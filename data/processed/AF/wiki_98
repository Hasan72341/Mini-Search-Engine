On 29 May 1953, Hillary and Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal.\nHillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II and was wounded in an accident. Prior to the Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952.\nAs part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest. \"Time\" named him one of the .\nBeginning in 1960, Hillary devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he established. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in Nepal. Hillary had numerous honours conferred upon him, including the Order of the Garter in 1995. Upon his death in 2008, he was given a state funeral in New Zealand.\nEarly life.\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus \"Percy\" (1885\u20131965) and Gertrude (n\u00e9e Clark) (1892\u20131965) Hillary in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919. His father Percy had served at Gallipoli with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, and was discharged \"medically unfit\" from the Army in 1916; he had married Gertrude after his return to New Zealand. His grandfather Edmund Raymond Hillary (b. 1836) from Lancashire, England was a watchmaker, who immigrated to the northern Wairoa region in the mid-19th century. He married Annie \"Ida\" Fleming from Ireland having four children. His maternal great-grandparents, the Clarks, were both from Yorkshire.\nHis family moved to Tuakau, south of Auckland, in 1920, after Percy was allocated of land there as a returned soldier. Percy had been a journalist prewar, and soon became founding editor of the weekly \"Tuakau District News\" as well as an apiarist. Ed had a sister June (born 1917) and a brother Rexford Fleming \"Rex\" (born 1920).\nHillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School. He finished primary school aged 11 or two years early, and at \"Grammar\" achieved average marks. His mother wanted him to go to a \"good school\" and he commuted by train, cycling to Tuakau station before 7\u00a0am and returning after 6\u00a0pm for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 years (a one-hour and 40 minutes journey each way) until the family moved to Remuera, Auckland in 1935, his last of four years at \"Grammar\".\nHe was initially smaller than his peers and shy, and did not enjoy \"Grammar\", where commuting barred him from after-school activities. He grew to be and gained confidence after taking up boxing.\nHe became interested in climbing when he was 16 following a 1935 school trip to Mount Ruapehu, after which he showed more interest in tramping than in studying and said he \"wanted to see the world\". He then attended Auckland University College, and joined the Tramping Club there. But in 1938, \"after two notably unsuccessful years studying mathematics and science\" he gave up on formal education.\nHe then became an apiarist with his father and brother Rex; with 1600 hives to attend, thousands of boxes of honey comb to handle, and 12 to 100 bee-stings daily. He kept bees in summer, and concentrated on climbing in winter. His father also edited the journal \"The N.Z. Honeybee\" and his mother Gertrude was famous for breeding and selling queen bees.\nIn 1938, he went to hear Herbert Sutcliffe, the proponent of a life philosophy called \"Radiant Living\", with his family. The family all became foundation members, and his mother became its secretary in 1939. He went to Gisborne as Sutcliff's assistant, and in 1941 sat examinations to become a teacher of Radiant Living, getting a 100% pass mark. His test lecture was on \"Inferiority \u2013 cause and cure\". He said of his five-year association with the movement that \"I learned to speak confidently from the platform; to think more freely on important topics; to mix more readily with a wide variety of people\". Tenets included healthy eating (the salads that June took to university for lunch) and pacificism. He joined the Radiant Living Tramping Club, and further developed his love of the outdoors in the Wait\u0101kere Ranges.\nIn 1939, he completed his first major climb, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier, near Aoraki / Mount Cook in the Southern Alps. Climbing brought new friends; Harry Ayres and George Lowe became \"the first real friends I'd ever had\".\nWorld War II.\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Hillary applied to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) but quickly withdrew the application, later writing that he was \"harassed by [his] religious conscience\". In 1943, with the Japanese threat in the Pacific and the arrival of conscription, he joined the RNZAF as a navigator in No. 6 Squadron RNZAF and later No. 5 Squadron RNZAF on Catalina flying boats. In 1945, he was sent to Fiji and to the Solomon Islands, where he was badly burnt in an accident.\nExpeditions.\nIn January 1948, Hillary and others ascended the south ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest peak. He took part in an arduous rescue on La Perouse in 1948, befriending fellow climber Norman Hardie.\nIn 1951 he was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest led by Eric Shipton, before joining the successful British attempt of 1953. In 1952, Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Shipton, that attempted Cho Oyu. After that attempt failed due to the lack of a route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Nup La pass into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the previous expeditions had camped.\n1953 Everest expedition.\nIn 1949, the long-standing climbing route to the summit of Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Tibet. For the next several years, Nepal allowed only one or two expeditions per year. A Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) attempted to reach the summit in 1952, but was forced back by bad weather and problems with oxygen sets below the summit.\nIn 1952, Hillary learned that he and Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the 1953 British attempt and immediately accepted. Shipton had been named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary objected but was immediately impressed by Hunt's energy and determination. Hunt asked Charles Evans and Hillary to form with him a small three-man planning group on the expedition. Hunt wrote that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hillary's testing in the Himalayas had shown that he would be a very strong contender, not only for Everest, but for an eventual summit party. When I met Shipton last autumn I well remember his prophesying this\u00a0\u2013 and how right he was. Quite exceptionally strong and abounding in a restless energy, possessed of a thrusting mind which swept away all unproven obstacles, Ed Hillary's personality had made an imprint on my mind, through his Cho Oyu and Reconnaissance friends and through his letters to me.\nHillary had hoped to climb with Lowe, but Hunt named two teams for the ascent: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing. Hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing. Hillary wrote, \"Tenzing had substantially greater personal ambition than any Sherpa I had met.\"\nThe Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and of baggage. Lowe supervised the preparation of the Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.\nCameraman Tom Stobart was Hillary's room-mate in Kathmandu. He described Hillary as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a skeleton as tall as I was\u00a0... a hatchet-thin face, and seemed tied together with steel\u00a0... I had just got a rubber torch to pieces and couldn't get it together again. This human machine took charge. 'Let's give it a go' he said, using an expression we came to know so well in the following months. It may have meant that he would try to fix it, but did not. Actually it meant he would fix it, a subtle but important difference so far as Ed and his fellow countryman George Lowe, were concerned.\nThe expedition set up base camp in March 1953 and, working slowly, set up its final camp at the South Col at . On 26 May, Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans's oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit. Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to attempt the summit.\nSnow and wind delayed them at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with the support of Lowe, Alfred Gregory, and Ang Nyima. The two pitched a tent at on 28 May, while their support group returned down the mountain. On the following morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them over a stove before he and Tenzing, wearing packs, attempted the final ascent. The final obstacle was the rock face later called \"Hillary Step\"; Hillary later wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTenzing wrote in his 1955 autobiography that Hillary took the first step onto the summit and he followed. They reached Everest's summit\u00a0\u2013 the highest point on earth\u00a0\u2013 at 11:30\u00a0am.\nThey spent about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took a photo of Tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but there is no photo of Hillary; Tenzing's autobiography says that Hillary simply declined to have his picture taken. They also took photos looking down the mountain.\nTenzing left chocolates at the summit as an offering, and Hillary left a cross given to him by John Hunt. Their descent was complicated by drifting snow that had covered their tracks. The first person they met was Lowe; Hillary said, \"Well, George, we knocked the bastard off.\"\nThey returned to Kathmandu a few days later and learned that Hillary had already been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Hunt a Knight Bachelor. News reached Britain on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, and the press called it a coronation gift. \nThe 37 members of the party later received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with mount everest expedition engraved along the rim.\nIn addition to the knighting of Hillary and Hunt, Tenzing\u00a0\u2013 ineligible for knighthood as a Nepalese citizen\u00a0\u2013 received the George Medal. Tenzing also received the Star of Nepal from King Tribhuvan.\nAfter Everest.\nHillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960\u20131961, and 1963\u20131965. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.\nIn 1960, Hillary organised the 1960\u201361 Silver Hut expedition, with Griffith Pugh; and Pugh showed that Mount Everest could be climbed without oxygen, with a long period of acclimatisation by living at for six months. \nAn assault on Makalu, the world's fifth-highest mountain, was unsuccessful. Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten.\nThe expedition also searched for the fabled abominable snowman. No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \"Yeti scalps\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope. Hillary said after the expedition: \"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\".\nIn 1962, he was a guest on the television game show \"What's My Line?\"; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin.\nIn 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \"Ocean to Sky\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source. From 1977 to 1979 he commentated aboard Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand, and was scheduled to act as the guide for the fatal Flight 901, but had to cancel owing to other commitments.\nIn 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest. This accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as Three Poles Challenge.\nIn January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica as part of a delegation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base.\nPublic recognition.\nOn 6 June 1953, Hillary was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and he received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal the same year. On 6 February 1987, he was the fourth appointee to the Order of New Zealand. He was also awarded the Polar Medal in 1958 for his part in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, the class of commander of the Order of Sports Merit of France in about 1960, the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, 1st Class of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1953 and the Coronation Medal in 1975. On 22 April 1995, Hillary was appointed Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. On 17 June 2004, Hillary was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. The Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest, the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was the first foreign national to receive that honour.\nSince 1992, New Zealand's $5 note has featured Hillary's portrait, making him the only living person not a current head of state ever to appear on a New Zealand banknote. In giving his permission, Hillary insisted that Aoraki / Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest be used as the backdrop.\nAnnual \"Reader's Digest\" polls from 2005 to 2007 named Hillary as \"New Zealand's most trusted individual\".\nHillary's favoured New Zealand charity was the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre, of which he was patron for 35 years. He was particularly keen on how this organisation introduced young New Zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to Mt Ruapehu at the age of 16. A bronze statue of Hillary was erected outside The Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village; it was unveiled by Hillary himself in 2003. Various streets, institutions and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after him \u2013 for example, the Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate in \u014ctara, which was established by Hillary in 2001.\nTwo Antarctic features are named after Hillary. The Hillary Coast is a section of coastline south of Ross Island and north of the Shackleton Coast. The Hillary Canyon, an undersea feature in the Ross Sea, appears on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, published by the International Hydrographic Organization.\nPersonal life.\nHillary married Louise Mary Rose (1930\u20131975) on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest; he admitted he was terrified of proposing to her and relied on her mother to propose on his behalf. They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1956) and Belinda (1959\u20131975). On 31 March 1975, while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off.\nIn 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died on Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979. June, Lady Hillary, died in Auckland on 1 June 2024.\nHis son Peter Hillary also became a climber, summiting Everest in 1990. In May 2002 Peter climbed Everest as part of a 50th anniversary celebration; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of Tenzing who had died in 1986) was also part of the expedition.\nHillary's home for most of his life was a property on Remuera Road in Auckland City, where he enjoyed reading adventure and science fiction novels in his retirement.\nHe also built a bach at Whites Beach, one of Auckland's west coast beaches in West Auckland, between Anawhata and North Piha. A friend called it Hillary's place of solace, where he could escape media attention.\nThe Hillary family has had a connection with the west coast of Auckland since 1925, when Louise's father built a bach at Anawhata. The family donated land at Whites Beach that is now crossed by trampers on the Hillary Trail, named for Edmund.\nHillary said of the area: \"That is the thing that international travel brings home to me \u2013 it's always good to be going home. This is the only place I want to live in; this is the place I want to see out my days.\"\nPhilanthropy.\nFollowing his ascent of Everest he devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he established in 1960 and led until his death in 2008. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in this remote region of the Himalayas. He was the Honorary President of the American Himalayan Foundation, a United States non-profit body that helps improve the ecology and living conditions in the Himalayas. He was also the Honorary President of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the worldwide protection of mountains.\nPolitical involvement.\nHillary supported the Labour Party in the 1975 New Zealand general election, as a member of the \"Citizens for Rowling\" campaign. His involvement in this campaign was seen as precluding his nomination as governor-general; the position was offered to Keith Holyoake in 1977. In 1985, Hillary was appointed New Zealand High Commissioner to India (concurrently High Commissioner to Bangladesh and Ambassador to Nepal) and spent four and a half years based in New Delhi.\nIn 1975, Hillary served as a vice president for the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand, a national pro-choice advocacy group. He was also a patron of REPEAL, an organisation seeking repeal of the restrictive Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977.\nDeath.\nOn 22 April 2007, while on a trip to Kathmandu, Hillary suffered a fall, and was hospitalised after returning to New Zealand.\nOn 11 January 2008, he died of heart failure at Auckland City Hospital, at the age of 88. Flags were lowered to half-mast on New Zealand public buildings and at Scott Base in Antarctica, and the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, called Hillary's death a \"profound loss to New Zealand\".\nOn 21 January, Hillary's casket was taken into Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, to lie in state.\nThe following day, 22 January 2008, Hillary's casket was moved to the adjacent St Mary's church for a state funeral, after which his body was cremated. On 29 February 2008, most of his ashes were scattered in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf per his desire. The remainder went to a Nepalese monastery near Everest; a plan to scatter them on the summit was cancelled in 2010.\nPosthumous tributes.\nIn January 2008, Lukla Airport, in Lukla, Nepal, was renamed to Tenzing\u2013Hillary Airport in recognition of their promotion of its construction.\nOn 2 April 2008, a service of thanksgiving in Hillary's honour at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle was attended by Queen Elizabeth II, New Zealand dignitaries including Prime Minister Helen Clark, and members of Hillary's and Norgay's families; Gurkha soldiers from Nepal stood guard outside the ceremony.\nIn October 2008, it was announced that future rugby test matches between England and New Zealand would be played for the Hillary Shield. In 2009 the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in New Zealand\u00a0\u2013 formerly the Young New Zealanders' Challenge\u00a0\u2013 was renamed \"The Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award\".\nOn 5 November 2008, a commemorative set of five stamps was issued by New Zealand Post.\nThere have been many calls for lasting tributes to Hillary. The first major public tribute has been by way of the \"Summits for Ed\" tribute tour organised by the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation. This tribute tour went from Bluff at the bottom of the South Island to Cape Reinga at the tip of the North Island, visiting 39 towns and cities along the way. In each venue, school children and members of the public were invited to join to climb a significant hill or site in their area to show their respect for Hillary. The public were also invited to bring small rocks or pebbles that had special significance to them, that would be included in a memorial to Hillary at the base of Mt Ruapehu, in the grounds of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre. Funds donated during the tour are used by the foundation to sponsor young New Zealanders on outdoor courses. Over 8,000 persons attended these \"Summit\" climbs between March and May 2008.\nThe tribute song \"Hillary 88\", by the New Zealand duo The Kiwis, is the official world memorial song for Hillary, with the endorsement of Lady Hillary.\nA four-day track in the Wait\u0101kere Ranges, along Auckland's west coast, is named the Hillary Trail, in honour of Hillary. Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, who had built a bach at Anawhata in 1925, wrote in his 1982 history of Anawhata Beach, \"My family look forward to the time when we will be able to walk from Huia to Muriwai on public walking tracks like the old-time Maori could do\". Hillary loved the area, and had his own bach near Anawhata. The track was opened on 11 January 2010, the second anniversary of Hillary's death. Rose Track, descending from Anawhata Road to Whites Beach, is named after the Rose family.\nThe South Ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, was renamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011. Hillary and three other climbers were the first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948. In September 2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a mountain in Nepal Hillary Peak in his honour. After the \"New Horizons\" mission discovered a mountain range on Pluto on 14 July 2015, it was officially named Hillary Montes (Hillary Mountains) by International Astronomical Union.\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy Medal, awarded by the Nepalese NGO Mountain Legacy \"for remarkable service in the conservation of culture and nature in mountainous regions\" was inaugurated in 2003, with the approval of Sir Edmund Hillary. \nA bronze bust of Hillary (circa 1953) by Ophelia Gordon Bell is in the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand.\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Archive was added to the UNESCO Memory of the world archive in 2013, it is currently held by Auckland War Memorial Museum.\nFrom 2016 to 2020, a pilot immigration programme to New Zealand awarded \"Edmund Hillary Fellowships\", the benefits of which included a three-year \"Global Impact Visa\" to create, support, and incubate ventures and models that result in positive global impact, from New Zealand. After three years, migrants could qualify for permanent residency. The Edmund Hillary Foundation, which operated the pilot, claims that more than 250 of the allocated 400 visas were awarded before the pilot closed.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73575", "revid": "46085058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73575", "title": "Slayer", "text": "American thrash metal band\nSlayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California, formed in 1981 by guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, drummer Dave Lombardo and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt, who initially joined as a touring musician in 2011 before joining the band permanently after Hanneman's death in 2013. Drummer Jon Dette is a former member of the band.\nIn the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, occultism, terrorism, religion, fascism, racism, and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups. However, its music has been highly influential, being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, \"Reign in Blood\" (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.\nSlayer released twelve studio albums, three live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. Slayer sold 5 million copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"Eyes of the Insane\" and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\", both of which were from the album \"Christ Illusion\" (2006). Slayer disbanded in 2019 following the conclusion of a year-and-a-half long farewell tour, but has reformed to perform sporadic reunion shows since 2024.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1981\u20131983).\nSlayer was formed in 1981 by Jeff Hanneman, Dave Lombardo, Tom Araya and Kerry King in Huntington Park, California. The group started out playing covers of songs by bands such as Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom at parties and clubs in Southern California. The band's early image relied heavily on Satanic themes that featured pentagrams, make-up, spikes, and inverted crosses. Rumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 film of the same name, were denied by King, as he later stated: \"We never were; it's a myth to this day.\" According to Lombardo, the original band name was to be Wings of Fire before they settled in with Slayer. According to him, he also designed the band logo. For inspiration, Lombardo thought in a perspective of a murderer of how they would carve out the logo with a knife and since he is lefthanded, the logo is unintentionally slanted to the right.\nIn 1983, Slayer was invited to open for the band Bitch at the Woodstock Club in Anaheim, California to perform eight songs, six of which were covers. The band was spotted by Brian Slagel, a former music journalist who had recently founded Metal Blade Records. Impressed with Slayer, he met with the band backstage and asked them to record an original song for his upcoming \"Metal Massacre III\" compilation album. The band agreed and their song \"Aggressive Perfector\" created an underground buzz upon its release in mid-1983, which led to Slagel offering the band a recording contract with Metal Blade.\nAraya noted in a 1991 Metal Forces interview that the band had written original songs in its early days that \"were more in the Scorpions and Iron Maiden vein\", but they left those songs behind after rehearsing Aggressive Perfector extensively in preparation for the Metal Massacre album.\n\"Show No Mercy\", \"Haunting the Chapel\" and \"Hell Awaits\" (1983\u20131986).\nWithout any recording budget, the band had to self-finance its debut album. Combining the savings of Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from King's father, the band entered the studio in November 1983. The album was rushed into release, stocking shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. \"Show No Mercy\", released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band. The group began a club tour of California to promote the album. The tour gave the band additional popularity and sales of \"Show No Mercy\" eventually reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.\nIn February 1984, King briefly joined Dave Mustaine's new band Megadeth. Hanneman was worried about King's decision, stating in an interview, \"I guess we're gonna get a new guitar player.\" While Mustaine wanted King to stay on a permanent basis, King left after five shows, stating Mustaine's band was \"taking too much of my time.\" The split caused a rift between King and Mustaine, which evolved into a long running feud between the two bands.\nIn June 1984, Slayer released a three-track EP called \"Haunting the Chapel\". The EP featured a darker, more thrash-oriented style than \"Show No Mercy\", and laid the groundwork for the future direction of the band. The opening track, \"Chemical Warfare\", has become a live staple, played at nearly every show since 1984.\nLater that year, Slayer began their first national club tour, traveling in Araya's Camaro towing a U-Haul trailer. The band recorded the live album \"Live Undead\" in November 1984 while in New York City.\nIn March 1985, Slayer began a national tour with Venom and Exodus, resulting in their first live home video dubbed \"Combat Tour: The Ultimate Revenge\". The video featured live footage filmed at the Studio 54 club. The band then made its live European debut at the \"Heavy Sound Festival\" in Belgium opening for UFO.\n\"Show No Mercy\" had sold over 40,000 copies, which led to the band returning to the studio to record their second full-length album. Metal Blade financed a recording budget, which allowed the band to hire producer Ron Fair. Released in April 1985, Slayer's second full-length album, \"Hell Awaits\", expanded on the darkness of \"Haunting the Chapel\", with hell and Satan as common song subjects. The album was the band's most progressive offering, featuring longer and more complex song structures. The intro of the title track is a backwards recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating \"Join us\", ending with \"Welcome back\" before the track begins. The album was a hit, with fans choosing Slayer for best band and live band, \"Hell Awaits\" as 1985's best album, and Dave Lombardo as best drummer in \"Metal Forces\"' 1985 Readers Poll.\n\"Reign in Blood\", Lombardo's brief hiatus and \"South of Heaven\" (1986\u20131989).\nFollowing the success of \"Hell Awaits\", Slayer was offered a recording contract with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, then a largely hip hop-based label. The band accepted, and with an experienced producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album \"Reign in Blood\", resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. The complex arrangements and long songs featured on \"Hell Awaits\" were ditched in favor of stripped down, hardcore punk influenced song structures.\nDef Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to the song \"Angel of Death\" which detailed Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi physician Josef Mengele. The album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, \"Reign in Blood\" did not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule. Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the \"Billboard\" 200, peaking at number 94, and the band's first album certified gold in the United States.\nSlayer began touring in support of \"Reign in Blood\" in late 1986 with Overkill. The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but just one month into it, drummer Lombardo left the band: \"I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid.\" To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987. At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" for the film \"Less than Zero\". Although the band was not happy with the final product, Hanneman deeming it \"a poor representation of Slayer\" and King labeling it \"a hunk of shit\", it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.\nIn late 1987, Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of \"Reign in Blood\", the band consciously decided to slow down the tempos and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, \"We knew we couldn't top \"Reign in Blood\", so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird\u2014we've never done that on an album, before or since.\"\nReleased in July 1988, \"South of Heaven\" received mixed responses from both fans and critics, although it was Slayer's most commercially successful release at the time, debuting at number 57 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and their second album to receive gold certification in the United States. Press response to the album was mixed, with AllMusic citing the album as \"disturbing and powerful\", and Kim Neely of \"Rolling Stone\" calling it \"genuinely offensive satanic drivel\". King said \"that album was my most lackluster performance\", although Araya called it a \"late bloomer\" which eventually grew on people. Touring for \"South of Heaven\" took place between August 1988 and January 1989, which included opening for Judas Priest on their \"Ram It Down\" tour and headlining a North American tour with Mot\u00f6rhead and Overkill.\n\"Seasons in the Abyss\" and Lombardo's second departure (1990\u20131993).\nSlayer returned to the studio in early 1990 with co-producer Andy Wallace to record its fifth studio album. Following the backlash created by \"South of Heaven\", Slayer returned to the \"pounding speed of \"Reign in Blood\", while retaining their newfound melodic sense.\" \"Seasons in the Abyss\", released on October 9, 1990, was the first Slayer album to be released under Rubin's new Def American label, as he had parted ways with Def Jam owner Russell Simmons over creative differences. The album debuted at number No. 57 and peaked at No. 40 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and was certified gold in 1992. The album spawned Slayer's first music video for the album's title track, which was filmed in front of the Giza pyramids in Egypt. In support of \"Seasons in the Abyss\", the band participated in the Clash of the Titans tour that was co-headlined by Megadeth; a European leg featured Testament and Suicidal Tendencies, while the North American trek had Anthrax and a then-unknown Alice in Chains as the direct support act. The band released a double live album, \"Decade of Aggression\" in 1991, to celebrate ten years since their formation. It debuted at number 55 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nIn May 1992, Lombardo left the band due to conflicts with the other members, as well as his desire to be off tour for the birth of his first child. Lombardo formed his own band Grip Inc., with Voodoocult guitarist Waldemar Sorychta, and Slayer recruited former Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph to fill in the drummer position. Slayer made its debut appearance with Bostaph at the 1992 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington. Bostaph's first studio effort was a medley of three Exploited songs, \"War\", \"UK '82\", and \"Disorder\", with rapper Ice-T, for the \"Judgment Night\" movie soundtrack in 1993.\n\"Divine Intervention\", \"Undisputed Attitude\" and \"Diabolus in Musica\" (1994\u20132000).\nOn September 27, 1994, Slayer released \"Divine Intervention\", the band's first album with Bostaph on the drums. The album featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which governments went to wield power. Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much of the content of the lyrics.\nSlayer geared up for a world tour in 1995, with openers Biohazard and Machine Head. A video of concert footage, \"Live Intrusion,\" was released, featuring a joint cover of Venom's \"Witching Hour\" with Machine Head. Following the tour, Slayer was billed third at the 1995 Monsters of Rock festival, headlined by Metallica. In 1996, \"Undisputed Attitude\", an album of punk covers, was released. The band covered songs by Minor Threat, T.S.O.L., Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, D.I., Verbal Abuse, Dr. Know, and The Stooges. The album featured three original tracks, \"Gemini\", \"Can't Stand You\", \"DDAMM\"; the latter two were written by Hanneman in 1984\u20131985 for a side project entitled Pap Smear. Bostaph left Slayer shortly after the album's recording to work on his own project, Truth About Seafood. With Bostaph's departure, Slayer recruited Testament drummer Jon Dette and headlined the 1996 Ozzfest alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Danzig, Biohazard, Sepultura, and Fear Factory. Dette was fired after a year due to a fallout with band members. After that, Bostaph returned to continue the tour.\n\"Diabolus in Musica\" (Latin for \"The Devil in Music\") was released in 1998, and debuted at number 31 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling over 46,000 copies in its first week. It was complete by September 1997, and scheduled to be released the following month, but got delayed by nine months after their label was taken over by Columbia Records. The album received a mixed critical reception, and was criticized for adopting characteristics of nu metal music such as tuned down guitars, murky chord structures, and churning beats. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin described the album as \"a feeble attempt at incorporating updated elements into the group's sound, the presence of which elevated the band's efforts somewhat and offered hope that Slayer could refrain from endlessly rehashing their previous material for their future output\", while Ben Ratliff of \"The New York Times\" had similar sentiments, writing on June 22, 1998, that: \"Eight of the 11 songs on \"Diabolus in Musica\", a few of which were played at the show, are in the same gray key, and the band's rhythmic ideas have a wearying sameness too.\"\nThe album was the band's first to primarily feature dropped tuning, making use of the tritone interval referred to in the Middle Ages as the Devil's interval. Slayer teamed up with digital hardcore group Atari Teenage Riot to record a song for the \"Spawn\" soundtrack titled \"No Remorse (I Wanna Die)\". The band paid tribute to Black Sabbath by recording a cover of \"Hand of Doom\" for the second of two tribute albums, titled \"Nativity in Black II\". A world tour followed to support the new album, with Slayer making an appearance at the United Kingdom .\n\"God Hates Us All\" (2001\u20132005).\nDuring mid-2001, the band joined Morbid Angel, Pantera, Skrape and Static-X on the Extreme Steel Tour of North America, which was Pantera's last major tour. After delays regarding remixing and artwork, including slip covers created to cover the original artwork as it was deemed \"too graphic\", Slayer's next album, \"God Hates Us All\", was released on September 11, 2001. The band received its first Grammy nomination for the lead track \"Disciple\", although the Grammy was awarded to Tool for \"Schism\". The September 11 attacks on America jeopardized the 2001 European tour \"Tattoo the Planet,\" originally set to feature Pantera, Static-X, Cradle of Filth, Biohazard and Vision of Disorder. The dates in the United Kingdom were postponed due to flight restrictions, with a majority of bands deciding to withdraw, leaving Slayer and Cradle of Filth remaining for the European leg of the tour.\nPantera, Static-X, Vision of Disorder and Biohazard were replaced by other bands depending on location; Amorphis, In Flames, Moonspell, Children of Bodom, and Necrodeath. Biohazard eventually decided to rejoin the tour later on, and booked new gigs in the countries where they missed dates. Drummer Bostaph left Slayer before Christmas in 2001, due to a chronic elbow injury which would hinder his ability to play. Since the band's European tour was unfinished at that time, the band's manager, Rick Sales, contacted original drummer Dave Lombardo and asked if he would like to finish the remainder of the tour. Lombardo accepted the offer, and stayed as a permanent member.\nSlayer toured playing \"Reign in Blood\" in its entirety throughout the fall of 2003, under the tour banner \"Still Reigning\". Their playing of the final song, \"Raining Blood\", culminated with the band drenched in a rain of stage blood. Live footage of this was recorded at the Augusta Civic Center in Augusta, Maine, on July 11, 2004, and released on the 2004 DVD \"Still Reigning\". The band also released \"War at the Warfield\" and a box set, \"Soundtrack to the Apocalypse\" featuring rarities, live CD and DVD performances and various Slayer merchandise. From 2002 to 2004, the band performed over 250 tour dates, headlining major music festivals including H82k2, Summer tour, and a European tour with Slipknot. While preparing for the Download Festival in England, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was taken to a hospital with an unknown and mysterious illness, and was unable to perform. Metallica vocalist James Hetfield searched for volunteers at the last minute to replace Ulrich; Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered, with Lombardo performing the songs \"Battery\" and \"The Four Horsemen\".\n\"Christ Illusion\" (2006\u20132008).\nThe next studio album, \"Christ Illusion\", was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, and would be the first album with original drummer Lombardo since 1990's \"Seasons in the Abyss\". However, the band decided to delay the release of the record, as they did not want to be among the many, according to King, \"half-ass, stupid fucking loser bands\" releasing records on June 6, although \"USA Today\" reported the idea was thwarted because the band failed to secure sufficient studio recording time. Slayer released \"Eternal Pyre\" on June 6 as a limited-edition EP. \"Eternal Pyre\" featured the song \"Cult\", a live performance of \"War Ensemble\" in Germany and video footage of the band recording \"Cult\". Five thousand copies were released and sold exclusively through Hot Topic chain stores, selling out within hours of release. On June 30, Nuclear Blast Records released a 7\" vinyl picture disc version limited to a thousand copies.\n\"Christ Illusion\" was eventually released on August 8, 2006, and debuted at number 5 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling over 62,000 copies in its first week. The album became Slayer's highest charting, improving on its previous highest-charting album, \"Divine Intervention\", which had debuted at number 8. However, despite its high positioning, the album dropped to number 44 in the following week. Three weeks after the album's release, Slayer were inducted into the \"Kerrang!\" Hall of Fame for their influence to the heavy metal scene.\nA worldwide tour dubbed The Unholy Alliance Tour was undertaken to support the new record. The tour was originally set to launch on June 6 in San Diego, but was postponed to June 10 as Araya had to undergo gall bladder surgery. In Flames, Mastodon, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, and Thine Eyes Bleed (featuring Araya's brother, Johnny) and Ted Maul (London Hammersmith Apollo) were supporting Slayer. The tour made its way through America and Europe and the bands who participated, apart from Thine Eyes Bleed, reunited to perform at Japan's Loudpark Festival on October 15, 2006.\nThe video for the album's first single, \"Eyes of the Insane\", was released on October 30, 2006. The track was featured on the \"Saw III\" soundtrack, and won a Grammy Award for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 49th Grammy Awards, although the band was unable to attend due to touring obligations. A week later, the band visited the 52nd Services Squadron located on the Spangdahlem U.S. Air Force Base in Germany to meet and play a show. This was the first visit ever to a military base for the band. The band made its first network TV appearance on the show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on January 19, playing the song \"Eyes of the Insane\", and four additional songs for fans after the show (although footage from \"Jihad\" was cut due to its controversial lyrical themes).\nIn 2007, Slayer toured Australia and New Zealand in April with Mastodon, and appeared at the Download Festival, Rock Am Ring, and a summer tour with Marilyn Manson and Bleeding Through.\n\"World Painted Blood\" (2009\u20132011).\nIn 2008, Araya expressed uncertainty about the future of the band, and that he could not see himself continuing the career at a later age. He said that once the band finished its upcoming album, which was the final record in their contract, the band would sit down and discuss its future. King was optimistic that the band would produce at least another two albums before considering to disband: \"We're talking of going in the studio next February [2009] and getting the next record out so if we do things in a timely manner I don't see there's any reason why we can't have more than one album out.\" Slayer, along with Trivium, Mastodon, and Amon Amarth, teamed up for a European tour titled 'The Unholy Alliance: Chapter III', throughout October and November 2008. Slayer headlined the second Mayhem Festival in the summer of 2009. Slayer, along with Megadeth, also co-headlined Canadian Carnage, the first time they performed together in more than 15 years when they co-headlined four shows in Canada in late June 2009 with openers Machine Head and Suicide Silence.\nThe band's eleventh studio album, \"World Painted Blood\", was released by American Recordings. It was available on November 3 in North America and November 2 for the rest of the world. The band stated that the album takes elements of all their previous works including \"Seasons in the Abyss\", \"South of Heaven\", and \"Reign in Blood\". Slayer, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010, at Bemowo Airport, in Warsaw, Poland. One of the following Big 4 performances in (Sofia, Bulgaria, June 22, 2010) was sent via satellite in HD to cinemas. They also went on to play several other dates as part of the Sonisphere Festival. Megadeth and Slayer joined forces once again for the American Carnage Tour from July to October 2010 with opening acts Anthrax and Testament, as well as the European Carnage Tour in March and April 2011. The \"Big Four\" played more dates at Sonisphere in England and France for the first time ever. Slayer returned to Australia in February and March 2011 as part of the Soundwave Festival, and also played in California with the other members of the \"Big Four\".\nIn early 2011, Hanneman was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. According to the band, doctors said that it likely originated from a spider bite. Araya said of Hanneman's condition: \"Jeff was seriously ill. Jeff ended up contracting a bacteria that ate away his flesh on his arm, so they cut open his arm, from his wrist to his shoulder, and they did a skin graft on him, they cleaned up ... It was a flesh-eating virus, so he was really, really bad. So we'll wait for him to get better, and when he's a hundred percent, he's gonna come out and join us.\" The band decided to play their upcoming tour dates without Hanneman. Gary Holt of Exodus was announced as Hanneman's temporary replacement. Cannibal Corpse guitarist Pat O'Brien filled in for Holt during a tour in Europe. On April 23, 2011, at the American Big 4 show in Indio, California, Hanneman rejoined his bandmates to play the final two songs of their set, \"South of Heaven\" and \"Angel of Death\". This turned out to be Hanneman's final live performance with the band.\nHanneman's death, Lombardo's third split, and \"Repentless\" (2011\u20132016).\nWhen asked if Slayer would make another album, Lombardo replied \"Yes absolutely; Although there's nothing written, there are definitely plans.\" However, Araya said Slayer would not begin writing a new album until Hanneman's condition improved. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of \"Reign In Blood\", the band performed all of the album's tracks at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival at the Alexandra Palace in London.\nIn November 2011, Lombardo posted a tweet that the band had started to write new music. This presumably meant that Hanneman's condition improved, and it was believed he was ready to enter the studio. King had worked with Lombardo that year and they completed three songs. The band planned on entering the studio in either March or April 2012 and were hoping to have the album recorded before the group's US tour in late May and release it by the summer of that year. However, King said the upcoming album would not be finished until September and October of that year, making a 2013 release likely. In July 2012, King revealed two song titles for the upcoming album, \"Chasing Death\" and \"Implode\".\nIn February 2013, Lombardo was fired right before Slayer was to play at Australia's Soundwave festival due to an argument with band members over a pay dispute. Slayer and American Recordings released a statement, saying \"Mr. Lombardo came to the band less than a week before their scheduled departure for Australia to present an entirely new set of terms for his engagement that were contrary to those that had been previously agreed upon\", although Lombardo claimed there was a gag order in place. Dette returned to fill in for Lombardo for the Soundwave dates. It was confirmed that Lombardo was officially out of Slayer for the third time, and in May, Bostaph rejoined the band.\nKing said in February 2024 that he had severed ties with Lombardo ever since, adding that \"he's dead to me.\"\nOn May 2, 2013, Hanneman died due to liver failure in a local hospital near his home in Southern California's Inland Empire; the cause of death was later determined to be alcohol-related cirrhosis. King confirmed that the band would continue, saying \"Jeff is going to be in everybody's thoughts for a long time. It's unfortunate you can't keep unfortunate things from happening. But we're going to carry on \u2013 and he'll be there in spirit.\" However, Araya felt more uncertain about the band's future, expressing his belief that \"After 30 years [with Hanneman active in the band], it would literally be like starting over\", and doubting that Slayer's fanbase would approve such a change. Despite the uncertainty regarding the band's future, Slayer still worked on a followup to \"World Painted Blood\". Additionally, it was reported that the new album would still feature material written by Hanneman.\nAt the 2014 \"Revolver\"'s Golden Gods Awards ceremony, Slayer debuted \"Implode\", its first new song in five years. The group announced that they had signed with Nuclear Blast and planned to release a new album in 2015. It was reported that Holt would take over Hanneman's guitar duties full-time, although Holt did not participate in the songwriting. In February, Slayer announced a seventeen-date American tour to start in June featuring Suicidal Tendencies and Exodus. In 2015, Slayer headlined the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival for the second time. \"Repentless\", the band's twelfth studio album, was released on September 11, 2015. Slayer toured for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 years in support of \"Repentless\". The band toured Europe with Anthrax and Kvelertak in October and November 2015, and embarked on three North American tours: one with Testament and Carcass in February and March 2016, then with Anthrax and Death Angel in September and October 2016, and with Lamb of God and Behemoth in July and August 2017. A lone date in Southeast Asia in 2017 was held in the Philippines.\nCancelled thirteenth studio album, Final World Tour and split (2016\u20132019).\nIn August 2016, King was asked if Slayer would release a follow-up to \"Repentless\". He replied, \"We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are way ahead of the ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, \"Repentless\" isn't quite a year old yet.\" King also stated that Slayer was not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he was \"completely open\" to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on \"Repentless\") involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, \"I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open.\"\nIn a June 2017 interview with the Ultimate Guitar Archive, Holt said that he was ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to \"Revolver\", King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, \"Funny thing is, \"Repentless\" isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded\u2014some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it.\" He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, \"I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [Laughs]\" When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, \"It depends on touring\u2014getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change \"all\" the time.\" In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, \"When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'\"\nPlans for a new album were ultimately scrapped when on January 22, 2018, Slayer announced their farewell world tour through a video featuring a montage of press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning the band's entire career. Although the members of Slayer have never publicly explained why they were retiring, it was thought that one of the reasons behind this decision was Tom Araya's desire not to tour anymore and to spend more time with his family; Araya hinted at the possibility of retiring in a 2016 interview. This was confirmed by former drummer Dave Lombardo in a 2019 interview, who said: \"Apparently, from what I hear. Tom has been wanting to retire when I was in the band\u2014he wanted to stop. He had the neck issues. He's been wanting to retire for a long time now. So now that he's got it, I'm happy for him, and I hope he gets what he wants out of life and his future.\"\nThe farewell tour began with a North American trek in May and June 2018, supported by Lamb of God, Anthrax, Behemoth and Testament. The second leg of the North American tour took place in July and August, with Napalm Death replacing Behemoth, followed in November and December by a European tour with Lamb of God, Anthrax and Obituary. The farewell tour continued into 2019, with plans to visit places such as South America, Australia and Japan; in addition to European festivals such as Hellfest and Graspop. The band toured the United States in May 2019 with Lamb of God, Amon Amarth and Cannibal Corpse. Slayer also played one show in Mexico at Force Fest in October 2018.\nOn December 2, 2018, Holt announced that he would not perform the remainder of the band's European tour to be with his dying father. Vio-lence and former Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel would fill in for him as a result.\nHolt had stated that Slayer would not release a new album before the end of the farewell tour. On how long the tour would last, Holt's Exodus bandmate Steve \"Zetro\" Souza commented, \"I'm speculating it's gonna take a year and a half or two years to do the one final thing, but I believe it's finished. Everybody knows what I know; just because I'm on the outside, I have no insight on that.\" The final North American leg of the tour, dubbed \"The Last Campaign\", took place in November 2019, and also included support from Primus, Ministry and Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals. Despite being referred to as a farewell tour for Slayer, their manager Rick Sales has stated that \"the band is not breaking up, they made a decision to stop touring. That doesn't mean the end of the band. It\u2019s just the end of touring\". Kristen Mulderig, who works with Rick Sales Entertainment Group, has also been quoted as saying that there would be Slayer-related activities following the tour's conclusion. However, within two days after the tour's completion, King's wife Ayesha stated on her Instagram page that there is \"not a chance in hell\" that Slayer would ever reunite to perform more shows or release new music.\nPost-breakup (2020\u20132024).\nIn March 2020, when talking to \"Guitar World\" about his then-latest endorsement with Dean Guitars, King hinted that he would continue to make music outside of Slayer, simply saying, \"Dean didn't sign me for nothing!\" King stated in an August 2020 interview on the Dean Guitars YouTube channel that he had \"more than two records' worth of music\" for his yet-to-be disclosed new project. Bostaph later confirmed that he and King were working on a new project that would \"sound like Slayer without it being Slayer\u2014but not intentionally so.\" This project was later revealed to be King's solo debut album, \"From Hell I Rise\", released on May 17, 2024, and the lineup of the album includes King, Bostaph, Death Angel vocalist Mark Osegueda, Hellyeah bassist Kyle Sanders, and former Vio-lence and Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel.\nIn addition to King and Bostaph, most of the other members of Slayer have remained musically active. Holt continues to record and perform with Exodus, releasing a new album, \"Persona Non Grata\", in 2021. Lombardo has been involved with various acts since his third split with Slayer in 2013, such as Suicidal Tendencies, Dead Cross, the Misfits, Mr. Bungle and Testament, the latter of which he had previously served as the drummer for the band's 1999 album \"The Gathering\" and rejoined in March 2022, only to leave again in the following April. Jon Dette has been a member of at least two bands, Animetal USA and Meshiaak, and performed with Anthrax and Volbeat as a fill-in drummer. Araya, aside from an appearance in the Bay Area thrash metal documentary film \"Murder in the Front Row\", had not been publicly active in the music industry nor given any interviews between the conclusion of Slayer's final tour and the band's 2024 reunion.\nThe members of Slayer had expressed mixed opinions about a reunion. When asked by the \"Let There Be Talk\" podcast in June 2020 about the possibility of the band ever reforming, Holt stated, \"If it does, if it ever happens, it has nothing to do with me. Someone else would call and say, 'We wanna [do this].' To my knowledge, it's done. And I think it \"should\" be that way. The band went out fucking on a bang, went out on Slayer's terms, and how many people get to say they did that?\". Holt stated in March 2021 that he was open to a potential Slayer reunion, but it was unlikely to happen in the near future: \"Look, if the powers that be ever\u2014like, in a year or something\u2014said, 'Hey, you know what? We feel like playing some shows,' I'm there to do it. But those aren't decisions for me to make, or even me to really speculate on. As far as my knowledge, the band is over, and the final show was November 30, 2019. And I'm full speed ahead with Exodus now.\" In October 2021, King expressed regret that Slayer had retired \"too early.\" While congratulating Machine Head on their 30th anniversary as a band, he said, \"Apparently, it's 30 years, which is quite an achievement. Not a lot of bands get there. We did, and then we quit too early. Fuck us. Fuck me. I hate fucking not playing.\" When interviewed two months later by \"Metal Hammer\", King did not rule out the possibility of any more \"Big Four\" shows with Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax, but expressed doubt that a Slayer reunion would ever happen: \"The way that I'm moving forward is I don't think Slayer are ever going to play again. There's no business of me playing by myself!\" King's wife Ayesha had also ruled out the possibility of a Slayer reunion, insisting that her husband and Araya would \"never be Slayer again\". In a February 2024 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", King clarified that a reunion of the band was unlikely: \"Could Slayer play a show again? I'm sure there's a scenario. Am I looking for it? No, I'm just getting ready to start my career. So if that happens, it happens. But I'm going to be doing this [solo band] for the next 10 years at least.\" King revealed in the same interview that he has not spoken to Araya since the band's split. King also says that his relationship with Araya is positive, but his relationship with that of former drummer Dave Lombardo is estranged, stating that Lombardo \"was listening to this woman that was his attorney at the time, and she thought we had Metallica money, which we've never had fucking Metallica money. So she's just blowing shit in his ear, and he thinks he should be getting more than he should be getting.\"\nReunion (2024\u2013present).\nA few weeks after King said he did not foresee a Slayer reunion, the band announced on February 21, 2024 that they would play their first show since disbanding at Riot Fest on September 22, and play their second show five days later at Louder Than Life. However, due to weather conditions caused by Hurricane Helene, Louder Than Life canceled their September 27 shows, which included Slayer in the lineup. The lineup of this reunion was the 2013\u20132019 lineup of bassist/vocalist Tom Araya, guitarists Kerry King and Gary Holt and drummer Paul Bostaph. They also headlined the first of four nights of the Aftershock Festival in Sacramento on October 10, 2024, and while announcing this show, the band said in a statement, \"There's been a lot of excited fans out there about our playing a couple of festival dates, so it's great to be able to add this last one.\"\nIn an interview with \"Metal Hammer\", King indicated that the planned shows were a one-off and that the reunion was \"not going to translate into recording and it's not going to translate into touring\", clarifying that \"it's three shows marking five years since our final shows, a fun, 'Hey, remember us from before the pandemic?' celebration.\" In a May 2024 interview on \"Trunk Nation with Eddie Trunk\", King said that while he would not rule out more Slayer shows in the future, his solo career is his main priority now. When asked in an October 2024 interview with 107.7 The Bone if more reunion shows were in the works, Bostaph said, \"We played our last one\u2026 If everybody's asking that question, I am too, but I don't have the answer to that question. So, yeah, Aftershock was the last one.\" That same month, it was announced that the band would be playing at the 2025 edition of Louder Than Life.\nSlayer played its first shows in the UK in six years in July. In addition to two headlining shows there, the band appeared at Villa Park on July 5, 2025 as one of the supporting acts for Black Sabbath's final concert, dubbed \"Back to the Beginning\". Slayer also performed their first show in Canada in six years at the FEQ Music Festival in Quebec City on July 11, 2025. Two days after their appearance at the Louder Than Life festival, the band played a one-off headlining US show at the Hersheypark Stadium on September 20, with Knocked Loose, Suicidal Tendencies, Power Trip, Cavalera and Exodus as supporting acts.\nWhen asked in July 2025 about the possibility of more shows under the Slayer name, Holt said: \"I think it's a year-by-year thing, every year, and this is the second year we've done; it might be the last, you know? Fortunately, none of these shows have interfered with or conflicted with my Exodus schedule, so we'll see what happens. But it's been fun, playing with fire is always a blast. And last year, the shows we did, we were really good. We fucking rehearsed really hard, and we did not suck. And everybody had a great time. Everybody was happy. And so, you know, [we'll] see how it goes this year, and maybe next year, a couple other festivals.\" Holt also said that Slayer \"is not like a permanent commitment on [his] end anymore\", and added, \"I'm able to focus on family number one, which is Exodus. [They're] my childhood friends. Slayer is my family as well, but they're family number two. And I've at my age, I want to close my career out with the guys I started it with.\"\nSlayer will play their first show in over a year, as one of the performers at the Sick New World Texas festival in Fort Worth, on October 24, 2026. This show will see the band celebrate the 40th anniversary of their third album \"Reign in Blood\".\nArtistry.\nSlayer is generally considered a thrash metal band. In an article from December 1986 by \"the Washington Post\", writer Joe Brown described Slayer as speed metal, a genre he defined as \"an unholy hybrid of punk rock thrash and heavy metal that attracts an almost all-male teen-age following\". Brown wrote: \"Over a jackhammer beat, Slayer's stun guitars created scraping sheets of corrosive metal noise, with occasional solos that sounded like squealing brakes, over which the singer-bassist emitted a larynx-lacerating growl-yowl.\" In an article from September 1988 by \"the New York Times\", writer Jon Pareles also described Slayer as speed metal, additionally writing that the band \"brings the sensational imagery of tabloids and horror movies\" and has lyrics that \"revel in death, gore and allusions to Satanism and Nazism.\" Pareles also described other \"Big Four\" thrash metal bands Metallica and Megadeth as speed metal bands. Slayer's early works were praised for their \"breakneck speed and instrumental prowess\", combining the structure of hardcore punk tempos and speed metal. The band released fast, aggressive material that was characterized as having a \"primitive\" sound. AllMusic noted \"God Hates Us All\" as \"abandoning the extravagances and accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returning to perfect the raw approach\", with some fans labeling it as nu metal.\nKing and Hanneman's dual guitar solos have been referred to as \"wildly chaotic\" and \"twisted genius\". \"Invisible Oranges\" observed, \"It\u2019s fun to watch these guys live and see their virtually identical soloing styles. Jeff Hanneman, with atonal runs going up and down the neck, finished with a whammy bar dump! Kerry King, with atonal runs going up and down the neck, finished with a whammy bar dump! These guys were made to be in a band together \u2013 because they would sound terrible in any other band.\" Original drummer Lombardo would use two kick drums instead of a double pedal on a single drum. Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the \"godfather of double bass\" by Drummerworld. Lombardo stated his reasons for using two bass drums: \"When you hit the bass drum, the head is still resonating. When you hit it in the same place right after that, you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe.\" When playing the two kick drums, Lombardo would use the \"heel-up\" technique.\nIn the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, with King and Hanneman writing the music with additional arrangement from Lombardo and sometimes Araya. Araya formed a lyric writing partnership with Hanneman, which sometimes overshadowed the creative input of King. Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music was a \"free-for-all\": \"It's all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with Kerry \u2013 it's whoever's hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it's good, we use it; if not, we don't.\"\nWhen writing material, the band would write the music first before incorporating lyrics. King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created and get their opinion. King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band would then add parts to get the basic song structure before figuring out where the lyrics and solos would be placed.\nSome of Slayer's influences include hardcore punk bands such as Minor Threat, T.S.O.L., Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, the Exploited, the Germs, D.R.I., Suicidal Tendencies and GBH. The band's other influences include heavy metal and hard rock acts Black Sabbath, Mot\u00f6rhead, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Kiss, UFO, Van Halen, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, Rush, Rainbow, Venom, Mercyful Fate, Scorpions, Saxon, Accept, Angel Witch and Raven. They were also influenced by their contemporaries in the then-upcoming genre of thrash metal such as Metallica and Exodus, both of whom Slayer had discovered through tape trading before recording their debut album \"Show No Mercy\".\nLegacy.\nSlayer is one of the most influential bands in heavy metal history. Steve Huey of AllMusic believes the musical style of Slayer makes the band stronger than the other members of the \"Big Four\" thrash metal bands Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax, all of which rose to fame during the 1980s. MTV stated that Slayer's \"downtuned rhythms, infectious guitar licks, graphically violent lyrics and grisly artwork set the standard for dozens of emerging thrash bands\" and their \"music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal\", ranking Slayer as the sixth greatest metal band of all time. VH1 ranked them 50th on their \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list. Hanneman and King ranked number 10 in \"Guitar World\"'s \"100 greatest metal guitarists of all time\" in 2004, and were voted \"Best Guitarist/Guitar Team\" in Revolver's reader's poll. Lombardo was also voted \"Best Drummer\", and the band entered the top five in the categories \"Best Band Ever\", \"Best Live Band\", \"Album of the Year\" (for \"Christ Illusion\") and \"Band of the Year\".\nMusic author Joel McIver considers Slayer very influential in the extreme metal scene, especially in the development of the death metal and black metal subgenres. According to John Consterdine of \"Terrorizer\", without \"Slayer's influence, extreme metal as we know it wouldn't exist.\" Kam Lee of Massacre and formerly Death stated: \"there wouldn't be death metal or black metal or even extreme metal (the likes of what it is today) if not for Slayer.\" Johan Reinholdz of Andromeda said that Slayer \"were crucial in the development of thrash metal which then became the foundation for a lot of different subgenres. They inspired generations of metal bands.\" Alex Skolnick of Testament declared: \"Before Slayer, metal had never had such razor-sharp articulation, tightness, and balance between sound and stops. This all-out sonic assault was about the shock, the screams, the drums, and [...] most importantly the riffs.\" Steve Asheim, drummer for Deicide, declared that \"there obviously would not have been a Deicide as we know it without the existence of Slayer.\" Sepultura guitarist Andreas Kisser affirmed that \"without Slayer, Sepultura would never be possible.\" \nIn particular, the band's 1986 release \"Reign in Blood\" has been an influence to extreme and thrash metal bands since its release and is considered the record which set the bar for death metal. It had a significant influence on genre leaders such as Death, Obituary, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel and Napalm Death. The album was hailed the \"heaviest album of all time\" by \"Kerrang!\", a \"genre-definer\" by \"Stylus\", and a \"stone-cold classic upon its release\" by AllMusic. In 2006, \"Reign in Blood\" was named the best metal album of the last 20 years by \"Metal Hammer\". According to Nielsen SoundScan, Slayer sold 4,900,000 copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013.\nOther groups who cited Slayer among their major influences include Pantera, Testament, Kreator, Body Count, Children of Bodom, Mayhem, Darkthrone, Avenged Sevenfold, Bullet for My Valentine, Trivium, As I Lay Dying, All That Remains, System of a Down, Killswitch Engage, Slipknot, Machine Head, DevilDriver, Lamb of God, Gojira, Behemoth, Evile and Lacuna Coil. Dave Grohl recalled \"Me and my friends, we just wanted to listen to fucking Slayer and take acid and smash stuff.\"\nControversies.\nA lawsuit was brought against the band in 1995 by the parents of Elyse Pahler, who accused the band of encouraging their daughter's murderers through their lyrics. Pahler was drugged, strangled, stabbed, trampled on, and raped as a sacrifice to the devil by three fans of the band. The case was unsealed by the court on May 19, 2000, stating Slayer and related business markets distribute harmful products to teens, encouraging violent acts through their lyrics, and \"none of the vicious crimes committed against Elyse Marie Pahler would have occurred without the intentional marketing strategy of the death-metal band Slayer\". The lawsuit was dismissed in 2001, for multiple reasons including \"principles of free speech, lack of a duty and lack of foreseeability\". A second lawsuit was filed by the parents, an amended complaint for damages against Slayer, their label, and other industry and label entities. The lawsuit was again dismissed. Judge E. Jeffrey Burke stated, \"I do not consider Slayer's music obscene, indecent or harmful to minors.\"\nSlayer has been accused of holding Nazi sympathies due to the band's eagle logo bearing resemblance to the Eagle atop swastika and the lyrics of \"Angel of Death\". \"Angel of Death\" was inspired by the acts of Josef Mengele, the doctor who conducted human experiments on prisoners during World War II at the Auschwitz concentration camp and was dubbed the \"Angel of Death\" by inmates. Araya credits Rubin with coming up with the eagle logo from Hanneman's book on Nazi war medals, with the band using it since \"Seasons in the Abyss\". The band has dismissed these accusations as misinterpretations of their intentions.\nSlayer's cover of Minor Threat's \"Guilty of Being White\" raised questions about a possible message of white supremacy in the band's music. The controversy surrounding the cover involved the changing of the refrain \"guilty of being white\" to \"guilty of being right\", at the song's ending. This incensed Minor Threat frontman Ian MacKaye, who stated \"that is so offensive to me\". King said it was changed for \"tongue-in-cheek\" humor as he thought the allegation of racism at the time was \"ridiculous\".\nIn a 2004 interview, when asked, \"Did critics realize you were wallowing in parody?\", Araya replied \"No.\u00a0People thought we were serious!...back then you had that PMRC, who literally took everything to heart, when in actuality you're trying to create an image. You're trying to scare people on purpose.\" Araya also denied rumors that the band's members are Satanists, stating that they find the subject of Satanism interesting and that \"we are all on this planet to learn and experience\".\nThe song \"Jihad\" from \"Christ Illusion\" sparked controversy among families of the September 11 attack victims, as it deals with the attack from the perspective of one of the religious terrorists. King stated \"In America every band under the sun has written their 9/11 song. And that's why I didn't want to have any part of it, but this is really cool. It kind of has an 'Angel Of Death' feel because it doesn't condemn anyone or say that anyone's right or wrong.\"&lt;ref name=\"Slayer SPARK 9/11 CONTROVERSY\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen bus benches promoting the album in Fullerton, California were deemed offensive by city officials, who contacted the band's record label and had the ads removed.\nIn India, \"Christ Illusion\" was recalled by EMI India after protests from Christian religious groups due to the graphic nature of the artwork. The album cover was designed by Slayer's longtime collaborator Larry Carroll and features Christ in a \"sea of despair\", with amputated arms, missing an eye, while standing in a sea of blood with severed heads. Joseph Dias of the Mumbai Christian group \"Catholic Secular Forum\" took \"strong exception\" to the original album artwork as well as the lyrics of \"Skeleton Christ\" and \"Jihad\", issuing a memorandum to Mumbai's police commissioner in protest. On October 11, 2006, EMI announced that all stocks had been destroyed, noting it had no plans to re-release the record in India in the future.\nBand members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nAwards and nominations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73579", "revid": "14672439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73579", "title": "Eixample", "text": "District of Barcelona\nThe Eixample ( 'Expansion'; ) is a district of Barcelona between the old city (Ciutat Vella) and what were once surrounding small towns (Sants, Gr\u00e0cia, Sant Andreu, etc.), constructed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Its population was 262,000 at the last census (2005).\nArchitecture and design.\nThe Eixample is characterized by long straight streets, a strict grid pattern crossed by wide avenues, and square blocks with chamfered corners (named \"illes\" in Catalan, \"manzanas\" in Spanish). \nThis was a visionary, pioneering design by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0, who considered traffic and transport along with sunlight and ventilation in coming up with his characteristic octagonal blocks, where the streets broaden at every intersection making for greater visibility, better ventilation and (today) some short-term parking areas. \nIt also provided an area for horse-drawn wagons and carriages to easily turn around. The grid pattern remains as a hallmark of Barcelona, but many of his other provisions were ignored: the four sides of the blocks and the inner space were built instead of the planned two or three sides around a garden; the streets were narrower; only one of the two diagonal avenues was carried out; the inhabitants were of a higher class than the mixed composition dreamed of by Cerd\u00e0. \nThe important needs of the inhabitants were incorporated into his plan, which called for markets, schools, hospitals every so many blocks. Today, most of the markets remain open in the spots they have been from the beginning.\nSome parts of the Eixample were influenced by \"Modernista\" architects, chief among whom was Antoni Gaud\u00ed. His work in the Eixample includes the Casa Mil\u00e0 (nicknamed \"La Pedrera\") and the Casa Batll\u00f3, both of which are on the wide Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, as well as the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Other architects who made highly significant, and certainly more numerous, contributions to giving the Eixample its characteristic appearance include Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Josep Dom\u00e8nech i Estap\u00e0, Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas and perhaps above all Enric Sagnier i Villavecchia, responsible for a total of over 500 buildings in the city (not all of them in the Eixample).\nThe Casa Terrades, better known as Casa de les Punxes and replete with medieval allusions, stands at the junction of Av. Diagonal with Carrer Rossell\u00f3. It was built in 1903\u20131905 by the \"Modernista\" architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who used Nordic Gothic and Spanish Plateresque resources side by side, along with traditional Catalan motifs.\nThe Casa Batll\u00f3 is part of a block called the Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia, along with two other notable \"Modernista\" works, Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner's Casa Lle\u00f3 Morera and Josep Puig i Cadafalch's Casa Amatller. The block is so named due to the visual clash between the buildings; its Spanish name, \"Manzana de la Discordia\", is also a pun on Eris's Apple of Discord \u2013 \"manzana\" means both \"apple\" and \"city block\".\nThe square architecture of Eixample was the main inspiration for the controversial jersey checkerboard design introduced by FC Barcelona in 2019 instead of the traditional stripes, and used until the following year.\nNeighborhoods.\nThere are six administrative neighborhoods: \nThe district is often divided for practical purposes in two: Esquerra de l'Eixample and Dreta de l'Eixample (left and right sides of Eixample, respectively). Traditionally and officially, it is divided into five neighborhoods. \nThese are, in addition to the areas already mentioned, Sant Antoni, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and Fort Pienc, also known as \"Fort Pius\". \nThe latter has recently become notable for the number of Asian, chiefly Chinese residents and the proliferation of Asian shops.\nSome parts of Eixample are rather wealthy neighborhoods, especially around the central areas such as Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Rambla de Catalunya, pedestrian streets such as Carrer de Girona and the Avinguda Gaudi and vicinity of the Sagrada Familia.\nMain thoroughfares.\nPasseig de Gr\u00e0cia connects the central Pla\u00e7a Catalunya to the old town of Gr\u00e0cia, while Avinguda Diagonal cuts across the grid diagonally and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes runs across the entire city from southwest to northeast.\nOther wide avenues in the area include Carrer d'Arag\u00f3, Carrer de Balmes and Passeig de Sant Joan.\nEducation.\nThere is a Japanese library in Eixample that opened in 1992. Most of the patrons are Japanese, though locals may also use the facilities. The library is located inside a flat.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At first dispassionate observers, they find themselves increasingly caught up in the chaotic and nihilistic violence, eventually becoming accomplices. The film received the Andr\u00e9 Cavens Award for Best Film by the Belgian Film Critics Association (UCC). Since its release, the picture has become a cult film, and received a rare NC-17 rating for its theatrical release in the U.S.\nPlot.\nBen is a witty and charismatic but narcissistic and easily-enraged serial killer who holds forth at length about whatever comes to mind, be it the \"craft\" of murder, the failings of architecture, his own poetry, or classical music, which he plays with his girlfriend Valerie. A film crew joins him on his sadistic adventures, recording them for a fly on the wall documentary. Ben takes them to meet his family and friends while boasting of murdering many people at random and dumping their bodies in canals and quarries. The viewer witnesses these grisly killings in graphic detail.\nBen ventures into apartment buildings, explaining how it is more cost-effective to attack old people than young couples because the elderly have more cash at home and are easier to kill. In a following scene, he screams wildly at an elderly lady, causing her to have a heart attack. As she lies dying, he casually remarks that this method saved him a bullet.\nBen continues his candid explanations and his rampage, shooting, strangling, and beating his victims to death. His murders often involve robbery and theft. His victims include women, the elderly, immigrants, and postmen (his favorite targets). He enjoys killing a postman at the start of each month because they tend to have parcels with money and other goods he can steal. He also enjoys killing women because he claims they do not fight back as much. However, Ben also kills a real estate developer who rudely evicted one of his friends, and when he kills an immigrant night watchman at a construction site, he expresses concern that the construction company hired the African employee for unscrupulous reasons (before launching into his own racist tirade and requesting the film crew expose the body\u2019s genitals). At the same construction site, Ben points out where he killed and buried two Muslims, and explains that he made sure to entomb their bodies in a wall that faces Mecca. During filming, some of Ben's crew are killed; their deaths are later called \"occupational hazards\" by a crew member and off-handedly mourned.\nThe camera crew becomes more and more involved in the murders, starting out as silent accomplices but gradually assisting Ben in his killings. When Ben invades a home and kills an entire family, they help him hold down a young boy and smother him with a pillow, all the while keeping up a casual conversation.\nAt the abandoned building that Ben uses for a hideout, the crew encounters two Italian criminals or gangsters also hiding out in the building. Ben kills the Italians before discovering that they were actually also being filmed by a competing documentary camera crew. Ben and his camera crew have fun taking turns as they shoot the rival crew members to death and record the whole thing.\nAfter a night of drinking with the film crew, Ben invades a home and interrupts a couple having sex. He then takes the pair hostage, holding the man at gunpoint while he and the crew gang-rape the woman. The following morning, the camera dispassionately records the aftermath: the woman has been butchered with a knife, her entrails spilling out, while the husband had his throat cut. Later, Ben's girlfriend and family receive death threats from the brother of one of the Italian criminals whom Ben had killed earlier. Ben kills an acquaintance in front of his girlfriend and friends during a birthday dinner as it is suggested he had been close to her while he was in prison. Spattered with blood, they act as though nothing horrible has happened, continuing to offer Ben gifts. The film crew disposes of the body for Ben.\nAfter a victim flees before he can be killed, Ben is arrested, but he escapes. At this point, someone, presumably the brother of the dead Italian along with other members of the two dead Italians' criminal organization, starts taking revenge on Ben and his family. Ben discovers that his girlfriend Valerie has been killed: a flutist, she has been murdered in a particularly humiliating manner, with her flute inserted into her anus. He later finds that his parents met the same fate, with his mother, who owns a shop and is \"not a musician\", being sodomized with the end of a broomstick. This prompts Ben to decide that he must leave. He meets the camera crew to say farewell, but in the middle of reciting a poem, he is abruptly shot dead by an off-camera gunman. The camera crew is then picked off one by one. After the camera falls, it keeps running, and the film ends with the death of the fleeing sound recordist.\nProduction.\n\"Man Bites Dog\" was shot in black and white on 16 mm film and was produced on a shoestring budget by four student filmmakers, led by director R\u00e9my Belvaux. The film's writers, Belvaux, Poelvoorde and Bonzel, all appear in the film using their own first names: Poelvoorde as Ben, the killer; Belvaux as R\u00e9my, the director; and Bonzel as Andr\u00e9, the camera operator. The genesis of the idea came from shooting a documentary without any money.\nThe film's French title, which translates to \"It Happened in Your Neighborhood\", is taken from a column in the Belgian daily newspaper \"Le Soir\" dedicated to trivial local news.\nBenoit Poelvoorde's parents and grandparents were portrayed by his real relatives. They thought they were filming a documentary on Benoit, and had no idea that the footage was going to be used in a film in which he is a serial killer.\nBen's cocktail \"Petit Gr\u00e9gory\" is a reference to an actual murder case in France that involved the killing of the 4-year-old Gr\u00e9gory who was found floating in a river with his hands and legs tied (much like the olive in the cocktail that is tied to a sugar cube).\nRelease.\n\"Man Bites Dog\" premiered in the International Critics' Week section at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. Though there was some outrage towards the film for its violence, it won the International Critics' Prize, the SACD award for Best Feature and the Special Award of the Youth for directors R\u00e9my Belvaux, Andr\u00e9 Bonzel and Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde. It went on to play the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 1992, as well as the New York Film Festival on October 9.\nBox office.\nThe film grossed $1.2 million in Belgium and more than $2 million in France. In the United States and Canada it grossed $205,569.\nControversy.\nThe film faced bans in some countries due to its violent content, particularly for a graphic scene involving a gang rape. For this scene, the film was banned in Sweden. During the UK release, British tabloids called for the picture to be banned from UK cinemas, along with the films \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Bad Lieutenant\". Despite protests, the film was able to secure an 18 certificate and was released uncut to home video by Tartan Films. When asked about the BBFC\u2019s decision for the rating, then-chief executive James Ferman said, \"\"Man Bites Dog\" was actually passed for film and video last year, before recent concerns about the violence under-age children could be seeing on video\", but added, \"We did think that as the film was a subtitled, grainy, black-and-white, low-budget student film for adults it would go to self-selected audience. Also the genre is black comedy, where the deliberate excessiveness of the violence is the joke.\" In 2003, the film was banned in Ireland.\nAlthough it is never shown or suggested in the film itself that Benoit kills a baby, the original poster features an image of a baby's pacifier with spattering blood coming from an unseen target at the end of Benoit's gun. For foreign release posters (not including the Region 4/Australian release), the baby's pacifier was changed to a set of dentures.\nIn Australia, the uncut version was initially refused classification by the Australian Classification Board for the scene of \"sexual violence.\" After removal of the rape scene, the film was given an R classification. This edited version was released to home video in Australia in late 1993 by 21st Century Films. The uncut version was finally passed in Australia in 2025, for a Blu-ray release by Imprint Films.\nIn the U.S., \"Man Bites Dog\" was given an NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong graphic violence\". It played in one theater and was distributed by Roxie Releasing. To ensure availability in video rental store chains which do not stock NC-17 films, cuts were made to the film to secure an unrated rating. The unrated version removes the rape scene and edited other violent scenes to be less graphic.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Man Bites Dog\" holds an approval rating of 68%, based on 19 reviews, and an average rating of 7.1/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 67 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating .\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" highly praised the film upon its release, writing, \"\"Man Bites Dog\" defines audacity. An assured, seductive chamber of horrors, it marries nightmare with humor and then abruptly takes the laughter away. Intentionally disturbing, it is close to the last word about the nature of violence on film, a troubling, often funny vision of what the movies have done to our souls... The deserving winner of the International Critics Award at Cannes ...\" Film critic Rob Gonsalves called the film \"[an] original, a stark and (sorry) biting work far more complex, both stylistically and thematically, than first meets the eye.\" Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"a grisly sick joke of a film that some will find funny, others simply appalling.\" Holden concluded his review by stating that the film \"gets carried away with its own cleverness. It makes the audience the butt of a nasty practical joke.\"\nIn 2015, Taste of Cinema ranked the film 19th among the \"30 Great Psychopath Movies That Are Worth Your Time\".\nLegacy.\nAmong the film's admirers are Steve Buscemi, who named \"Man Bites Dog\" as part of his top 10 films in The Criterion Collection, and Quentin Tarantino, who attended the very first screening with Buscemi at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival and \"absolutely loved the movie\". When Tarantino tried to attend the second screening, he could not get past the security guard. Tarantino took a swing at the guard, whereupon five guards wrestled Tarantino to the floor. The movie was a clear inspiration on Tarantino's story for \"Natural Born Killers\", released in 1994.\nThe film is included among the \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\", edited by Steven Jay Schneider.\nWriting for \"MTV\", Sacha Howells said, \"If anything, the film's comment on how documentaries and reality TV manipulate misery and violence for entertainment value is even more relevant now. \"Man Bites Dog\" premiered the same year that the first \"Real World\" episodes aired, before the dozens of increasingly extreme shows that have come since\u2026The disturbing film they left behind has more meaning today than it did when it was made, an indictment of a celebrity-obsessed culture that considers anyone in front of a camera to be a star.\"\nWriting about the film for \"The A.V. Club\" in 2010, Scott Tobias said, \"Five years before Michael Haneke\u2019s even nastier \"Funny Games\", \"Man Bites Dog\" also implicates the audience for watching it\u2014a stand that has naturally made both films extremely polarizing. When R\u00e9my talks about never having enough [salacious content], it isn\u2019t just the filmmakers who are guilty of insatiable bloodlust, but the unseen audience that regularly seeks out violence and mayhem as entertainment.\" He also noted the film \"forcefully reveals the lie of documentary 'objectivity,' this false notion that filmmakers can be flies on the wall and record life as it really happens.\" He concluded, \"Though time has made the big shocks in \"Man Bites Dog\" seem a little quaint\u2014the careers of Haneke, Gaspar No\u00e9, and Takashi Miike hastened that inevitability\u2014the film looks wiser and more prescient now than it did in 1992. Back then, most of the arguments about the film centered on whether it should even exist; before you could even broach a discussion about themes, you first had to come to terms with the nearly unprecedented horror of the rape scene, or the bleak comedy of bodies piling up without consequence. Today, it doesn\u2019t look like provocation for provocation\u2019s sake; it\u2019s a thoughtful, evergreen thesis on documentary 'reality' and the grotesque distortions of the movie camera. It\u2019s even possible to laugh about it now. Sicko.\"\nFor the film's 30th anniversary in 2021, Luiz H.C. of \"Bloody Disgusting\" discussed the film's impact, noting its influence on subsequent mockumentaries such as \"\" and \"What We Do in the Shadows\". He contended that the film's \"horrific subject matter isn\u2019t actually gratuitous\" and does serve a narrative purpose, and is \"never romanticized or even stylized like you might see in a Slasher flick, with the filmmakers always choosing to depict them as sudden and messy, making the entire experience feel like one excruciatingly long snuff film.\" He added the film's \"gritty photography\u2026helps to hammer home [its] brutal realism, with the hard shadows and lack of color making the Belgian setting look hopeless and dreary as Ben goes about his nihilistic shenanigans.\"\nHome media.\nThe directors' cut of \"Man Bites Dog\" was released on LaserDisc in the United States in December 1993. In 2002, \"Man Bites Dog\" was released on DVD uncut as a part of The Criterion Collection with spine #165. The Criterion DVD restores scenes that were removed in edited versions and includes English-language interviews with Belvaux, Bonzel, and Poelvoorde.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They covered most of the Low Countries, i.e., what is now the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and most of the French departments of Nord (French Flanders and French Hainaut) and Pas-de-Calais (Artois).\nThe Seventeen Provinces arose from the Burgundian Netherlands, a number of fiefs held by the House of Valois-Burgundy and inherited by the House of Habsburg in 1482, and held by Habsburg Spain from 1556. Starting in 1512, the Provinces formed the major part of the Burgundian Circle. In 1581, many of these provinces seceded to form what would eventually become the Dutch Republic.\nDefinition and composition.\nAs the term \"province\" did not denote a specific administrative unit, but rather was a term of convenience, different authors chose and still choose to make sense of the intricate patchwork of fiefdoms across Early Modern Europe in different ways, meaning that not only is there no agreed upon definition of which provinces were among the seventeen, some even disagree on the number seventeen itself.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, which established the Netherlands as a cohesive administrative entity, lists the following provinces:\nThis totals fifteen provinces, but by counting Zutphen and Groningen separately, the number increases to seventeen; this is thought to be the origin of the number, though others attribute it Christian significance. In any case, it is a rather arbitrary one and even contemporary sources disagree on the composition and number of provinces. The Margraviate of Antwerp in particular was often counted as a fully-fledged province, while other lists omit it, counting it as part of Brabant. Some lists count the Tournaisis as a province, while others lump it together with Lillie, Douai and Orchies as \"Walloon Flanders\", despite there being no record of such a name having been used in the 16th century. Some modern lists may retroactively include the Territory of Drenthe, which was considered a province within the Dutch Republic, as one of the Seventeen Provinces.\nHistory.\nThe Seventeen Provinces originated from the Burgundian Netherlands. The dukes of Burgundy systematically became the lords of different provinces. Mary I of Valois, Duchess of Burgundy was the last of the House of Burgundy.\nMary married Archduke Maximilian in 1477, and the provinces were acquired by the House of Habsburg on her death in 1482, with the exception of the Duchy of Burgundy itself, which, with an appeal to Salic law, had been reabsorbed into France upon the death of Mary's father, Charles the Bold. Maximilian and Mary's grandson, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain, eventually united all 17 provinces under his rule, the last one being the Duchy of Guelders, in 1543.\nMost of these provinces were fiefs of the Holy Roman Empire. Two provinces, the County of Flanders and the County of Artois, were originally French fiefs, but sovereignty was ceded to the Empire in the Treaty of Cambrai in 1529.\nOn 15 October 1506, in the palace of Mechelen, the future Charles V was recognized as \"Heer der Nederlanden\" (\"Lord of the Netherlands\"). Only he and his son ever used this title. The Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 determined that the Provinces should remain united in the future and inherited by the same monarch.\nAfter Charles V's abdication in 1555, his realms were divided between his son, Philip II of Spain, and his brother, Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. The Seventeen Provinces went to his son, the king of Spain.\nConflicts between Philip II and his Dutch subjects led to the Eighty Years' War, which started in 1568. The seven northern provinces gained their independence as a republic called the Seven United Provinces. They were:\nThe southern provinces, Flanders, Brabant, Namur, Hainaut, Luxembourg and the others, were restored to Spanish rule due to the military and political talent of the Duke of Parma, especially at the Siege of Antwerp (1584\u20131585). Hence, these provinces became known as the Spanish Netherlands.\nThe County of Drenthe, surrounded by the other northern provinces, became \"de facto\" part of the Seven United Provinces, but had no voting rights in the Union of Utrecht and was therefore not considered a province.\nThe northern Seven United Provinces kept parts of Limburg, Brabant, and Flanders during the Eighty Years' War (see Generality Lands), which ended with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648.\nArtois and parts of Flanders and Hainaut (French Flanders and French Hainaut) were ceded to France in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries.\nEconomy.\nBy the mid-16th century, the Margraviate of Antwerp (Duchy of Brabant) had become the economic, political, and cultural centre of the Netherlands after its capital had shifted from the nearby Lordship of Mechelen to the city of Brussels.\nBruges (County of Flanders) had already lost its prominent position as the economic powerhouse of northern Europe, while Holland was gradually gaining importance in the 15th and 16th centuries.\nHowever, after the revolt of the seven northern provinces (1568), the Sack of Antwerp (1576), the Fall of Antwerp (1584\u20131585), and the resulting closure of the Scheldt river to navigation, a large number of people from the southern provinces emigrated north to the new republic. The centre of prosperity moved from cities in the south such as Bruges, Antwerp, Ghent, and Brussels to cities in the north, mostly in Holland, including Amsterdam, The Hague, and Rotterdam.\nNetherlands.\nTo distinguish between the older and larger Low Countries of the Netherlands from the current country of the Netherlands, Dutch speakers usually drop the plural for the latter. They speak of \"Nederland\" in the singular for the current country and of \"de Nederlanden\" in the plural for the integral domains of Charles V.\nIn other languages, this has not been adopted, though the larger area is sometimes known as the Low Countries in English.\nThe fact that the term \"Netherlands\" has such different historical meanings can sometimes lead to difficulties in expressing oneself correctly. For example, composers from the 16th century are often said to belong to the \"Dutch School\" (\"Nederlandse School\"). Although they themselves would not have objected to that term at that time, nowadays it may wrongly create the impression that they were from the current Netherlands. In fact, they were almost exclusively from current Belgium.\nFlanders.\nThe same confusion exists around the word \"Flanders\". Historically, it applied to the County of Flanders, corresponding roughly with the present-day provinces of West Flanders, East Flanders and French Flanders. However, when the Dutch-speaking population of Belgium sought more rights in the 19th century, the word \"Flanders\" was reused, this time to refer to the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, which is larger and contains only part of the old county of Flanders (see Flemish Movement). Therefore, the territory of the County of Flanders and that of present-day Flanders do not fully match:\nThis explains, for instance, why the province of East Flanders is not situated in the east of present-day Flanders."}
{"id": "73591", "revid": "45880546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73591", "title": "Treaty of Tordesillas", "text": "1494 treaty dividing the unclaimed world between Spanish and Portuguese sovereignty\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in Tordesillas, Spain, on 7 June 1494, and ratified in Set\u00fabal, Portugal, divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Crown of Castile, along a meridian 370 leagues or west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. That line of demarcation was about halfway between Cape Verde (already Portuguese) and the islands visited by Christopher Columbus on his first voyage (claimed for Castile and Le\u00f3n), named in the treaty as Cipangu and Antillia (Cuba and Hispaniola).\nThe lands to the east would belong to Portugal and the lands to the west to Castile, modifying an earlier bull by Pope Alexander VI. The treaty was created on 7 June 1494, then ratified by Spain on 2 July 1494, by Portugal on 5 September 1494, and by Pope Julius II on 24 January 1506. The other side of the world was divided a few decades later by the Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529, which specified the to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas. Portugal and Spain largely respected the treaties, while the Indigenous peoples of the Americas did not acknowledge them. \nThe Treaty of Tordesillas was added by UNESCO to its Memory of the World international register in 2007. Originals of both treaties are kept at the General Archive of the Indies in Spain and at the Torre do Tombo National Archive in Portugal.\nSigning and enforcement.\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas was intended to solve the dispute that arose following the return of Christopher Columbus and his crew, who had sailed under the Crown of Castile. On his way back to Spain, he first stopped at Lisbon, where he requested another meeting with King John\u00a0II to prove to him that there were more islands to the southwest of the Canary Islands.\nAfter learning of the Castilian-sponsored voyage, the Portuguese King sent a threatening letter to the Catholic Monarchs, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, stating that by the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas signed in 1479 and by the 1481 papal bull \"Aeterni regis\" that granted all lands south of the Canary Islands to Portugal, all of the lands discovered by Columbus belonged, in fact, to Portugal. The Portuguese king also stated that he was already making arrangements for a fleet (an armada led by Francisco de Almeida) to depart shortly and take possession of the new lands. The Spanish rulers replied that Spain owned the islands discovered by Columbus and warned King John II not to permit anyone from Portugal to go there. Finally, the rulers invited Portugal to send ambassadors to begin diplomatic negotiations aimed at settling the rights of each nation in the Atlantic.\nOn 4 May 1493, Pope Alexander\u00a0VI (Rodrigo Borgia), an Aragonese from Valencia by birth, decreed in the bull \"Inter caetera\" that all lands west of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west of any of the islands of the Azores or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile, although territory under Christian rule as of Christmas 1492 would remain untouched. The bull did not mention Portugal or its lands, so Portugal could not claim newly discovered lands even if they were east of the line. Another bull, \"Dudum siquidem\", entitled \"Extension of the Apostolic Grant and Donation of the Indies\" and dated 25 September 1493, gave all mainlands and islands, \"at one time or even still belonging to India\" to Spain, even if east of the line.\nThe Portuguese King John II was not pleased with that arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land\u2014it prevented him from possessing India, his near-term goal. By 1493, Portuguese explorers had reached the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope. The Portuguese were unlikely to go to war over the islands encountered by Columbus, but the explicit mention of India was a major issue. As the Pope had not made changes, the Portuguese king opened direct negotiations with the Catholic Monarchs to move the line to the west and allow him to claim newly discovered lands east of the line. In the bargain, John accepted \"Inter caetera\" as the starting point of discussion with Ferdinand and Isabella but had the boundary line moved west, protecting the Portuguese route down the coast of Africa and giving the Portuguese rights to lands that now constitute the eastern quarter of Brazil. As one scholar assessed the results, \"both sides must have known that so vague a boundary could not be accurately fixed, and each thought that the other was deceived\", concluding that it was a \"diplomatic triumph for Portugal, confirming to the Portuguese not only the true route to India, but most of the South Atlantic\".\nThe treaty was negotiated without consulting Pope Alexander VI and effectively countered his bulls. However, it was subsequently sanctioned by his successor Pope Julius\u00a0II by means of the bull \"Ea quae pro bono pacis\" of 24 January 1506 and therefore some sources call the resulting line the \"Papal Line of Demarcation\".\nVery little of the newly divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided via the treaty. Castile gained lands including most of the Americas, which in 1494 had little proven wealth. The easternmost part of current Brazil was granted to Portugal when in 1500 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral landed there while he was en route to India. Some historians contend that the Portuguese already knew of the South American bulge that makes up most of Brazil before this time, so his landing in Brazil was not an accident. One scholar points to Cabral's landing on the Brazilian coast 12 degrees farther south than the expected Cape S\u00e3o Roque, such that \"the likelihood of making such a landfall as a result of freak weather or a navigational error was remote; and it is highly probable that Cabral had been instructed to investigate a coast whose existence was not merely suspected, but already known\".\nThe line was not strictly enforced\u2014the Spanish did not resist the Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian. However, Spain attempted to stop the Portuguese advance in Asia, by claiming the meridian line ran around the world, dividing the whole world in half rather than just the Atlantic. Portugal pushed back, seeking another papal pronouncement that limited the line of demarcation to the Atlantic. This was given by Pope Leo X, who was friendly toward Portugal and its discoveries, in 1514 in the bull \"Praecelsae devotionis\".\nThe divided possessions sanctioned by the treaty continued, even when Spain and Portugal were united under a single king between 1580 and 1640, until the treaty was superseded by the 1750 Treaty of Madrid.\nEmerging Protestant maritime powers, particularly England and The Netherlands, and other third parties such as Catholic France, did not recognize the division of the world between only two Catholic nations brokered by the pope.\nTordesillas meridian.\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas only specified the line of demarcation in leagues from the Cape Verde Islands. It did not specify the length of the league, its equivalent in equatorial degrees, or which of the Cape Verde islands was intended. Instead, the treaty provided that these matters were to be settled by a joint voyage. This voyage never occurred, and instead there were only a series of nonbinding expert opinions produced over the next several decades. Their computations were further complicated by remaining uncertainty about the exact equatorial circumference of the earth. As such, each proposed line can be variously computed using geographical leagues defined in terms of a degree using a ratio which applies regardless of the size of the earth or using a specifically measured league applied to the actual equatorial circumference of the earth, with allowances necessary for the imperfect Portuguese and Spanish knowledge of its true dimensions.\nAntimeridian: Moluccas and Treaty of Zaragoza.\nInitially, the line of demarcation did not encircle the earth. Instead, Spain and Portugal could conquer any new lands they were the first to discover, Spain to the west and Portugal to the east, even if they passed each other on the other side of the globe. But Portugal's discovery of the highly valued Moluccas in 1512 caused Spain to argue in 1518 that the Treaty of Tordesillas divided the earth into two equal hemispheres. After the surviving ships of Magellan's fleet visited the Moluccas in 1521, Spain claimed that those islands were within its western hemisphere. The Treaty of Vitoria, negotiated between Spain and Portugal on 19 February 1524, called for the Junta of Badajoz to meet in an attempt to reach an agreement on the anti-meridian, which ultimately failed. It was finally agreed in the Treaty of Zaragoza (or Saragossa), signed on 22 April 1529, that Spain would relinquish its claims to the Moluccas upon the payment of 350,000 ducats of gold by Portugal to Spain. To prevent Spain from encroaching upon Portugal's Moluccas, the anti-meridian was to be &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;297+1\u20442 leagues or 17\u00b0 to the east of the Moluccas, passing through the islands of Las Velas and Santo Thome. This distance is slightly smaller than the 300 leagues determined by Magellan as the westward distance from los Ladrones to the Philippine island of Samar, which is just west of due north of the Moluccas.\nThe Moluccas are a group of islands west of New Guinea. However, unlike the large modern Indonesian archipelago of the Maluku Islands, to 16th-century Europeans the Moluccas were a small chain of islands, the only place on earth where cloves grew, just west of the large north Malukan island of Halmahera (called Gilolo at the time). Cloves were so prized by Europeans for the medicinal uses that they were worth their weight in gold. 16th- and 17th-century maps and descriptions indicate that the main islands were Ternate, Tidore, Moti, Makian and Bacan, although the last was often ignored even though it was by far the largest island. The principal island was Ternate at the chain's northern end (0\u00b047\u2032N, only in diameter) on whose southwest coast the Portuguese built a stone fort (Forte de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ternate) during 1522\u201323, which could only be repaired, not modified, according to the Treaty of Zaragoza. This north\u2013south chain occupies two degrees of latitude bisected by the equator at about 127\u00b024\u2032E, with Ternate, Tidore, Moti, and Makian north of the equator and Bacan south of it.\nAlthough the treaty's Santo Thome island has not been identified, its \"Islas de las Velas\" (Islands of the Sails) appear in a 1585 Spanish history of China, on the 1594 world map of Petrus Plancius, on an anonymous map of the Moluccas in the 1598 London edition of Linschoten, and on the 1607 world map of Petro K\u00e6rio, identified as a north\u2013south chain of islands in the northwest Pacific, which were also called the \"Islas de los Ladrones\" (Islands of the Thieves) during that period. Their name was changed by Spain in 1667 to \"Islas de las Marianas\" (Mariana Islands), which include Guam at their southern end. Guam's longitude of 144\u00b045\u2032E is east of the Moluccas' longitude of 127\u00b024\u2032E by 17\u00b021\u2032, which is remarkably close by 16th-century standards to the treaty's 17\u00b0 east. This longitude passes through the eastern end of the main north Japanese island of Hokkaido and through the eastern end of New Guinea, which is where Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Durand placed the demarcation line. Moriarty and Keistman placed the demarcation line at 147\u00b0E by measuring 16.4\u00b0 east from the western end of New Guinea (or 17\u00b0 east of 130\u00b0E). Despite the treaty's clear statement that the demarcation line passes 17\u00b0 east of the Moluccas, some sources place the line just east of the Moluccas.\nThe Treaty of Zaragoza did not modify or clarify the line of demarcation provided by the Treaty of Tordesillas, nor did it validate Spain's claim to equal hemispheres (180\u00b0 each), so the two lines divided the earth into unequal hemispheres. Portugal's portion was roughly 191\u00b0 whereas Spain's portion was roughly 169\u00b0. Both portions have a large uncertainty of \u00b14\u00b0 because of the wide variation in the opinions regarding the location of the Tordesillas line.\nPortugal gained control of all lands and seas west of the Zaragoza line, including all of Asia and its neighboring islands so far discovered, leaving Spain most of the Pacific Ocean. Although the Philippines were not named in the treaty, Spain implicitly relinquished any claim to them because they were well west of the line. Nevertheless, by 1542, Charles V decided to colonize the Philippines, judging that Portugal would not protest because the archipelago had no spices. Although a number of expeditions sent from New Spain arrived in the Philippines, they were unable to establish a settlement because the return route across the Pacific was unknown. King Philip II succeeded in 1565 when he sent Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi and Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta, establishing the initial Spanish trading post at Cebu and later founding Manila in 1571.\nBesides Brazil and the Moluccas, Portugal eventually controlled Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (among other territories and bases) in Africa; several bases or territories such as Muscat, Ormus and Bahrain in the Persian Gulf, Goa, Bombay and Daman and Diu (among other coastal cities) in India; Ceylon, and Malacca, bases in present-day Indonesia as Makassar, Solor, Ambon, and Portuguese Timor, the \"entrep\u00f4t\"-base of Macau and the entrep\u00f4t-enclave of Dejima (Nagasaki) in the Far East.\nSpain, on the other hand, would control vast western regions in the Americas, in areas ranging from the present-day United States to present-day Argentina, an empire that would extend to the Philippines, and bases in Ternate and Formosa (17th century).\nEffect on other European powers.\nThe attitude towards the treaty that other governments had was expressed by France's Francis I, who declared, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam's will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\"\nTreaty of Madrid.\nOn January 13, 1750, King John V of Portugal and Ferdinand\u00a0VI of Spain signed the Treaty of Madrid, in which both parties sought to establish the borders between Brazil and Spanish America, admitting that the Treaty of Tordesillas, as it had been envisioned in 1494, had been superseded, and was considered void. Spanish sovereignty was acknowledged over the Philippines, while Portugal would get the territory of the Amazon River basin. Portugal would relinquish the colony of Sacramento, on the left bank of the River Plata in modern-day Uruguay, while getting the territory of the Seven Missions.\nFollowing the Guarani War, the treaty was annulled by Spain and Portugal in the Treaty of El Pardo (1761). The border was eventually settled in the First Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1777, with Spain acquiring territories east of the Uruguay River and Portugal acquiring territories in the Amazon Basin.\nModern claims.\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas was invoked by Chile in the 20th century to defend the principle of an Antarctic sector extending along a meridian to the South Pole, as well as the assertion that the treaty made Spanish (or Portuguese) all undiscovered land south to the Pole.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Infections with toxoplasmosis are associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric and behavioral conditions. Occasionally, people may have a few weeks or months of mild, flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes. In a small number of people, eye problems may develop. In those with a weakened immune system, severe symptoms such as seizures and poor coordination may occur. If a woman becomes infected during pregnancy, a condition known as congenital toxoplasmosis may affect the child.\nToxoplasmosis is usually spread by eating poorly cooked food that contains cysts, by exposure to infected cat feces, or from an infected woman to her baby during pregnancy. Rarely, the disease may be spread by blood transfusion or other organ transplant. It is thought to not otherwise spread between people, but broader transmissibility remains a matter of scientific debate. Studies have reported the presence of \"T. gondii\" in human semen and have proposed sexual transmission as a possible route, though this has not been established as a primary mode of spread. The parasite is only known to reproduce sexually in the cat family. It can infect most types of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Diagnosis is typically by testing blood for antibodies or by testing the amniotic fluid in a pregnant patient for the parasite's DNA.\nPrevention is by properly preparing and cooking food. Pregnant women are also recommended not to clean cat litter boxes or, if they must, to wear gloves and wash their hands afterwards. Treatment of otherwise healthy people is usually not needed. During pregnancy, spiramycin or pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine and folinic acid may be used for treatment.\nUp to half of the world's population is infected by \"T.\u00a0gondii\", but have no symptoms. In the United States, approximately 11% of people have been infected, while in some areas of the world this is more than 60%. Approximately 200,000 cases of congenital toxoplasmosis occur a year. Charles Nicolle and Louis Manceaux first described the organism in 1908. In 1941, transmission during pregnancy from a pregnant woman to her baby was confirmed. There is tentative evidence that otherwise asymptomatic infection may affect people's behavior.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nInfection has three stages:\nAcute.\nAcute toxoplasmosis is often asymptomatic in healthy adults. However, symptoms may manifest and are often influenza-like: swollen lymph nodes, headaches, fever, and fatigue, or muscle aches and pains that last for a month or more. It is rare for a human with a fully functioning immune system to develop severe symptoms following infection. People with weakened immune systems are likely to experience headache, confusion, poor coordination, seizures, lung problems that may resemble tuberculosis or \"Pneumocystis jirovecii\" pneumonia (a common opportunistic infection that occurs in people with AIDS), or chorioretinitis caused by severe inflammation of the retina (ocular toxoplasmosis). Young children and immunocompromised people, such as those with HIV/AIDS, those taking certain types of chemotherapy, or those who have recently received an organ transplant, may develop severe toxoplasmosis. This can cause damage to the brain (encephalitis) or the eyes (necrotizing retinochoroiditis). Infants infected via placental transmission may be born with either of these problems, or with nasal malformations, although these complications are rare in newborns. The toxoplasmic trophozoites causing acute toxoplasmosis are referred to as tachyzoites, and are typically found in various tissues and body fluids, but rarely in blood or cerebrospinal fluid.\nSwollen lymph nodes are commonly found in the neck or under the chin, followed by the armpits and the groin. Swelling may occur at different times after the initial infection, persist, and recur for various times independently of antiparasitic treatment. It is usually found at single sites in adults, but in children, multiple sites may be more common. Enlarged lymph nodes will resolve within 1\u20132 months in 60% of cases. However, a quarter of those affected take 2\u20134 months to return to normal, and 8% take 4\u20136 months. A substantial number (6%) do not return to normal until much later.\nLatent.\nDue to the absence of obvious symptoms, hosts easily become infected with \"T.\u00a0gondii\" and develop toxoplasmosis without knowing it. Although mild, flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following exposure, infection with \"T.\u00a0gondii\" produces no readily observable symptoms in healthy human adults. When the infection enters a latent phase, during which only bradyzoites (in tissue cysts) are present; these tissue cysts and even lesions can occur in the retinas, alveolar lining of the lungs (where an acute infection may mimic a \"Pneumocystis jirovecii\" infection), heart, skeletal muscle, and the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain. Cysts form in the CNS (brain tissue) upon infection with \"T.\u00a0gondii\" and persist for the lifetime of the host. Most infants who are infected while in the womb have no symptoms at birth, but may develop symptoms later in life.\nReviews of serological studies have estimated that 30\u201350% of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with latent toxoplasmosis, although infection rates differ significantly from country to country. This latent state of infection has recently been associated with numerous disease burdens, neural alterations, and subtle sex-dependent behavioral changes in immunocompetent humans, as well as an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions.\nSkin.\nWhile rare, skin lesions may occur in the acquired form of the disease, including roseola and erythema multiforme-like eruptions, prurigo-like nodules, urticaria, and maculopapular lesions. Newborns may have punctate macules, ecchymoses, or \"blueberry muffin\" lesions.\nDiagnosis of cutaneous toxoplasmosis is based on the tachyzoite form of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" being found in the epidermis. It is found in all levels of the epidermis, is about 6 by 2\"\u00a0\"\u03bcm and bow-shaped, with the nucleus being one-third of its size. It can be identified by electron microscopy or by Giemsa staining tissue where the cytoplasm shows blue, the nucleus red.\nCause.\nParasitology.\nIn its lifecycle, \"T. gondii\" adopts several forms. Tachyzoites are responsible for acute infection; they divide rapidly and spread through the tissues of the body. Tachyzoites are also known as \"tachyzoic merozoites\", a descriptive term that conveys more precisely the parasitological nature of this stage. After proliferating, tachyzoites convert into bradyzoites, which are inside latent intracellular tissue cysts that form mainly in the muscles and brain. The formation of cysts is in part triggered by the pressure of the host immune system. The bradyzoites (also called \"bradyzoic merozoites\") are not responsive to antibiotics. Bradyzoites, once formed, can remain in the tissues for the lifespan of the host. In a healthy host, if some bradyzoites convert back into active tachyzoites, the immune system will quickly destroy them. However, in immunocompromised individuals, or in fetuses, which lack a developed immune system, the tachyzoites can run rampant and cause significant neurological damage.\nThe parasite's survival is dependent on a balance between host survival and parasite proliferation. \"T.\u00a0gondii\" achieves this balance by manipulating the host's immune response, reducing the host's immune response, and enhancing the parasite's reproductive advantage. Once it infects a normal host cell, it resists damage caused by the host's immune system, and changes the host's immune processes.\nAs it forces its way into the host cell, the parasite forms a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) membrane from the membrane of the host cell. The PV encapsulates the parasite, and is both resistant to the activity of the endolysosomal system, and can take control of the host's mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum.\nWhen first invading the cell, the parasite releases ROP proteins from the bulb of the rhoptry organelle. These proteins translocate to the nucleus and the surface of the PV membrane where they can activate STAT pathways to modulate the expression of cytokines at the transcriptional level, bind and inactivate PV membrane destroying IRG proteins, among other possible effects. Additionally, certain strains of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" can secrete a protein known as GRA15, activating the NF-\u03baB pathway, which upregulates the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 in the early immune response, possibly leading to the parasite's latent phase. The parasite's ability to secrete these proteins depends on its genotype and affects its virulence.\nThe parasite also influences an anti-apoptotic mechanism, allowing the infected host cells to persist and replicate. One method of apoptosis resistance is by disrupting pro-apoptosis effector proteins, such as BAX and BAK. To disrupt these proteins, \"T.\u00a0gondii\" causes conformational changes to the proteins, which prevent the proteins from being transported to various cellular compartments where they initiate apoptosis events. \"T.\u00a0gondii\" does not, however, cause downregulation of the pro-apoptosis effector proteins.\n\"T. gondii\" also has the ability to initiate autophagy of the host's cells. This leads to a decrease in healthy, uninfected cells, and consequently fewer host cells to attack the infected cells. Research by Wang \"et al\" finds that infected cells lead to higher levels of autophagosomes in normal and infected cells. Their research reveals that \"T.\u00a0gondii\" causes host cell autophagy using a calcium-dependent pathway. Another study suggests that the parasite can directly affect calcium being released from calcium stores, which are important for the signalling processes of cells.\nThe mechanisms above allow \"T.\u00a0gondii\" to persist in a host. Some limiting factors for the toxoplasma is that its influence on the host cells is stronger in a weak immune system and is quantity-dependent, so a large number of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" per host cell cause a more severe effect. The effect on the host also depends on the strength of the host immune system. Immunocompetent individuals do not normally show severe symptoms or any at all, while fatality or severe complications can result in immunocompromised individuals.\n\"T. gondii\" has been shown to produce a protein called GRA28, released by the MYR1 secretory pathway, which interferes with gene expression in infected cells and results in cells that behave like dendritic cells, becoming highly mobile in the body.\nSince the parasite can change the host's immune response, it may also have an effect, positive or negative, on the immune response to other pathogenic threats. This includes, but is not limited to, the responses to infections by \"Helicobacter felis\", \"Leishmania major\", or other parasites, such as \"Nippostrongylus brasiliensis\".\nTransmission.\nToxoplasmosis is generally transmitted through the mouth when \"Toxoplasma gondii\" oocysts or tissue cysts are accidentally eaten. Congenital transmittance from mother to fetus can also occur. Transmission may also occur during the solid organ transplant process or hematogenous stem cell transplants.\nOral transmission may occur through:\nCats excrete the pathogen in their feces for a number of weeks after contracting the disease, generally by eating an infected intermediate host that could include mammals (like rodents) or birds. Oocyst shedding usually starts from the third day after ingestion of infected intermediate hosts, and may continue for weeks. The oocysts are not infective when excreted. After about a day, the oocyst undergoes a process called sporulation and becomes potentially pathogenic. In addition to cats, birds and mammals including human beings are also intermediate hosts of the parasite and are involved in the transmission process. However the pathogenicity varies with the age and species involved in infection and the mode of transmission of \"T.\u00a0gondii\".\nToxoplasmosis may also be transmitted through solid organ transplants. Toxoplasma-seronegative recipients who receive organs from recently infected Toxoplasma-seropositive donors are at risk. Organ recipients who have latent toxoplasmosis are at risk of the disease reactivating in their system due to the immunosuppression occurring during solid organ transplant. Recipients of hematogenous stem cell transplants may experience higher risk of infection due to longer periods of immunosuppression.\nHeart and lung transplants provide the highest risk for toxoplasmosis infection due to the striated muscle making up the heart, which can contain cysts, and risks for other organs and tissues vary widely. Risk of transmission can be reduced by screening donors and recipients prior to the transplant procedure and providing treatment.\nPregnancy precautions.\nCongenital toxoplasmosis is a specific form of toxoplasmosis in which an unborn fetus is infected via the placenta. Congenital toxoplasmosis is associated with fetal death and miscarriage, and in infants, it is associated with hydrocephalus, cerebral calcifications and chorioretinitis, leading to encephalopathy and possibly blindness. If a woman receives her first exposure to \"T.\u00a0gondii\" while pregnant, the fetus is at particular risk. A simple blood draw at the first prenatal doctor visit can determine whether or not a woman has had previous exposure and therefore whether or not she is at risk. A positive antibody titer indicates previous exposure and immunity, and largely ensures the unborn fetus' safety.\nNot much evidence exists around the effect of education before pregnancy to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis. However educating parents before the baby is born has been suggested to be effective because it may improve food, personal and pet hygiene. More research is needed to find whether antenatal education can reduce congenital toxoplasmosis.\nFor pregnant women with negative antibody titers, indicating no previous exposure to \"T.\u00a0gondii\", serology testing as frequent as monthly is advisable as treatment during pregnancy for those women exposed to \"T.\u00a0gondii\" for the first time dramatically decreases the risk of passing the parasite to the fetus. Since a baby's immune system does not develop fully for the first year of life, and the resilient cysts that form throughout the body are very difficult to eradicate with antiprotozoans, an infection can be very serious in the young.\nDespite these risks, pregnant women are not routinely screened for toxoplasmosis in most countries, for reasons of cost-effectiveness and the high number of false positives generated; Portugal, France, Austria, Uruguay, and Italy are notable exceptions, and some regional screening programmes operate in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium. As invasive prenatal testing incurs some risk to the fetus (18.5 pregnancy losses per toxoplasmosis case prevented), postnatal or neonatal screening is preferred. The exceptions are cases where fetal abnormalities are noted, and thus screening can be targeted.\nPregnant women should avoid handling raw meat, drinking raw milk (especially goat milk) and be advised to not eat raw or undercooked meat regardless of type. Because of the obvious relationship between \"Toxoplasma\" and cats it is also often advised to avoid exposure to cat feces, and refrain from gardening (cat feces are common in garden soil) or at least wear gloves when so engaged. Most cats are not actively shedding oocysts, since they get infected in the first six months of their life, when they shed oocysts for a short period of time (1\u20132 weeks). However, these oocysts get buried in the soil, sporulate and remain infectious for periods ranging from several months to more than a year. Numerous studies have shown living in a household with a cat is not a significant risk factor for \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection, though living with several kittens has some significance.\nIn 2006, a Czech research team discovered women with high levels of toxoplasmosis antibodies were significantly more likely to give birth to baby boys than baby girls. In most populations, the birth rate is around 51% boys, but people infected with \"T.\u00a0gondii\" had up to a 72% chance of a boy.\nDiagnosis.\nToxoplasmosis in humans is diagnosed through biological, serological, histological, or molecular methods, or by some combination of the above. Toxoplasmosis can be difficult to distinguish from several other conditions, especially ones that are common in HIV/AIDS and immunocompromised patients, and can cause central nervous system problems and brain lesions. Toxoplasmosis is most commonly mistaken for primary central nervous system lymphoma, both conditions cause lesions in the brain, but in about 50-80% of cases the lesions appearances can be very similar on imaging, and exist in an area of the brain that makes biopsying too risky, however the main difference is lymphoma typically causes a single lesion in the subependymal region, and toxoplasmosis causes multiple lesions scattered through the basal ganglia. Other conditions that can present as toxoplasmosis on a differential diagnosis are metastatic brain lesions, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS tuberculosis, bacterial or fungal brain abscess, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex encephalitis.\n\"T. gondii\" may also be detected in blood, amniotic fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid by using polymerase chain reaction. \"T.\u00a0gondii\" may exist in a host as an inactive cyst that would likely evade detection, with some studies finding evidence that latent toxoplasmosis (in non-HIV patients) might play a role in causing mental disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\nSerological testing can detect \"T.\u00a0gondii\" antibodies in blood serum, using methods including the Sabin\u2013Feldman dye test (DT), the indirect hemagglutination assay, the indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA), the direct agglutination test, the latex agglutination test (LAT), the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the immunosorbent agglutination assay test (IAAT).\nThe most commonly used tests to measure IgG antibody are the DT, the ELISA, the IFA, and the modified direct agglutination test. IgG antibodies usually appear within a week or two of infection, peak within one to two months, then decline at various rates. \"Toxoplasma\" IgG antibodies generally persist for life, and therefore may be present in the bloodstream as a result of either current or previous infection.\nTo some extent, acute toxoplasmosis infections can be differentiated from chronic infections using an IgG avidity test, which is a variation on the ELISA. In the first response to infection, toxoplasma-specific IgG has a low affinity for the toxoplasma antigen; in the following weeks and month, IgG affinity for the antigen increases. Based on the IgG avidity test, if the IgG in the infected individual has a high affinity, it means that the infection began three to five months before testing. This is particularly useful in congenital infection, where pregnancy status and gestational age at time of infection determines treatment.\nIn contrast to IgG, IgM antibodies can be used to detect acute infection but generally not chronic infection. The IgM antibodies appear sooner after infection than the IgG antibodies and disappear faster than IgG antibodies after recovery. In most cases, \"T.\u00a0gondii\"-specific IgM antibodies can first be detected approximately a week after acquiring primary infection and decrease within one to six months; 25% of those infected are negative for \"T.\u00a0gondii\"-specific IgM within seven months. However, IgM may be detectable months or years after infection, during the chronic phase, and false positives for acute infection are possible. The most commonly used tests for the measurement of IgM antibody are double-sandwich IgM-ELISA, the IFA test, and the immunosorbent agglutination assay (IgM-ISAGA). Commercial test kits often have low specificity, and the reported results are frequently misinterpreted.\nIn 2021, twenty commercial anti-\"Toxoplasma\" IgG assays were evaluated in a systematic review, in comparison with an accepted reference method. Most of them were enzyme-immunoassays, followed by agglutination tests, immunochromatographic tests, and a Western-Blot assay. The mean sensitivity of IgG assays ranged from 89.7% to 100% for standard titers and from 13.4% to 99.2% for low IgG titers. A few studies pointed out the ability of some methods, especially WB to detect IgG early after primary infection. The specificity of IgG assays was generally high, ranging from 91.3% to 100%; and higher than 99% for most EIA assays. The positive predictive value (PPV) was not a discriminant indicator among methods, whereas significant disparities (87.5\u2013100%) were reported among negative predictive values (NPV), a key-parameter assessing the ability to definitively rule out a \"Toxoplasma\" infection in patients at-risk for opportunistic infections.\nCongenital.\nRecommendations for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis include: prenatal diagnosis based on testing of amniotic fluid and ultrasound examinations; neonatal diagnosis based on molecular testing of placenta and cord blood and comparative mother-child serologic tests and a clinical examination at birth; and early childhood diagnosis based on neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations and a serologic survey during the first year of life. During pregnancy, serological testing is recommended at three week intervals.\nEven though diagnosis of toxoplasmosis heavily relies on serological detection of specific anti-\"Toxoplasma\" immunoglobulin, serological testing has limitations. For example, it may fail to detect the active phase of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection because the specific anti-\"Toxoplasma\" IgG or IgM may not be produced until after several weeks of infection. As a result, a pregnant woman might test negative during the active phase of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection leading to undetected and therefore untreated congenital toxoplasmosis. Also, the test may not detect \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infections in immunocompromised patients because the titers of specific anti-\"Toxoplasma\" IgG or IgM may not rise in this type of patient.\nMany PCR-based techniques have been developed to diagnose toxoplasmosis using clinical specimens that include amniotic fluid, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue biopsy. The most sensitive PCR-based technique is nested PCR, followed by hybridization of PCR products. The major downside to these techniques is that they are time-consuming and do not provide quantitative data.\nReal-time PCR is useful in pathogen detection, gene expression and regulation, and allelic discrimination. This PCR technique utilizes the 5' nuclease activity of \"Taq\" DNA polymerase to cleave a nonextendible, fluorescence-labeled hybridization probe during the extension phase of PCR. A second fluorescent dye, e.g., 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine, quenches the fluorescence of the intact probe. The nuclease cleavage of the hybridization probe during the PCR releases the effect of quenching resulting in an increase of fluorescence proportional to the amount of PCR product, which can be monitored by a sequence detector.\nLymph nodes affected by \"Toxoplasma\" have characteristic changes, including poorly demarcated reactive germinal centers, clusters of monocytoid B cells, and scattered epithelioid histiocytes.\nThe classic triad of congenital toxoplasmosis includes: chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracranial arteriosclerosis. Other consequences include sensorineural deafness, seizures, and intellectual disability.\nCongenital toxoplasmosis may also impact a child's hearing. Up to 30% of newborns have some degree of sensorineural hearing loss. The child's communication skills may also be affected. A study published in 2010 looked at 106 patients, all of whom received toxoplasmosis treatment prior to 2.5 months. Of this group, 26.4% presented with language disorders.\nTreatment.\nTreatment is recommended for people with serious health problems, such as people with HIV whose CD4 counts are under 200 cells/mm3. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice to prevent toxoplasmosis, but not for treating active disease.\nA 2012 study shows a promising new way to treat the active and latent form of this disease using two endochin-like quinolones.\nAcute.\nThe medications prescribed for acute toxoplasmosis are the following:\n(other antibiotics, such as minocycline, have seen some use as a salvage therapy).\nIf infected during pregnancy, spiramycin is recommended in the first and early second trimesters while pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine and leucovorin is recommended in the late second and third trimesters.\nLatent.\nIn people with latent toxoplasmosis, the cysts are immune to these treatments, as the antibiotics do not reach the bradyzoites in sufficient concentration.\nThe medications prescribed for latent toxoplasmosis are:\nCongenital.\nWhen a pregnant woman is diagnosed with acute toxoplasmosis, amniocentesis can be used to determine whether the fetus has been infected or not. When a pregnant woman develops acute toxoplasmosis, the tachyzoites have approximately a 30% chance of entering the placental tissue, and from there entering and infecting the fetus. As gestational age at the time of infection increases, the chance of fetal infection also increases.\nIf the parasite has not yet reached the fetus, spiramycin can help to prevent placental transmission. If the fetus has been infected, the pregnant woman can be treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, with folinic acid, after the first trimester. They are treated after the first trimester because pyrimethamine has an antifolate effect, and lack of folic acid can interfere with fetal brain formation and cause thrombocytopaenia. Infection in earlier gestational stages correlates with poorer fetal and neonatal outcomes, particularly when the infection is untreated.\nNewborns who undergo 12 months of postnatal anti-toxoplasmosis treatment have a low chance of sensorineural hearing loss. Information regarding treatment milestones for children with congenital toxoplasmosis have been created for this group.\nNew therapeutics under study\nThe discovery of new therapeutic options with anti-parasitic effects against \"T. gondii\" would significantly change the prognosis of neurologic toxoplasmosis, providing a novel curative resource for the disease. In the last four decades, approximately a quarter of the newly approved drugs to treat human diseases came from natural sources or modified compounds derived from natural products.\nAmong them, we can mentioned Tartrolon E, secondary metabolite produced by the bacterial symbiont \"Teredinibacter turnerae\" (T7901) found in the gills of shipworms, marine mollusks that feed on wood This novel drug candidate has proven to be safe and highly effective against \"T. gondii\" parasites.\nEpidemiology.\n\"T. gondii\" infections occur throughout the world, although infection rates differ significantly by country. For women of childbearing age, a survey of 99 studies within 44 countries found the areas of highest prevalence are within Latin America (about 50\u201380%), parts of Eastern and Central Europe (about 20\u201360%), the Middle East (about 30\u201350%), parts of Southeast Asia (about 20\u201360%), and parts of Africa (about 20\u201355%).\nIn the United States, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2004 found 9.0% of US-born persons 12\u201349 years of age were seropositive for IgG antibodies against \"T.\u00a0gondii\", down from 14.1% as measured in the NHANES 1988\u20131994. In the 1999\u20132004 survey, 7.7% of US-born and 28.1% of foreign-born women 15\u201344 years of age were \"T.\u00a0gondii\" seropositive. A trend of decreasing seroprevalence has been observed by numerous studies in the United States and many European countries. \"Toxoplasma gondii\" is considered the second leading cause of foodborne-related deaths and the fourth leading cause of foodborne-related hospitalizations in the United States.\nThe protist responsible for toxoplasmosis is \"T.\u00a0gondii\". Three major types of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" are responsible for the patterns of toxoplasmosis throughout the world, named types I, II, and III. These three types of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" have differing effects on certain hosts, mainly mice and humans due to their variation in genotypes.\nCurrent serotyping techniques can only separate type I or III from type II parasites.\nBecause the parasite poses a particular threat to fetuses when it is contracted during pregnancy, much of the global epidemiological data regarding \"T.\u00a0gondii\" comes from seropositivity tests in women of childbearing age. Seropositivity tests look for the presence of antibodies against \"T.\u00a0gondii\" in blood, so while seropositivity guarantees one has been exposed to the parasite, it does not necessarily guarantee one is chronically infected.\nHistory.\n\"Toxoplasma gondii\" was first described in 1908 by Nicolle and Manceaux in Tunisia, and independently by Splendore in Brazil. Splendore reported the protozoan in a rabbit, while Nicolle and Manceaux identified it in a North African rodent, the gundi (Ctenodactylus gundi). In 1909 Nicolle and Manceaux differentiated the protozoan from \"Leishmania\". Nicolle and Manceaux then named it \"Toxoplasma gondii\" after the curved shape of its infectious stage (Greek root = bow).\nThe first recorded case of congenital toxoplasmosis was in 1923, but it was not identified as caused by \"T.\u00a0gondii\". Jank\u016f (1923) described in detail the autopsy results of an 11-month-old boy who had presented to hospital with hydrocephalus. The boy had classic marks of toxoplasmosis including chorioretinitis (inflammation of the choroid and retina of the eye). Histology revealed a number of \"sporocytes\", though Jank\u016f did not identify these as \"T.\u00a0gondii\".\nIt was not until 1937 that the first detailed scientific analysis of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" took place using techniques previously developed for analyzing viruses. In 1937 Sabin and Olitsky analyzed \"T.\u00a0gondii\" in laboratory monkeys and mice. Sabin and Olitsky showed that \"T.\u00a0gondii\" was an obligate intracellular parasite and that mice fed \"T.\u00a0gondii\"-contaminated tissue also contracted the infection. Thus Sabin and Olitsky demonstrated \"T.\u00a0gondii\" as a pathogen transmissible between animals.\n\"T. gondii\" was first described as a human pathogen in 1939 at Babies Hospital in New York City. Wolf, Cowen and Paige identified \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection in an infant girl delivered full-term by Caesarean section. The infant developed seizures and had chorioretinitis in both eyes at three days. The infant then developed encephalomyelitis and died at one month of age. Wolf, Cowen and Paige isolated \"T.\u00a0gondii\" from brain tissue lesions. Intracranial injection of brain and spinal cord samples into mice, rabbits and rats produced encephalitis in the animals. Wolf, Cowen and Page reviewed additional cases and concluded that \"T.\u00a0gondii\" produced recognizable symptoms and could be transmitted from mother to child.\nThe first adult case of toxoplasmosis was reported in 1940 with no neurological signs. Pinkerton and Weinman reported the presence of \"Toxoplasma\" in a 22-year-old man from Peru who died from a subsequent bacterial infection and fever.\nIn 1948, a serological dye test was created by Sabin and Feldman based on the ability of the patient's antibodies to alter staining of \"Toxoplasma\". The Sabin Feldman Dye Test is now the gold standard for identifying \"Toxoplasma\" infection.\nTransmission of \"Toxoplasma\" by eating raw or undercooked meat was demonstrated by Desmonts et al. in 1965 Paris. Desmonts observed that the therapeutic consumption of raw beef or horse meat in a tuberculosis hospital was associated with a 50% per year increase in \"Toxoplasma\" antibodies. This means that more \"T.\u00a0gondii\" was being transmitted through the raw meat.\nIn 1974, Desmonts and Couvreur showed that infection during the first two trimesters produces most harm to the fetus, that transmission depended on when mothers were infected during pregnancy, that mothers with antibodies before pregnancy did not transmit the infection to the fetus, and that spiramycin lowered the transmission to the fetus.\n\"Toxoplasma\" gained more attention in the 1970s with the rise of immune-suppressant treatment given after organ or bone marrow transplants and the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. Patients with lowered immune system function are much more susceptible to disease.\nSociety and culture.\n\"Crazy cat-lady\".\n\"Crazy cat-lady syndrome\" is a term coined by news organizations to describe scientific findings that link the parasite \"Toxoplasma gondii\" to several mental disorders and behavioral problems. The suspected correlation between cat ownership in childhood and later development of schizophrenia suggested that further studies were needed to determine a risk factor for children; however, a later study found that childhood cat ownership was not predictive of psychotic experiences at ages 13 or 18. Researchers also found that cat ownership does not strongly increase the risk of a \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection in pregnant women.\nThe term \"crazy cat-lady syndrome\" draws on both stereotype and popular cultural reference. It was originated as instances of the aforementioned afflictions were noted amongst the populace. A cat lady is a cultural stereotype of a woman who compulsively hoards and dotes upon cats. The biologist Jaroslav Flegr is a proponent of the theory that toxoplasmosis affects human behaviour.\nOther animals.\nAlthough \"T. gondii\" has the capability of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals, susceptibility and rates of infection vary widely between different genera and species. Rates of infection in populations of the same species can also vary widely due to differences in location, diet, and other factors.\nAlthough infection with \"T.\u00a0gondii\" has been noted in several species of Asian primates, seroprevalence of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" antibodies were found for the first time in toque macaques (\"Macaca sinica\") that are endemic to the island of Sri Lanka.\nAustralian marsupials are particularly susceptible to toxoplasmosis. Wallabies, koalas, wombats, pademelons and small dasyurids can be killed by it, with eastern barred bandicoots typically dying within about 3 weeks of infection.\nIt is estimated that 23% of wild swine worldwide are seropositive for \"T.\u00a0gondii\". Seroprevalence varies across the globe with the highest seroprevalence in North America (32%) and Europe (26%) and the lowest in Asia (13%) and South America (5%). Geographical regions located at higher latitudes and regions that experience warmer, humid climates are associated with increased seroprevalence of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" among wild boar. Wild boar infected with \"T.\u00a0gondii\" pose a potential health risk for humans who consume their meat.\nLivestock.\nAmong livestock, pigs, sheep and goats have the highest rates of chronic \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection. The prevalence of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" in meat-producing animals varies widely both within and among countries, and rates of infection have been shown to be dramatically influenced by varying farming and management practices. For instance, animals kept outdoors or in free-ranging environments are more at risk of infection than animals raised indoors or in commercial confinement operations.\nPigs.\nWorldwide, the percentage of pigs harboring viable parasites has been measured to be 3\u201371.43% and in the United States (via bioassay in mice or cats) to be as high as 92.7% and as low as 0%, depending on the farm or herd. Surveys of seroprevalence (\"T.\u00a0gondii\" antibodies in blood) are more common, and such measurements are indicative of the high relative seroprevalence in pigs across the world. Neonatal piglets have been found to experience the entire range of severity, including progression to stillbirth. This was especially demonstrated in the foundational Thiptara et al. 2006, reporting a litter birth of three stillborns and six live in Thailand. This observation has been relevant not only to that country but to toxoplasmosis control in porciculture around the world.\nSheep.\nAlong with pigs, sheep and goats are among the most commonly infected livestock of epidemiological significance for human infection. Prevalence of viable \"T.\u00a0gondii\" in sheep tissue has been measured (via bioassay) to be as high as 78% in the United States, and a 2011 survey of goats intended for consumption in the United States found a seroprevalence of 53.4%. A single live attenuated vaccine, Toxovax, is currently available to mitigate the negative impacts of congenital toxoplasmosis on the sheep industry.\nChickens.\nDue to a lack of exposure to the outdoors, chickens raised in large-scale indoor confinement operations are not commonly infected with \"T.\u00a0gondii\". Free-ranging or backyard-raised chickens are much more commonly infected. A survey of free-ranging chickens in the United States found its prevalence to be 17\u2013100%, depending on the farm. Because chicken meat is generally cooked thoroughly before consumption, poultry is not generally considered to be a significant risk factor for human \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection.\nCattle.\nAlthough cattle and buffalo can be infected with \"T.\u00a0gondii\", the parasite is generally eliminated or reduced to undetectable levels within a few weeks following exposure. Tissue cysts are rarely present in buffalo meat or beef, and meat from these animals is considered to be low-risk for harboring viable parasites.\nHorses.\nHorses are considered resistant to chronic \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection. However, viable cells have been isolated from US horses slaughtered for export, and severe human toxoplasmosis in France has been epidemiologically linked to the consumption of horse meat.\nDomestic cats.\nIn 1942, the first case of feline toxoplasmosis was diagnosed and reported in a domestic cat in Middletown, New York. The investigators isolated oocysts from feline feces and found that the oocysts could be infectious for up to 12 months in the environment.\nThe seroprevalence of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" in domestic cats, worldwide has been estimated to be around 30\u201340% and exhibits significant geographical variation. In the United States, no official national estimate has been made, but local surveys have shown levels varying between 16% and 80%. A 2012 survey of 445 purebred pet cats and 45 shelter cats in Finland found an overall seroprevalence of 48.4%, while a 2010 survey of feral cats from Giza, Egypt found a seroprevalence rate of 97.4%. Another survey from Colombia recorded seroprevalence of 89.3%, whereas a Chinese (Guangdong) study found just a 2.1% prevalence.\n\"T. gondii\" infection rates in domestic cats vary widely depending on the cats' diets and lifestyles. Feral cats that hunt for their food are more likely to be infected than domestic cats, and naturally also depends on the prevalence of \"T.\u00a0gondii\"-infected prey such as birds and small mammals.\nMost infected cats will shed oocysts in their feces only once in their lifetime, typically for 3\u201310 days after infection. This shedding can release millions of oocysts, each capable of spreading and surviving for months. After infection, most cats will develop antibodies to \"T. gondii\" and will no longer shed oocysts. An estimated 1% of cats at any given time are actively shedding oocysts.\nIt is difficult to control the cat population with the infected oocysts due to the lack of an approved vaccine. This remains a challenge in most cases, and the programs that are readily available are questionable in efficacy. Research into feline vaccines for toxoplasmosis is ongoing, with several candidates showing positive results in clinical trials.\nCurrent methods of control of \"T. gondii\" in cats typically rely on preventing them from hunting (where they might acquire the parasite), not allowing the cat to consume raw meat, and maintaining good hygiene around litter boxes to minimize environmental oocyst contamination.\nRodents.\nInfection with \"T. gondii\" has been shown to alter the behavior of mice and rats in ways thought to increase the rodents' chances of being preyed upon by cats. Infected rodents show a reduction in their innate aversion to cat odors; while uninfected mice and rats will generally avoid areas marked with cat urine or with cat body odor, this avoidance is reduced or eliminated in infected animals. Moreover, some evidence suggests this loss of aversion may be specific to feline odors: when given a choice between two predator odors (cat or mink), infected rodents show a significantly stronger preference to cat odors than do uninfected controls.\nIn rodents, \"T.\u00a0gondii\"\u2013induced behavioral changes occur through epigenetic remodeling in neurons associated with observed behaviors; for example, it modifies epigenetic methylation to induce hypomethylation of arginine vasopressin-related genes in the medial amygdala to greatly decrease predator aversion. Similar epigenetically induced behavioral changes have also been observed in mouse models of addiction, where changes in the expression of histone-modifying enzymes via gene knockout or enzyme inhibition in specific neurons produced alterations in drug-related behaviors. Widespread histone\u2013lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by \"T.\u00a0gondii\".\n\"T. gondii\"-infected rodents show a number of behavioral changes beyond altered responses to cat odors. Rats infected with the parasite show increased levels of activity and decreased neophobic behavior. Similarly, infected mice show alterations in patterns of locomotion and exploratory behavior during experimental tests. These patterns include traveling greater distances, moving at higher speeds, accelerating for longer periods of time, and showing a decreased pause-time when placed in new arenas. Infected rodents have also been shown to have lower anxiety, using traditional models such as elevated plus mazes, open field arenas, and social interaction tests.\nMarine mammals.\nA University of California, Davis study of dead sea otters collected from 1998 to 2004 found toxoplasmosis was the cause of death for 13% of the animals. Proximity to freshwater outflows into the ocean was a major risk factor. Ingestion of oocysts from cat feces is considered to be the most likely ultimate source. Surface runoff containing wild cat feces and litter from domestic cats flushed down toilets are possible sources of oocysts. These same sources may have also introduced the toxoplasmosis infection to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal. Infection with the parasite has contributed to the death of at least four Hawaiian monk seals. A Hawaiian monk seal's infection with \"T.\u00a0gondii\" was first noted in 2004. The parasite's spread threatens the recovery of this highly endangered pinniped. The parasites have been found in numerous cetacean species, such as the bottlenose dolphin, spinner dolphin, Risso's dolphin, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, striped dolphin, the beluga whale, and the critically endangered M\u0101ui dolphin and Hector's dolphin. A 2011 study of 161 Pacific Northwest marine mammals ranging from a sperm whale to harbor porpoises that had either become stranded or died found that 42 percent tested positive for both \"T. gondii\" and \"S. neurona\". Researchers Black and Massie believe anchovies, which travel from estuaries into the open ocean, may be helping to spread the disease.\nGiant panda.\n\"Toxoplasma gondii\" has been reported as the cause of death of a giant panda kept in a zoo in China, who died in 2014 of acute gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. Although seemingly anecdotal, this report emphasizes that all warm-blooded species are likely to be infected by \"T.\u00a0gondii\", including endangered species such as the giant panda.\nResearch.\nChronic infection with \"T.\u00a0gondii\" has traditionally been considered asymptomatic in people with normal immune function. Some evidence suggests latent infection may subtly influence a range of human behaviors and tendencies, and infection may alter the susceptibility to or intensity of a number of psychiatric or neurological disorders.\nIn most of the current studies where positive correlations have been found between \"T.\u00a0gondii\" antibody titers and certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders, \"T.\u00a0gondii\" seropositivity tests are conducted after the onset of the examined disease or behavioral trait; that is, it is often unclear whether infection with the parasite increases the chances of having a certain trait or disorder, or if having a certain trait or disorder increases the chances of becoming infected with the parasite. Groups of individuals with certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders may share certain behavioral tendencies that increase the likelihood of exposure to and infection with \"T.\u00a0gondii\"; as a result, it is difficult to confirm causal relationships between \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infections and associated neurological disorders or behavioral traits.\nMental health.\nSome evidence links \"T.\u00a0gondii\" to schizophrenia. Two 2012 meta-analyses found that the rates of antibodies to \"T.\u00a0gondii\" in people with schizophrenia were 2.7 times higher than in controls. \"T.\u00a0gondii\" antibody positivity was therefore considered an intermediate risk factor in relation to other known risk factors. Cautions noted include that the antibody tests do not detect toxoplasmosis directly, most people with schizophrenia do not have antibodies for toxoplasmosis, and publication bias might exist. While the majority of these studies tested people already diagnosed with schizophrenia for \"T.\u00a0gondii\" antibodies, associations between \"T.\u00a0gondii\" and schizophrenia have been found prior to the onset of schizophrenia symptoms. Sex differences in the age of schizophrenia onset may be explained in part by a second peak of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection incidence during ages 25\u201330 in females only. Although a mechanism supporting the association between schizophrenia and \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection is unclear, studies have investigated a molecular basis of this correlation. Antipsychotic drugs used in schizophrenia appear to inhibit the replication of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" tachyzoites in cell culture. Supposing a causal link exists between \"T.\u00a0gondii\" and schizophrenia, studies have yet to determine why only some individuals with latent toxoplasmosis develop schizophrenia; some plausible explanations include differing genetic susceptibility, parasite strain differences, and differences in the route of the acquired \"T.\u00a0gondii\" infection.\nCorrelations have also been found between antibody titers to \"T.\u00a0gondii\" and OCD, as well as suicide among people with mood disorders including bipolar disorder. Positive antibody titers to \"T.\u00a0gondii\" appear to be uncorrelated with major depression or dysthymia. Although there is a correlation between \"T.\u00a0gondii\" and many psychological disorders, the underlying mechanism is unclear. A 2016 study of 236 persons with high levels of toxoplasmosis antibodies found that \"there was little evidence that \"T.\u00a0gondii\" was related to increased risk of psychiatric disorder, poor impulse control, personality aberrations or neurocognitive impairment\".\nNeurological disorders.\nLatent infection has been linked to Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.\nIndividuals with multiple sclerosis show infection rates around 15% lower than the general public.\nTraffic accidents.\nLatent \"T. gondii\" infection in humans has been associated with a higher risk of automobile accidents, potentially due to impaired psychomotor performance or enhanced risk-taking personality profiles.\nClimate change.\nClimate change has been reported to affect the occurrence, survival, distribution and transmission of \"T.\u00a0gondii\". \"T.\u00a0gondii\" has been identified in the Canadian arctic, a location that was once too cold for its survival. Higher temperatures increase the survival time of \"T.\u00a0gondii\". More snowmelt and precipitation can increase the amount of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" oocysts that are transported via river flow. Shifts in bird, rodent, and insect populations and migration patterns can impact the distribution of \"T.\u00a0gondii\" due to their role as reservoir and vector. Urbanization and natural environmental degradation are also suggested to affect \"T.\u00a0gondii\" transmission and increase risk of infection.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n* Parts of this article are taken from the public domain https://"}

It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.\nThe earliest folk metal bands were Skyclad from England and Cruachan from Ireland. Skyclad's debut album \"The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth\" was released in 1991 and would be considered a thrash metal album with some folk influences, unlike Cruachan\u2019s early work which embraced the folk element as a defining part of their sound. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe and beyond. Among these early groups, the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow.\nThe music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music. A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line-ups. A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments. Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with fantasy, mythology, paganism, history and nature.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt was always my heartfelt dream to see the energy of Metal music mixed with elements from more traditional styles.\nMartin Walkyier, former vocalist for Skyclad\nThe English band Skyclad was formed in 1990 after vocalist Martin Walkyier left his previous band, the thrash metal group Sabbat. Skyclad began as a thrash metal band but added violins from session musician Mike Evans on several tracks from their debut album, \"The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth\", an effort described by Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic as \"ambitious\" and \"groundbreaking.\" The song \"The Widdershins Jig\" from the debut album has been acclaimed as \"particularly significant\" and \"a certain first in the realms of Metal\". With a full-time fiddler in their lineup, the band's second album feature a \"now legendary folky jig style\" and \"more prominent inclusion of the fiddle playing lead lines and melodies normally associated with the lead guitar parts of most other rock bands.\"\nEven with the departure of Martin Walkyier in 2001, Skyclad remains an active folk metal group today after nearly two decades since their formation. In contrast, the Portuguese band Moonspell had a brief tenure in the genre. Their first release was the 1994 \"Under the Moonspell\" EP with music that featured Lusitanian folk and Medieval influences. With the release of their debut album \"Wolfheart\" in the following year, the band made a transition into gothic metal and within a matter of years \"quickly evolved into one of the major players of the European goth-metal scene.\"\nCruachan were formed in 1992 in Dublin, Ireland. From the outset their intention was to mix the native Irish folk music of their home country with the more extreme side of metal music. Their debut album \"Tuatha Na Gael\" was released in 1995 and was a full folk metal album from start to finish. In the Italian book \"Folk Metal, Dalle origini al Ragnar\u00f6k\", a comprehensive history of the genre, author Fabrizio Giosu\u00e8 credits Cruachan as being the very first real folk metal band. He acknowledges that Skyclad did have some folk parts in some songs before Cruachan however he goes on to say Cruachan used folk music as much as they used heavy metal music. Cruachan also used arrangements of known folk songs and melodies, Skyclad wrote folk \"sounding\" parts.\nSpanish band M\u00e4go de Oz was among early folk metal artists that were influenced by the Celtic folk music. The band introduced folk elements and instruments in their power metal-based music from their 1994 debut album. Another early developer of folk metal is the Finnish group Amorphis. They formed in 1990 with their debut album, \"The Karelian Isthmus\", following two years later. Their sophomore effort \"Tales from the Thousand Lakes\" was released in 1994 with \"plenty of fascinating melodies and song structures that drew heavily from the traditional folk music of their native country.\" The album received a favorable reception from fans with \"its content quickly being exalted across the metal underground as perhaps the very pinnacle of atmospheric death metal achievement.\"\nRegional variations.\nMedieval metal.\nThe German band Subway to Sally was formed in 1992 as a folk rock band, singing in English and incorporating Irish and Scottish influences in their music. With their second album \"MCMXCV\" released in 1995, the band adopted a \"more traditional approach\" and started singing in German. Taking Skyclad as an influence, Subway to Sally performs a blend of hard rock and heavy metal \"enriched with medieval melodies enmeshed in the songs via bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, lute, mandoline, shalm [\"sic\"], fiddle and flute\" and combined with \"romantic-symbolic German-speaking poetry\" in their lyrics. With chart success in their native Germany, they have since been credited as the band \"that set off the wave of what is known as medieval rock.\"\nThis distinctly German phenomenon has been continued and expanded further by subsequent bands. Formed in 1996, the Berlin based In Extremo has also found chart success with their \"medieval style stage garb and unashamed usage of such bizarre, sometimes hand made, instruments as the Scottish bagpipes.\" Another band that has experienced commercial success in Germany is the Bavarian outfit Schandmaul. Describing themselves as the \"minstrels of today,\" the band employs a musical arsenal that includes the bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, shawm, violin and mandolin.\nCeltic metal.\nThe Irish band Cruachan was formed in 1992 by guitarist Keith Fay with their first demo recording distributed in 1993. Drawing inspiration from Skyclad's first album, Fay set out to combine black metal with the folk music of Ireland. Their debut album \"Tuatha Na Gael\" was released in 1995 and the band has since been acclaimed as having \"gone the greatest lengths of anyone in their attempts to expand\" the genre of folk metal. Cruachan's combination of Celtic music and heavy metal is known today as Celtic metal.\nParallel to Cruachan, the black metal act Primordial also released a demo recording in 1993 and \"found themselves heralded as frontrunners in the burgeoning second-wave black metal movement.\" Irish music plays \"a very big role\" in Primordial but in \"a dark and subtle way\" through the chords and timings. The band has since \"established themselves as one of the most unique sounding bands in the folk-meets-black metal field.\" Other early representatives of Celtic metal include the bands Geasa, M\u00e4go de Oz and Waylander with both groups releasing a demo recording in 1995.\nOriental metal.\nThe Israeli progressive metal band Orphaned Land was formed in 1991 and released the demo \"The Beloved's Cry\" in 1993, \"immediately creating a media stir\" that \"quickly drew attention to their unorthodox style.\" The music of Orphaned Land \"borrow[s] heavily from Middle Eastern music styles\" with traditional elements coming from both Jewish and Arabic folk music. Acclaimed as \"one of the world's most unique and trailblazing heavy metal bands,\" Orphaned Land's style of music has since been dubbed \"oriental metal\".\nMelechesh formed in Jerusalem in 1995, becoming \"undoubtedly the first overtly anti-Christian band to exist in one of the holiest cities in the world.\" Melechesh began as a straightforward black metal act with their first foray into folk metal occurring on the title track of their 1996 EP \"The Siege of Lachish\". Their subsequent albums saw the group straddling the boundaries between black, death, and thrash metal, with \"impressive, tastefully rendered epics chock-full of superb riffs, Middle Eastern melodies, and vocal exchanges varying from a throaty midrange screech to chanting.\" Other oriental metal acts emerged thereafter with the band Distorted emerging in 1996 as the first female-fronted metal act from Israel.\nAdditional oriental metal bands emerged form the Middle East in the 2000s, such as Myrath from Tunisia, who mix Middle Eastern and Arabic melodies with power metal and progressive rock. The Kordz from Lebanon combine Middle Eastern instrumentation with politicized lyrics. and Andaz Uzzal from Algeria combine that region's traditional music forms with heavy metal. Egypt's Massive Scar Era includes several female members, who have reported harassment due to their participation in heavy metal music.\nDevelopment.\nFrom the middle of the 1990s, other bands gradually emerged to combine heavy metal with folk music. Storm was a short lived Norwegian supergroup with Fenriz, Satyr and Kari Ruesl\u00e5tten from the black metal groups Darkthrone, Satyricon and the doom metal band The 3rd and the Mortal respectively. Their only album \"Nordavind\" was released in 1995 with the use of keyboards to imitate the sound of folk instruments. The Germans Empyrium also relied on synthesizers and guitars to deliver their \"dark folklore\" black metal music with the release of their 1996 debut album \"A Wintersunset...\"\nThe year 1996 also saw the debut album of the \"one-man black metal project of multi-instrumentalist Vratyas Vakyas\" from Germany known as Falkenbach. Even though Falkenbach was formed as early as 1989, the band didn't get much attention until the debut, that includes epic music that is \"rife with keyboards, Viking themes, and folk music tendencies,\" Falkenbach was effectively a merge of Viking metal with folk metal. They were joined in the next two years by other bands combining the two genres including Windir, M\u00e5negarm and Thyrfing.\nPredating most folk metal groups, the Spanish band M\u00e4go de Oz was formed as far back as 1989 with a self-titled debut album, released in 1994. With nine members in their lineup, including a violinist and flutist, the band has evolved over the years into a combination of power metal and Celtic flavored folk metal. They have experienced strong chart success in their native Spain as well as in South America and Mexico.\nSlough Feg from Pennsylvania, United States also had an early formation dating back to 1990. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1996 and the band has pursued a \"unique style of combining traditional/power metal with folk metal.\"\nThe Czech band Silent Stream of Godless Elegy had formed in 1995 as a doom metal band \"laced with Pagan imagery and adventurous enough to include violins and cellos alongside the expected modern day arsenal.\" With the release of their second album \"Behind the Shadows\" in 1998, the band began to use \"folklore influences\" in their music.\nExplosion.\nThe folk metal genre has dramatically expanded with the turn of the new millennium. At the forefront of this explosion, with a \"revolutionary clash of tradition and amplification that set them apart\", is a group from Finland known as Finntroll. The band was formed in 1997 with a demo recorded the following year and a debut album \"Midnattens widunder\" released in 1999. They have since developed a reputation for being \"obsessed with all things trollish.\" Their lyrics are sung exclusively in Swedish instead of the Finnish language \"apparently because this language was better to evoke the trollish spirit\", even though the real reason for this lies in the band's original vocalist belonging to the Swedish-speaking minority. The music of Finntroll features a \"real innovation\" in the marriage of black metal music with a style of Finnish polka called humppa. Specifically, the band took from humppa \"the alternate picking bass lines accompanied with the drumbeat, and the use of accordion.\" This unlikely mix of polka and extreme metal has received a mixed reception from critics. Andy Hinds of AllMusic laments the polka influence as undermining \"the intended threat of a death metal band\" while his colleague Alex Henderson praises the band for their \"solid, consistently likable effort,\" declaring that Finntroll has set themselves apart from their peers \"because of their emphasis on Finnish humppa\" and \"the humor and irony they bring to the table.\"\nFinntroll's second album \"Jaktens tid\" was released in 2001 and became a chart success in their native Finland. Some of the songs on the album feature vocals performed by Jonne J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 of Korpiklaani, another band from Finland. While other folk metal bands began with metal before adding folk music, Korpiklaani started with folk music before turning metal. The roots of Korpiklaani can be traced back to a Sami folk music group under the name of Shamaani Duo, an \"in house restaurant band\" created in 1993. An album of folk music was released under this name before Jonne J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 relocated and formed a new band, Shaman. The folk metal act Shaman was based on the folk music of Shamaani Duo. Two albums were released in 1999 and 2001 before Shaman changed their name to Korpiklaani. The change in name was accompanied by a change in the music. The traditional yoik vocals and the use of the Northern S\u00e1mi language were dropped while the synthesizer was replaced with real folk instruments. Jonne J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 credits his work with Finntroll as the catalyst for the shift in emphasis from folk to metal.\nWhile Korpiklaani used an assortment of traditional instruments to deliver their folk metal, Finntroll relies on keyboards for Finnish folk melodies played in the humppa style. The keyboards in Finntroll are performed by Henri Sorvali who also performs in Moonsorrow, another folk metal band from Finland that he formed with his cousin Ville Sorvali in 1995. They released two demos, the first in 1997 and another in 1999, before the 2001 debut album \"Suden Uni\". Moonsorrow blends folk metal with Viking metal by incorporating \"Finland's traditional folk music forms into elaborate symphonic arrangements typical of Viking metal outfits such as Bathory and Enslaved.\" The adoption of folk elements was \"becoming all the rage\" in Finland by this point and other folk metal bands from Finland that began to emerge in the early 2000s included Cadacross, Ensiferum and later on Turisas and Wintersun. Ensiferum notably found themselves at the top of the Finnish charts with their 2007 single \"One More Magic Potion\". Finntroll, Korpiklaani, Moonsorrow and Turisas have all experienced chart success in their native Finland as well.\nThere are also folk metal acts from the other nordic countries. Icelandic group Sk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld is a notable example. The Norwegian act Glittertind was A-listed and played with the highest playing frequency on Norway's most popular radio channel NRK P1 with the song \"Kvilelaus\" (eng. Restless)\" and performed the song on Lindmo when they released their first full-length as a full band. Other Norwegian acts include the aforementioned Storm and Windir as well as more recent groups such as Kampfar, Lumsk, \u00c1smegin and Trollfest. Bands from Sweden include the aforementioned Thyrfing and M\u00e5negarm along with other acts such as Otyg and Vintersorg. Folk metal bands from Denmark include Wuthering Heights, Svartsot, Huldre and the Faroe Islanders T\u00fdr.\nOutside Scandinavia, other European nations have contributed to the growing genre. Groups from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania includes Metsat\u00f6ll, Raud-Ants, Skyforger and Varang Nord while representatives from Russia include Alkonost, Arkona and Butterfly Temple. More isolated examples across Europe include Dimmi Argus and Balkandji from Bulgaria, Equilibrium and Finsterforst from Germany, Dalriada from Hungary, Ithilien from Belgium, Cruadalach from the Czech Republic, Litvintroll from Belarus, Nightcreepers from France, Zaria from Slovenia, M\u00e4go de Oz and Saurom from Spain, Elvenking from Italy and Eluveitie from Switzerland.\nFolkearth is an international folk metal project with members from several different European countries. At its inception, the project consisted of 14 musicians from separate backgrounds in folk and metal music. With their second album \"By the Sword of My Father\" released in 2006, the project boasted the participation of 31 musicians.\nBeyond the European continent, folk metal is relatively rare with only a few known acts including the aforementioned The Lord Weird Slough Feg and their fellow Americans Agalloch. The latter's music \"made for a stark geographical anomaly, since its eclectic, avant-garde folk-metal was the sort of thing one would expect to emerge from Scandinavia -- not Portland, Oregon.\" Tuatha de Danann is another geographical anomaly with their Celtic metal from Brazil.\nCharacteristics.\nMusic.\nThe music of folk metal is a diverse collection with bands pursuing different subgenres of heavy metal music. While bands like Primordial and Finntroll perform black metal, other groups such as The Lord Weird Slough Feg ply their trade with a more traditional or power metal base. The German-Norwegian group Midnattsol blends the genre with gothic metal. Progressive tendencies can be found among some bands including Elvenking, Lumsk and T\u00fdr. Some bands are known to adopt more than one different styles of heavy metal. Orphaned Land combines folk metal with progressive and doom/death metal. The band formed in 1991, also combining Jewish, Arabic, and other West Asian influences while Ensiferum mix folk music on top of a power and death metal hybrid. A few groups are also known to incorporate the styles of other music genres outside of heavy metal. Examples include the punk rock in the music of Glittertind and the neofolk and post-rock tendencies of Agalloch.\nThe folk elements in the genre often reflect the ethnic background of the musicians as is the case for the Finnic folk music in Finntroll, Korpiklaani, and Metsat\u00f6ll, the Baltic folk music in Skyforger, East Asian influences such as Chthonic's use of Taiwanese folk music or Tengger Cavalry's incorporation of Mongolian throat singing, or the Middle Eastern background of Orphaned Land. However, some bands defy the geographical and ethnical background, like Ymyrgar, who hail from Tunisia but chose to focus on Norse mythology.\nCeltic music can be found among such Irish groups as Cruachan and Waylander as well as bands outside Ireland like Ithilien from Belgium, Eluveitie (although Switzerland can be considered a country with a Celtic history), and Tuatha de Danann (from Brazil, a country that has no cultural ties with the Celts whatsoever, despite the similarity of the country's name to an island in Irish myth). Folk music from multiple regions are employed by some groups like Elvenking, Ithilien and Ensiferum.\nThe genre also offers a variety of atmosphere and moods. A fun and cheerful nature is characteristic of groups like Finntroll and Korpiklaani. Both bands are also noted for playing music that one can dance to. In contrast, other acts such as Thyrfing and Primordial are known for their contemplative atmosphere. Lumsk offers a more mellow style while Agalloch are known for their \"depressive ambient\" sound.\nAn epic atmosphere is characteristic of some folk metal bands like Primordial, Moonsorrow, Turisas and the music project Folkearth. Groups like Ensiferum and Wintersun are known to have a melodious side while bands that favor a more blistering or brutal approach can be found in groups like Finntroll and M\u00e5negarm.\nInstruments.\nFolk metal feature the same typical instruments found in heavy metal music: guitars, bass, drums and vocalist. While a few folk metal groups like Tharaphita discard \"any notion of utilising folk instrumentation\" and \"rely solely on traditional metal instruments,\" bands in the genre generally rely on folk instruments that range from the common to the exotic. Numerous folk metal acts include a dedicated violinist in their line up. This includes Skyclad, Subway to Sally, Schandmaul, M\u00e4go de Oz, Ithilien, Silent Stream of Godless Elegy, Korpiklaani, Lumsk, Elvenking, Eluveitie and Tuatha de Danann. The tin whistle and flute can be found in such Celtic metal bands as Cruachan, Waylander, Ithilien and Eluveitie. The flute can also be found in other bands such as Metsat\u00f6ll, Schandmaul and Morgenstern. Medieval bagpipes are used in bands like Folkstone and In Extremo. Some bands are also known to highlight more exotic instruments from their ethnic background or country, including Skyforger's use of the Latvian kokles, Metsat\u00f6ll's use of the Estonian torupill, Korpiklaani's use of the Finnish kantele, Eluveitie and Ithilien's use of the hurdy-gurdy, and Orphaned Land's use of the oud and saz.\nIn the absence of folk instruments, other bands in the genre resort to using keyboards to replicate the sound of folk instruments. This includes the aforementioned Storm, Empyrium and Finntroll as well as other acts like Midnattsol. Bands that supplement a folk instrument like the violin with keyboards include Skyclad, M\u00e4go de Oz, and Tuatha de Danann.\nThe large number of instruments that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances. While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel, they have to rely on a computer to replicate the roles of the guest musicians for concerts elsewhere. Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts. This includes Folkearth, and Falkenbach. Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently, it is not uncommon to find bands in the genre featuring six or more members in their line-up. Some of the sextets in the genre are Schandmaul, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Midnattsol, while septets include Ithilien, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, and Lumsk. Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of M\u00e4go de Oz totals nine performers. Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments, they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound. As an example, Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band's seven members on their debut album \"\u00c5smund Fr\u00e6gdegjevar\". At times, guest musicians are known to become full-fledged members of the band, as was the case in Skyforger and Turisas.\nVocals.\nThe diverse range of music styles and instruments is matched by a variety of vocal styles in the genre. From the \"spine-chilling death shrieks\" in Finntroll to the black metal rasps of Skyforger or Moonsorrow, there is no shortage of extreme vocals in folk metal. Other bands to feature extreme vocals include Cadacross, Ensiferum, Ithilien and Equilibrium. In contrast, bands like M\u00e4go de Oz and Metsat\u00f6ll are known to feature \"clean\" singing in line with their more traditional metal approach. Numerous other bands in the genre are known to feature both extreme vocals and clean singing. This includes Primordial, Turisas, Windir and Wintersun.\nTraditional folk singing can also be found among some folk metal bands. The yoik vocals of Jonne J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 have been featured in varying degrees in the music of Shaman, Finntroll and Korpiklaani. Folk singing or folk-inspired singing can also be heard in the music of Equilibrium, Metsat\u00f6ll, Skyforger and Orphaned Land. The music of Orphaned Land also features the use of chants and choirs, commonly encountered in the genre of folk metal. Bands that are known to use a choir include Arkona, Turisas, Lumsk and Eluveitie, while chants can be found in the music of T\u00fdr and Windir. Some bands like Falconer and Thyrfing are also known to feature \"yo-ho-ho folk melodies\" in their vocals to suit their Viking metal style.\nOrphaned Land mostly uses English lyrics, but they are known to feature other languages as they \"go well with the music and also sound more exotic and unique.\" T\u00fdr has also been known to use multiple languages in their music. Other bands in the genre are known to sing exclusively or almost entirely in their native language, including M\u00e4go de Oz in Spanish, Moonsorrow in Finnish, Metsat\u00f6ll in Estonian and Lumsk in Norwegian. Bands in the medieval metal subgenre also tend to sing largely or entirely in their German language, including Subway to Sally, Morgenstern and Letzte Instanz.\nLead female singers are not uncommon in the genre and can be found in Cruachan, Otyg, Lumsk, Arkona, Celtian and Midnattsol. Other groups like Orphaned Land and Elvenking have employed guest female vocalists in their music.\nLyrics.\nPopular subjects in folk metal include paganism, nature, fantasy, mythology and history.\nFolk metal has been associated with paganism ever since its inception, when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad, in part because the band \"wasn't going to go far enough down the pagan, British way that we wanted to do it.\" Consequently, the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters. The band Cruachan was also founded by a self-described pagan, Keith Fay. For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow, the label \"pagan metal\" is preferred \"because that describes the ideological points in the music, but doesn\u2019t say anything about the music itself.\" Other bands that also prefer to use the term \"pagan metal\" as a self-description include Cruachan, Eluveitie, Obtest and Skyforger. In contrast to bands with pagan themes, some folk metal bands such as Orphaned Land have themes of Abrahamic religion.\nNature is a strong influence to many folk metal bands. Groups such as Korpiklaani, Elvenking, Midnattsol and Vintersorg have all based lyrics on the subject. For the band Agalloch, nature is an embraced theme \"because we are siding with what is essentially the victim in a relationship where humankind is a disease.\" All the members of Skyclad are supporters of \"organisations like Greenpeace and others, for those are the ones who stand up and take on the battle\" between \"people who want to save the planet, and people who want to destroy it.\"\nThe pioneers of the genre Skyclad avoided fantasy lyrics because \"there was already enough fantasy in the world, told to us by our politicians every day.\" Nonetheless, other folk metal bands have been known to feature fantasy themes in their lyrics including Ensiferum, Midnattsol and Cruachan. For Elvenking, fantasy themes are used \"as a metaphor to cover deeper meanings.\" Similarly, the fantasy themes in Turisas belie the coverage of issues \"that are deeper and have greater significance.\"\nThe Celtic metal subgenre is known to feature lyrics based on Celtic mythology. The history of the Celts is another popular source for the lyrics of Celtic metal bands like Cruachan, Eluveitie, Primordial and Mael M\u00f3rdha. Norse mythology can be found in the lyrics of such Scandinavian bands as Falkenbach, T\u00fdr, Finntroll and Mithotyn. Skyforger is known for featuring lyrics based on both the history and mythology of their Latvian culture. Other bands that have treated history to song include Falconer and Slechtvalk.\n Many National Socialist black metal (NSBM) bands like Nokturnal Mortum, or Russia's Temnozor and Kroda have been known to cross over into folk metal, a circumstance that Ciaran O'Hagan, the vocalist of Waylander, views as \"an insult to people like myself who don\u2019t hold with fascist ideals at all.\" He further suggests that the NSBM bands are playing folk metal \"for all the wrong reasons.\" Due to the misappropriation of pagan symbols by Neo-Nazism, several folk metal bands have also been mistaken for being part of the NSBM scene. Consequently, such bands as Cruachan, Skyforger, M\u00e5negarm and T\u00fdr have had to disassociate themselves with Nazism, fascism or racism. Skyforger went as far as to add the words 'No Nazi Stuff Here!' on the back of their album covers. In April 2008, performers on the folk metal festival Paganfest were subject to accusations of being Nazis, racists and fascists from the German Antifa. Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow and Heri Joensen of T\u00fdr issued a joint video statement to refute these accusations, noting that \"one of the biggest issues seems to be that we use ancient Scandinavian symbols in our imagery like the S in the Moonsorrow logo and the T in the T\u00fdr logo [even though] that is how the S and the T runes have been written for thousands of years.\" Moonsorrow has also issued a written statement in response to the controversy while T\u00fdr notes on their official website that they \"got the idea for the rune logo\" from the Black Sabbath album of the same name. On the other side of the political landscape, some folk metal bands have uttered explicit socialist sentiments. For example the aforementioned Glittertind made a leftist statement against neoliberalism in their album booklet when re-releasing the record \"Til Dovre Faller\" on Napalm Records in May 2009.\nThe original folk metal band Skyclad was also known to deal with serious political subjects but through lyrics that were littered with puns and humor. Other bands have continued to feature fun and humorous lyrics. This includes Finntroll with their obsession on trolls. The lyrics of Korpiklaani also \"focused on having a good time, drinking [and] partying.\" In a review of Turisas' \"The Varangian Way\" album, James Christopher Monger of Allmusic commented that some listeners might be put off by \"the concept of grown men in pelts\" singing such lyrics as \"come with us to the south, write your name on our roll.\" Heri Joensen of T\u00fdr contends that a listener needs to be confident in his masculinity to listen to such traditional Faeroese lyrics as his own \"young lads, happy lads, step upon the floor, dance merrily.\"\nUnlike any other, the Belgian folk metal band Ithilien preferred to focus their lyrics on very personal subjects such as loss, perseverance or grief. The album Shaping the Soul is for example constructed based on Elisabeth Kubler-Ross model of the mourning process.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the latter part of the 19th century, people started to grow citrus trees. Citrus was introduced by Melton Haynes. Throughout the 1940s and 50s, citrus production increased and grew into the area's leading industry. The December 1989 United States cold wave destroyed most of the citrus groves, dealing an economic blow from which many growers could not recover.

{"id": "73609", "revid": "745492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73609", "title": "Worcester Cathedral", "text": "Church of England cathedral in Worcester, Worcestershire, England\nWorcester Cathedral, formally the Cathedral Church of Christ and Blessed Mary the Virgin, is a Church of England cathedral in Worcester, England. The cathedral is the seat of the bishop of Worcester and is the mother church of the diocese of Worcester; it is administered by its dean and chapter. The cathedral is a grade I listed building and part of a scheduled monument.\nThe cathedral was founded in 680. The earliest surviving fabric dates from 1084, when the cathedral was rebuilt in the Romanesque style by Bishop Wulfstan. The chapter house dates from 1120, and the nave was extended in the 1170s. Between 1224 and 1269 the east end was rebuilt in the Early English Gothic style. The remainder of the nave was rebuilt in the 1360s, and the \"exquisite\" central tower completed in 1374. The cathedral retains a set of medieval misericords, now set into Victorian choir stalls; the cathedral was heavily restored in the nineteenth century, and contains a set of furnishings by George Gilbert Scott. It contains several funerary monuments, including those of King John; Arthur, Prince of Wales; and the prime minister Stanley Baldwin.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe cathedral was founded in 680, with a Northumbrian priest, Tatwine, appointed as its first bishop. Tatwine died before he could be consecrated, however, so his successor Bishop Bosel may be regarded as Worcester's first serving bishop. The first cathedral church, dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was built in this period, but no remains of its architecture survive. The crypt of the present-day cathedral dates from the 11th century and the time of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester.\nThe community associated with the cathedral in the early eighth century included members of various clerical orders. The cathedral community was regulated along formal monastic lines as a consequence of the Benedictine reforms in the second half of the tenth century (one author gives the time range 974\u2013977; another considers 969 more likely). There is an important connection with Fleury Abbey in France, as Oswald, bishop of Worcester from 961 to 992, was professed at Fleury and introduced the monastic rule of Fleury to the monastery that he established at Worcester around the year 966, which was dedicated \u2013 as the present cathedral church is \u2013 to St. Mary.\nMedieval.\nWulfstan, bishop of Worcester, was the last surviving Anglo-Saxon bishop, living until 1095. He was later made a saint. The cathedral is the burial place of King John, who died in 1216.\nThe cathedral priory, one of a number of religious institutions in the city, was a major landowner and economic force, in both Worcester and the county. Its properties included the priory manor of Bromsgrove. It was a centre of learning, providing schooling, and was associated with hospitals. The Church received a portion of local taxations, and administered ecclesiastical law as applied to Christian morals, which could result in punishments. It had close political associations with leading gentry and aristocracy. It thus had a central role in the medieval life of the city and county.\nRelations with the Jewish community of Worcester.\nThe Diocese was notably hostile to the small Jewish community in Worcester. Peter of Blois was commissioned by a Bishop of Worcester, probably John of Coutances, to write a significant anti-Judaic treatise \"Against the Perfidy of Jews\" around 1190. William de Blois, as Bishop of Worcester, imposed particularly strict rules on Jews within the diocese in 1219. As elsewhere in England, Jews were officially compelled to wear rectangular white badges, supposedly representing tabulae. In most places, this requirement was waived as long as fines were paid. In addition to enforcing the church laws on wearing badges, Blois tried to impose additional restrictions on usury, and wrote to Pope Gregory IX in 1229 to ask for better enforcement and further, harsher measures. In response, the Papacy demanded that Christians be prevented from working in Jewish homes, \"lest temporal profit be preferred to the zeal of Christ\", and insisted on enforcement of the wearing of badges.\nDissolution and Reformation.\nThe priory came to an end with King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. Shortly beforehand, in 1535, the prior William More resigned, and was replaced by Henry Holbeach. More had a reputation for fine living, although his standards seem in line with other senior ecclesiasts of the time. However, there certainly were problems with the administration of the priory, including divisions within the community.\nThe Protestant Hugh Latimer was bishop from 1535, and preached for reform and iconoclasm. He resigned as bishop in 1539, as a result of a theological turn by Henry VIII towards Roman Catholicism, in the Six Articles. John Bell, a moderate reformer, was bishop from 1539 to 1543, during the period of the priory's dissolution.\nIn the early 16th century, Worcester had around 40 monks. This declined slightly in the years immediately before 1540, as recruitment seems to have halted. There were 35 Benedictine monks plus the Prior Holbeach at the time of dissolution, probably 16 January 1540; eleven were immediately given pensions, while the remainder became secular canons in the new Royal College. Holbeach was re-appointed as the first Dean. A further five former monks were pensioned from the college in July 1540.\nThe former monastic library of Worcester contained a considerable number of manuscripts which are now scattered over, among other libraries, Cambridge, London (British Library), Oxford (Bodleian), and the Cathedral library at Worcester of today. Remains of the priory dating from the 12th and 13th centuries can still be seen.\nJohn Bell's successor as bishop, Nicholas Heath, was religiously much more conservative and Catholic.\nCivil War.\nDuring the Civil War, the cathedral was used to store arms, possibly as early as September 1642. Worcester declared itself for the Crown and was quickly occupied by extra Royalist forces, who were using the building to store munitions when the Earl of Essex briefly retook the city after a skirmish on its outskirts. The Parliamentary troops then ransacked the Cathedral building. Stained glass was smashed and the organ destroyed, along with library books and monuments.\nThe See was abolished during the Commonwealth and the Protectorate, approximately 1646\u20131660. The bell tower was demolished in 1647 and the building used as a prison in the aftermath of the 1651 battle.\nVictorian to present.\nIn the 1860s, the cathedral was subject to major restoration work planned by Sir George Gilbert Scott and A. E. Perkins.\nAn image of the cathedral's west facade appeared on the reverse of the Series E British \u00a320 note commemorating Sir Edward Elgar, issued between 1999 and 2007, remaining in circulation as legal tender until 30 June 2010.\nArchitecture.\nWorcester Cathedral embodies many features that are highly typical of an English medieval cathedral. Like the cathedrals of Salisbury and Lincoln, it has two transepts crossing the nave, rather than the single transept usual on the Continent. This feature of English cathedrals was to facilitate the private saying of the Holy Office by many clergy or monks. Worcester is also typical of English cathedrals in having a chapter house and cloister. To the north side of the cathedral is an entrance porch, a feature designed to eliminate the draught which, prior to the installation of modern swing doors, would blow through cathedrals whenever the western doors were open.\nThere are important parts of the building dating from every century from the 11th to the 16th. Its tower in the perpendicular style is described by Alec Clifton-Taylor as \"exquisite\" and is seen best across the River Severn.\nThe earliest part of the building at Worcester is the multi-columned crypt in Norman style with cushion capitals remaining from the original monastic church begun by bishop Saint Wulfstan of Worcester in 1084. Also from the Norman period is the circular chapter house of 1120, made octagonal on the outside when the walls were reinforced in the 14th century. The nave was built and rebuilt piecemeal and in different styles by several different architects over a period of 200 years, from 1170 to 1374, some bays being a unique and decorative transition between Norman and Gothic. The oldest parts show alternate layers of green sandstone from Highley in Shropshire and yellow Cotswold limestone.\nThe east end was rebuilt over the Norman crypt by Alexander Mason between 1224 and 1269, coinciding with, and in a very similar Early English style to, Salisbury Cathedral. From 1360, John Clyve finished off the nave, built its vault, the west front, the north porch and the eastern range of the cloister. He also strengthened the Norman chapter house, added buttresses and changed its vault. His masterpiece is the central tower of 1374, originally supporting a timber, lead-covered spire, now gone. Between 1404 and 1432, an unknown architect added the north and south ranges to the cloister, which was eventually closed by the western range by John Chapman, 1435\u20131438. The last important addition is Prince Arthur\u2019s Chantry Chapel to the right of the south choir aisle, 1502\u20131504.\nWorcester Cathedral was extensively restored from 1857 to 1874 by W. A. Perkins and Sir George Gilbert Scott. Most of the fittings and the stained glass date from this time. Some early 17th century screens and panelling, removed from the choir and organ casing in 1864, are now at Holy Trinity Church, Sutton Coldfield.\nBurials and memorials.\nThe Cathedral contains the tomb of King John in its chancel. Before his death in Newark in 1216, John had requested to be buried at Worcester. He is buried between the shrines of St Wulfstan and St Oswald (now destroyed).\nThe cathedral has a memorial, Prince Arthur's Chantry, to the young prince Arthur Tudor, who is buried here. Arthur's younger brother and next in line for the throne was Henry VIII. Worcester Cathedral suffered badly from iconoclasm but was spared total destruction by Henry VIII during the English Reformation because of his brother's chantry in the cathedral.\nAn epitaph in Latin to Henry Bright, headmaster of the King's School, Worcester, can be found near the north porch. Other notable burials include:\nLibrary.\nThe Cathedral Library at Worcester, located since the 19th century in the loft above the South Nave, contains 289 medieval manuscripts, 55 incunabula, and 6600 post-medieval printed books. The library and archive of Worcester Cathedral also has a total of 19000 archived documents, along with a music collection containing works from famous composers such as Edward Elgar and Thomas Tomkins. Of particular note are the Worcester Antiphoner (the only book of its kind to survive the Reformation), the will of King John, and a 1225 copy of Magna Carta. The large scriptorium at Worcester produced many manuscripts and was a place of work for many famous scribes, such as the chronicler John of Worcester and the unnamed monk identified by his distinctive handwriting as The Tremulous Hand of Worcester.\nMisericords.\nThirty-nine of the misericords date from 1379 and include a complete set of the Labours of the Months. The subject matter includes biblical stories, mythology and folklore including N-07, \"The Clever Daughter\", which shows a naked woman draped in a net, riding a goat and carrying a rabbit under her arm. Three of the misericords are Victorian replacements such as N-02, \"Judas in the jaws of Satan\".\nBells.\nThe tower has a ring of twelve bells plus four semitone bells and a 4.1 tonne non-swinging bourdon. The current peal of 15 ringing bells were cast in 1928 by John Taylor &amp; Co., of Loughborough, from the metal of the original ring cast in 1869. The bourdon bell was cast in 1869 and retuned in 1928. It is only used by the clock to strike the hours and sometimes tolls for special events. The ring is the sixth heaviest ring of twelve in the world; only the bells in the cathedrals of Liverpool, Exeter, York, and St Paul's in London, and of St Mary Redcliffe church in Bristol are heavier. The bells are also considered to be one of the finest toned rings ever cast, a close contender to York Minster. The bells hang in a wooden frame that was constructed in 1869 for the previous ring. Worcester Cathedral is unique in having a purpose-built teaching centre equipped with eight special training bells, linked to computers.\nThe Cathedral is also famous for being the only church in the world to have a ring of ten bells in a harmonic minor key.\nClock.\nA new clock by J. B. Joyce &amp; Co was installed in 1871 at a cost of about \u00a3500 (). It was built to the designs of Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe using the double three-legged gravity escapement.\nMusic.\nWorcester Cathedral has three choirs: Worcester Cathedral Choir (the principal choir which has both boys' and girls' sections, normally working independently), Worcester Cathedral Voluntary Choir, and Worcester Cathedral Chamber Choir. All three were involved in the BBC broadcast of the midnight and Christmas morning services in 2007, with the boys and the girls of the Cathedral Choir, respectively, taking the lead in the two services. Since the 18th century, Worcester Cathedral Choir has taken part in the Three Choirs Festival, the oldest music festival in the world.\nThe composer Edward Elgar spent most of his life in Worcestershire. The first performance of the revised version of his Enigma Variations \u2013 the version usually performed \u2013 took place at the cathedral during the 1899 Three Choirs Festival. He is commemorated in a stained glass window which contains his portrait.\nWorcester Cathedral has a long history of organs dating back to at least 1417. There have been many re-builds and new organs in the intervening period, including work by Thomas Dallam, William Hill and most famously Robert Hope-Jones in 1896. The Hope-Jones organ was heavily re-built in 1925 by Harrison &amp; Harrison, and then regular minor works kept it in working order until Wood Wordsworth and Co. were called in 1978. It was a large four-manual organ with 61 speaking stops. It had a large Gothic Revival case with heavily decorated front pipes as well as two smaller cases either side of the quire.\nThis organ (apart from the large transept case and pedal pipes) was removed in 2006 in order to make way for a new instrument by Kenneth Tickell, which was completed in the summer of 2008. The nave has a separate three-manual Rodgers organ.\nNotable organists at Worcester have included Thomas Tomkins (from 1596), Hugh Blair (from 1895), Ivor Atkins (from 1897) and David Willcocks (from 1950). From 2012 to 2018, the Director of Music and Organist was Peter Nardone.\nEvents.\nWorcester Cathedral hosts the annual graduation ceremonies for the University of Worcester. These ceremonies are presided over by the vice-chancellor of the university, and take place over four days in November.\nSince 2018, Worcester Cathedral became the host to the annual honours celebration of the Royal Life Saving Society UK, celebrating the long service and meritorious achievements of their lifesaving members.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, its population was 760,822. In 2022, the population was 822,453, making it the eighth-most populous county in the state. The county seat is Fort Myers, with a population of 86,395 as of the 2020 census, and the largest city is Cape Coral, with an estimated 2020 population of 194,016.\nThe county comprises the Cape Coral\u2013Fort Myers Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which, along with the Naples-Marco Island (Collier County) MSA and the Clewiston (Hendry County, Glades County) Micropolitan Statistical Area (\u03bcSA), is included in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers-Naples Combined Statistical Area (CSA).\nLee County was established in 1887 from Monroe County. Fort Myers is the county seat and a center of tourism in Southwest Florida. It is about south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caloosahatchee River. Lee County is the home for spring training of the Boston Red Sox and the Minnesota Twins Major League Baseball teams.\nHistory.\nProtohistory and European contact (500\u20131799).\nThe area that is now Lee County has several archaeological sites that show evidence of habitation by peoples belonging to the Caloosahatchee culture (500 to 1750 AD). By the time of European contact, the area was more specifically occupied by the Calusa. After European contact, fishermen from Cuba and other Spanish colonies set up fishing camps, known as \"ranchos\" in Spanish, on the southern portion of the Gulf Coast of Florida. These \"ranchos\" extended from Charlotte Harbor south to San Carlos Bay and the mouth of the Caloosahatchee. Likely established in the latter part of the 1600s, they were precursors to the larger European settlements that would be established in the following centuries. As the 18th century came to an end, the Calusa who had once inhabited the area were replaced with the Seminole (see also the Spanish Indians). In particular, in 1799, an Indian agent noted the existence of a Seminole town on the \"Cull-oo-saw-hat-che\" or Caloosahatchee River.\nFort established (1850s\u20131860s).\nAfter Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, a number of American settlers moved into the Florida Territory, causing conflict with the local native tribes. Several military and trading posts were established near the Caloosahatchee River during the Second Seminole War. Fort Myers was built in 1850 as a military fort to fend off Seminole Indians just prior to the Third Seminole War (Billy Bowleg's War). The fort was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of the fort's establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, Holata Micco (Chief Billy Bowlegs) and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move west, and the fort was abandoned. Billy's Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men awaited ships to take them west. In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by federal troops during the Civil War. In 1865, in the Battle of Fort Myers, the fort was attacked by a small group of Confederates from the Cow Cavalry. The Union's garrison, led by Captain James Doyle, successfully held the fort and the Confederate forces retreated. After the war, the fort was again deserted. The fort was later disassembled and some of its wood was used to build parts of downtown Fort Myers.\nSettlement and early growth (1860s\u20131920s).\nDuring the Civil War, Fort Myers was occupied by federal troops with the intention of disrupting the Confederate cattle supply from Florida. In February 1865, it was the site of the Battle of Fort Myers. The first settlers in Fort Myers arrived in 1866. In the 1870s, Tervio Padilla, a wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo Costa and established trade with natives and \"ranchos\" that extended northward to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the Spanish\u2013American War, when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means of livelihood \u2013 fishing. When the government claimed his land, he was disinclined to set up another ranch, so moved with his wife further down the island and as before, simply homesteaded. The Padilla family is one of the first pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county, mainly around the Pine Island area.\nIn 1882, the city experienced a significant influx of settlers. In 1885, when Fort Myers was incorporated, its population of 349 residents made it the second-largest city only to Tampa on Florida's west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, also growing cities at the time. Lee County was formed in 1887 from Monroe County, with Fort Myers serving as the county seat. It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American Civil War. Fort Myers first became a nationally known winter resort with the opening of the Royal Palm Hotel in 1898, built by New York City department store magnate Hugh O'Neill. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford. In 1911, Fort Myers was incorporated as a city. In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties were created by splitting these areas from Lee County. Construction of the Tamiami Trail Bridge, built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924, sparked the city's growth. After the bridge's construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many subdivisions sprouted around the city. In 1927, a property purchased by the City of Fort Myers was turned into an airport, eventually called Page Field.\nModern growth (1940s\u2013present).\nDuring World War II, Page Field served as an advanced fighter training base and home to the several bomber groups. Following the war, a small terminal was built in the mid-1950s as the airport transitioned to commercial use. Another airfield was constructed in 1942 called Buckingham Army Airfield. The base was closed down in 1945, after which the barracks served as classrooms for Edison College until 1948. Following the end of World War II, the Royal Palm Hotel was closed permanently, and in 1947, the hotel on the corner of First and Fowler was torn down.\nLee County has been the host to several Major League Baseball teams for spring training over the past several decades.\nThe county received a boost in 1983 when Southwest Florida Regional Airport (now known as Southwest Florida International Airport) opened.\nHurricanes.\nOn August 13, 2004, the county was struck by Hurricane Charley, a category 4 storm, particularly on the northwestern islands of Captiva, Gasparilla, and North Captiva.

On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3\u20131 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. That stadium, named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for the 2012 season.\nCity of Palms Park had been built in 1992 for the Red Sox' spring training.

It was named after the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. As of the 2020 census, the population was 292,198. The county seat is Tallahassee, which is also the state capital and home to many politicians, lobbyists, jurists, and attorneys. Leon County is included in the Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Tallahassee is home to two of Florida's major public universities, Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University, as well as Tallahassee State College.

The area includes red rolling hills.\nHistory.\nOriginally part of Escambia and later Gadsden County, Leon County was created in 1824. It was named after Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, the Spanish explorer who was the first European to reach Florida.\nThe United States finally acquired this territory in the 19th century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct Indian Removal of the Seminole and Creek peoples, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the Seminole Wars, planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the Deep South's \"cotton kingdom\". It ranked fifth of all Florida and Georgia counties in cotton production from the 20 major plantations.

The layers above the basement are carbonate rock created from dying foraminifera, bryozoa, mollusks, and corals from as early as the Paleocene, a period of ~66\u201455.8 Ma.\nDuring the Eocene (~55.8\u201433.9 Ma) and Oligocene (~33.9\u201423 Ma), the Appalachian Mountains began to uplift and the erosion rate increased enough to fill the Gulf Trough with quartz sands, silts, and clays via rivers and streams. The first sedimentation layer in Leon County is the Oligocene Suwannee Limestone in the southeastern part of the county as stated by the United States Geological Survey and Florida Geological Survey.\nThe Early Miocene (~23.03\u201415.7 Ma) sedimentation in Leon County is Hawthorn Group, Torreya Formation and St. Marks Formation and is found in the northern two-thirds of the county.\nThe Pliocene (~5.332\u20142.588 Ma) is represented by the Miccosukee Formation scattered within the Torreya Formation.\nSediments were laid down from the Pleistocene epoch (~2.588 million\u201412\u2009000 years ago) through the Holocene epoch (~12,000\u2014present) and are designated Beach ridge and trail and undifferentiated sediments.\nTerraces and shorelines.\nDuring the Pleistocene, what would be Leon County emerged and submerged with each glacial and interglacial period. Interglacials created the county's topography.\n\"Also See Leon County Pleistocene coastal terraces\"\n\"Also see: Florida Platform and Lithostratigraphy\"\nPaleontology.\nThree sites in Leon County have yielded fossil remnants of the Miocene epoch.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 292,198 people, 116,530 households, and 61,961 families residing in the county.\n2010 census.\nRace.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 275,487 people, and 108,592 households residing in the county.

Tallahassee's city limits would (at current size) increase from to . Roughly 36 percent of Leon County's 250,000 residents live outside the Tallahassee city limits.\nProponents of consolidation have claimed that the new jurisdiction would attract business by its very size.

It was the first and only public library in Tallahassee until 1955. Philanthropist Andrew Carnegie offered Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, the library was built on the FAMU campus because the city refused the donation because it would have to serve the black citizens. \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and social groups, as well as, public and private businesses throughout Florida and the nation.\" The building was designed by noted architect William Augustus Edwards and was built in 1908. On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which served only the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955. According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954. The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" A year later, the library was established by legislative action and developed by citizens and civic groups. The first Leon County free public library opened on March 21, 1956. The first building to house the library was The Columns, one of the oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area, at Park Avenue and Adams Street (now the home of the James Madison Institute).\nIn order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddywagon for its Road Prison. In 1962, the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee had been desegregated by 1958, but the public library system was only integrated several years later.\nIn the early 1970s, Jefferson and Wakulla Counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's website, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\" In 1975 the system started a branch library in Bond, a predominantly black community on the city's south side. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to Tallahassee's Northwood Mall. Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library. In 1989, \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\" The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\nPoints of interest.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCommunities.\nOther unincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The structure of a BSP tree is useful in rendering because it can efficiently give spatial information about the objects in a scene, such as objects being ordered from front-to-back with respect to a viewer at a given location. Other applications of BSP include: performing geometrical operations with shapes (constructive solid geometry) in CAD, collision detection in robotics and 3D video games, ray tracing, virtual landscape simulation, and other applications that involve the handling of complex spatial scenes.\nOverview.\nBinary space partitioning is a generic process of recursively dividing a scene into two using hyperplanes until the partitioning satisfies one or more requirements. It can be seen as a generalization of other spatial tree structures such as \"k\"-d trees and quadtrees, one where hyperplanes that partition the space may have any orientation, rather than being aligned with the coordinate axes as they are in \"k\"-d trees or quadtrees. When used in computer graphics to render scenes composed of planar polygons, the partitioning planes are frequently chosen to coincide with the planes defined by polygons in the scene.\nThe specific choice of partitioning plane and criterion for terminating the partitioning process varies depending on the purpose of the BSP tree. For example, in computer graphics rendering, the scene is divided until each node of the BSP tree contains only polygons that can be rendered in arbitrary order. When back-face culling is used, each node, therefore, contains a convex set of polygons, whereas when rendering double-sided polygons, each node of the BSP tree contains only polygons in a single plane. In collision detection or ray tracing, a scene may be divided up into primitives on which collision or ray intersection tests are straightforward.\nBinary space partitioning arose from computer graphics needing to rapidly draw three-dimensional scenes composed of polygons. A simple way to draw such scenes is the painter's algorithm, which produces polygons in order of distance from the viewer, back to front, painting over the background and previous polygons with each closer object. This approach has two disadvantages: the time required to sort polygons in back-to-front order, and the possibility of errors in overlapping polygons. Fuchs and co-authors showed that constructing a BSP tree solved both of these problems by providing a rapid method of sorting polygons with respect to a given viewpoint (linear in the number of polygons in the scene) and by subdividing overlapping polygons to avoid errors that can occur with the painter's algorithm. A disadvantage of binary space partitioning is that generating a BSP tree can be time-consuming. Typically, it is therefore performed once on static geometry, as a pre-calculation step, prior to rendering or other real-time operations on a scene. The expense of constructing a BSP tree makes it difficult and inefficient to directly implement moving objects into a tree.\nGeneration.\nThe canonical use of a BSP tree is for rendering polygons (that are double-sided, that is, without back-face culling) with the painter's algorithm. Each polygon is designated with a front side and a backside which could be chosen arbitrarily and only affects the structure of the tree but not the required result. Such a tree is constructed from an unsorted list of all the polygons in a scene. The recursive algorithm for construction of a BSP tree from that list of polygons is:\nThe following diagram illustrates the use of this algorithm in converting a list of lines or polygons into a BSP tree. At each of the eight steps (i.-viii.), the algorithm above is applied to a list of lines, and one new node is added to the tree.\nThe final number of polygons or lines in a tree is often larger (sometimes much larger) than the original list, since lines or polygons that cross the partitioning plane must be split into two. It is desirable to minimize this increase, but also to maintain reasonable balance in the final tree. The choice of which polygon or line is used as a partitioning plane (in step 1 of the algorithm) is therefore important in creating an efficient BSP tree.\nTraversal.\nA BSP tree is traversed in a linear time, in an order determined by the particular function of the tree. Again using the example of rendering double-sided polygons using the painter's algorithm, to draw a polygon \"P\" correctly requires that all polygons behind the plane \"P\" lies in must be drawn first, then polygon \"P\", then finally the polygons in front of \"P\". If this drawing order is satisfied for all polygons in a scene, then the entire scene renders in the correct order. This procedure can be implemented by recursively traversing a BSP tree using the following algorithm. From a given viewing location \"V\", to render a BSP tree,\nApplying this algorithm recursively to the BSP tree generated above results in the following steps:\nThe tree is traversed in linear time and renders the polygons in a far-to-near ordering (\"D1\", \"B1\", \"C1\", \"A\", \"D2\", \"B2\", \"C2\", \"D3\") suitable for the painter's algorithm.\nApplication.\nBSP trees are often used by 3D video games, particularly first-person shooters and those with indoor environments. Game engines using BSP trees include the Doom (id Tech 1), Quake (id Tech 2 variant), GoldSrc and Source engines. In them, BSP trees containing the static geometry of a scene are often used together with a Z-buffer, to correctly merge movable objects such as doors and characters onto the background scene. While binary space partitioning provides a convenient way to store and retrieve spatial information about polygons in a scene, it does not solve the problem of visible surface determination. \nBSP trees have also been applied to image compression.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditional references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As an active transport mechanism, exocytosis requires the use of energy to transport material. Exocytosis and its counterpart, endocytosis, are used by all cells because most chemical substances important to them are large polar molecules that cannot pass through the hydrophobic portion of the cell membrane by passive means. Exocytosis is the process by which a large amount of molecules are released; thus it is a form of bulk transport. Exocytosis occurs via secretory portals at the cell plasma membrane called porosomes. Porosomes are permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structures at the cell plasma membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell.\nIn exocytosis, membrane-bound secretory vesicles are carried to the cell membrane, where they dock and fuse at porosomes and their contents (i.e., water-soluble molecules) are secreted into the extracellular environment. This secretion is possible because the vesicle transiently fuses with the plasma membrane. In the context of neurotransmission, neurotransmitters are typically released from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis; however, neurotransmitters can also be released via reverse transport through membrane transport proteins.\nExocytosis is also a mechanism by which cells are able to insert membrane proteins (such as ion channels and cell surface receptors), lipids, and other components into the cell membrane. Vesicles containing these membrane components fully fuse with and become part of the outer cell membrane.\nHistory.\nThe term was proposed by De Duve in 1963.\nTypes.\nIn eukaryotes, there are two types of exocytosis:\n1) Ca2+ triggered non-constitutive (i.e., regulated exocytosis) and\n2) non-Ca2+ triggered constitutive (i.e., non-regulated).\n\"Ca2+ triggered non-constitutive\" exocytosis requires an external signal, a specific sorting signal on the vesicles, a clathrin coat, as well as an increase in intracellular calcium. In multicellular organisms, this mechanism initiates many forms of intercellular communication such as synaptic transmission, hormone secretion by neuroendocrine cells, and immune cells' secretion. In neurons and endocrine cells, the SNARE-proteins and SM-proteins catalyze the fusion by forming a complex that brings the two fusion membranes together. For instance, in synapses, the SNARE complex is formed by syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 at the plasma membrane and VAMP2 at the vesicle membrane. Exocytosis in neuronal chemical synapses is Ca2+ triggered and serves interneuronal signalling. The calcium sensors that trigger exocytosis might interact either with the SNARE complex or with the phospholipids of the fusing membranes. Synaptotagmin has been recognized as the major sensor for Ca2+ triggered exocytosis in animals. However, synaptotagmin proteins are absent in plants and unicellular eukaryotes. Other potential calcium sensors for exocytosis are EF-hand proteins (Ex: Calmodulin) and C2-domain (Ex: Ferlins, E-synaptotagmin, Doc2b) containing proteins. It is unclear how the different calcium sensors can cooperate together and mediate the calcium triggered kinetics of exocytosis in a specific fashion.\n\"Constitutive exocytosis\" is performed by all cells and serves the release of components of the extracellular matrix or delivery of newly synthesized membrane proteins that are incorporated in the plasma membrane after the fusion of the transport vesicle. There is no clear consensus about the machinery and molecular processes that drive the formation, budding, translocation and fusion of the post-Golgi vesicles to the plasma membrane. The fusion involves membrane tethering (recognition) and membrane fusion. It is still unclear if the machinery between the constitutive and regulated secretion is different. The machinery required for constitutive exocytosis has not been studied as much as the mechanism of regulated exocytosis. Two tethering complexes are associated with constitutive exocytosis in mammals, ELKS and Exocyst. ELKS is a large coiled-coil protein, also involved in synaptic exocytosis, marking the 'hotspots' fusion points of the secretory carriers fusion. Exocyst is an octameric protein complex. In mammals, exocyst components localize in both plasma membrane, and Golgi apparatus and the exocyst proteins are colocalized at the fusion point of the post-Golgi vesicles. The membrane fusion of the constitutive exocytosis, probably, is mediated by SNAP29 and Syntaxin19 at the plasma membrane and YKT6 or VAMP3 at the vesicle membrane.\n\"Vesicular exocytosis\" in prokaryote gram negative bacteria is a third mechanism and latest finding in exocytosis. The periplasm is pinched off as bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for translocating microbial biochemical signals into eukaryotic host cells or other microbes located nearby, accomplishing control of the secreting microbe on its environment - including invasion of host, endotoxemia, competing with other microbes for nutrition, etc. This finding of membrane vesicle trafficking occurring at the host\u2013pathogen interface also dispels the myth that exocytosis is purely a eukaryotic cell phenomenon.\nSteps.\nFive steps are involved in exocytosis:\nVesicle trafficking.\nCertain vesicle-trafficking steps require the transportation of a vesicle over a moderately small distance. For example, vesicles that transport proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface area, will be likely to use motor proteins and a cytoskeletal track to get closer to their target. Before tethering would have been appropriate, many of the proteins used for the active transport would have been instead set for passive transport, because the Golgi apparatus does not require ATP to transport proteins. Both the actin- and the microtubule-base are implicated in these processes, along with several motor proteins. Once the vesicles reach their targets, they come into contact with tethering factors that can restrain them.\nVesicle tethering.\nIt is useful to distinguish between the initial, loose \"tethering\" of vesicles to their objective from the more stable, \"packing\" interactions. Tethering involves links over distances of more than about half the diameter of a vesicle from a given membrane surface (&gt;25\u00a0nm). Tethering interactions are likely to be involved in concentrating synaptic vesicles at the synapse.\nVesicle docking.\nSecretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse at the porosome at the cell plasma membrane, via a tight t-/v-SNARE ring complex.\nVesicle priming.\nIn neuronal exocytosis, the term \"priming\" has been used to include all of the molecular rearrangements and ATP-dependent protein and lipid modifications that take place after initial docking of a synaptic vesicle but before exocytosis, such that the influx of calcium ions is all that is needed to trigger nearly instantaneous neurotransmitter release. In other cell types, whose secretion is constitutive (i.e. continuous, calcium ion independent, non-triggered) there is no priming.\nVesicle fusion.\nTransient vesicle fusion is driven by SNARE proteins, resulting in release of vesicle contents into the extracellular space (or in case of neurons in the synaptic cleft).\nThe merging of the donor and the acceptor membranes accomplishes three tasks:\nVesicle retrieval.\nRetrieval of synaptic vesicles occurs by endocytosis. Most synaptic vesicles are recycled without a full fusion into the membrane (kiss-and-run fusion) via porosome. Non-constitutive exocytosis and subsequent endocytosis are highly energy expending processes, and thus, are dependent on mitochondria.\nExamination of cells following secretion using electron microscopy demonstrate increased presence of partially empty vesicles following secretion. This suggested that during the secretory process, only a portion of the vesicular content is able to exit the cell. This could only be possible if the vesicle were to temporarily establish continuity with the cell plasma membrane at porosomes, expel a portion of its contents, then detach, reseal, and withdraw into the cytosol (endocytose). In this way, the secretory vesicle could be reused for subsequent rounds of exo-endocytosis, until completely empty of its contents.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most prominent instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency (HF) band. The IRI is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the ionosphere. Other instruments, such as a VHF and a UHF radar, a fluxgate magnetometer, a digisonde (an ionospheric sounding device), and an induction magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region. Work on the HAARP facility began in 1993. Initially HAARP was jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It was designed and built by BAE Advanced Technologies. Its original purpose was to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. Since 2015 it has been operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\nThe current working IRI was completed in 2007; its prime contractor was BAE Systems Advanced Technologies. As of 2008, HAARP had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs. In May 2014, it was announced that the HAARP program would be permanently shut down later in the year. After discussions between the parties, ownership of the facility was transferred to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in August 2015.\nHAARP is a target of conspiracy theorists, who claim that it is capable of weather manipulation and mind control. Scientists and other critics point out that these claims fall well outside the abilities of the facility, and often outside the scope of current natural science.\nHistory.\nThe High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program began in 1990. Ted Stevens, Republican U.S. senator from Alaska, helped win approval for the facility, and construction began in 1993.\nIn early May 2013, HAARP was temporarily shut down, awaiting a change between contractors to operate the facility. In July 2013, HAARP program manager James Keeney said, \"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is expected on site as a client to finish up some research in fall 2013 and winter 2014.\" The temporary shutdown was described as being due to \"a contractor regime change.\" Ahtna, Incorporated, the Alaska Native corporation serving the region of Alaska where the HAARP site is located, was reportedly in talks to take over the facility administration contract from Marsh Creek, LLC.\nIn May 2014, the Air Force announced that the HAARP program would be shut down later in 2014. While experiments ended in the summer of 2014, the complete shutdown and dismantling of the facility was postponed until at least May 2015. In mid-August 2015 control of the facility and its equipment was turned over to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, which is making the facilities available for researchers on a pay-per-use basis.\nProject overview.\nHAARP began operating in 1999 as a 6 \u00d7 8 (= 48) antenna array at 0.96 MW, expanding in 2007 to a 12 \u00d7 15 (=180) array of 180 antennas with 360 radio transmitters at 9.6 MW. It covers 14 ha near Gakona, about 250 km northeast of Anchorage. Its beam direction is anywhere within 30\u00b0 of zenith.\nThe HAARP project directs a 3.6\u00a0MW signal, in the 2.8\u201310\u00a0MHz region of the HF band, into the ionosphere. The signal may be pulsed or continuous. Effects of the transmission and any recovery period can be examined using associated instrumentation, including VHF and UHF radars, HF receivers, and optical cameras. According to the HAARP team, this will advance the study of basic natural processes that occur in the ionosphere under the natural but much stronger influence of solar interaction. HAARP also enables studies of how the natural ionosphere affects radio signals.\nThe insights gleaned at HAARP will enable scientists to develop methods to mitigate these effects to improve the reliability or performance of communication and navigation systems which would have a wide range of both civilian and military uses, such as an increased accuracy of GPS navigation and advances in underwater and underground research and applications. This may lead, among other things, to improved methods for submarine communication or an ability to remotely sense and map the mineral content of the terrestrial subsurface, and perhaps underground complexes, of regions or countries. The current facility lacks range to be used in regions like the oil-rich Middle East, according to one of the researchers involved, but the technology could be put on a mobile platform.\nThe project was originally funded by the Office of Naval Research and jointly managed by the ONR and Air Force Research Laboratory, with principal involvement of the University of Alaska Fairbanks; other US universities and educational institutions involved in the development of the project and its instruments include Stanford University, Penn State University (ARL), Boston College, UCLA, Clemson University, Dartmouth College, Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Massachusetts Amherst, MIT, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Virginia Tech and the University of Tulsa. The project's specifications were developed by the universities, who continued to play a major role in the design of future research efforts.\nAccording to HAARP's original management, the project strove for openness, and all activities were logged and publicly available, a practice which continues under the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Scientists without security clearances, even foreign nationals, were routinely allowed on site, which also continues today. HAARP hosts an open house annually, during which time any civilian can tour the entire facility. In addition, scientific results obtained using HAARP are routinely published in major research journals (such as \"Geophysical Research Letters\" and \"Journal of Geophysical Research\"), written both by university scientists (American and foreign) and by U.S. Department of Defense research lab scientists.\nResearch.\nHAARP's main goal is basic science research in the uppermost portion of the atmosphere, termed the ionosphere. Essentially a transition between the atmosphere and the magnetosphere, the ionosphere is where the atmosphere is thin enough that the Sun's X-rays and UV rays can reach it, but thick enough that there are enough molecules present to absorb those rays. Consequently, the ionosphere consists of a rapid increase in density of free electrons, beginning at ~70\u00a0km, reaching a peak at ~300\u00a0km, and then falling off again as the atmosphere disappears entirely by ~1,000\u00a0km. Various aspects of HAARP can study all of the main layers of the ionosphere.\nThe profile of the ionosphere is highly variable, changing constantly on timescales of minutes, hours, days, seasons, and years. This profile becomes even more complex near Earth's magnetic poles, where the nearly vertical alignment and intensity of Earth's magnetic field can cause physical effects like the aurora.\nThe ionosphere is traditionally very difficult to measure. Balloons cannot reach it because the air is too thin, but satellites cannot orbit there because the air is too thick. Hence, most experiments on the ionosphere give only small pieces of information. HAARP approaches the study of the ionosphere by following in the footsteps of an ionospheric heater called EISCAT near Troms\u00f8, Norway. There, scientists pioneered exploration of the ionosphere by perturbing it with radio waves in the 2\u201310\u00a0MHz range, and studying how the ionosphere reacts. HAARP performs the same functions but with more power and a more flexible and agile HF beam.\nSome of the main capabilities of HAARP include:\nResearch at the HAARP has included:\nResearch conducted at the HAARP facility has allowed the US military to perfect communications with its fleet of submarines by sending radio signals over long distances.\nInstrumentation and operation.\nThe main instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI). This is a high-power, high-frequency phased array radio transmitter with a set of 180 antennas, disposed in an array of 12\u00d715 units that occupy a rectangle of about . The IRI is used to temporarily energize a small portion of the ionosphere. The study of these disturbed volumes yields important information for understanding natural ionospheric processes.\nDuring active ionospheric research, the signal generated by the transmitter system is delivered to the antenna array and transmitted in an upward direction. At an altitude between (depending on operating frequency), the signal is partially absorbed in a small volume several tens of kilometers in diameter and a few meters thick over the IRI. The intensity of the HF signal in the ionosphere is less than 3\u00a0\u03bcW/cm2, tens of thousands of times less than the Sun's natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the Earth and hundreds of times less than even the normal random variations in intensity of the Sun's natural ultraviolet (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere. The small effects that are produced can be observed with the sensitive scientific instruments installed at the HAARP facility. These observations can provide information about the dynamics of plasmas and insight into the processes of solar-terrestrial interactions.\nEach antenna element consists of a crossed dipole that can be polarized for linear, ordinary mode (O-mode), or extraordinary mode (X-mode) transmission and reception.\nEach part of the two section crossed dipoles is individually fed from a specially designed, custom-built transmitter that operates at very low distortion levels. The effective radiated power (ERP) of the IRI is limited by more than a factor of 10 at its lower operating frequencies. Much of this is due to higher antenna losses and a less efficient antenna pattern.\nThe IRI can transmit between 2.7 and 10\u00a0MHz, a frequency range that lies above the AM radio broadcast band and well below Citizens' Band frequency allocations. HAARP is licensed to transmit only in certain segments of this frequency range. When the IRI is transmitting, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is 100\u00a0kHz or less. The IRI can transmit in continuous waves (CW) or in pulses as short as 10 microseconds (\u03bcs). CW transmission is generally used for ionospheric modification, while transmission in short pulses frequently repeated is used as a radar system. Researchers can run experiments that use both modes of transmission, first modifying the ionosphere for a predetermined amount of time, then measuring the decay of modification effects with pulsed transmissions.\nThere are other geophysical instruments for research located at the HAARP facility. Some of them are:\nThe facility is powered by a set of five 2500 kilowatt generators being driven by EMD 20-645-E4 diesel locomotive engines.\nSite.\nThe project site () is north of Gakona, Alaska just west of Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park. An environmental impact statement led to permission for an array of up to 180 antennas to be erected. HAARP was constructed at the previous site of an over-the-horizon radar (OTH) installation. A large structure, built to house the OTH now houses the HAARP control room, kitchen and offices. Several other small structures house various instruments.\nThe HAARP site was constructed in three distinct phases:\nRelated facilities.\nIn the United States, there have been two related ionospheric heating facilities: the HIPAS, near Fairbanks, Alaska, which was dismantled in 2009, and one at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which collapsed in 2020. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) operates an ionospheric heating facility capable of transmitting over 1\u00a0GW effective radiated power (ERP), near Troms\u00f8, Norway. The Sura Ionospheric Heating Facility, in Vasilsursk, Russia, near Nizhniy Novgorod, is capable of transmitting 190\u00a0MW ERP.\nConspiracy theories.\nHAARP is the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. Various individuals have speculated about hidden motivations and capabilities of the project. For example, Rosalie Bertell warned in 1996 about the deployment of HAARP as a military weapon. Michel Chossudovsky stated in a book published by the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform that \"recent scientific evidence suggests that HAARP is fully operational and has the capability of triggering floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes.\" Over time, HAARP has been blamed for generating such catastrophes, as well as thunderstorms, in Iran, Pakistan, Haiti, Turkey, Greece and the Philippines, and even major power outages, the downing of TWA Flight 800, Gulf War syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome.\nAllegations include the following:\nIn 1995, Elisabeth Rehn, Finnish Member of the European Parliament, tabled a motion for a resolution on the potential use of military-related resources for environmental strategies. The proposal is referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defense Policy for substantive consideration. Magda Aelvoet, Belgian MEP and President of the Green Group, becomes convinced that HAARP is a secret weapon system. In 1998, the two MEPs, convinced by Begich's theory that HAARP poses a threat to the environment, decided to write a report in which they interviewed only two people \u2014 Begich and Rosalie Bertell, head of a Canadian association which also supports the conspiracy theory of chemtrails \u2014 the invited representatives of the United States and NATO did not respond. It is on the basis of these two testimonies alone, in which Begich is described as a doctor without having any qualification, that a report by the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defense Policy relating to the environment, security and foreign policy takes up these assertions and adopts a resolution indicating that \"HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project) by virtue of its far-reaching impact on the environment to be a global concern and (the European Parliament) calls for its legal, ecological and ethical implications to be examined by an international independent body before any further research and testing.\"\nTwo Georgia men arrested on drug charges in November 2016 were reportedly plotting domestic terrorism based on conspiracy theories about HAARP. The Coffee County Sheriff's Office said the men possessed a \"massive arsenal\" that included AR-15 rifles, Glock handguns, a Remington rifle and thousands of rounds of ammunition. According to police, the men wanted to destroy HAARP because they believed the facility manipulates the weather, controls minds and even traps the souls of people. Police say the men confessed that \"God told them to go and blow this machine up that kept souls, so souls could be released.\"\nStanford University professor Umran Inan told \"Popular Science\" that weather-control conspiracy theories were \"completely uninformed,\" explaining that \"there's absolutely nothing we can do to disturb the Earth's [weather] systems. Even though the power HAARP radiates is very large, it's minuscule compared with the power of a lightning flash\u2014and there are 50 to 100 lightning flashes every second. HAARP's intensity is very small.\" Computer scientist David Naiditch characterizes HAARP as \"a magnet for conspiracy theorists,\" saying that HAARP attracts their attention because, \"its purpose seems deeply mysterious to the scientifically uninformed.\" Journalist Sharon Weinberger called HAARP \"the Moby Dick of conspiracy theories,\" and said the popularity of conspiracy theories often overshadows the benefits HAARP may provide to the scientific community. Austin Baird writing in the \"Alaska Dispatch\" said, \"What makes HAARP susceptible to conspiracy criticism is simple. The facility doesn't open its doors in the same way as other federally funded research facilities around the country, and it doesn't go to great efforts to explain the importance of its research to the public.\" In 2016, in response to these claims, the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, which manages the facility, announced that HAARP will host an annual open house in August, allowing visitors to tour the complex.\nThis project resurfaced again during the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as \"COP 27\", sparking conspiracies as well as many fantasies, and speaking also about geo-engineering.\nFollowing the recent 2023 earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, this project, including that of \"Blue Beam\", has also been accused of having caused earthquakes, giving rise to numerous conspiracy theories.\nFollowing the widespread visibility of the aurora borealis over much of the Northern Hemisphere in May and again in October 2024, conspiracy theorists promoted HAARP as the true cause of the event.\nIn popular culture.\nHAARP gave rise to a live album by the rock band Muse and became the theme of novels like \"La Route de Gakona\" by Jean-Paul Jody.\nHAARP is the key plot point in \"Breaking Point\" of Tom Clancy's Net Force (2000), where it is used to induce group madness.\nThe HAARP facility appears in the 2004 video game \"X-Men Legends\". In the game, the X-Men track the Brotherhood of Mutants to HAARP. The facility is significantly different from its real life counterpart, with snowy valleys around it and vast icy tunnels below. It is guarded by an extensive security force, including armed guards and tanks. The X-Men eventually locate the Brotherhood and learn that sensitive information, including the location of Magneto's imprisonment, is kept in the HAARP computers.\nSeason 1, episode 11, of the UPN TV series \"Seven Days\" was titled \"HAARP Attack\". It was broadcast on January 27, 1999.\nThe HAARP played a major part in the miniseries. In it, Cobra was able to weaponize the lab to create a Particle Cannon and threaten the world to surrender to them. Though it was freed from Destro and Baroness, Cobra possessed a smaller yet functional version that Cobra Commander planned to use to strike randomly until the world surrendered with Washington, D.C. as his first target. Though Duke couldn't deactivate the weapon, he was able to change the target to Cobra's main base in Springfield, though Cobra Commander seemingly escaped the devastation.\nThe Missing in Alaska series, Zombies of HAARP episode, attempts to claim The top secret government facility known as HAARP, an electromagnetic generator, could be turning people into zombies and causing them to disappear in the Alaska Triangle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nVideos"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 42,915. Its county seat is Bronson. It has been included in the Gainesville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area since 2018.\nHistory.\nLevy County was created in 1845, after the Seminole Wars, and became Florida's 27th county. It was named for David Levy Yulee, a slave owner elected in 1841 as the state's territorial delegate to the US House of Representatives, where he served two terms.\nLevy provided for long-term development in the state by constructing the first railroad across Florida, the Florida Railroad, linking the deep-water ports of Fernandina (Port of Fernandina) on the Atlantic Ocean and Cedar Key on the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe original county seat of Levy County was located in a neighborhood locally known as Sodom. This concerned the county commission so much that in April 1854 they changed the name to \u201cMount Pleasant\u201d. The name was changed again in January 1856 to \"Levyville\". An act of the State of Florida legislature ordered the county commissioners to let the county residents vote on the location of the county seat. In 1869, a vote was held to decide the location for the county seat. Bronson was selected by popular vote. County officials cited illegal votes cast in every precinct, so a new election was set to take place in 30 days. The Board of County Commissioners would later reverse their previous decision and let the vote stand. The process to build a new courthouse at Bronson began along with the removal of the courthouse at Levyville.\nIn 1874, the county seat was moved to Bronson, originally known as \u201cChunky Pond\u201d, and was named after an early settler, Isaac Bronson.\nThe Rosewood Massacre occurred in Levy County in the first week of January 1923. White citizens from the nearby town of Sumner, reacting to a what turned out to be a false accusation that a black man raped a white woman, burned the predominantly black town of Rosewood to the ground and brutally murdered several of Rosewood's black citizens. A film based on the incident was made in 1997, but was not filmed in Levy County.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (20.9%) is water.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 42,915 people, 16,971 households, and 10,747 families residing in the county.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 34,450 people, 13,867 households, and 9,679 families residing in the county.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 17,968. Its county seat is also called Madison.\nHistory.\nLocated in what is known as the Florida Panhandle, Madison County was created in 1827. It was named for James Madison, fourth President of the United States of America, who served from 1809 to 1817. It was developed as part of the plantation belt, with cotton cultivated and processed by enslaved African Americans.\nThe county's economic and population growth was stagnant from the 1880s and for several decades into the early 20th century.\nIn the period after Reconstruction, racial violence rose in the state, reaching a peak at the end of the 19th century and extending into the difficult economic years of the 1920s and 1930s. According to the Equal Justice Institute's 2015 report, \"Lynching in America: Confronting Racial Terror\", from 1877 to 1950, Madison County had 16 lynchings in this period, the 6th highest of any county in the state.\nIn 1945, the county's population of 15,537 was divided evenly between black and white.\nThe last known lynching in the county was that in October 1945 of Jesse James Payne, a young married sharecropper with a child. After an economic dispute with the white landowner where he was sharecropping, where Payne escaped murder following \"a demand for an unjust debt repayment\", he was charged with sexually assaulting the landowner's daughter, but was innocent. The sheriff and other law enforcement officials appeared implicated in Payne's murder, as he was left in the county jail unguarded after mob action had been threatened. Payne's was the only recorded lynching nationwide that year, when World War II ended. The case received national attention and the governor was strongly criticized for failure to mount a true investigation or to take action against the sheriff.\nIn 1949, Ernest Thomas, a WWII veteran, was tracked to a swamp in Madison County after he had fled from a wrongful accusation of rape in Groveland, Florida. He was found sleeping under a tree and was shot an estimated 400 times by a lynch mob led by Lake County Sheriff Willis V. McCall.\nAs of August 2012, Madison became a wet county, meaning that voters had approved the legal sale, possession, or distribution of alcoholic beverages.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.8%) is water.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 17,968 people, 6,778 households, and 4,232 families residing in the county.\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 18,733 people, 6,629 households, and 4,680 families residing in the county.

As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population was 399,710. Manatee County is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Its county seat and largest city is Bradenton. The county was created in 1855 and named for the Florida manatee, Florida's official marine mammal. Features of Manatee County include access to the southern part of the Tampa Bay estuary, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, and the Manatee River.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric history.\nThe area now known as Manatee County had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. Shell middens and other archaeological digs have been conducted throughout the county including at Terra Ceia and at Perico Island. These digs revealed materials belonging to peoples from the Woodland period.\nEuropean exploration and early settlement.\nSome historians have suggested that the southern mouth of the Manatee River was the landing site of the De Soto Expedition.\nDue to conflict during the Patriot War and First Seminole War, many Native American and African American refugees fled to the Tampa Bay region of Florida and some settled in modern-day Manatee County. The settlement they founded on the Manatee River was called Angola. By 1819, the population of Angola may have reached as high as 600-700 people.\nThe Manatee area was opened to settlement in 1842 with the passing of the federal Armed Occupation Act. Early settlements included the Manatee Colony led by Colonel Samuel Reid that numbered thirty-one individuals both black and white. Other prominent early settlers were Joseph and Hector Braden who moved into an area near the Manatee River in 1842. The two had lost their land for their plantations in Northern Florida during the Panic of 1837. They were said to have heard that there was abundant land in the area. The brothers moved into a log cabin five miles north of the mouth of the Manatee River. Four years later Hector drowned while trying to cross the Manatee River on his horse during a hurricane. Despite this tragic event, Joseph decided he would still build the Braden sugar mill at the mouth of the Manatee River and the Braden River. He later built a dock where Main Street was and fortified the area near his house by building a stockade. A few years later in 1851, he built the Braden Castle, which was made out of tabby and served as his residence. In spring of 1856, the fortified home was attacked by Seminole Indians during the Third Seminole War. It later became a popular tourist attraction in the early 1900s with Tin Can Tourists. He would only stay there for the next six years before moving to Tallahassee.\nCounty formation and development.\nManatee County was carved out from a vast Hillsborough County in January 1855 and led by Florida Senate President Hamlin V. Snell. The new county covered 5,000 square miles and included all of what are now Charlotte County, DeSoto County, Glades County, Hardee County, Highlands County, Sarasota County, and part of Lee County. The original county seat was Manatee, a village on the southern shore of the Manatee River in what now is eastern Bradenton. In 1866, the county seat was moved from the village of Manatee to Pine Level, as a result of a referendum mandated by the Florida Legislature. In 1887, the county seat was moved again due to the creation of DeSoto County within the existing boundaries. Braiden Town (Bradenton) was selected as the new county seat by referendum of the county residents who mostly resided near the Manatee River. In 1921, Sarasota County was created by the Florida Legislature and further reducing Manatee County to its current boundaries.\nAmerican Civil War.\nFollowing the Seminole Wars, Manatee County continued to grow both in population and in economic output. Hogs and some sheep were raised, but the land was primarily used for cattle raising. Processed sugar and molasses was produced and exported. This agricultural economy, like much of the south, was increasingly becoming reliant on slave labor. A federal census in 1860 showed that the county had a population of 601 white people and 214 enslaved black people. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Manatee County provided supplies to the Confederate army. Aside from the Union blockade, the Federal army dispatched raiding parties throughout Florida to further limit the Confederate supply chain. For example, in August 1864, the Union schooner USS Stonewall came up the Manatee river on a raid. According to the Florida State Archives, Dr. Braden's sugar works was destroyed during the raid. However, another source states that Braden's property was left untouched.\nAccording to a partial list of soldiers of the Confederate States of America, the county also sent at least 100 of its citizens to fight. Some of the men from Manatee would be recruited to the 7th Florida Infantry Regiment, which fought as part of the Army of Tennessee.\nWithin Manatee County is the Gamble Plantation, a sugar plantation and home of Major Robert Gamble. According to some, following the Civil War, the Confederate Secretary of State, Judah P. Benjamin, took refuge at the mansion before escaping to England.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (17%) is water.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 399,710 people, 150,345 households, and 99,157 families residing in the county. By age, the population was spread out as such: 4.6% under 5 years old, 18.0% under 18 years old, and 28.1% 65 years and over. 51.7% of the population was female.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $59,963 in 2020 dollars and a per capita income in the past 12 months of $35,146. There was a reported 10.9% of the population living in poverty.\nEconomy.\nBealls of Florida has its headquarters and was founded 1915 in unincorporated Manatee County.\nTropicana was founded in Manatee County in the 1950s. Tropicana was bought by PepsiCo in 2001. PepsiCo sold Tropicana to a French private equity firm in 2021.\nLibraries.\nThe Manatee County Public Library System offers a collection of adult, young adult, and children's materials, as well as a genealogy section and a local history collection in the form of the Eaton Florida History Reading Room. Public computers are available at all library locations. The library also has a digital collection that includes e-books through OverDrive, Inc. and Libby; television shows, movies and more e-books through Hoopla; and magazines through Flipster; and local images and documents from the late nineteenth century to the early 1980s.https://\nThe libraries also offer author luncheons, children's story times, summer reading programs, job fairs, and book discussion groups.\nThe library system serves the county in seven locations:\nIn September 2021, a seventh branch was approved by county commissioners, to be built in Lakewood Ranch. The library's grand opening was on January 12, 2024.\nLibrary cards are free to those who reside, own property, attend school, or work in Manatee County. Non-residents may obtain a temporary card upon payment of a $25.00 annual fee.\nManatee County participates in the Little Free Library program. There are several Little Free Libraries at parks and other public places around the county.\nHistory of libraries.\nManatee County's first public library was a privately owned rental library created by Julia Fuller at the Mrs. Bass Dry Goods store in 1898. The county's first independent library opened in Bradenton in 1907, followed a Carnegie Library in Palmetto in 1914 and another in Bradenton in 1918. For much of the twentieth century, both cities' libraries were free to city residents while county residents had to pay a non-resident fee. In 1964, the Bradenton and Palmetto library associations merged with the Manatee County government to create the Manatee County Public Library System. This was followed by the establishment of a bookmobile for rural areas in 1964 and a Talking Books program for the blind in 1966.\nAs demands on the bookmobile grew and the library collection outstripped the existing buildings in Bradenton and Palmetto, the first branch of the Manatee County Public Library system was built in Bayshore in 1967, followed by a new branch on East Ninth Street in 1969 and an Island branch in 1971, the last of which was moved into a new building in 1983. A new building for the Palmetto Library was built in 1969, followed by the modern Central Public Library in downtown Bradenton in 1978.\nThe 1990s saw a period of rapid growth in Manatee County and the library system grew accordingly, with the Braden River, Rocky Bluff, and South Manatee branches opening in 1991, 1994, and 1998, respectively. The Braden River branch moved to a new building in 1997. The Rocky Bluff location would be moved to a larger location, featuring a built in caf\u00e9, in 2011. The new location is still physically within Ellenton. The additions as well as investment into various technologies such as modern computers, a 3-D Printing Lab, as well as new loanable items, brings Manatee County Libraries to its modern services.\nReciprocal borrowing began in 2000 between Manatee and Sarasota County Libraries, which would be followed by statewide reciprocal borrowing programs. Starting in 2017, the Manatee County library system began offering items including musical instruments, tools, telescopes, binoculars, cake pans, hotspots, and museum passes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the library system began offering WiFi hotspots to patrons in order to provide internet service remotely to work safely and at home. This began in Spring of 2020.\nOn December 15, 2021, the county broke ground for a new East County library, which was to serve the community of Lakewood Ranch. The new library was scheduled to open mid-2023. The new library, dubbed the Lakewood Ranch Library, had its grand opening on January 12, 2024.\nCommunities.\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnincorporated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransportation.\nManatee County has a county transportation service, MCAT. It serves this county, Pinellas County, and Sarasota County.\nGovernment.\nPolitical history.\nManatee County is part of the strongly Republican Sun Belt. The area became a Republican stronghold following World War II and has remained so since: the last Democrat to win Manatee County was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944.\nDuring the peak of the Socialist Party's prominence in the early 20th century, Manatee County would elect the only socialist to the state legislature, Andrew Jackson Pettigrew to the Florida House of Representatives in 1906 for one term defeating John A. Graham (who was a Democrat) in the general election. As a state legislator he would make several proposals that were inline with what the Party reflected at the national level such as making US Senators popularly elected and creating a national income tax. Overall as a state legislator he would make little progress in getting legislation proposed by him passed. Prior to the 1906 race he would run in 1904 for the same position unsuccessfully losing to A.T. Cornwell (also a Democrat) who had served as Bradenton's first mayor and in a variety of positions at the county level.

It is a small prostrate evergreen subshrub forming large colonies. The specific epithet \"octopetala\" derives from Greek \"octo\" 'eight' and \"petalon\" 'petal', referring to the eight petals of the flower, an unusual number in the Rosaceae, where five is the normal number. However, flowers with up to 16 petals also occur naturally.\nAs a floral emblem, it is the official territorial flower of the Northwest Territories and the national flower of Iceland.\nDescription.\nThe stems are woody, tortuous, with short, horizontal rooting branches. The leaves are glabrous above, densely white-tomentose beneath. The flowers are produced on stalks long, and have eight creamy white petals \u2013 hence the specific epithet \"octopetala\". The style is persistent on the fruit with white feathery hairs, functioning as a wind-dispersal agent. The feathery hairs of the seed head first appear twisted together and glossy before spreading out to an expanded ball which the wind quickly disperses.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Dryas octopetala\" has a widespread occurrence throughout mountainous areas where it is generally restricted to limestone outcrops. These include the entire Arctic, as well as the mountains of Scandinavia, Iceland, the Alps, the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkans, the Caucasus, and in isolated locations elsewhere. In Great Britain, it occurs in the Pennines of Northern England, at two locations in the Snowdonia region of North Wales, and more widely in the Scottish Highlands. In Ireland, it occurs on The Burren and a few other sites. In North America, it is found in Alaska, most frequently on previously glaciated terrain, and through the Canadian Rockies reaching as far south as Colorado in the Rocky Mountains.\nIt grows in dry localities where snow melts early, on gravel and rocky barrens, forming a distinct heath community on calcareous soils.\nClimatology.\nThe Younger Dryas, Older Dryas and Oldest Dryas stadials are named after \"Dryas octopetala\", because of the great quantities of its pollen found in cores dating from those times. During these cold spells, \"Dryas octopetala\" was much more widely distributed than it is today, as large parts of the Northern Hemisphere that are now covered by forests were replaced in the cold periods by tundra.\nCultivation.\n\"D. octopetala\" is cultivated in temperate regions as groundcover, or as an alpine or rock garden plant. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The leaves are occasionally used as an herbal tea.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the northeasternmost county in the state. The county seat is Fernandina Beach. The population was 90,352 at the 2020 census.\nNassau County is a constituent of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which accommodates around 1.68 million inhabitants as of 2022. The county is situated in Northeast Florida with a land area of . The county's population has surged by more than 40,000 residents since the year 2000, driven by factors such as Nassau's nearness to downtown Jacksonville, the emergence of fresh residential projects, agricultural output, prominent tourist destinations, and a broadening tax foundation through the influx of novel industrial and business enterprises to the county. Nassau County is also a favored residential destination for military personnel stationed at bases in the adjacent Duval County, Florida (Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Naval Station Mayport) and Camden County, Georgia (Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay). Nassau County celebrated 200 years with its bicentennial celebration in 2024.\nHistory.\nNassau County was created in 1824 from Duval County. It was named for the Duchy of Nassau in Germany.\nThe Battle of Alligator Bridge took place in Nassau County around Callahan on June 30, 1778, and was the only major engagement in an unsuccessful campaign to conquer British East Florida during the American Revolutionary War.\nIn 1817, the short-lived Republic of the Floridas was established on Amelia Island. It was one of several attempts to wrest Florida from Spanish control into the growing United States.\nSome of the men from the county had formed a militia unit called the Davis Guards leading up to the Civil War. This unit would be organized as Company K of the 2nd Florida Infantry Regiment in the Confederate army.\nLaw and government.\nCounty commissioners.\nNassau County operates under the administration of the Nassau County Board of County Commissioners, comprising five members. These commissioners are elected by the voters to serve four-year terms, with the election cycle structured such that either three or two commissioners are subject to election every two years. The following individuals constitute the Nassau County Commissioners:\nOcean Highway and Port Authority.\nThe Ocean Highway &amp; Port Authority (OHPA) functions as an autonomous governmental organization within Nassau County, Florida, responsible for the ownership and management of the seaport infrastructure at the Port of Fernandina. OHPA was founded in 1941 by the Florida Legislature. Relay Terminals is the current operating partner of the Port.\nThe Port of Fernandina operates as a terminal for handling various commodities, including pulp and paper, steel exports, machinery, automotive components, chemicals, beverages, building materials, and food items. The port's container lines facilitate shipping routes to destinations such as Colombia, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, and Bermuda. Notably, in 2020, the port was awarded a substantial grant exceeding one million dollars from the United States Department of Transportation to initiate a barge service.\nOHPA Commissioners\nNassau County Soil and Water Conservation District.\nThe primary entity overseeing environmental and agricultural matters is the Nassau County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD), which maintains close collaboration with various other regional agencies. According to a summary taken from Florida Statutes Ch. 582, the Board's powers include conducting surveys, investigations, research and demonstrational projects relating to soil and water conservation (in areas like irrigation, water quality, and soil erosion). SWCD supervisors do not receive monetary compensation, and, for the most part, conduct their activities on their own time. Supervisors are members of a five-person board for the district, to which they can either be elected or appointed.\nPolice.\nThe Nassau County Sheriff's Office offers essential services to the residents of Nassau County. It bears the responsibility of upholding both the provisions of the Florida Constitution and the laws and statutes of the state of Florida, ensuring the protection, security, and welfare of its populace.

This entails moderate conditions in the winter months and hot, humid conditions throughout the summer. Precipitation patterns show a concentration of rainfall during the warmer months spanning from May to September, whereas the drier period falls between November and April.

It also has a junction with the CSX Callahan Subdivision which runs parallel to US 301 from the Duval County Line almost to Callahan. This line also once had an extension to the Fernandina Subdivision, as well as a second extension to Gross, which were abandoned in 1954 and 1985 respectively.\nA third CSX line exists closer to the east coast of the state known as the Kingsland Subdivision, which runs parallel to US 17 from the Duval County line to Yulee, where it joins the First Coast Railroad, a class three railroad that runs along the Fernandina Subdivision and the former Kingsland Subdivision north of Yulee.\nThe other major railroad line in the county is Norfolk Southern Railway's Valdosta District, which spans northwest to southeast from a bridge over the Saint Mary's River in Kent to the Jacksonville Terminal. The Valdosta District has a diamond junction with the Callahan Subdivision in Crawford.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nThe 2020 United States census counted 90,352 people, 35,919 households, and 26,196 families in Nassau County, Florida.

{"id": "73626", "revid": "125972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73626", "title": "Christopher Reeve", "text": "American actor and activist (1952\u20132004)\nChristopher D'Olier Reeve (September 25, 1952 \u2013 October 10, 2004) was an American actor, activist, director, and author. He amassed several stage and screen credits in his 34-year career, including playing the title character in the \"Superman\" film series (1978\u20131987). He won a British Academy Film Award, an Emmy Award, a Grammy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. He was also known for his activism.\nBorn in New York City and raised in Princeton, New Jersey, Reeve discovered a passion for acting and theater at the age of nine. He studied at Cornell University and the Juilliard School, making his Broadway debut in 1976. His breakthrough came with playing the title character in \"Superman\" (1978) and its three sequels (1980\u20131987). Afterwards, Reeve turned down multiple roles in big-budget movies, focusing instead on independent films and plays with complex characters. He appeared in critically successful films such as \"Somewhere in Time\" (1980), \"Deathtrap\" (1982), \"The Bostonians\" (1984), \"Street Smart\" (1987), and \"The Remains of the Day\" (1993), and in the plays \"Fifth of July\" on Broadway and \"The Aspern Papers\" in London's West End.\nBeginning in the 1980s, Reeve was an activist for environmental and human-rights causes and for artistic freedom of expression. In 1995, Reeve was paralyzed from the neck down after being thrown from a horse during an equestrian competition in Culpeper, Virginia. He used a wheelchair and ventilator for the rest of his life. After his accident, he lobbied for spinal injury research, including human embryonic stem cell research, and for better insurance coverage for people with disabilities. His advocacy work included leading the Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation and co-founding the Reeve-Irvine Research Center.\nReeve later directed \"In the Gloaming\" (1997), acted in a television remake of \"Rear Window\" (1998), and made two appearances in the Superman-themed television series \"Smallville\" (2003). He also wrote two autobiographical books: \"Still Me\" (1998) and \"Nothing Is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life\" (2002). He died in 2004 from cardiac arrest at a hospital near his home in Westchester County, New York.\nEarly life and education.\nReeve was born on September 25, 1952, in New York City, to Barbara Pitney Lamb, an associate editor of \"Town Topics\", and Franklin D'Olier Reeve, a teacher, novelist, poet, and scholar. Many of his ancestors had been in America since the early 17th century, some having been aboard the \"Mayflower\". Through his mother, he was a 12th generation descendant of William Bradford, a pilgrim and five-time Governor of Plymouth Colony. Other ancestors of Reeve came from the French aristocracy. His maternal great-grandfather, Mahlon Pitney, was an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1913 to 1922. For over 25 years his paternal great-grandfather, Franklin D'Olier, was CEO of the Prudential Insurance Company. His grand-uncle, Franklin D'Olier Jr., was married to Margaret Winifred Lee, the maternal aunt of First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\nFranklin and Barbara divorced in 1956, and she moved with Christopher and his younger brother Benjamin to Princeton, New Jersey, where they attended Nassau Street School and then Princeton Day School (PDS). Reeve's parents both remarried; he had five half-siblings and several step-siblings. Reeve excelled academically, athletically, and onstage; he was on the honor roll and played soccer, baseball, tennis, and hockey. He also played the piano and sang in the choir as a soprano.\nReeve had a difficult relationship with his father, Franklin. He wrote in 1998 that his father's \"love for his children always seemed tied to performance\" and he put pressure on himself to act older than he actually was to gain his father's approval. Between 1988 and 1995 the two barely spoke to each other, but they reconciled after Reeve's paralyzing accident.\nReeve found his passion for acting in 1962 at age nine when he was cast in an amateur version of the operetta \"The Yeomen of the Guard\"; it was the first of many student plays. His interest was solidified when at age 15, he spent a summer as an apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts.\nAfter graduating from PDS in June 1970, Reeve acted in plays in Boothbay, Maine. He planned to go to New York City to find a career in theater. Ultimately, however, at the advice of his mother, he applied for college. He was accepted into Princeton University, Columbia University, Brown University, Cornell University, Northwestern University, and Carnegie Mellon University. Reeve said he chose Cornell primarily because it was distant from New York City and this would help him avoid the temptation of working as an actor immediately versus finishing college, as he had promised his mother and stepfather. Reeve joined the theater department in Cornell and played Pozzo in \"Waiting for Godot\", Segismundo in \"Life Is a Dream\", Hamlet in \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\", and Polixenes in \"The Winter's Tale\".\nLate in his first year, Reeve received a letter from Stark Hesseltine, a high-powered New York City agent who had discovered Robert Redford and who represented actors such as Richard Chamberlain, Michael Douglas, and Susan Sarandon. Hesseltine had seen Reeve in \"A Month in the Country\" and wanted to represent him. Reeve was excited and kept re-reading the letter to make sure of what it said. Reeve was impatient with school and eager to get on with his career. The two met, but Reeve was surprised to find Hesseltine strongly supported his promise to his mother and stepfather to complete college. They decided instead of dropping out of school, Reeve would come to New York once a month to meet casting agents and producers to find work for the summer vacation.\nReeve received favorable responses to his introductions and auditions arranged by Hesseltine but had to forgo several desirable opportunities because they began before school ended. In the summer, he toured in a production of \"Forty Carats\" with Eleanor Parker. The next year, Reeve received a full summer contract with the San Diego Shakespeare Festival, with roles as Edward IV in \"Richard III\", Fenton in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", and Dumaine in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" at the Old Globe Theatre.\nBefore his third year of college, Reeve took a three-month leave of absence. He traveled to Glasgow, Scotland, and saw theatrical productions throughout the United Kingdom. He was inspired by the actors there, and often had conversations with them in bars after their performances. He helped actors at The Old Vic with their American accents by reading the newspaper aloud for them. He then flew to Paris to study the French theater. Reeve spoke fluent French, having studied it from the third grade through his first year in Cornell. While there he spoke only French to immerse himself in French culture, and watched many performances.\nAfter returning from Europe, Reeve chose to focus solely on acting, although Cornell had several general education requirements for graduation he had yet to complete. He managed to convince theater director John Clancy and the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, as a theater major, he would achieve more at Juilliard (Group 4, 1973\u20131975) in New York City than at Cornell. They agreed his first year at Juilliard would be counted as his senior year at Cornell.\nIn 1973, approximately 2,000 students auditioned for 20 places in the freshman class at Juilliard. Reeve's audition was in front of 10 faculty members, including John Houseman, who had just won an Academy Award for \"The Paper Chase\". Reeve and Robin Williams were the only students selected for Juilliard's Advanced Program. They had several classes together in which they were the only students. In their dialects class with Edith Skinner, Williams had no trouble mastering all dialects naturally, whereas Reeve was more meticulous about it. Williams and Reeve developed a close friendship. Reeve was a godfather to Williams' eldest son Zachary.\nIn a meeting with Houseman, Reeve was told, \"Mr. Reeve. It is terribly important that you become a serious classical actor. Unless, of course, they offer you a shitload of money to do something else.\" Houseman then offered him the chance to leave school and join the Acting Company, among performers such as Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, and David Ogden Stiers. Reeve declined, as he had not yet received his bachelor's degree.\nIn early 1974, Reeve and other Juilliard students toured the New York City junior high school system and performed \"The Love Cure\". In one performance, Reeve, who played the hero, drew his sword out too high and accidentally destroyed a row of lights above him. The students applauded and cheered. Reeve later said this was the greatest ovation of his career. After completing his first year at Juilliard, Reeve graduated from Cornell in the Class of 1974 as a double major in English and music theory.\nCareer.\nEarly work.\nIn 1974, Reeve auditioned for the soap opera \"Love of Life\" to pay tuition fees at Juilliard. Initially, he was promised a schedule that would not interfere with his studies. However, his character quickly gained popularity, leading to increased screen time. When Reeve reminded the producers of their agreement, they responded that it wasn't set in writing. The following year, Reeve had to leave Juilliard to fulfill his contract with CBS. He received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Juilliard in 1997.\nIn between filming for the soap opera, Reeve took acting classes at the HB Studio and appeared in an Off-off-Broadway production of \"Berchtesgaden\" at the Theater for the New City. The play was directed by Barbara Loden, who became Reeve's mentor. She coached him not to play \"on the nose\", and he often followed that advice over the years. After that, he starred in a limited run of \"Berkeley Square\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club.\nIn late 1975, Reeve auditioned for the Broadway play \"A Matter of Gravity\". Katharine Hepburn watched his audition and cast him as her character's grandson. With Hepburn's influence over CBS, Reeve worked out the schedules of the soap opera and the play so he would be able to do both. Because of his busy schedule, he ate candy bars and drank coffee in place of meals and experienced exhaustion and malnutrition. At one of the performances, Reeve entered the stage, said his first line, and then promptly fainted. Hepburn turned to the audience and said, \"This boy's a goddamn fool. He doesn't eat enough red meat.\" The understudy finished the play for Reeve, and a doctor treated him. The doctor advised Reeve to eat a healthier diet. He stayed with the play for nine months and was given favorable reviews.\nReeve and Hepburn became very close. Some gossip columns rumored a romance between the two. Reeve said, \"She was 67 and I was 22, but I thought that was quite an honor.\u00a0... I believe I was fairly close to what a child or grandchild might have been to her.\" She told him, \"You're going to be a big star, Christopher, and support me in my old age.\" He replied, \"I can't wait that long.\" Reeve said his father, who was a professor of literature and came to many of the performances, was the man who most captivated Hepburn. When the play moved to Los Angeles in June 1976, Reeve\u2014to Hepburn's disappointment\u2014dropped out. They stayed in touch for years after the play's run. Reeve later regretted not staying closer and just sending messages back and forth.\nReeve's first role in a Hollywood film was a small part as a junior officer in the 1978 naval submarine disaster movie \"Gray Lady Down\", starring Charlton Heston. He then acted in the play \"My Life\" at the Circle Repertory Company with friend William Hurt.\n\"Superman\" films.\nDuring the Off-Broadway production of \"My Life\", Stark Hesseltine told Reeve he had been asked to audition for the leading role as Clark Kent/Superman in the big-budget film \"Superman\" (1978). Lynn Stalmaster, the casting director, put Reeve's picture and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on the top of the pile three separate times, only to have the producers throw it out each time. Through Stalmaster's persistent pleading, a meeting between director Richard Donner, producer Ilya Salkind, and Reeve was arranged. The morning after the meeting, Reeve was sent a 300-page script. He was thrilled that the script took the subject matter seriously, and that Donner's motto was \"verisimilitude\". Hesseltine also told him that Marlon Brando was going to play Jor-El and Gene Hackman was going to play Lex Luthor. Reeve flew to London for a screen test, but he still did not believe he had much of a chance. On the plane ride, he imagined his approach to the role. He later said, \"By the late 1970s, the masculine image had changed.\u00a0... Now it was acceptable for a man to show gentleness and vulnerability.\u00a0... I felt that the new Superman ought to reflect that contemporary male image.\" He based his portrayal of Clark Kent on Cary Grant's role in the 1938 film \"Bringing Up Baby\". After the screen test, his driver said, \"I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you've got the part.\"\nPortraying Superman would be a stretch for the 24-year-old actor. He was tall, but his physique was slim. Reeve went through an intense two-month training regimen with former British weightlifting champion David Prowse supervising. The training regimen consisted of running in the morning, followed by two hours of weightlifting and 90 minutes on the trampoline. He added of muscle to his \"thin\" frame. He later made even higher gains for \"Superman III\" (1983), though for \"\" (1987), he decided it would be healthier to focus more on cardiovascular workouts. One of the reasons Reeve could not work out as much for \"Superman IV\" was an emergency appendectomy that he had in June 1986.\nReeve was never a Superman or comic book fan, though he had watched \"Adventures of Superman\" starring George Reeves. Reeve found the role offered a suitable challenge because it was a dual role. He said, \"there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise, you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character.\" Remembering Loden's earlier advice, Reeve also decided to \"underplay\" Superman: \"I was six feet four, strong, and physically imposing; so I played against that, making him as casual as possible, letting the audience sense an implied power.\"\nOn the commentary track for the director's edition of \"\", creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz spoke of how Reeve had talked to him about playing Superman and then playing Clark Kent. Mankiewicz then corrected Reeve, telling him he was \"always, \"always\" playing Superman\" and when he was Clark Kent, he was \"playing Superman who was playing Clark Kent.\" Mankiewicz described it to Reeve as a role within a role.\nThe film, made without the use of computers for special effects, was the first attempt to realistically show a person flying. Roy Field, the film's optical supervisor, said, \"There were many techniques used to make Superman fly, but the best special effect of all was Christopher Reeve himself. We discovered very early on he, being a glider pilot, could hold his body aerodynamically. So when he got into the harness, the whole shot began to come alive.\"\nThe film grossed $300.2\u00a0million worldwide (unadjusted for inflation). Reeve received positive reviews for his performance:\nFor his performance, Reeve won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles. Reeve described Superman as \"the closest opportunity I've had to playing a classical role on film, the closest expression to something of mythical dimension.\" His co-star Margot Kidder said after his death that, with the \"Superman\" films, Reeve \"knew he'd done something meaningful. He was very aware of that and very happy with that role.\"\nMuch of \"Superman II\" was filmed at the same time as the first film. In fact, the original plan had been for the film to be a single three-hour epic comprising both parts. After most of the footage had been shot, the producers had a disagreement with Donner over various matters, including money and special effects, and Donner was fired. Director Richard Lester, who had worked with the producers previously on the two-parter \"The Three Musketeers\" (1973) and \"The Four Musketeers\" (1974), replaced Donner. Lester had the script changed and re-shot some footage. The cast was unhappy, but Reeve later said he liked Lester and considered \"Superman II\" to be his favorite of the series. Donner's version of \"Superman II\", titled \"Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut\", was released on DVD in November 2006 and was dedicated in memory of Reeve.\nLester directed \"Superman III\", released in 1983, solo. Reeve believed the producers Alexander Salkind, his son Ilya Salkind, and Pierre Spengler had decreased the credibility of \"Superman III\" by turning it into a Richard Pryor comedy rather than a proper Superman film. He missed Donner and believed \"Superman III\"'s only really good element was the automobile junkyard scene in which Evil Superman fights Good Clark Kent in an internal battle. Reeve's portrayal of the Evil Superman was highly praised, though the film was critically panned.\n\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" was released in 1987. After \"Superman III\", Reeve vowed he was done with Superman. However, he agreed to continue the role in a fourth film on the condition he would have partial creative control over the script. The nuclear disarmament plot was his idea. Cannon Films purchased the production rights to the character of Superman from the Salkinds in the mid-1980s. Cannon Films were known for low-budget, poorly acted, poorly scripted action films. They cut the budget of \"Superman IV\" in half to $17 million. The film was both a critical failure and a box-office disappointment, becoming the lowest-grossing \"Superman\" film to date. Reeve later said, \"the less said about \"Superman IV\" the better.\" Both of Reeve's children from his relationship with Gae Exton had uncredited appearances in a deleted scene in which Superman rescues a girl, played by his daughter Alexandra, and reunites her with her brother, played by his son Matthew, after Nuclear Man creates a tornado in Smallville.\nReeve would have made a fifth \"Superman\" film after the rights to the character reverted to the Salkinds and Spengler if the film had a budget of the same size as \"Superman: The Movie\". Although there was potential for such a film in the late 1980s after Cannon Films went bankrupt, Reeve never received a script.\nIn 1993, two years before Reeve's accident, the Salkinds sold the rights to the character of Superman again, this time to Warner Bros. \"There was supposed to be a fifth \"Superman\" movie titled \"Superman Reborn\", but because of studio shifts, the terrible box office [\"Superman IV\"] got, and\u00a0... Reeves's [\"sic\"] accident, it never saw the light of day.\"\n1980s.\nReeve's first role after 1978's \"Superman\" was in the 1980 time-travel mystery/romantic fantasy \"Somewhere in Time\". Reeve as playwright Richard Collier romanced Elise McKenna, a popular stage actress from the early 20th century, played by Jane Seymour. The film was shot on Mackinac Island using the Grand Hotel in mid-1979, and was Reeve's favorite film to shoot.\nThe original plan was for a limited release and to build word of mouth, but early test screenings were favorable and the studio decided on a wide release, which proved to be the wrong strategy. Early reviews savaged the film as unduly sentimental and melodramatic, and an actors' strike prevented Reeve and Seymour from doing publicity. The film quickly closed, although Jean-Pierre Dorl\u00e9ac was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design in 1980. However, thanks to screenings on cable networks and video rentals, the film became a cult classic. INSITE (International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts) did fundraising to sponsor a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Reeve in 1997, and raised over $20,000 for the Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation. Seymour became a friend of Reeve and in 1995 named one of her twin sons Kristopher in his honor (Reeve also became his godfather). The Grand Hotel and Mackinac Island has become a popular tourist site for film fans.\nIn that same year, Reeve made a guest appearance on \"The Muppet Show\", where he performed \"East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)\" on a piano for Miss Piggy, who had a crush on him. Reeve denied being Superman but displayed the character's superpowers throughout the episode. He then returned to continue filming on the not yet finished production of \"Superman II\".\nAfter finishing \"Superman II\", Reeve called Nikos Psacharopoulos, the artistic director of the Williamstown Theatre Festival, whom he knew since his apprentice days, and asked if he could join the company. Reeve did two plays that season: \"The Front Page\" and \"The Cherry Orchard\". The former, directed by Robert Allan Ackerman, became one of the biggest successes of the summer. From then on, he was a regular at the festival. Later in the year, Reeve played a disabled Vietnam veteran in Lanford Wilson's play \"Fifth of July\" on Broadway to excellent reviews. To prepare for the role, he was coached by an amputee on how to walk on artificial legs. The production was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Play. In 1981, Reeve returned to Williamstown to play Achilles in the two-part, six-hour production of \"The Greeks\".\nIn 1982, Reeve stretched his acting range further and played a devious novice playwright with questionable motives regarding his idol and mentor Michael Caine, in Sidney Lumet's suspenseful dark comedy \"Deathtrap\", based on the play by Ira Levin. The film was well received, but a major plot twist was spoiled by the press, affecting its box office performance. The same year, Reeve portrayed corrupt Catholic priest John Flaherty making challenging decisions during World War II in Frank Perry's \"Monsignor\". Reeve felt this gave him the opportunity to play \"a morally ambiguous character who was neither clearly good nor clearly bad, someone to whom life is much more complex than the characters I've played previously.\" Reeve blamed the failure of the film on poor editing. He said, \"the movie is sort of a series of outrageous incidents that you find hard to believe. Since they don't have a focus, and since they aren't justified and explained, they become laughable.\"\nIn 1983, Reeve appeared in \"Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre\", playing the dual roles of Prince Charming and the cowardly prince in \"Sleeping Beauty\". In Williamstown, he acted in the play \"Holiday\". Later that year, Reeve went to Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, to work on the film \"The Aviator\". The producers approached him without knowing he could fly a Stearman, the vintage biplane used in the film. He readily accepted the role and volunteered to do his own piloting to achieve a more realistic look. The film was released in March 1985.\nReeve was then offered the role of Basil Ransom in 1984's \"The Bostonians\" alongside Vanessa Redgrave. Though Reeve ordinarily commanded over one million dollars per film, Ismail Merchant could only afford to pay him one-tenth of that. Reeve had no complaints, as this was exactly the kind of film he wanted to do. In a 2005 interview, James Ivory said that Merchant Ivory Productions didn't have good representatives at the time, so Reeve \"brokered\" the arrangements with the CAA to get them into the agency. The film exceeded expectations and performed well at the box office for what was considered to be an art house film. \"The New York Times\" ranked it \"among the finest film adaptations of a classic novel that anyone has yet made.\"\nIvory thought that Reeve was \"wonderful\" in \"The Bostonians\", but that he was \"really undervalued by the critics and even the awards\" because \"they were so used to thinking of him as Superman.\" Hepburn called Reeve to tell him he was \"absolutely marvelous\" and \"captivating\" in the film. When he told her he was currently shooting the 1985 version of \"Anna Karenina\", she said, \"Oh, that's a terrible mistake.\" Reeve reunited with Redgrave in the play \"The Aspern Papers\" during its 1984 run in London's West End. In Williamstown, he played the title role in \"Richard Cory\".\nIn March 1985, Reeve starred as Count Vronsky in the television film \"Anna Karenina\", opposite Jacqueline Bisset. Reeve's daughter, Alexandra, also appeared in the film as his character's 10-month-old daughter, taking her first steps. It was for this film that Reeve learned to ride horses and decided to take up the sport seriously upon returning home. In April, Reeve hosted an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\". He then returned to the stage, playing Tony in \"The Royal Family\" in Williamstown and the Count in a modern adaptation of \"The Marriage of Figaro\" on Broadway. Reeve also hosted the television documentary \"Dinosaur!\", which was filmed at the American Museum of Natural History. It was one of the earliest prime-time specials on prehistoric life and won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects. Also in 1985, DC Comics named Reeve as one of the honorees in the company's 50th-anniversary publication, \"Fifty Who Made DC Great\", for his work on the \"Superman\" film series.\nIn 1986, he was still struggling to find scripts he liked. A script named \"Street Smart\" had been lying in his house for years, and after re-reading it, he took it to Cannon Films. They agreed to produce it on the condition that he play Superman in at least one more sequel for them. Reeve starred opposite Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for his first Academy Award for the film. It received excellent reviews but performed poorly at the box office, possibly because Cannon Films had failed to properly advertise it. Back in Williamstown, he began building a house and starred in \"Summer and Smoke\" alongside Laila Robins.\nAfter the filming of \"Superman IV\" in February 1987, Reeve and Exton separated and Reeve returned to New York. In a depression over his personal life, he thought doing a comedy might be good for him and agreed to appear in \"Switching Channels\". However, Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner had a feud during filming, which made the time even more unbearable for Reeve. He later stated that he made a fool of himself in the film and most of his time was spent refereeing between Reynolds and Turner. In her 2008 memoir, Turner wrote, \"Burt and I were sworn enemies.\u00a0... It was not happy shooting at all. I was absolutely miserable. If the crew hadn't been so kind, and Chris Reeve, who was so very nice, hadn't been there in the cast, it might have been impossible.\" The film did poorly, and Reeve believed it marked the end of his movie star career. In June, he appeared in the British television special charity event \"The Grand Knockout Tournament\" and then went to Williamstown to rehearse for the play \"The Rover\". On June 30, Reeve met his future wife Dana Morosini.\nIn 1988, Reeve played Major Johnnie Dodge in the two-part television film \"\". Like the 1963 film, the first part tells the story of the mass escape of Allied POWs from a German camp in 1944. The second part depicts the search and prosecution of those responsible for the murder of 50 escapees, which was not covered in the 1963 film. But for most of 1988 and 1989, Reeve worked onstage. He starred in another production of \"Summer and Smoke\", this time with Christine Lahti, at the Ahmanson Theatre. In Williamstown, he reunited with Madeleine Potter in Joel Gross' new play, \"Mesmer\", and performed in a stage reading of the same play on Broadway.\nIn 1989, Reeve played Polixenes in an Off-Broadway production of \"The Winter's Tale\". In Williamstown, he played the lead in \"John Brown's Body\", in which Dana also had a small role. Reeve was part of a rotating cast in John Tillinger's production of \"Love Letters\" at the Promenade Theatre; with Julie Hagerty, he also performed in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston in 1989 and 1990. He auditioned for the Richard Gere role in \"Pretty Woman\" but walked out on the audition because they had a half-hearted casting director fill in for Julia Roberts.\n1990s.\nIn 1990, Reeve starred in the American Civil War film \"The Rose and the Jackal\", in which he played Allan Pinkerton, the head of President Lincoln's new Secret Service. In Williamstown, he played Death/Prince Nikolai Sirki in the play \"Death Takes a Holiday\".\nIn the early 1990s, Reeve was cast as a villain in three television films almost in a row: \"Bump in the Night\" (1991), \"Death Dreams\" (1991), and \"Nightmare in the Daylight\" (1992). The most notable of these was \"Bump in the Night\", in which Reeve played a child molester who abducts a young boy. The movie received fair to positive reviews. Reeve felt it was important for parents of young children to see the film.\nIn 1992, Reeve played one of the leads in Peter Bogdanovich's comedy \"Noises Off\". In a 2020 book \"Picturing Peter Bogdanovich: My Conversations with the New Hollywood Director\", Bogdanovich said, \"[Reeve] was very good in that. He was good at comedy. I could tell that from the first \"Superman\". He was my only choice for that part.\" In another television film, \"Mortal Sins\", Reeve for the second time played a Catholic priest, this time hearing the confessions of a serial murderer in a role reminiscent of Montgomery Clift in Alfred Hitchcock's \"I Confess\". He also acted in the short film \"Last Ferry Home\". His last performance in a proper stage production was \"The Guardsman\" in Williamstown that year.\nIn the spring of 1992, Reeve attended the US premiere of \"Howards End\" where he met Ivory again. The next day Ivory called him and offered him a role in his new film, \"The Remains of the Day\" (1993). The script was one of the best he had read, and he unhesitatingly took the part. The film was deemed an instant classic and was nominated for eight Academy Awards. At the 2024 screening of the film, Ivory praised Reeve's performance, saying, \"He was a great guy... a very, very good actor who got trapped in Superman.\" According to Reeve's son Will, \"The Remains of the Day\" is the film that his father was most proud of.\nIn 1993, Reeve starred opposite Charles Bronson in the television film \"The Sea Wolf\", based on Jack London's novel of the same name. After that, he traveled to Canada to shoot a miniseries, \"Black Fox\", co-starring Tony Todd. CBS released it as three films two months after Reeve's accident in 1995. Scenes of Reeve riding are featured heavily in the story. Reeve's children, Matthew and Alexandra, appear briefly in the background in the first film.\nDuring this period, Superman's grip on Reeve's career gradually began to loosen. In a review for \"Morning Glory\" (1993), one critic wrote: \"Those who can't take Reeve seriously unless he's wearing a blue suit and a red cape will find themselves pleasantly surprised by the heft and subtlety he brings to his [role].\u00a0\u2026 This movie isn't big enough to make Reeve a star again. But the impression he makes here is good enough to suggest that a reversal of perception\u2014and fortune\u2014won't be long in coming.\" Another critic said in a review for \"Speechless\" (1994): \"Mr. Reeve has quietly evolved into a versatile character actor\u2026 It's only a matter of time before he is 'officially' rediscovered and celebrated, like John Travolta in \"Pulp Fiction\".\" Reeve considered \"The Rose and the Jackal\", \"Morning Glory\", and \"The Sea Wolf\" some of his best work.\nIn 1994, Reeve did a reading of \"Love Letters\" in Williamstown, and also appeared as a narrator in a concert version of the musical \"Allegro\" at the New York City Center. These became his last performances onstage.\nIn 1995, Reeve starred in John Carpenter's \"Village of the Damned\", a remake of the 1960 British movie of the same name. Both films were based on the 1957 novel \"The Midwich Cuckoos\" by John Wyndham. For Carpenter, the film was a contractual obligation, but \"it has a very good performance from Christopher Reeve, so there's some value in it.\" \"Village of the Damned\" was Reeve's final feature film to be released in theaters. Shortly before his accident, Reeve played a paralyzed police officer in the HBO movie \"Above Suspicion\". He did research at a rehabilitation hospital in Van Nuys \"on what it would be like to be a paraplegic.\" His injury occurred less than a week after the premiere of the film.\nReeve also made several guest appearances in television shows: \"Carol &amp; Company\" in 1991, \"Road to Avonlea\" and \"Tales from the Crypt\" in 1992. He accepted an offer to appear in \"Road to Avonlea\" without reading the script because Colleen Dewhurst, with whom he was close, spoke highly of the show. His episode in \"Tales from the Crypt\", \"What's Cookin'\", is considered one of the best in the series. He was also one of the celebrity guest callers on \"Frasier\" in 1993.\nBefore his injury, Reeve was offered the lead in the 1995 film \"Kidnapped\". He also planned to direct his first film for the big screen, a romantic comedy entitled \"Tell Me True\". Both plans were cancelled as a result of a horse riding accident that left him paralyzed.\nIn 1996, Reeve narrated the HBO documentary \"\". The film won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Special. He then acted in a small role in the film \"A Step Toward Tomorrow\".\nIn 1997, Reeve made his directorial debut with the HBO film \"In the Gloaming\" with Robert Sean Leonard, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg, Bridget Fonda, and David Strathairn. The film was nominated for five Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries or Special, and won four awards out of the six it was nominated for at the CableACE Awards. Dana said, \"There's such a difference in his outlook, his health, his overall sense of well-being when he's working at what he loves, which is creative work.\"\nIn early 1998, Reeve persuaded Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney at the time, to give a two-hour prime-time slot on ABC to a spinal cord research fundraiser. The special focused on inspiring stories of people with disabilities, as well as performances by disabled artists. Reeve said, \"To put two hours about spinal cord injury on prime-time TV is unheard of. We wanted to make it a celebration of life. Show the triumphs that can happen.\" Numerous celebrities lent their support, including Robin Williams, Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Stevie Wonder, Willie Nelson, Gloria Estefan, and many others. \"A Celebration of Hope\" received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special.\nOn April 25, 1998, Random House published Reeve's autobiography, \"Still Me\". The book spent 11 weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. Reeve narrated the abridged audiobook, which won him the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album, the Audie Award for Solo Narration by the Author, and the Earphones Award from \"AudioFile\". The paperback edition with a new afterword was released the following year and spent an additional two weeks on the Best Seller list.\nAlso in 1998, Reeve starred in and served as executive producer of \"Rear Window\", a remake of Hitchcock's 1954 film. He was nominated for a Golden Globe and won a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, Reeve made guest appearances on the PBS series \"Sesame Street\". In September 2002, Random House published Reeve's second book, \"Nothing Is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life\". This book is shorter than \"Still Me\" and focuses on Reeve's world views and the life experiences which helped shape them. The book spent three weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. Reeve narrated an unabridged audiobook for which he received his second Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.\nIn 2001, Reeve's son Matthew began filming a three-part series detailing Reeve's recovery process and advocacy for spinal cord injury research. The first film, \"Hope in Motion\", aired on ABC in September 2002 under the title \"Courageous Steps\". It received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Nonfiction Special. In February 2003, it was broadcast on BBC One under its original title. Following Reeve's death in 2004, a third film was never made, while \"Hope in Motion\" and its follow-up, \"Choosing Hope\", were released on DVD in 2007.\nIn 2003, Reeve guest-starred in an episode of \"The Practice\". He submitted a story treatment to the show's creator, David E. Kelley, that addresses the issues of health insurance policy and caregiver burnout. Kelley liked the idea and wrote an episode based on it.\nReeve's final acting role was in the television series \"Smallville\" portraying Dr. Virgil Swann. On February 25, 2003, he made an appearance in the episode \"Rosetta\", in which Dr. Swann informs Clark Kent (Tom Welling) about his origins. The scenes of Reeve and Welling feature music cues from 1978's \"Superman\", composed by John Williams and arranged by Mark Snow. At the end of the episode, Reeve and Welling appeared in a short spot inviting people to support the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. \"Rosetta\" set ratings history for The WB. The fan community met the episode with rave reviews and praised it as being among the series' best to this day. Reeve also appeared in the episode \"Legacy\", in which he reunited with fellow stage actor John Glover, who played Lionel Luthor in the show.\nIn 2004, Reeve directed the A&amp;E film \"The Brooke Ellison Story\". The film is based on the true story of Brooke Ellison, the first quadriplegic to graduate from Harvard University. Reeve during this time was directing the animated film \"Everyone's Hero\". It was one of his dream projects and he died during the middle of production for the film. His wife Dana helped out, and his son Will was a cast member in the film. Dana and Will also had small roles in \"The Brooke Ellison Story\".\nRoles turned down by Reeve.\nFollowing the first \"Superman\" movie, Reeve realized Hollywood producers wanted him to be an action star. He later said, \"I found most of the scripts of the genre poorly constructed, and I felt the starring roles could easily be played by anyone with a strong physique.\" In addition, he did not feel he was right for the other films he was offered and turned down the lead roles in \"American Gigolo\", \"The World According to Garp\", \"Splash\", \"Fatal Attraction\", \"Romancing the Stone\", \"Lethal Weapon\", and \"Body Heat\". Hepburn recommended Reeve to David Lean for the role of Fletcher Christian in \"The Bounty\", starring Anthony Hopkins. After considering it, Reeve decided he would be miscast, and the film was eventually made with Mel Gibson. In the 1990s, Reeve received scripts for \"Picket Fences\" and \"Chicago Hope\" and was asked by CBS if he wanted to start his own television series. This would have meant moving to Los Angeles, which he did not want to do. He declined the offers. After his accident, Reeve was offered the role of Mason Verger in Ridley Scott's \"Hannibal\". He turned it down upon learning that the character was a paralyzed and facially disfigured child molester. The role went to Gary Oldman.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships.\nReeve's first romantic relationship was at the age of 16 with a theater actress who was seven years his senior. Eventually, he began to feel that \"something about it didn't feel right\", and they split up.\nWhile filming the first two \"Superman\" movies in England, Reeve began a 10-year relationship with modeling executive Gae Exton. In 2018, Jane Seymour revealed that Reeve and Exton had broken up prior to filming \"Somewhere in Time\", and during production, Reeve and Seymour fell in love. However, Reeve returned to Exton upon learning that she was pregnant with their son Matthew Exton Reeve, who was born on December 20, 1979. Their second child, daughter Alexandra Reeve Givens, was born on November 25, 1983. Both were born in London. In February 1987, Reeve and Exton separated amicably with joint custody of their children, and Reeve returned to New York. Matthew and Alexandra remained in London with their mother and spent their holidays with Reeve. Matthew, who graduated from Brown University in 2002, is a writer, director, and producer. Alexandra graduated from Yale University in 2005 and received a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School in 2008. She is a lawyer and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. Alexandra's son is named Christopher after her father.\nIn June 1987, Reeve met his future wife Dana Morosini, a singer and actress. By 1990, they were living together but Reeve, remembering his parents' painful divorce and other failed marriages in his family, could not bring himself to commit. After they almost broke up, Reeve began about a year of therapy, primarily to talk through his fears about marriage. Then one night during dinner, he said, \"I just put down my fork and asked her to marry me.\" They were married in April 1992, and their son &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;William Elliot \"Will\" Reeve was born on June 7, 1992. Will graduated from Middlebury College in 2014 and, , he reports for ABC News. Christopher and Dana Reeve remained married until Christopher's death.\nAviation and sailing.\nReeve was a licensed pilot and began reaching milestones in his early 20s: private, instrument, multi-engine, commercial, instructor, and glider. In 1976, Reeve purchased his first aircraft, a second-hand Cherokee 140. After his paralyzing accident, he fondly recalled sleeping under its wings during a solo trip across Canada. Over the years, he owned an A36 Bonanza, a Beechcraft Baron, a Cheyenne II, and a sailplane. He flew solo across the Atlantic twice and was a pilot for the Environmental Air Force.\nWhen Robin Williams was filming \"The World According to Garp\", Glenn Close recalled that Reeve would \"literally swoop in, piloting his own plane, scoop Robin up, and away they would fly for the weekend.\" During the shooting of \"Superman III\", Reeve joined The Tiger Club, a group of aviators who pilot vintage de Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes. Reeve knew how to fly a Stearman and did his own piloting in the film \"The Aviator\". He also enjoyed gliding; his personal record was 32,000 ft.\nReeve was an avid sailor. While filming \"The Bostonians\", he lived aboard his Swan 40, \"Chandelle\", and would take the cast and crew sailing on the weekends. In 1989, he sold \"Chandelle\" and bought a sloop sailboat, Cambria 46, which he named the \"Sea Angel\". According to David Walters Yachts, \"when Chris Reeve came to build a Cambria, he did not want a double entry 44. A new deck mold with a single entry was built, and was designated the new 46 model.\"\nHe sailed in the Caribbean and to Bermuda a few times. The coast of New England is what he knew best, sailing \"all over the East, Nova Scotia, and Maine.\" His favorite ports were Nantucket, Yarmouth, and Christmas Cove in Maine.\nEquestrianism and injury.\nReeve began his involvement in horse riding in 1985 after learning to ride for the film \"Anna Karenina\". He was initially allergic to horses, so he took antihistamines. He trained on Martha's Vineyard, and by 1989, he began eventing. His allergies soon disappeared.\nReeve purchased a 12-year-old American thoroughbred horse named Eastern Express, nicknamed \"Buck\", while filming \"Village of the Damned\". He trained with Buck in 1994 and planned to do Training Level events in 1995 and move up to Preliminary in 1996. Though Reeve had originally signed up to compete at an event in Vermont, his coach invited him to go to the Commonwealth Dressage and Combined Training Association finals at the Commonwealth Park equestrian center in Culpeper, Virginia. Reeve finished in fourth place out of 27 in the dressage, before walking his cross-country course. He was concerned about jumps 16 and 17 but paid little attention to the third jump, which was a routine fence shaped like the letter \"W\".\nOn May 27, 1995, Reeve's horse made a refusal. Witnesses said the horse began the third fence jump and suddenly stopped. Reeve fell forward off the horse, holding on to the reins. His hands became tangled in them, and the bridle and bit were pulled off the horse. He landed head first on the far side of the fence, shattering his first and second vertebrae. The resulting cervical spinal injury paralyzed him from the neck down and halted his breathing. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs. He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center. He had no recollection of the accident.\nHospitalization.\nAfter five days in which Reeve was heavily medicated and delirious, he regained full consciousness. His doctor explained to him his first and second cervical vertebrae had been destroyed and his spinal cord damaged. He was paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe without a ventilator.\nReeve's first thoughts when informed about the seriousness of his injury was he had ruined his life, would be a burden on his family, and it might be best to \"slip away\". He mouthed to his wife Dana, \"Maybe we should let me go.\" She tearfully replied, \"I will support whatever you want to do, because this is your life and your decision. But I want you to know that I'll be with you for the long haul, no matter what. You're still you. And I love you.\" In what she would later describe as a \"sales ploy\", she also told him that if he still wanted to die in two years they could reconsider the question.\nAfter this conversation, and visits from his children in which he saw how much they needed him, Reeve consented to lifesaving surgery and treatment for pneumonia. He never considered euthanasia as an option again.\nReeve went through inner anguish in the ICU, particularly when he was alone during the night. His upcoming operation to stabilize his spine in June 1995 \"was frightening to contemplate.\u00a0... I already knew that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery.\u00a0... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent. He announced that he was my proctologist, and that he had to examine me immediately.\" It was Robin Williams, reprising his character from the film \"Nine Months\". \"For the first time since the accident, I laughed. My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay.\" In addition to visits from friends and family, Reeve received over 400,000 letters from all over the world, which gave him great comfort during his recovery.\nJohn A. Jane performed surgery to repair Reeve's neck vertebrae. He put wires underneath both laminae and used bone from Reeve's hip to fit between the C1 and C2 vertebrae. He inserted a titanium pin and fused the wires with the vertebrae, then drilled holes in Reeve's skull and fitted the wires through to secure the skull to the spinal column. To access the cord, the surgeon had to cut a tendon on the right side of Reeve's neck, which became shorter and less flexible as a result, causing his head to tilt slightly to the right.\nRehabilitation.\nAfter a month in the hospital, Reeve spent six months at the Kessler Rehabilitation Center in West Orange, New Jersey, to continue with his recovery and learn skills such as operating his sip-and-puff electric wheelchair by blowing air through a straw. In his autobiography \"Still Me\", he described initially not wanting to face the reality of his disability. Getting used to sitting strapped into a wheelchair or taking a shower was initially terrifying. Reeve developed a deep fondness for many of the staff at Kessler, and through conversations with the other patients gradually started to see himself as being part of the disabled community.\nFor the first few months after the accident, Reeve relied on a ventilator, which was connected to his neck through a tracheostomy tube, for every breath. With therapy and practice, he developed the ability to breathe on his own for up to 90 minutes at a time.\nAt home, Reeve exercised for up to four or five hours a day, using specialized exercise machines to stimulate his muscles and prevent muscle atrophy and osteoporosis. He believed that intense physical therapy could regenerate the nervous system, and also wanted his body to be strong enough to support itself if a cure for paralysis were found.\nBeginning in 2000, he started to regain the ability to make small movements with his fingers and other parts of his body. By 2002, he could feel the prick of a needle and sense hot and cold temperatures on 65% of his body. He regularly exercised in a swimming pool and could push off with his legs from the side of a pool and make a snow angel movement with his arms. He also had a sense of proprioception, which is critical for movement control. Initially, Reeve was given an A grade on the ASIA Impairment Scale, indicating no motor or sensory function. In 2002, his grade was changed to C, indicating some degree of muscle movement and sensation. Reeve's doctors were surprised by his improvements, which they attributed to his intensive exercise regimen. The degree of his recovery was reported in scientific journals.\nIn February 2003, Reeve became the third patient in the United States to undergo an experimental procedure in which electrodes were implanted in his diaphragm to help him breathe without a ventilator. Previously, he could force air into his lungs using his neck muscles, which required a lot of effort. With a diaphragm pacing device, he was able to breathe normally through his nose, regaining his sense of smell and normal speech. At first, the device allowed him to breathe for 15 minutes an hour, but over time this increased up to 18 hours a day. In November 2003, Reeve appeared in public without a ventilator for the first time since his accident. In 2008, the device was approved by the FDA under a Humanitarian Device Exemption, and received premarket approval in 2023.\nLife with paralysis.\nIn December 1995, Reeve moved back to his home in Bedford, New York. By two years after the accident, Reeve said he was \"glad to be alive, not out of obligation to others, but because life was worth living.\" He continued to require round-the-clock care for the rest of his life, with a rotating team of 10 nurses and five aides working in his home.\nIn the aftermath of the accident, Reeve went through intense grief. He gradually resolved to make the best of his new life, with a busy schedule of activism, film work, writing and promoting his books, public speaking, and parenting. In 1998, he said in an interview:\nWho knows why an accident happens? The key is what do you do afterwards. There is a period of shock, and then grieving, with confusion and loss. After that, you have two choices. One is to stare out the window and gradually disintegrate. And the other is to mobilize and use all your resources, whatever they may be, to do something positive. That is the road I have taken. It comes naturally to me. I am a competitive person and right now I am competing against decay. I don't want osteoporosis or muscle atrophy or depression to beat me.\nIn another interview, Reeve said he drew on the self-discipline he had gained in his early years in the theater:\nNobody wants another actor. There's too many of them now already.\u00a0... To keep believing in yourself in spite of those kinds of obstacles is certainly good preparation for what I'm going through now.\nReligious views.\nFor most of his life, Reeve did not identify with any religion. He attended his stepfather's Presbyterian church as a teenager. In 1975, he briefly explored Scientology but chose not to become a member. He subsequently voiced criticism of the organization.\nReeve described his wedding in 1992 as his \"first act of faith\". After his accident, many well-wishers suggested that prayer would make him feel better, but he did not find it helpful. \"I wondered what was wrong with me\", he later wrote. \"I had broken my neck and become paralyzed, possibly forever, but still hadn't found God.\"\nIn his 2002 book \"Nothing Is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life\", Reeve said that he and his wife had regularly attended Unitarian services, starting in his late 40s. In the years following the accident, he had gradually come to believe that:\nSpirituality is found in the way we live our daily lives. It means spending time thinking about others. It's not so hard to imagine that there is some kind of higher power. We don't have to know what form it takes or exactly where it exists; just to honor it and try to live by it is enough.\u00a0... As these thoughts unfolded in the process of learning to live my new life, I had no idea that I was becoming a Unitarian.\nActivism.\nAt the age of 15, Reeve developed a passionate interest in political and social causes. He conducted a door-to-door campaign on behalf of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 and participated in protests against the invasion of Cambodia in 1970.\nAfter the release of \"Superman\", Reeve used his celebrity status to enable him to support several philanthropic causes. Through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, he visited terminally ill children. He joined the board of directors for the worldwide charity Save the Children. In 1979, he served as a track and field coach at the Special Olympics.\nReeve was critical of Ronald Reagan's presidency. In the 1980s, he campaigned for Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy and made speeches throughout the state. He served as a board member for the Charles Lindbergh Fund, which promotes environmentally safe technologies, and lent support to causes such as Amnesty International, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and People for the American Way. As a pilot with the Environmental Air Force he gave government officials and journalists aerial tours over areas of environmental damage. In 1983, Reeve was elected to Actors' Equity Association Council.\nIn late 1987, in Santiago, Chile, the country's dictator, Augusto Pinochet, threatened to execute 77 actors. Ariel Dorfman asked Reeve to help save their lives. Reeve flew to Chile and helped lead a protest march. A cartoon then ran in a newspaper showing him carrying Pinochet by the collar with the caption, \"Where will you take him, Superman?\" For his contribution to the protest, Reeve was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins, the highest Chilean distinction for foreigners. He also received an Obie Award and the Annual Walter Briehl Human Rights Foundation award. The following year, Reeve was among the international stars for the No campaign in the Chilean presidential referendum that marked the end of Pinochet's rule.\nReeve spoke out against Donald Trump's developing projects on West End Avenue in the late 1980s. The 1991 documentary \"\", which was suppressed for years, showed Reeve deliver a critical speech on the topic at a public event. The documentary also featured an interview in which Reeve called Trump's ambitions \"the American dream gone berserk\", adding, \"You're allowed to dream as big as you want, but if your dreams step on the lives of ordinary people and ruin the quality of their life and their neighborhood, you have to be stopped.\"\nIn 1993, a teacher at Flowing Wells High School was fired for staging a play with homosexual themes during the school's arts week. In response, People for the American Way held a forum on the issue of censorship in Tucson, Arizona. Reeve and several other actors performed an impromptu reading of the play to a standing ovation. Representing the actors on the panel discussion, Reeve was heckled by some parents, to which he responded, \"What I hear this lady saying is that she is uncomfortable with things that don't resemble her or her way of life. This country is founded on a completely different principle, which is tolerance and diversity.\" The dismissed teacher described the demonstration as \"a healing experience\".\nIn 1989, Reeve's friend Ron Silver started the Creative Coalition (TCC), a liberal organization aiming to teach celebrities how to speak knowledgeably about political issues. Reeve was an early member of the group, along with Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, and Blythe Danner. The group's initiatives included environmental issues and defending the National Endowment of the Arts, which was under attack from conservative Republicans who objected to taxpayer funding of art they considered offensive. Reeve was elected as a co-president of TCC in 1994. They were instrumental in starting residential recycling in New York, convincing the state legislature to allocate $1\u00a0billion to protect the city's watershed area, and stopping the building of a coal-fired power station near Albany. The organization's work was noticed nationwide, and the Democratic Party asked Reeve to run for the United States Congress. He replied, \"Run for Congress? And lose my influence in Washington?\" In 1997, TCC established the Christopher Reeve First Amendment Award.\nIn 1996, 10 months after his injury, Reeve appeared at the 68th Academy Awards to a long standing ovation. He used the occasion to encourage Hollywood to make more films on social issues, saying, \"Let's continue to take risks. Let's tackle the issues. In many ways our film community can do it better than anyone else.\"\nDisability activism.\nReeve left the Kessler Rehabilitation Center feeling inspiration from the other patients he had met. Because the media was constantly covering him, he decided to use his name to put focus on spinal cord injuries. He traveled across the country to make speeches and also hosted the 1996 Summer Paralympic Games in Atlanta and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. For these efforts, he was placed on the cover of \"Time\" on August 26, 1996.\nReeve was elected chairman of the American Paralysis Association and vice chairman of the National Organization on Disability. With Joan Irvine Smith, he co-founded the Reeve-Irvine Research Center, which is now one of the leading spinal cord research centers in the world. In 1999, the American Paralysis Association and Reeve's own foundation, established in 1996, were merged into the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which aims to speed up research through funding and to use grants to improve the quality of lives of people with disabilities. The Foundation to date has given more than $140\u00a0million to research and more than $46\u00a0million in quality-of-life grants. Reeve served as a board member for several organizations' aim to improve quality of life for people with disabilities.\nIn the mid-1990s, Reeve established the Christopher Reeve Acting Scholarship, which is given to a young disabled actor at the Media Access Awards, sponsored by the Reeve Foundation. The scholarship changed its name to the Christopher Reeve Acting Award in 2023.\nReeve's first effort to change disability legislation was in supporting a 1997 bill to raise the lifetime \"cap\" on insurance payments from $1\u00a0million to $10\u00a0million per person. For catastrophically injured people with one insurance policy, the $1\u00a0million limit often lasts just a few years. He said, \"There are certain CEOs of insurance companies taking home $300 million a year in personal income. That is outrageous. We need to make insurance companies provide the benefits they are supposed to, and we shouldn't have to fight for necessities.\" The bill was narrowly defeated. In 1999, he supported the Work Incentives Improvement Act, which allows people to continue to receive disability benefits after they return to work. This bill passed.\nReeve lobbied for expanded federal funding on embryonic stem cell research to include all embryonic stem cell lines in existence and for self-governance to make open-ended scientific inquiry of the research. President George W. Bush limited federal funding to research only on human embryonic stem cell lines created on or before August 9, 2001, the day he announced his policy, and allotted approximately $100\u00a0million for it. Reeve initially called this \"a step in the right direction\", admitting he did not know about the existing lines and would look into them further. He fought against the limit when scientists revealed an early research technique involved mixing the human stem cells with mouse cells contaminated most of the old lines.\nIn 2001, Reeve received Public Service Award from the American Society for Cell Biology for \"outstanding public service in support of biomedical research.\"\nIn 2002, Reeve lobbied for the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001, which would allow somatic cell nuclear transfer research, but would ban reproductive cloning. He argued stem cell implantation is unsafe unless the stem cells contain the patient's own DNA and because somatic cell nuclear transfer is done without fertilizing an egg, it can be fully regulated. In June 2004, Reeve provided a videotaped message on behalf of the Genetics Policy Institute to the delegates of the United Nations in defense of somatic cell nuclear transfer, which a world treaty was considering banning. In the final days of his life, Reeve urged California voters to vote yes on Proposition 71, which would establish the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine and would allot $3\u00a0billion of state funds to stem cell research. Proposition 71 was approved less than one month after Reeve's death.\nIn July 2003, Reeve's continuing frustration with the pace of stem cell research in the US led him to Israel, a country that was then, according to him, at the center of research in spinal cord injury. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited him to seek out the best treatment for his condition. During his visit, Reeve called the experience \"a privilege\" and said, \"Israel has very proactive rehab facilities, excellent medical schools and teaching hospitals, and an absolutely first-rate research infrastructure.\" Israelis were very receptive to Reeve's visit, calling him an inspiration to all and urging him never to give up hope.\nIn September 2003, Reeve was awarded the Lasker Public Service Award \"for his perceptive, sustained and heroic advocacy for medical research in general and victims of disability in particular.\"\nCommenting on Reeve's impact, Jerome Groopman said in 2003, \"I think that people of prominence or great resources are the ones who act as catalysts in our society.\u00a0... There was essentially no substantial funding of spinal-cord research before Reeve's injury, and now it is one of the hottest areas in neurobiology. Scientists are flocking to work in it, because science follows the money.\" Of Reeve, UC Irvine said, \"in the years following his injury, Christopher did more to promote research on spinal cord injury and other neurological disorders than any other person before or since.\"\nHealth problems and death.\nDuring his teenage years, Reeve suffered from occasional bouts of asthma and allergies. He sustained injuries in various sports activities, such as a broken ankle while skiing and a fractured rib from a riding mishap while training for \"Anna Karenina\". At Kessler Rehabilitation Center, he discovered that he hadn't fully recovered from malaria, which he contracted while scouting filming locations in Kenya in 1993.\nHe had a rare condition called mastocytosis, which made him vulnerable to anaphylaxis, and more than once he had a severe reaction to a drug. While at Kessler, he tried a drug which was theorized to help reduce damage to the spinal cord. The drug caused him to go into anaphylactic shock, and his heart stopped. He said he had an out-of-body experience and remembered saying, \"I'm sorry, but I have to go now\", during the event. In his autobiography, he wrote, \"and then I left my body. I was up on the ceiling.\u00a0... I looked down and saw my body stretched out on the bed, not moving, while everybody\u2014there were 15 or 20 people, the doctors, the EMTs, the nurses\u2014was working on me. The noise and commotion grew quieter as though someone were gradually turning down the volume.\" After receiving a large dose of epinephrine, he woke up and stabilized later that night. Two days later, he gave it another try, but experienced the same anaphylactic reaction and was immediately given epinephrine.\nAt age 16, he developed alopecia areata. Generally, he was able to comb over the bald spots and often the problem disappeared for long periods. The condition became more noticeable after his paralysis. He was given a medication for it, but an adverse reaction caused all the hair on his body to fall out, including his eyebrows and eyelashes.\nDuring 1996 and 1997, Reeve was frequently hospitalized for dysreflexia, pneumonia, a collapsed lung, and two blood clots. On one occasion, he was put incorrectly in a wheelchair, which caused him to fall and break his left arm. A titanium rod was inserted inside his humerus bone to stabilize his arm. In 1997, a small ulcer on his left ankle became infected, eventually spreading to the bone. He was warned that his leg might have to be amputated to prevent further spread of infection. Reeve sought help from specialists at Albany Medical Center, who examined his leg, removing the dead tissue and putting him on powerful antibiotics, although he developed an allergy after eight days. His leg fully healed a few months later.\nBy early October 2004, he was being treated for an infected pressure ulcer that was causing sepsis, a complication he had experienced many times before. On October 4, he spoke at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago on behalf of its work; it was his last reported public appearance. On October 9, Reeve attended his son Will's hockey game. That night, he went into cardiac arrest after receiving an antibiotic for the infection. He fell into a coma, and was taken to Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York. Eighteen hours later, on October 10, Reeve died at the age of 52. No autopsy was performed. However, both Reeve's wife, Dana, and his doctor, John McDonald, believed that an adverse reaction to a drug caused his death.\nHis remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery, where his ashes were sprinkled in the wind by his family. A memorial service for Reeve was held at the Unitarian Church in Westport, Connecticut, which was officiated by Frank Hall. Another private memorial service held at the Juilliard School three weeks later was attended by more than 900 people, with speakers.\nLegacy.\nReeve's widow Dana headed the Christopher Reeve Foundation after his death. Although a non-smoker, she was diagnosed with lung cancer on August 9, 2005. She died at age\u00a044 on March 6, 2006, and the foundation was subsequently renamed the Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation. Reeve's children serve on the board of directors of the foundation.\nFollowing Reeve's death, the Society for Neuroscience added his name to their satellite symposium dedicated to stem cell research. The Annual Christopher Reeve \"Hot Topics\" in Stem Cell Biology is held almost annually, except for 2020, 2021, and 2024.\nIn 2005, Princeton Day School established the Christopher Reeve '70 Sportsmanship Award that is awarded during the Invitational Ice Hockey Tournament. In 2006, Cornell University dedicated a plaque to Reeve at the Schwartz Center for the Performing Arts and established the Christopher Reeve '74 Scholarship that provides support to students majoring in theater, film, music, and English.\nIn 2005, the Williamstown Theatre Festival, where Reeve often performed during his career, announced that it would dedicate the final performance of every season to his memory and would establish a fund to support artists with disabilities. In 2015, Princeton Public Library created the Christopher Reeve Theater and Dramatic Arts Collection that consists of books on acting, screenwriting, theater, filmmaking, cinema studies, music and Broadway. Reeve's books are also part of the collection.\nFrom 2004 to 2016, Heart of America Foundation presented the Christopher Reeve Award, an annual scholarship funded by Merriam-Webster, Inc., to \"a student who has demonstrated outstanding compassion and caring by serving their community.\" In 2018, Drexel University College of Medicine established the Christopher Reeve Endowment Award \"as a scholarship fund for support of research and training of scientists and clinicians working in the area of spinal cord and brain injury research.\"\nIn March 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act that aims \"to enhance and further research into paralysis and to improve rehabilitation and the quality of life for persons living with paralysis and other physical disabilities.\"\nAlexander Newley's portrait of Reeve is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.\nOn September 25, 2021, Google celebrated Reeve's 69th birthday with a Google Doodle.\nA documentary about Reeve's life and the aftermath of his accident titled \"\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2024. On the 20th anniversary of Reeve's death, the Empire State Building was lit in blue, yellow, red, and orange colors in honor of the foundation's work and the wide release of the documentary. On October 25, 2024, a French documentary about Reeve titled \"Christopher Reeve: The Eternal Superman\" was released on TCM Cin\u00e9ma.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Palm Beach County had historically claimed all of the surface of the lake as part of its area, to its benefit for the distribution of state and federal highway funds. The state representative of Martin County, William Ralph Scott of Stuart, initiated a bill to divide the lake among its adjacent counties, creating a more equitable distribution of state funds for road creation and maintenance. All bordering counties confirmed the justice of this change and supported its ratification, with the exception of Palm Beach County. Representatives from Palm Beach County later presented Representative Scott with a jug of water, signifying \"all the water Bill Scott left Palm Beach County.\" The jug is in the possession of Stuart Heritage.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (27.8%) is water.

The area, officially named Cape Sable Census County Division, is virtually uninhabited. This area has 87.4 percent of the county's land area (859.6 out of ), but it had only 0.022 percent of the county's population (18 out of 82,170) as of the 2021 American Community Survey.

Flamingo, on the south coast and at the end of State Road 9336 (Flamingo Lodge Highway), is the location of the Flamingo Lodge and the Flamingo Ranger Station (with Visitor Center &amp; Marina). northeast on the highway is the West Lake Trail (station). Pinecrest, located in the northern interior of the county (in the Big Cypress National Preserve) on Loop Road (given that name since it forms a loop with U.S. Highway 41 further north), hosts the Loop Road Education Center. Trail City is west of Pinecrest on Loop Road. Loop Road can be found on most maps as CR 94, although the roadway no longer has a numbered designation and is now managed by the National Park Service.\nBetween the south coast of Florida's mainland and the Florida Keys is Florida Bay, which is encompassed by the Everglades National Park and contains numerous islets or keys.\nThe county is coterminous with the Key West-Key Largo, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area (\u03bcSA), with Key Largo and Key West designated as principal cities. The \u03bcSA was first defined in 2003 as the Key West-Marathon, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area. The name was changed to Key West, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area in 2006, and to Key West-Key Largo, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area in 2023. The \u03bcSA is part of the Miami-Port Saint Lucie-Fort Lauderdale Combined Statistical Area.\nProtected areas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 82,874 people, 32,839 households, and 18,586 families residing in the county.\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 73,090 people, 32,629 households, and 18,219 families living in the county.

It also manages the county's Tourism Development Council arts marketing grants and serves as a leading advocate for cultural tourism in lower Florida. In 1998, the Florida Keys Council of the Arts was designated by the Board of Monroe County Commissioners as the area's Local Arts Agency as provided by Florida Statute 286.011. Established in 1997 as the Monroe Council of the Arts Corporation. The name was changed to the Florida Keys Council of the Arts in 2001.

Cox and John W. Davis. However, unlike most Southern Democrats, Monroe County voters tended to be far more liberal on social issues such as civil rights and later gay rights, voting decisively for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and even supporting Hubert Humphrey in 1968, one of only three Florida counties to do so. Four years later, however, Richard Nixon easily carried the county in his 1972 landslide re-election, becoming the first Republican winner since 1888 by receiving over 70% of the vote.\nSince the 1970s, Monroe County has been a competitive swing county in presidential elections. Although Monroe voted for the Democratic candidate from 1992 to 2012, it was won by consistently narrow margins, such as 0.5% in 2004 and 2012. Barack Obama in 2008 was the first candidate for president to win a majority, 51.7%, of the vote since George H. W. Bush's national landslide victory in 1988. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican to carry the county in almost three decades, winning a majority and winning it by an even larger margin than Obama had won it by in 2008. In 2020, he won it by a still wider margin, and in 2024 he won by double digits.\nMonroe County is home to a large LGBT community, particularly in Key West. Due to the influence of this community, Monroe County was the only county in Florida to reject 2008 Florida Amendment 2, which banned same-sex marriage and civil unions in the state. The amendment passed in the state with 60% of the vote.\nMonroe County is politically divided by geography, with Key West voting reliably Democratic, Stock Island a swing area, and the rest of the archipelago voting reliably Republican. The western part of Key West is more strongly Democratic than the eastern part of the island.\nOn July 17, 2014, a county court judge ruled the state's ban on same sex marriage unconstitutional, ordering the county clerk of court to issue marriage licenses on July 22, 2014.\nLibraries.\nThe Monroe County Public Library system serves residents of the Florida Keys in five locations: Key West, Big Pine, Marathon, Key Largo, and Islamorada.\nThe Monroe County Public Library provides various programs and services to the Monroe County community, including job finding tools.

Night Shyamalan", "text": "American filmmaker (born 1970)\nManoj Nelliyattu &lt;templatestyles src=\"Nobold/styles.css\"/&gt;\"M. Night&lt;templatestyles src=\"Nobold/styles.css\"/&gt;\" Shyamalan ( ; born August 6, 1970) is an American filmmaker. His films often employ supernatural plots and twist endings. The cumulative gross of his films exceeds $3.3 billion globally. Shyamalan has received various accolades, including nominations for two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards and a Golden Globe.\nShyamalan was born in Mah\u00e9, India, and raised in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania. His early films include \"Praying with Anger\" (1992) and \"Wide Awake\" (1998) before his breakthrough film \"The Sixth Sense\" (1999), which earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. He then released \"Unbreakable\" (2000), \"Signs\" (2002) and \"The Village\" (2004). After a string of poorly received films\u2014\"Lady in the Water\" (2006), \"The Happening\" (2008), \"The Last Airbender\" (2010), and \"After Earth\" (2013)\u2014he experienced a career resurgence with \"The Visit\" (2015) and \"Split\" (2016). These were followed by \"Glass\" (2019), \"Old\" (2021), \"Knock at the Cabin\" (2023), and \"Trap\" (2024).\nShyamalan was also one of the executive producers and occasional director of the 20th Television science fiction series \"Wayward Pines\" (2015\u20132016) and the Apple TV+ psychological horror series \"Servant\" (2019\u20132023), for which he also served as showrunner.\nEarly life.\nManoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan was born on August 6, 1970, in Mah\u00e9, India, a town in the Union Territory of Puducherry. His father, Dr. Nelliyattu C. Shyamalan, is a Malayali neurologist from Mah\u00e9 and a JIPMER graduate; his mother, Dr. Jayalakshmi Shyamalan, a Tamil from Chennai, is an OB-GYN. \nShyamalan's parents immigrated to the United States when he was six weeks old. Shyamalan was raised Hindu in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania. He attended the private Roman Catholic grammar school Waldron Mercy Academy. He felt like an outsider and remembers that teachers would say that whoever was not baptized would go to hell. When he was a student there, a teacher once became upset because he \"got the best grade in religion class and [he] wasn't Catholic\". He later attended the Episcopal Academy, a private Episcopal high school located at the time in Merion Station, Pennsylvania.\nShyamalan earned the New York University Merit Scholarship in 1988, and was also a National Merit Scholar. Shyamalan is an alumnus of New York University Tisch School of the Arts in Manhattan, graduating in 1992. When reading about the Lakota, he discovered a person whose name was translated as 'Night' in English. He used Night thereafter instead of his original middle name, Nelliyattu. The name change was also in his view to draw audiences to his films with just his name, as with Hitchcock and Spielberg.\nShyamalan had an early desire to be a filmmaker when he was given a Super 8 camera at a young age. Though his father wanted him to follow in the family practice of medicine, his mother encouraged him to follow his passion. By the time he was seventeen, he had made forty-five home movies.\nCareer.\nFilm.\nShyamalan made his first film, the semi-autobiographical drama \"Praying with Anger\", while still a student at NYU, using money borrowed from family and friends. He wrote and directed his second movie, \"Wide Awake\". His parents were the film's associate producers. The drama dealt with a ten-year-old Catholic schoolboy (Joseph Cross) who, after the death of his grandfather (Robert Loggia), searches for God. The film's supporting cast included Dana Delany and Denis Leary as the boy's parents, as well as Rosie O'Donnell, Julia Stiles, and Camryn Manheim. \"Wide Awake\" was filmed in a school Shyamalan attended as a child and earned 1999 Young Artist Award nominations for Best Drama, and, for Cross, Best Performance. Only in limited release, the film grossed $305,704 in theaters, against a $6 million budget.\nThat same year Shyamalan co-wrote the screenplay for \"Stuart Little\" with Greg Brooker. In 2013, he revealed he was the ghostwriter for the 1999 film \"She's All That\", a teen comedy starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook. On June 17, 2013, Jack Lechner (who served as Miramax's head of development in the late 1990s) confirmed that both Shyamalan and R. Lee Fleming, Jr. contributed to the script: Fleming wrote the initial script that Miramax bought while Shyamalan did an uncredited rewrite (doing more than \"a polish\") that got the film green-lit. Lechner reiterated that content from both writers was included in the final cut of the film.\nShyamalan gained international recognition when he wrote and directed 1999's \"The Sixth Sense\", starring Bruce Willis, which became the second-highest grossing horror movie of all time. \"The Sixth Sense\" was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.\nIn July 2000, on \"The Howard Stern Show\", Shyamalan said he had met with Spielberg and was in early talks to write the script for the fourth \"Indiana Jones\" film. This would have given Shyamalan a chance to work with his longtime idol. After the film fell through, Shyamalan later said it was too \"tricky\" to arrange and \"not the right thing\" for him to do.\nShyamalan followed \"The Sixth Sense\" by writing and directing \"Unbreakable\" (2000), again starring Willis, a stealth superhero film within a thriller, which was both critically and financially successful.\nShyamalan's name was linked with the 2001 film \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", but it conflicted with the production of \"Unbreakable\". In July 2006, while doing press tours for \"Lady in the Water\", Shyamalan expressed he remained interested in directing one of the last two \"Harry Potter\" films: \"The themes that run through it\u00a0... the empowering of children, a positive outlook\u00a0... you name it, it falls in line with my beliefs\", Shyamalan said. \"I enjoy the humor in it. When I read the first \"Harry Potter\" and was thinking about making it, I had a whole different vibe in my head of it\".\nHis next film, \"Signs\", was released in 2002. The film stars Mel Gibson as a former Episcopalian priest who regains his faith in God during an alien invasion. It was both critically and financially successful and grossed $408 million from a budget of $72 million.\nShyamalan next directed \"The Village\" (2004), about an isolated community living in the woods. Although it received mixed reviews, it was financially successful as it grossed $257 million from a budget of $60 million.\nAfter the release of \"The Village\" in 2004, Shyamalan had been planning a film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel \"Life of Pi\" with 20th Century Fox, but later backed out so that he could make \"Lady in the Water\". In an interview he said about his reasons for dropping out of that project:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I love that book. I mean, it's basically [the story of] a kid born in the same city as me [Mahe, India] \u2014 it almost felt predestined. But I was hesitant because the book has kind of a twist ending. And I was concerned that as soon as you put my name on it, everybody would have a different experience. Whereas if someone else did it, it would be much more satisfying, I think. Expectations, you've got to be aware of them. I'm wishing them all great luck. I hope they make a beautiful movie.\nReleased in 2006, \"Lady in the Water\", a bedtime story about a water nymph and an apartment superintendent, was both critically and financially unsuccessful, only grossing $72 million worldwide from a budget of $70 million.\nNext was the film \"The Happening\", a science fiction thriller about an inexplicable natural disaster causing mass suicides, featuring a teacher and his wife fleeing from contaminated cities into the countryside. It was critically unsuccessful but financially successful as it grossed $163 million from a budget of $48 million.\nIn July 2008, it was announced that Shyamalan had partnered with Media Rights Capital to form a production company called Night Chronicles. Shyamalan would produce, but not direct, one film a year for three years. The first of the three films was \"Devil\", a supernatural thriller directed by siblings John and Drew Dowdle. The script was written by Brian Nelson, based on an original idea from Shyamalan. The movie was about a group of people stuck in an elevator with the devil, and starred Chris Messina. The film was not previewed by critics before its release.\nIn 2010, he directed \"The Last Airbender\", based on of the Nickelodeon TV series \"\". It was widely panned with the criticism aimed at its casting of white actors in Asian inspired roles, yet was a financial success, grossing $319 million from a budget of $150 million. It is considered to be one of the worst films of all time.\nIn 2013, Shyamalan directed the film \"After Earth\", based on a script by Gary Whitta and starring Will Smith and his son, Jaden. It was received poorly by critics, but was financially successful, making nearly $244 million against a budget of $130 million. Shyamalan later described his thinking in 2013 as full of doubts, introspection and questioning.\nShyamalan announced in January 2014 that he would be working again with Bruce Willis on a film titled \"Labor of Love\". As of March 2022, and the retirement of Willis, this film had yet to be produced.\nShyamalan's reputation was poor and most Hollywood studios passed on his self-funded, low-budget horror-comedy \"The Visit\", featuring a brother and sister who are sent to their grandparents' remote Pennsylvania farm for a weeklong visit. After revising the film, which Shyamalan had shot in secret, Universal picked up rights to \"The Visit\". The movie went on to gross $98 million worldwide on a budget of $5 million \u2013 the fifth-highest grossing thriller film of the year. Universal released the movie on September 11, 2015.\nIn 2017, Shyamalan released the movie \"Split\". It was both critically and financially successful and grossed $279 million from a budget of $9 million.\nIn 2019, he released \"Glass\" as the final installment in his 19-year trilogy inclusive of previous films \"Unbreakable\" and \"Split\". The movie grossed over $247 million worldwide.\nHis next film, \"Old\", a thriller about tourists who begin aging rapidly on a mysterious beach, was shot in the Dominican Republic and released on July 23, 2021. The film stars Gael Garcia Bernal, Eliza Scanlen, Thomasin McKenzie, Aaron Pierre, Alex Wolff, Abbey Lee, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Ken Leung, Vicky Krieps, Rufus Sewell, Embeth Davidtz, Alexa Swinton, Nolan River, and Emun Elliott. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\nIn October 2021, Shyamalan announced that his next film \"Knock at the Cabin\" would be released in cinemas on February 3, 2023. \"Knock at the Cabin\" premiered in New York City at the Rose Hall on January 30, 2023. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed over $54 million worldwide.\nIn February 2023, it was revealed Shyamalan's next film, titled \"Trap\", would be released in theatres on August 2, 2024 distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $85 million worldwide.\nTelevision.\nShyamalan is the executive producer on the Apple TV series \"Servant\". He directed several episodes, including the pilot. \"Servant\" was renewed for a second series in advance of the season one premiere. The second season of \"Servant\" completed filming in fall 2020 under COVID protocols.\nShyamalan was also instrumental in the creation of the Fox science fiction series \"Wayward Pines\" (2015\u20132016), for which he executive produced and directed the pilot episode. The series became the most-watched show of that summer.\nIn 2016, TNT first announced that Shyamalan would be responsible for a reboot series for \"Tales from the Crypt\". As of June\u00a02017[ [update]] the series had been cancelled due to a number of legal reasons.\nHe also appeared in an episode of the series \"Entourage\".\nProduction company.\nShyamalan's production company, Blinding Edge Pictures, is located in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. Blinding Edge has produced \"Servant\", \"Wayward Pines\", \"Devil\", \"The Happening\", \"Lady in the Water\", \"The Village\", \"Signs\", \"Unbreakable\", \"The Last Airbender\", \"After Earth\", \"The Visit\", \"Split\", \"Glass\" and \"Old\". It is run by Shyamalan and Ashwin Rajan. In February 2023, the company signed a multi-year first-look deal with Warner Bros., among them the Shyamalan-directed \"Trap\", which released theatrically on August 2, 2024.\nBooks.\nWhile working on his film \"The Happening\", Shyamalan developed an interest in improving the delivery of education in American schools. He hired doctoral student James Richardson to do most of the background research and as a result published \"I Got Schooled: The Unlikely Story of How a Moonlighting Movie Maker Learned the Five Keys to Closing America's Education Gap\" through Simon and Schuster in 2013. John Willol of NPR reviewed the book by stating \"\"I Got Schooled\" is a breezily written, research driven call to change America's approach to education. Shyamalan is smart and sincere, and his innovative ideas are unbound by the educational establishment.\"\nPersonal life.\nShyamalan married Bhavna Vaswani, a fellow student whom he met at New York University. The couple has three daughters, including director Ishana and musician Saleka. His cousin is actor Ritesh Rajan.\nShyamalan and his family live near Philadelphia at Ravenwood, a estate, built around a 1937 Georgian Revival house.\nShyamalan is a season ticket holder of the Philadelphia 76ers.\nIn 2023, Shyamalan bought a estate from the Rockefeller family in Willistown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, which has five historic houses and two barns for $24 million.\nShyamalan was born and raised in a Hindu family, educated at a Catholic school, and most of his movies contain Christian symbolism. Shyamalan considers himself \"pretty spiritual,\" but not religious. \"I do have a lot of thoughts about things in that realm beyond what we can touch and feel, but I'm not a huge fan of organized religion,\" said Shyamalan, \"although I'm very fascinated by it, so it comes into my movies a lot.\" \nCritical analysis and box-office performance.\n\"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"The Sixth Sense\" gave Shyamalan the reputation of \"the guy who makes the scary movies with a twist\". In 2008, Shyamalan said it was a common misperception that \"all [his] movies have twist endings, or that they're all scary. All [Shyamalan's] movies are spiritual and all have an emotional perspective\". He nonetheless avoided plot twists for years, until again using them starting with \"The Visit\" in 2015. \"Rolling Stone\" wrote in 2018,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In his twenties, [Shyamalan] says, \"I don't think you could have told me that making thrillers for your whole life wasn't a bad thing. At first it was a sense of, 'Hey, I can make anything.' But that's hypocritical, because when I pick up an Agatha Christie novel in my library, I have a strong expectation. So, I get it\u00a0... When I became happy with the idea of making thrillers for the rest of my life, everything went right.\"\nAfter the release of \"The Village\", \"Slate\"'s Michael Agger noted that Shyamalan was following \"an uncomfortable pattern\" of \"making fragile, sealed-off movies that fell apart when exposed to outside logic\".\nShyamalan has also been nominated for, and in some cases won, numerous Golden Raspberry Awards for \"Lady in the Water\" in 2006, \"The Happening\" in 2008, \"The Last Airbender\" in 2010, and \"After Earth\" in 2013. In 2016 he was also nominated for the Razzie Redeemer Award.\n\"The Village\", \"Lady in the Water,\" \"Split\" and \"Trap\" have been included in \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" annual top ten lists.\nShyamalan is also known for setting and shooting his films in and around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, along with nearby Reading, Pennsylvania. Most of his early commercially successful films were co-produced and released by Walt Disney Studios' Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures imprints. Films of his resurgence, however, were usually released by Universal Pictures.\nCritical reception and box-office performance.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nAwards and nominations.\nIn 2008, Shyamalan was honored with the Padma Shri award by the Government of India. Shyamalan was the Jury President of the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival competition section.\nControversy.\nSyFy Channel hoax.\nIn 2004, Shyamalan was involved in a media hoax with SyFy Channel, which was eventually uncovered by the press. SyFy claimed in its \"documentary\" special \"The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan\", shot on the set of \"The Village\", that as a child, Shyamalan had been dead for nearly half an hour while drowned in a frozen pond in an accident, and that upon being rescued he had experiences of communicating with spirits, fueling an obsession with the supernatural.\nIn truth, Shyamalan developed the hoax with SyFy, going so far as having SyFy staffers sign non-disclosure agreements with a $5 million fine attached and requiring Shyamalan's office to formally approve each step. Neither the childhood accident nor a supposed rift with the filmmakers ever occurred. The hoax included a nonexistent SyFy publicist, \"David Westover\", whose name appeared on press releases regarding the special. SyFy also fed false news stories to the Associated Press, Zap2It, and the \"New York Post\", among others.\nAfter an AP reporter confronted SyFy Channel president Bonnie Hammer at a press conference, Hammer admitted the hoax, saying it was part of a guerrilla marketing campaign to generate pre-release publicity for \"The Village\". This prompted SyFy's parent company, NBC Universal, to state that the undertaking was \"not consistent with our policy at NBC. We would never intend to offend the public or the press and we value our relationship with both.\"\nPlagiarism accusations.\nRobert McIlhinney, a Pennsylvanian screenwriter, sued Shyamalan in 2003, alleging similarities between \"Signs\" and his unpublished script \"Lord of the Barrens: The Jersey Devil\".\nIn 2004, Margaret Peterson Haddix claimed that \"The Village\" has numerous similarities to her young adult novel \"Running Out of Time\", prompting discussions with publisher Simon &amp; Schuster about filing a lawsuit.\nIn response to both allegations, Disney and Shyamalan's production company Blinding Edge issued statements calling the claims \"meritless\".\nOrson Scott Card has claimed that many elements of \"The Sixth Sense\" were plagiarized from his novel \"Lost Boys\", although he has said that enough had been changed that there was no point in suing.\nPop culture.\nAfter the release of \"The Happening\", \"The Guardian\"'s Kim Newman questioned, \"Can it be a kind of racism that the Indian-born, Philadelphia-raised auteur is hammered for his apparent character (or funny name) rather more than, say, Quentin Tarantino or Spike Lee?\" The British Film Institute (BFI) also discussed the impact of racism on Shyamalan's career, pointing to frequent mispronunciations of his last name. By 2017, \"Vice\" said that \"Shamalamadingdong\" had become the \"agreed-upon mockery of his name\".\nBFI asked if critical attacks are the result of egotistical statements on Shyamalan's part. They question whether his strong statements of self-assurance coupled with the remarkable success of \"The Sixth Sense\" set up a fall from grace which was soon realized when a run of very successful films (\"The Sixth Sense\", \"Unbreakable\", \"Signs\" and \"The Village\") seemingly collapsed with a string of critical failures (\"Lady in the Water\", \"The Happening\", \"The Last Airbender\", and \"After Earth\"). In 2019, Tim Greiving of \"The Washington Post\" said that \"his confidence was interpreted as arrogance by some, especially after he cast himself in \"Lady in the Water\" as a brilliant writer whose book is prophesied as a world-saver.\" Greiving continued, \"Howard, who expressed pride in him for forging ahead despite his turn among critics, noted how rare it was for such a young filmmaker to write, direct and produce original material. He wondered whether that placed a bigger target on his back, as his reputation for doggedness was perpetuated within the industry and reinforced by critics.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73633", "revid": "19992876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73633", "title": "Overkill (band)", "text": "American thrash metal band\nOverkill is an American thrash metal band, formed in 1980 in New Jersey. They have gone through many lineup changes, leaving bassist D.D. Verni and lead vocalist Bobby \"Blitz\" Ellsworth as the only remaining original members. The band's current lineup includes Verni, Ellsworth, Dave Linsk on lead guitar, Derek \"The Skull\" Tailer on rhythm guitar, and Jeramie Kling on drums. Along with Nuclear Assault and Anthrax, the latter of which featured one-time Overkill lead guitarist Dan Spitz, the band is one of the most successful East Coast thrash metal bands, and has been called \"the Mot\u00f6rhead of thrash metal\", due to their unique playing style which is influenced by punk and the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM). The band has a mascot named \"Chaly\" (a skeletal bat with a skull-like face, horns, bony wings and green eyes) that has appeared on many of their album covers.\nOverkill has released twenty studio albums, an album of cover songs, two extended plays (EPs), one demo tape and three live albums. They were one of the first thrash metal bands to be signed to a major label (having signed to Atlantic Records in 1986), and rose to popularity as part of the genre's movement of the mid-to-late 1980s, along with the \"Big Four\" (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax) and other bands such as Exodus and Testament. Overkill achieved its first mainstream success with their second studio album and Atlantic debut, \"Taking Over\" (1987), which peaked at number 191 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The band's next five studio albums \u2013 \"Under the Influence\" (1988), \"The Years of Decay\" (1989), \"Horrorscope\" (1991), \"I Hear Black\" (1993) and \"W.F.O.\" (1994) \u2013 were also successful on the \"Billboard\" charts, with the latter two entering the top 10 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Following their split with Atlantic in 1995, Overkill went through label changes but continued to enjoy moderate underground success, particularly in Europe and Japan. The band experienced a resurgence in the U.S. during the 2010s, with three of their studio albums released that decade \u2013 \"The Electric Age\" (2012), \"White Devil Armory\" (2014) and \"The Grinding Wheel\" (2017) \u2013 reaching the top 100 on the charts. Overkill has sold over 16 million records worldwide. They are estimated to have sold more than 625,000 records in the U.S. since the beginning of the SoundScan era.\nHistory.\nEarly years and \"Feel the Fire\" (1980\u20131986).\nOverkill was formed in 1980 by members of the punk band the Lubricunts, which featured bassist D.D. Verni and drummer Rat Skates. Verni and Skates placed an ad looking for a guitarist and lead singer, which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek and singer Bobby Ellsworth, and the first incarnation of Overkill was formed. After rejecting several names, including Virgin Killer, the band settled on Overkill, named after Mot\u00f6rhead's second album.\nEarly on, they covered punk songs by the Ramones, the Dead Boys and others. By late 1980, the band's setlist included songs by bands such as Mot\u00f6rhead (including songs from \"Overkill\" and half of the \"Ace of Spades\" album), Judas Priest (\"Tyrant\" in particular), and Riot. Along with the influx of heavy metal covers, the band still played a smattering of punk covers, with extra distortion, intensity, and speed. In 1981, the band went through a succession of guitarists after Pisarek left, first being replaced by Dan Spitz (who later joined Anthrax) and Anthony Ammendola, then Rich Conte and Mike Sherry, before settling with Bobby Gustafson in late 1982. Around this time, the band started writing original songs, including \"Grave Robbers\" (later renamed \"Raise the Dead\"), \"Overkill\", and \"Unleash the Beast (Within)\". More songs followed, including \"Death Rider\" (1981) and \"Rotten to the Core\" (1982). As the band continued to write original material, they became a staple at clubs in New York and New Jersey, such as L'Amour.\nIn 1983, the lineup of Verni, Skates, Ellsworth, and Gustafson released the \"Power in Black\" demo, a recording that made as much impact in the underground tape trading circuit as demos by then-up-and-coming Bay Area thrash metal bands, such as Exodus and Testament (then-called Legacy). \"Power in Black\" gained the band two compilation appearances: \"Feel the Fire\" was included on \"New York Metal '84\" while \"Death Rider\" appeared on the fifth volume of Metal Blade Records' \"Metal Massacre\" series. The success of \"Power in Black\" also enabled the band to secure a small recording deal with Azra/Metal Storm Records, resulting in the 1985 four-track extended play (EP) \"Overkill\", which quickly sold out, pushing the band to the forefront of the fledgling thrash metal movement. Long out of print, the vinyl-only EP is now considered a rare collector's item, and all the songs appeared eleven years later on the compilation album \"!!!Fuck You!!! and Then Some\".\nThough it is said that the band never received money from its release, the \"Overkill\" EP garnered the band massive underground interest and the attention of Jon Zazula, owner of Megaforce Records, a prominent independent heavy metal record label at the time. Megaforce signed Overkill to a multi-album record contract and released their full-length debut album, \"Feel the Fire,\" in October 1985. Hailed by many critics and fans as a thrash metal masterpiece, the album cemented the band's position as a driving force of the East Coast thrash metal movement. The band spent the better part of 1985 and 1986 touring in support of \"Feel the Fire\", touring Europe with Anthrax and Agent Steel, and opening for Slayer on their \"Reign in Blood\" tour in North America. Overkill's tour schedule and the growing buzz for \"Feel the Fire\" resulted in several major labels courting the band. They eventually signed to Atlantic Records, making Overkill one of the early thrash metal bands to sign with a major label.\nRise to success (1987\u20131990).\nOverkill's second album, \"Taking Over\", was released in March 1987; it was the first to be released by Megaforce with distribution from Atlantic Records. The album featured longer songs and improved production. \"Taking Over\" brought the band public recognition, becoming their first album to enter the \"Billboard\" 200, while Overkill's first-ever music video, \"In Union We Stand\", received significant airplay on MTV's \"Headbangers Ball\". Another European tour followed, this time opening for Helloween. Overkill also opened for Megadeth on their \"Peace Sells\" tour in North America, and headlined their own U.S. tour, with support from Nuclear Assault and then-labelmates Testament.\nIn late 1987, the \"!!!Fuck You!!!\" EP was released, consisting of a studio cover version of the Subhumans' \"Fuck You\" and a handful of live tracks recorded earlier that year at the Phantasy Theater in Cleveland. 1987 also saw the departure of founding drummer Rat Skates. He was replaced temporarily by Mark Archibole, and then permanently by Danish drummer Bob \"Sid\" Falck, formerly of Paul Di'Anno's Battlezone. Overkill closed out the year with a one-off show at the Christmas on Earth festival in Leeds, England, together with Megadeth, Kreator, Nuclear Assault, Voivod, the Cro-Mags, L\u0227\u0227z Rockit and Virus.\nOverkill released their third album, \"Under the Influence\", in July 1988. Once again produced by Alex Perialas, who worked on the band's first two albums, \"Under the Influence\" was rawer and thrashier, lacking most of the epic atmosphere heard on \"Taking Over\". \"Hello from the Gutter\" was released as a single, and its music video gained regular airplay on \"Headbangers Ball\". Overkill kept touring all over the world, furthering their reputation as one of the most active live metal bands. This included opening for Slayer on their \"South of Heaven\" tour in the United States and Europe, and performing with Anthrax, Mot\u00f6rhead, Anvil, Nuclear Assault, M.O.D., Testament, Vio-lence, King's X, Prong, Murphy's Law, Ludichrist and Znowhite.\nOverkill released their fourth album, \"The Years of Decay\", in October 1989. Produced by Terry Date (who later worked with the likes of Pantera, White Zombie, Soundgarden and Deftones), the album featured the band's best production value to date, as well as Overkill's most progressive and diverse work compared to previous albums. It combined the raw approach of \"Under the Influence\" with more complex song structures and epic elements of \"Taking Over\", resulting in a more serious atmosphere and longer songs, including the eight-minute title track and the ten-minute \"Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher\", the latter being the longest track Overkill has recorded to date. Although the album charted lower than \"Under the Influence\" on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 155, \"The Years of Decay\" was a breakthrough album for Overkill, selling over 67,000 copies within the next decade-and-a-half, and includes one of the band's best-known songs, \"Elimination\", for which a music video received regular airplay on \"Headbangers Ball\". That song became a fan favorite and remains a staple in the band's live repertoire. Overkill toured extensively in support of \"The Years of Decay\" between November 1989 and June 1990, with bands such as Testament, Wolfsbane, Dark Angel, Vio-lence, Mordred, Powermad, Whiplash and Excel.\n\"Horrorscope\", \"I Hear Black\" and \"W.F.O.\" (1990\u20131995).\nAfter \"The Years of Decay\" tour ended in the summer of 1990, Gustafson left Overkill. Accounts vary as to how and why he split with the band: he had been either fired by Verni and Ellsworth, or had left Overkill following an argument over the band's musical direction. Gustafson said that one of the reasons he left Overkill was due to disagreements over royalties, during which he became embroiled in a feud with Verni and Ellsworth. The remaining members added two new guitarists to the band: Rob Cannavino, who had been Gustafson's guitar technician, and Merritt Gant, formerly of Faith or Fear. Ellsworth stated in an interview with \"Invisible Oranges\" years later that the reason Overkill hired two guitarists was mainly because they wanted to do something different: \"We knew if we replaced Bobby with one guitarist, we'd get compared to what we were. So, it seemed like to logical thing to bring in two players. We didn't want anyone to say, 'Bobby was better than this new guy.' And we wanted to perform old stuff with two guitars to keep in fresh. We realized that change isn't a bad thing.\"\nThe \"new\" Overkill recorded their fifth album, \"Horrorscope\", again produced by Terry Date, in 1991. Featuring the furious riffs and trade-off solos of new guitarists Cannavino and Gant, and the refined songwriting of Verni and Ellsworth, \"Horrorscope\" silenced worries from fans that the band would not recover from their split with Gustafson. The album is regarded as one of Overkill's defining moments and is arguably their heaviest release. Focusing on a darker, heavier style, the album spawned the doomy single \"Horrorscope\", a departure from the band's earlier singles, which were traditionally uptempo songs. \"Horrorscope\" was Overkill's first album to be accompanied by more than one music video or single; there were music videos for the title track and \"Thanx for Nothin'\" (both of which received airplay on \"Headbangers Ball\"), while songs like \"Coma\", \"Infectious\" and the cover version of Edgar Winter's \"Frankenstein\" received particular attention (through radio or otherwise), expanding the band's popularity in the heavy metal community, and helping the album enter the Top 30 on the \"Billboard\" Heatseekers chart. Overkill supported \"Horrorscope\" by touring North America with Anacrusis and Galactic Cowboys in 1991 and Armored Saint in 1992, after which drummer Sid Falck left the band. Admittedly never a big fan of thrash metal, Falck said he initially wanted to push his drumming to the limit by playing the most complex type of music, and in time he decided to pursue other musical interests. Although later in an interview with \"Antichrist\" magazine he said it was misquotation, and that he still listens to thrash metal exclusively.\nFalck was replaced by former M.O.D. drummer Tim Mallare, with whom the next Overkill album \"I Hear Black\" was recorded. Released in March 1993, \"I Hear Black\" reunited the band with producer Alex Perialas, and was the first Overkill album released directly through Atlantic Records. The album again presented a change in style, from the heavy thrash of \"Horrorscope\" to a more stoner/blues rock-oriented style influenced by Black Sabbath. The eclectic nature of the album is often attributed to the number of songwriters involved. Verni and Ellsworth handled most of the songwriting on subsequent albums, with only minor contributions from other members. A music video was shot for \"Spiritual Void\" and it received minor airplay on \"Headbangers Ball\". The European leg of the 1993 \"World of Hurt Tour\" featured Savatage and Non-Fiction as support acts.\nOverkill's self-produced seventh album, \"W.F.O.\" (which stands for \"Wide Fuckin' Open\", a common biker term), was released on July 15, 1994, in response to the criticism that \"I Hear Black\" had received. The album was fast, old school thrash metal without the experimental elements of \"I Hear Black\" in favor of a groove-oriented sound. The music video for \"Fast Junkie\" received little or no airplay from MTV, due to changing mainstream tastes and limited airplay availability for metal bands. Overkill continued to have bigger success overseas, mounting an extensive European tour in the fall, supported by Jag Panzer and Massacra.\nWith grunge dominating the airwaves in the United States, many heavy metal radio stations changing formats and \"Headbangers Ball\" going off the air, \"W.F.O.\" failed to find an audience, and in 1995 Overkill split with Atlantic Records. The band was happy to leave the major label, where they felt they received little or no attention and signed to different record companies around the world (CMC International in the US).\nA March 1995 show, once again in Cleveland, Ohio, was recorded for Overkill's first full-length live album, a near 100-minute double CD entitled \"Wrecking Your Neck\". The album was released in May 1995, with the first pressing featuring a bonus CD containing the \"Overkill\" EP that had been out of print for years. A music video for the song \"Bastard Nation\" taken from \"Wrecking Your Neck\" was released, but failed to receive airplay in the US.\nPost-Atlantic years (1995\u20132002).\nLate in 1995, Cannavino and Gant left the band, Cannavino to focus on motorcycle racing and Gant to spend more time with his family. Overkill hired Joe Comeau, former singer of Liege Lord, on guitar. Comeau brought along former Anvil guitarist Sebastian Marino, with whom he had worked in the past. The new lineup recorded \"The Killing Kind\" in 1996, again self-produced and mixed by Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest). While staying within the thrash genre, the album was a departure from its predecessor's more traditional thrash metal style and featured different elements such as hardcore, while the vocals showed influences from a broad spectrum of music. As Comeau was also a singer, backing vocals on \"The Killing Kind\" and subsequent albums were more elaborate and frequent than before, adding another element to the band's sound. Press response to \"The Killing Kind\" was positive, but the album remains a hotly contested topic among the band's audience, with some longtime fans resistant to the new modern elements, and others hailing \"The Killing Kind\" as one of the band's finest moments.\nOverkill toured Europe twice in support of \"The Killing Kind\" first in February 1996 with Megora and Accu\u00a7er, and again in November with Anvil and Stahlhammer. In the summer of 1996, Overkill appeared on Volume 2 of Century Media's \"Legends of Metal \u2013 A Tribute to Judas Priest\" compilation, to which they contributed \"Tyrant\".\nIn October 1996, the band released \"!!!Fuck You!!! and Then Some\". The album included the \"!!!Fuck You!!!\" EP, which had been out of print for some years, along with the classic \"Overkill\" EP and two live tracks from a 1990 promo single. The following year saw the release of the ninth Overkill studio album, titled \"From the Underground and Below\". It retained some of the modern influences from \"The Killing Kind\", while also reincorporating elements from the band's earlier efforts. Some songs on \"From the Underground and Below\", including \"Save Me\", even had a slight industrial metal sound. Reportedly, a video for the track \"Long Time Dyin'\" was shot, but received no television exposure. In 1998, the band once again opted to tour only Europe in support of the album, touring alongside Nevermore, Angel Dust and Nocturnal Rites.\nIn 1998, Ellsworth was diagnosed with an aggressive form of nose cancer and underwent immediate surgery, stopping the cancer before it spread. After his recovery, the band started work on their tenth studio album. The self-produced \"Necroshine\" was released in February 1999, making Overkill the first thrash metal band to release ten full-length studio albums. While once again different from the previous records and musically not considered \"classic\" Overkill, the album was vocally even more experimental than \"The Killing Kind\", and was well received by fans and critics.\nBefore the release of \"Necroshine\", Sebastian Marino left Overkill to spend more time with his family. He was replaced by Dave Linsk from New Jersey hardcore/thrash metal band Anger on Anger. A two-week European trip in June was arranged to fill the gap between appearances at the Dynamo and With Full Force festivals.\nOctober 1999 saw the release of \"Coverkill\", an album of cover versions from bands that were especially influential to Overkill, such as Black Sabbath, Kiss, Mot\u00f6rhead, Manowar, and the Ramones. Some tracks had previously been available on compilations or as bonus tracks, but others had been shelved for years (the earliest recording was from the \"Under the Influence\" sessions) or were recorded immediately before the album's release. A full European tour in support of both \"Necroshine\" and \"Coverkill\" took place in February 2000, as Overkill co-headlined with Canadian thrash metal band Annihilator, with German band Dew-Scented in the opening slot.\nDuring the European tour, Annihilator fired their lead singer Randy Rampage due to disruptive behavior. A few months later, Joe Comeau was confirmed as his replacement. The band returned to the studio as a four-piece, and in the fall of 2000, released \"Bloodletting\". It was again produced by the band and mixed by Colin Richardson.\nIn November 2000, the band toured Europe as a special guest on Halford's \"Resurrection\" world tour. Since Overkill had not yet found a new second guitarist, Comeau joined on a temporary basis for the tour. For the last couple of shows, the band also utilized another session musician. With D.D. Verni's wife giving birth to their second child, Verni missed a week or two of shows, and Derek Tailer of Dee Snider's band SMFs filled in. In 2002, Tailer was announced as a permanent member of Overkill, although not on bass, but filling the vacant second guitarist position.\nSwitching labels and drummers (2002\u20132008).\nAfter a break, Overkill resurfaced in 2002 with \"Wrecking Everything\", their second full-length live album, recorded at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The album contained only songs that had not been on \"Wrecking Your Neck\", some because they were released on later albums, but also a few early songs from albums such as \"Taking Over\", \"Under the Influence\" and \"The Years of Decay\". The same show was used for Overkill's first ever DVD, \"Wrecking Everything \u2013 An Evening in Asbury Park\", also released in 2002.\nThe European tour in June 2002, supporting \"Bloodletting\" and \"Wrecking Everything\", saw Blaze and Wicked Mystic opening for Overkill. During the second to last show of the tour in Nuremberg, Germany, Blitz suffered a stroke on stage. For nearly three days, there were rumors that Blitz was in a coma, permanently paralyzed, or dead. Three days later, the band announced that the stroke was minor and had no lasting consequences.\nOverkill signed to Spitfire Records and entered the studio in late 2002 to record their twelfth studio album, \"Killbox 13\". Produced by the band and Colin Richardson, and released in March 2003, the album was their twelfth regular studio album, but the \"Overkill\" EP was counted to make it 13. The album received critical acclaim, combining the \"new\" Overkill with their raw early style heard on their debut \"Feel the Fire\". Touring for the album included a number of European festivals during the summer, and a full European tour followed in November with Seven Witches and After All. The band played without Derek Tailer, who was absent for undisclosed reasons. Nobody was hired to fill in for him, so Overkill toured as a four-piece for the first time since 1990. Tailer was still considered a full member of the band.\nIn late 2004, after a Japanese tour with Death Angel and Flotsam and Jetsam, the band started work on another record in D.D. Verni's own recording studio. The album, \"ReliXIV\", was produced and mixed by the band themselves and released in March 2005.\nOverkill toured the eastern US in April 2005, and before they went on a European tour in May, it was announced that Mallare would not take part in this tour, with former Hades drummer Ron Lipnicki replacing him. A few weeks later, the band announced that Mallare had permanently left and Lipnicki was his replacement. In the summer of 2005, Overkill organized their first US West Coast tour in more than ten years, playing Western Canada to Southern California. The tour was such a success that the band was added to the 2006 Gigantour as second-stage headliners, marking Overkill's first nationwide US tour since 1994.\nNow with the Bodog Music label, the band rejoined forces with Jonny and Marsha Zazula, previous owners of Megaforce Records, who were part of the Bodog Team in the United States. Overkill released its 14th studio album, \"Immortalis\", on October 9, 2007. The album featured founders Bobby Ellsworth and D.D. Verni, guitarists Dave Linsk and Derek Tailer, and new drummer Ron Lipnicki. Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe contributed vocals on the song \"Skull and Bones\".\nReturn to popularity (2009\u20132017).\nOn October 30, 2009, it was announced that Overkill had inked a multi-album deal with Nuclear Blast. The band's 15th album, \"Ironbound,\" described as a \"thrashter-piece\", was released on February 9, 2010. The album marked a \"comeback\" for Overkill after years of lackluster record sales and declining popularity in the U.S. since the mid-1990s. It was the band's first album to appear on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart since 1993's \"I Hear Black\", peaking at number 192. The band was playing at Times Square in New York City on May 1, 2010 as part of their \"Ironbound\" tour when someone unsuccessfully attempted to blow up a nearby car with fireworks. The show proceeded without interruption, but some ticket holders arriving late were prevented from entering the theater by police responding to the incident. Overkill had toured for almost two years promoting \"Ironbound\"; it started with a European trek in February 2010 (supported by Suicidal Angels, Savage Messiah and Cripper), followed two months later by a U.S. tour with Vader, God Dethroned, Warbringer, Evile and Woe of Tyrants. The band toured the U.S. again in the fall (this time with Forbidden, Evile, Gama Bomb and Bonded by Blood), and then did a European run in March 2011 with Destruction, Heathen, After All and Bonded by Blood. The tour cycle for \"Ironbound\" ended in South America in the fall of 2011.\nIn July 2011, Overkill began demoing six songs and announced they were planning to begin recording their 16th album in October for an early 2012 release. The resulting album, \"The Electric Age\", was released on March 27, 2012, and it was the band's first album to enter the top 100 on the \"Billboard\" 200, peaking at number 77, Overkill's highest chart position at the time. In 2013, the band embarked on \"The Dark Roots of Thrash\" tour of North America, headlined by Testament, and supported by Flotsam and Jetsam and 4Arm. They canceled their February 15 show in Huntington at The Paramount Theatre due to singer Bobby Ellsworth being diagnosed with \"walking pneumonia\". On February 18, it was announced that Overkill dropped out of the \"Dark Roots of Thrash\" tour as Blitz's condition had gotten slightly worse after the show in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nOn August 31, 2013, Overkill entered Gear Recording to begin recording their seventeenth studio album. The album was going to be released on March 7, 2014. On January 14, however, it was announced that the album was postponed to July. On March 15, it was revealed that the new album would be titled \"White Devil Armory\". After some delays, \"White Devil Armory\" was released on July 22, 2014. The album was their most successful, peaking at No. 31 on the \"Billboard\" 200, Overkill's highest chart position yet.\nOverkill played a special show on April 16, 2016 in Oberhausen, where they played the \"Feel the Fire\" and \"Horrorscope\" albums in their entirety. The show was professionally filmed and recorded for the DVD \"Live in Overhausen\", released on May 18, 2018.\nOverkill released a box set, \"\", on October 16, 2015. To support the box set, Overkill embarked on a North American tour with Symphony X in September\u2013October 2015, and a UK tour in April 2016. In a September 2015 interview, Ellsworth revealed that Overkill had begun writing their eighteenth studio album, and by March 2016, they had \"fully demoed\" eleven songs for it. Ellsworth said in a March 2016 interview that Overkill would begin recording the album in early May for an October release. On April 16, 2017, the band announced that drummer Ron Lipnicki would miss the European tour due to a family emergency, and he would be replaced by Eddy Garcia, which was later confirmed to be a \"personal issue\" from Lipnicki. On August 13, 2016, \"The Grinding Wheel\" was announced as the name of the album, and Ellsworth said the band was \"looking for a first-week-of-November release\"; however, the album's release date was pushed back to February 10, 2017. \"The Grinding Wheel\" was another successful album for Overkill. It reached number 69 on the \"Billboard\" 200, the band's second-highest chart position behind \"White Devil Armory\". To support the album, Overkill toured North America with Nile, and supported former Sepultura members Max and Igor Cavalera in Europe on their Return to Roots tour. They also headlined the 2017 edition of the Metal Alliance Tour, supported by Crowbar, Havok, Black Fast and Invidia.\nJason Bittner-era (2017\u20132024).\nOn May 4, 2017, Overkill announced that Jason Bittner (Shadows Fall and formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam) had replaced Lipnicki as the drummer of the band. Lipnicki later went on to join Whiplash.\nOn February 9, 2018, Overkill announced that they were in the studio working on demos for its nineteenth studio album. Pre-production of the album began that April, and Ellsworth announced that it would be released in February 2019. On June 1, 2018, the band announced that they had begun recording the album. During an interview with Eddie Trunk on \"Trunk Nation\" on October 10, 2018, Verni announced that the album was finished. He was quoted as saying, \"I just got the final sequencing and all that, so that's all buttoned up. We're working on the cover now. We still don't have a title \u2014 we're gonna have to come up with that soon \u2014 but we have a lot of things floating around. And the new release will probably be in February.\" On November 28, 2018, Overkill announced that the album was titled \"The Wings of War\" and would be released on February 22, 2019. The band promoted the album by headlining the 2019 edition of the Killfest Tour, supported by Destruction, Flotsam and Jetsam and Meshiaak, touring North America in the spring with Death Angel and Mothership, and performing at Megadeth's first-ever MegaCruise in the Pacific Ocean that October. They continued to tour in support of \"The Wings of War\" in 2020, including touring the U.S. with Exhorder and Hydraform, and appearing at a handful of metal-related festivals in Europe.\nIn June 2019, it was reported that Overkill was expected to start writing new material for their 20th studio album by the beginning of 2020. In an interview with Metal Exhumator in October 2019, Ellsworth said, \"We just sat down and talked about starting to write in the spring. Maybe late spring, early summer, just say maybe we should just schedule some time to do it. But there's been no ideas with regard to where it's going to go.\" Bittner revealed in an April 2020 interview with Metal Pilgrim that Verni had written nine songs for the album, but added that plans to enter the studio were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic: \"So our plan was to start working on new material, but considering the fact that we have to stay in our spaces right now, we're just kind of doing things electronically and it's just given D.D. some more time to write. Because we were kind of on a little bit of a timeline, 'cause we \u2014 well, all right, I'll say we \"had\" a plan, but everybody had a plan before last month.\" He mentioned that a European tour in March 2021 to support the album was in the works: \"We have no idea if that's gonna even be a possibility right now, because timelines that we had for the record label and whatnot are no longer those anymore, because the record label is shut down and \"nobody\" is doing any business right this very second.\" Ellsworth stated in an interview with A&amp;P Reacts in June 2020 that a new Overkill album was expected to be released in April 2021, with a tour supporting it to follow. Bittner later revealed that the band had recorded 11 demos for the album, and added, \"I think right now, the last time I talked to D.D., our idea is to try to start getting drums done, like, September-ish, depending on what happens. The problem is that we really can't do our regular pre-production right now, because we all don't live in the same state.\" On September 5, 2020, Bittner announced on his Facebook profile that Overkill would enter the studio on September 14 to begin recording their new album. Drum tracks were finished by October, and mixing was handled by Colin Richardson, who had previously worked with Overkill in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In an interview on That Metal Interview in October 2020, Bittner said its release could be pushed back to the fall of 2021 due to the COVID pandemic, explaining, \"Lord knows what's gonna happen. God forbid it gets worse. It might even be pushed back even longer. But the point is at least we're gonna get it done.\" Verni reiterated Bittner's comments about a possible release date, saying, \"I don't know. We're trying to coordinate it maybe with some touring. We don't really have any touring till next July, I think, our first shows. We have shows [booked] in July, August, September, October. Whether any of them are gonna happen, I don't know, but probably something like that for the new Overkill release. So I'll be working on that between now and then.\" Bittner later said the release of the album was pushed back to February 2022. In an August 2021 interview on \"Trunk Nation With Eddie Trunk\", Verni revealed that Overkill was still recording their 20th studio album and planned to mix it in the fall for a March 2022 release coincided with a tour. Ellsworth stated in a March 2022 interview that it was not expected to be released before April 2023.\nOn November 13, 2021, Overkill performed their first show in \"609 f!!kin' days\" at the Wellmont Theater in New Jersey. Supported by Demolition Hammer and Sworn Enemy, it was a make-up date for a show initially scheduled for March 14, 2020 but cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this show, Phil Demmel (formerly of Machine Head and Vio-lence) filled in for guitarist Dave Linsk, who was unable to perform. Demmel again filled in for him during the band's spring 2022 tour with Prong.\nOn December 9, 2022, the band debuted a song titled \"Wicked Place\" during their performance at the Ruhrpott Metal Meeting festival in Oberhausen from their then-upcoming 20th studio album. The resulting album, \"Scorched\", was released on April 14, 2023. In support of the album, Overkill embarked on a headlining European and US tour with Exhorder and Heathen. The band performed at the parking lot of the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on August 6, 2023, the same day Metallica played at the venue as part of the latter's M72 World Tour. Overkill continued to tour in support of \"Scorched\" with a tour over Latin America in April 2024, where former Megadeth bassist David Ellefson filled in for Verni, who was unable to perform due to recovery from shoulder surgery. Verni played his first show back with Overkill at the Milwaukee Metal Fest on May 17, 2024.\nSeveral months after the release of \"Scorched\", Derek Tailer said that Overkill would begin work on their 21st studio album after the \"Scorched\" tour in 2024 for a tentative 2025 release.\nJeramie Kling-era and upcoming 21st studio album (2024\u2013present).\nOn August 5, 2024, Bittner announced that he was leaving Overkill to focus on Shadows Fall and his new band Category 7. Later that month, it was revealed that Jeramie Kling was the band's new drummer, and he played his first show with Overkill on August 30, at the Posada Rock festival in C\u00e2mpulung Muscel, Romania. During the band's summer and fall 2024 European tour, former Kreator bassist Christian \"Speesy\" Giesler filled in for Verni, who was unable to perform due to an ongoing \"shoulder issue\". Overkill (along with Night Demon) supported King Diamond on their Saint Lucifer's Hospital 1920 tour in North America from October to December 2024, which saw former Fear Factory and Vio-lence bassist Christian Olde Wolbers fill in for Verni. Also on this tour, the band performed as a four-piece for the first time in years, with Tailer sitting out one show due to illness.\nWhen asked in September 2024 when Overkill was going to begin work on their 21st studio album, Ellsworth said, \"We're looking at, I suppose, the majority of the first half of 2025 as being that timeframe for the writing. And probably recording by the end of 2025 and then releasing in 2026.\" Kling announced in August 2025 that the band had begun writing and demoing new material for the upcoming album.\nArtistry.\nMusical style and legacy.\nOverkill's beginnings predate the formation of all of the \"Big Four\" of thrash metal bands (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer) by at least one year. While the band is often recognized for its fast and heavy style, their music lacked enough variety to rival the \"Big Four\"; regardless, Overkill maintained its unique sound throughout its career instead of trying to gain popularity with a more commercial style. The band has been viewed as one of the most important thrash bands from the East Coast, and they are considered to be one of the most active bands of the genre, having never disbanded or gone on hiatus, nor taken more than four years to release an album.\nAlong with Exodus and Testament, Overkill has been the subject of which thrash metal band should be included in an expanded \"Big Four\". When asked in September 2014 about the idea of either Overkill, Exodus or Testament being included in the \"Big Five\" of thrash metal, frontman Bobby Ellsworth said, \"Aw man, that's gonna put me in a corner! We measure our success in days, not dollars! But maybe you can find the answer in what I'm going to say. When [playing thrash metal] became harder in the '90s with grunge music, we never had a question about if we would stop doing it and go work for our moms and dads or something. We just needed to make it happen. We weren't going to let grunge stop us. And if it did, we'd just go back to the underground. I liked it there anyway!\" Commenting on the fact that Overkill did not become part of the \"Big Four\", Ellsworth stated, \"When it comes to being selected and not selected, that's a simple accounting issue. When you talk numbers, numbers make the world go around, numbers put food on your table, and numbers put the 'Big Four' in arenas. And they sell enough records to do that. For me, it's not a concern. To even be asked the question from you is quite a compliment with regard to, let's say, our longevity or tenacity doing what we like doing. But this is quite simply an accounting issue. He who sells the most gets the pole positions.\"\nOverkill's sound has influenced the genre of thrash metal. Their technique draws on bits and pieces of punk and hard rock as well as the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM). These elements blend to create a fast, aggressive style unique to the band and make Overkill's sound easily recognizable to metal fans; as a result, they have been referred to as \"the Mot\u00f6rhead of thrash metal.\"\nOverkill has been cited as an influence by Pantera, Sepultura and Slipknot, as well as bands from the so-called \"thrash metal revival\" scene of the 2000s, including Evile, Havok and Mantic Ritual, the latter of whom incorporates a variety of stylistic traits reminiscent of Overkill and other thrash bands that had found success in the past. The band has also been cited as an influence on the groove metal genre; Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell had cited Bobby Gustafson's performance on the albums \"Under the Influence\" and \"The Years of Decay\" as one of the sources of inspiration for the band's transition from glam metal to thrash/groove metal, as well as \"The Years of Decay\" producer Terry Date's production for Pantera's 1990 album \"Cowboys from Hell\".\nInfluences.\nOverkill has been influenced by a variety of music, including heavy metal, hard rock and progressive rock acts such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Accept, Judas Priest, the Who, Aerosmith, Rush, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Queen, UFO, Jethro Tull, Mot\u00f6rhead, Saxon, Venom, Ted Nugent, Humble Pie, Rainbow, Manowar, Wishbone Ash and Starz, as well as punk rock and glam rock acts such as the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, the Damned, the New York Dolls, Lou Reed, the Vibrators, Generation X and the Dead Boys.\nMembers.\nCurrent members\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More formally, a \"mathematical symbol\" is any grapheme used in mathematical formulas and expressions. As formulas and expressions are entirely constituted with symbols of various types, many symbols are needed for expressing all mathematics.\nThe most basic symbols are the decimal digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and the letters of the Latin alphabet. The decimal digits are used for representing numbers through the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system. Historically, upper-case letters were used for representing points in geometry, and lower-case letters were used for variables and constants. Letters are used for representing many other types of mathematical object. As the number of these types has increased, the Greek alphabet and some Hebrew letters have also come to be used. For more symbols, other typefaces are also used, mainly boldface &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, script typeface formula_1 (the lower-case script face is rarely used because of the possible confusion with the standard face), German fraktur &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and blackboard bold &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; (the other letters are rarely used in this face, or their use is unconventional). It is commonplace to use alphabets, fonts and typefaces to group symbols by type (for example, boldface is often used for vectors and uppercase for matrices). \nThe use of specific Latin and Greek letters as symbols for denoting mathematical objects is not described in this article. For such uses, see \"Variable \u00a7 Conventional variable names\" and \"List of mathematical constants\". However, some symbols that are described here have the same shape as the letter from which they are derived, such as formula_2 and formula_3.\nThese letters alone are not sufficient for the needs of mathematicians, and many other symbols are used. Some take their origin in punctuation marks and diacritics traditionally used in typography; others by deforming letter forms, as in the cases of formula_4 and formula_5. Others, such as + and =, were specially designed for mathematics.\nArithmetic operators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEquality, equivalence and similarity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nComparison.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSet theory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBasic logic.\nSeveral logical symbols are widely used in all mathematics, and are listed here. For symbols that are used only in mathematical logic, or are rarely used, see \"List of logic symbols\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBlackboard bold.\nThe blackboard bold typeface is widely used for denoting the basic number systems. These systems are often also denoted by the corresponding uppercase bold letter. A clear advantage of blackboard bold is that these symbols cannot be confused with anything else. This allows using them in any area of mathematics, without having to recall their definition. For example, if one encounters formula_7 in combinatorics, one should immediately know that this denotes the real numbers, although combinatorics does not study the real numbers (but it uses them for many proofs).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCalculus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLinear and multilinear algebra.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdvanced group theory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInfinite numbers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBrackets.\nMany types of bracket are used in mathematics. Their meanings depend not only on their shapes, but also on the nature and the arrangement of what is delimited by them, and sometimes what appears between or before them. For this reason, in the entry titles, the symbol \u25a1 is used as a placeholder for schematizing the syntax that underlies the meaning.\nParentheses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSquare brackets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBraces.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther brackets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSymbols that do not belong to formulas.\nIn this section, the symbols that are listed are used as some sorts of punctuation marks in mathematical reasoning, or as abbreviations of natural language phrases. They are generally not used inside a formula. Some were used in classical logic for indicating the logical dependence between sentences written in plain language. Except for the first two, they are normally not used in printed mathematical texts since, for readability, it is generally recommended to have at least one word between two formulas. However, they are still used on a black board for indicating relationships between formulas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMiscellaneous.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was introduced in the original 1977 \"Star Wars\" film as the main antagonist, and the commander of the Death Star, a gigantic spherical space station built by the Galactic Empire, equipped with an immensely powerful superlaser capable of obliterating entire planets. Tarkin is portrayed by Peter Cushing in \"Star Wars\". Tarkin also appears in the films ' and \"Rogue One\", and in the animated series ', \"Rebels\", and \"\". He is featured in the 2014 novel \"Tarkin\", which details his backstory and his rise to power within the Empire. In 2006, the entertainment website \"IGN\" called Tarkin \"one of the most formidable villains\" in \"Star Wars\" history.\nCreation and portrayal.\nTarkin's character was originally conceived as a holy man from the planet Aquila, but was changed to an antagonist. As the Emperor would not appear until later in the original trilogy, Lucas used Tarkin's final version as the \"main villain\" of the first film, a personification of the Empire. According to a book created to help promote the original film to prospective theaters, he aspires to become the Emperor.\nCushing later joked that he did not know what a \"Grand Moff\" actually was, and that it sounded like \"something which infests a clothes closet\". He characterized Tarkin as a \"deeply cross and unpleasant gentleman\".\nIn the 2005 prequel film ', Wayne Pygram was able to achieve the likeness of a young version of Tarkin through the use of prosthetic makeup. For his performance as Tarkin in the animated series ', the voice actor Stephen Stanton researched Cushing's performances and then tried to imitate what Cushing might have sounded like in his mid-thirties and soften his voice to portray a level of humanity.\nIn the 2016 film \"Rogue One\", archival footage and a digital scan of Peter Cushing's life mask made for the 1984 film \"Top Secret!\" were used to create a 3D CGI mask which was augmented and mapped to actor Guy Henry's face. Henry had studied Cushing's mannerisms many years previously for the lead role in British TV show \"\", but insisted on a screen test as he was not comfortable that his vocal imitation was accurate, stating he sounded more \"Peter O'Toole than Peter Cushing\". The ILM team searched through hours of footage to find suitable material of Cushing to build from. The footage from \"A New Hope\" was lit very differently to the lighting used in \"Rogue One\" and had to be digitally changed. The more they manipulated the lighting to match the other actors in the scenes the less like Cushing the character model looked, which meant creating a balancing act between \"a digital figure\" and \"one who looked precisely like Cushing\". The owners of Cushing's estate were heavily involved with the creation and had input right down to small and subtle adjustments. The result, which has been called \"one of the most complex and costly CGI re-creations ever\", received a mixed response, with questions being raised about the morality of using a dead actor's likeness.\nAppearances.\nFilm.\n\"Star Wars\" (1977).\nIntroduced in the first film in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, Governor Tarkin is a Grand Moff of the Galactic Empire and commander of the Death Star. After Emperor Palpatine dissolves the Imperial Senate, Tarkin and Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) are charged with pursuing and destroying the Rebel Alliance. He threatens Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) with the destruction of her home planet, Alderaan, if Leia does not reveal the location of the Rebel main base of operations. When Leia names the planet Dantooine as the base's location, he destroys Alderaan regardless, hoping to make an example out of the planet's support of the Rebellion. Upon learning that Leia's coerced information was false, Tarkin orders Leia's execution.\nHe allows the Rebels to escape the Death Star with Leia after placing a tracking beacon on the \"Millennium Falcon\" in order to find the Rebel base. He orders the Death Star to destroy the Rebel base on Yavin 4. In the film's climax, Tarkin refuses to believe that the Death Star is in danger from the Rebel starfighter attack; as a result, he refuses to evacuate. He is subsequently killed by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who succeeds in destroying the Death Star by firing torpedoes into the exhaust port. Tarkin is last seen deep in thought seconds before the Death Star explodes.\n\"Revenge of the Sith\" (2005).\nAt the end of \"\", the final film in the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy, a younger version of Tarkin, played by Wayne Pygram, makes a cameo appearance overseeing the original Death Star's construction, standing beside Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) and Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid).\n\"Rogue One\" (2016).\nIn the film \"Rogue One\" (which takes place immediately before the events in \"A New Hope\"), Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn), Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military, meets with Tarkin, who expresses his skepticism about Krennic's management of the Death Star project. Tarkin oversees the Death Star's first attack on the Rebellion when it is used to destroy the Holy City of the planet Jedha. Impressed, he congratulates Krennic before announcing that he is going to take command of the Death Star from that point on, pointing out security breaches that had occurred under Krennic's command (much to Krennic's chagrin). Later in the film, Tarkin is informed of a Rebel attack on Scarif, the planet where the plans to the Death Star are kept. He orders the jump to hyperspace to the planet, where an ongoing battle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance rages. Tarkin has the Death Star target and destroy the Scarif base, killing Krennic, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), and any other survivor of the ground battle.\nTelevision series.\n\"The Clone Wars\" (2010\u20132013).\nIn the animated television series \"\", set during the events of the prequel trilogy, a younger Tarkin (voiced by Stephen Stanton) is depicted as a Captain and later an Admiral in the Galactic Republic Navy.\nIn the third season, Captain Tarkin and Jedi Master Even Piell (Blair Bess) are ambushed and attacked by Separatist forces. Prisoners to the Citadel, Tarkin and Piell are freed from captivity by a rescue team. Initially pessimistic about being in enemy territory, Tarkin puts himself at odds with Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter), but their respective opinions of each other improve when each realizes that both know Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian Abercrombie). During a skirmish, Tarkin fights and attempts to execute Citadel Warden Osi Sobeck (James Arnold Taylor), but fails when Sobeck swiftly retaliates and nearly kills him. However, Tarkin is rescued just in time by Anakin's Padawan Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein).\nIn the fifth season, Tarkin, now an admiral, suspects Ahsoka of masterminding a terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple, and attempts to have the Padawan arrested. After Ahsoka is recaptured, Tarkin requests that the Jedi Order expel her and turn her over to the Republic so she can receive more \"impartial\" judgement. The Jedi concede and Ahsoka is tried before a jury of senators, with Tarkin heading the prosecution while Padm\u00e9 Amidala (Catherine Taber) heads the defense. Despite Padm\u00e9's impressive defense, Tarkin casts doubt by mentioning that Ahsoka had been seen with Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress (Nika Futterman). After Tarkin and Padm\u00e9's arguments conclude and the jury reaches a verdict that Palpatine is about to read, Anakin arrives with Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger), the real mastermind of the attack.\n\"Star Wars Rebels\" (2014\u20132018).\nIn the television series \"Star Wars Rebels\", Tarkin (voiced once again by Stanton) starts off as Governor of the Outer Rim territories, including Lothal, but eventually receives his Grand Moff title. He visits the planet Lothal to deal with its growing Rebel activity, and reprimands Minister Maketh Tua (Kath Soucie), Agent Kallus (David Oyelowo), and the Inquisitor for their repeated failures to stop the planet's Rebel cell. Tarkin has the Inquisitor execute Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint (both David Shaughnessy) for their inability to deal with the cell's leader, Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.). Later, Tarkin sets a trap for the Rebels and manages to capture Kanan during their mission to send a message through one of the planet's communication towers. The Rebels' message gets sent out, but Tarkin then orders the tower to be destroyed. Kanan is tortured by the Inquisitor and transported to the Mustafar system aboard Tarkin's Star Destroyer. During Kanan's rescue by Rebel forces, Tarkin's Star Destroyer is destroyed, and the Inquisitor is killed. On Lothal, Tarkin introduces Agent Kallus to Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).\nTaking the loss of his Star Destroyer personally, Tarkin orders that Maketh Tua be brought before him for her failure to find the Lothal rebels. Knowing the true meaning behind the summoning after the deaths of Aresko and Grint, Tua attempts to defect to the rebellion, but she is killed by Vader and Kallus before she can leave Lothal. Tarkin later appears in the season three premiere where he meets with Governor Pryce (Mary Elizabeth Glynn) regarding the Lothal Rebels. He subsequently grants her request for use of the Seventh Fleet, commanded by Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen). Tarkin appears via hologram in the season three finale, being briefed on Thrawn's imminent attack on Atollon to stymie a coordinated Rebel attack on Lothal. Towards the end of season four, he warns Thrawn that he must prove the worth of his TIE Defender program, Thrawn's prototype design of a new Imperial Star Fighter, or it will be shut down in favor of diverting resources to Krennic's \"Stardust project\" - which would eventually become the Death Star.\n\"Star Wars: The Bad Batch\" (2021\u20132024).\nTarkin (voiced again by Stanton) appears in the Disney+ series \"\", set between the events of \"The Clone Wars\" and \"Rebels\". In the premiere episode, \"Aftermath\", Admiral Tarkin arrives on Kamino to discuss with Prime Minister Lama Su if the Empire should continue to produce clone troopers, noting that conscripted soldiers would be less expensive. He later evaluates Clone Force 99, a group of genetically enhanced clone troopers also known as the Bad Batch, through a battle simulation. While impressed by their extraordinary skills, he also notices disobedience in them. He then dispatches them to the planet of Onderon to eliminate a group of refugees led by Saw Gerrera, as a test of their loyalty. When the Bad Batch disobeys orders, Tarkin has them arrested, but separates Bad Batch member Crosshair from the others after noticing that he is more loyal to the Empire. Tarkin has Kaminoan scientist Nala Se intensify the programming of Crosshair's inhibitor chip, turning him against his teammates, who escape Kamino.\nTarkin is later promoted to Governor, and in the episode \"Replacements\", he puts Crosshair in charge of an \"elite squad\" of recruited soldiers, who are then sent to finish the mission the Bad Batch had abandoned. After the mission is successful, Tarkin sees potential for conscripts. In the episode \"Return to Kamino\", after most Imperial personnel are evacuated from Kamino, Tarkin orders Vice Admiral Rampart to destroy all settlements on the planet, wiping out most of the Kaminoan race.\nIn the series finale episode \"The Cavalry Has Arrived\", he went with Captain Bragg and the stormtroopers to find Dr. Royce Hemlock's base destroyed.\nNovels.\nTarkin appears in \"\", the prequel novel to \"Rogue One\", where Tarkin forms a rivalry with Advanced Weapons Director Orson Krennic.\n\"Tarkin\" (2014).\n\"Star Wars: Tarkin\" explores the title character's origins, and chronicles how he meets and aligns himself with Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader prior to the events of \"A New Hope\". The novel was one of the first four canon novels to be released in 2014 and 2015. Tarkin's Star Destroyer, the \"Executrix\", is introduced; it later appears in \"Rogue One\". In the novel, he advocates for the Tarkin Doctrine, a military system based on \"the threat of force, rather than force itself\". His philosophy becomes central to Imperial policy and earns him the position as the first Grand Moff in the Empire. (In the Galactic Empire, a \"Moff\" is the governor of a Sector, or subdivision of the Empire; a \"Grand Moff\" is the governor of an Oversector, a grouping of several Sectors.)\n\"From a Certain Point of View\" (2017).\nIn Glen Weldon's short story \"Of MSE-6 and Men\", featured in the anthology \"From a Certain Point of View\", Tarkin is revealed to have been sleeping with the stormtrooper TK-421 during the events of \"A New Hope\", after capturing Leia Organa, but before his armour was stolen by Luke Skywalker in order to rescue Organa.\n\"Legends\".\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe material produced since the originating 1977 film \"Star Wars\" was rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.\nIn \"Legends\", Tarkin appears in several novels, including \"Death Star, Cloak of Deception, Rogue Planet\" and \"\". The original Marvel \"Star Wars\" comic series features a powerful superweapon called \"The Tarkin\" after the late Grand Moff. His protegee and lover, Natasi Daala, is later featured as a frequent antagonist in novels set after his death.\nWest End Games' roleplaying material describes the \"Tarkin Doctrine\", which emphasizes ruling \"through the fear of force, rather than force itself\", and has been mentioned various other times in the \"Star Wars\" canon. He is also mentioned during the \"New Jedi Order\" novel series as having been present on Zonama Sekot with Anakin Skywalker. In the comics series \"Darth Vader and the Lost Command\", Tarkin is seen telling Vader of a missing convoy of Imperial craft and adds that his own son was in command of the convoy and is also missing.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73638", "revid": "44941471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73638", "title": "Quercus alba", "text": "Species of oak tree\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nQuercus alba, the white oak, is one of the preeminent hardwoods of eastern and central North America. It is a long-lived oak, native to eastern and central North America and found from Minnesota, Ontario, Quebec, and southern Maine south as far as northern Florida and eastern Texas. Specimens have been documented to be over 450 years old.\nAlthough called a white oak, it is very unusual to find an individual specimen with white bark; the usual colour is a light gray. The name comes from the colour of the undersides of the leaves. In the forest it can reach a magnificent height and in the open it develops into a massive broad-topped tree with large branches striking out at wide angles.\nDescription.\n\"Quercus alba\" typically reaches heights of at maturity, and its canopy can become quite massive as its lower branches are apt to extend far out laterally, parallel to the ground. Trees growing in a forest will become much taller than ones in an open area which develop to be short and massive. The Mingo Oak was the tallest known white oak at over two hundred feet with a trunk height of before it was felled in 1938. It is not unusual for the crown spread of a white oak tree to be as wide as it is tall, but specimens growing at high altitudes may only become small shrubs. \nThe bark is a light ash-gray and peels somewhat from the top, bottom and/or sides. According to Chris Bolgiano in \"The Appalachian Forest: A Search for Roots and Renewal\", the largest tree ever cut in West Virginia was a white oak that measured thirteen feet thick at its base.\nWhite oak may live 200 to 300 years, with some even older specimens known. The Wye Oak in Wye Mills, Maryland was estimated to be over 450 years old when it finally fell in a thunderstorm in 2002.\nAnother noted white oak was the Basking Ridge white oak in New Jersey, estimated to have been over 600 years old when it died in 2016. The tree measured in circumference at the base and in circumference above the ground. The tree was tall, and its branches spread over from tip to tip. The oak, claimed to be the oldest in the United States, began showing signs of poor health in the mid-2010s. The tree was taken down in 2017.\nSexual maturity begins at around 20 years, but the tree does not produce large crops of acorns until its 50th year and the amount varies from year to year. Acorns deteriorate quickly after ripening, the germination rate being only 10% for six-month-old seeds. As the acorns are prime food for insects and other animals, all may be consumed in years of small crops, leaving none that would become new trees. The acorns are usually sessile, and grow to in length, falling in early October.\nIn spring, the young leaves are delicate, silvery pink, and covered with a soft blanket-like down. The petioles are short, and the clustered leaves close to the ends of the shoots are pale green and downy, resulting in the entire tree having a misty, frosty look. This condition continues for several days, passing through the opalescent changes of soft pink, silvery white, and finally, yellow green.\nThe leaves grow to be long and wide and have a deep glossy green upper surface. They usually turn red or brown in autumn, but depending on climate, site, and individual tree genetics, some trees are nearly always red, or even purple in autumn. Some dead leaves may remain on the tree throughout winter until very early spring. The lobes can be shallow, extending less than halfway to the midrib, or deep and somewhat branching.\n\"Quercus alba\" is sometimes confused with the swamp white oak, a closely related species, and the bur oak. The white oak hybridizes freely with the bur oak, the post oak, and the chestnut oak.\nChemistry.\nGrandinin/roburin E, castalagin/vescalagin, gallic acid, monogalloyl glucose (glucogallin) and valoneic acid dilactone, digalloyl glucose, trigalloyl glucose, ellagic acid rhamnose, quercitrin and ellagic acid are phenolic compounds found in \"Q. alba\".\nThe haplotype-resolved chromosome-scale genome of Q. alba was published in 2025.\nDistribution.\n\"Quercus alba\" is fairly tolerant of a variety of habitats, and may be found on ridges, in valleys, and in between, in dry and moist habitats, and in moderately acid and alkaline soils. It is mainly a lowland tree, but reaches altitudes of 1,600\u00a0m (5,249\u00a0ft) in the Appalachian Mountains. It is often a component of the forest canopy in an oak-heath forest.\nFrequent fires in the Central Plains region of the United States prevented oak forests, including \"Q. alba\", from expanding into the Midwest. However, a decrease in the frequency of these natural fires after European settlement caused rapid expansion of oak forests into the Great Plains, negatively affecting the natural prairie vegetation.\nUses.\nCultivation.\n\"Quercus alba\" is cultivated as an ornamental tree somewhat infrequently due to its slow growth and ultimately huge size. It is not tolerant of urban pollution and road salt; and due to its large taproot, it is unsuited for a street tree or parking strips/islands.\nFood.\nThe acorns are much less bitter than the acorns of red oaks. They can be eaten by humans but, if bitter, may need to have the tannins leached. They are also a valuable wildlife food, notably for turkeys, wood ducks, pheasants, grackles, jays, nuthatches, thrushes, woodpeckers, rabbits, squirrels, deer, and black bear. The white oak is the only known food plant of the \"Bucculatrix luteella\" and \"Bucculatrix ochrisuffusa\" caterpillars.\nThe young shoots of many eastern oak species are readily eaten by deer. Dried oak leaves are also occasionally eaten by white-tailed deer in the fall or winter. Rabbits often browse twigs and can girdle stems.\nWoodcraft.\nWhite oak has tyloses that give the wood a closed cellular structure, making it water- and rot-resistant. Because of this characteristic, white oak is used by coopers to make wine and whiskey barrels as the wood resists leaking. It has also been used in construction, shipbuilding, agricultural implements and in the interior finishing of houses. White oak splints have been used historically by Native Americans for basketry.\nWhite oak logs feature prominent medullary rays which produce a distinctive, decorative ray and fleck pattern when the wood is quarter sawn. Quarter sawn white oak was a signature wood used in mission style oak furniture by Gustav Stickley in the Craftsman style of the Arts and Crafts movement.\n is made of white oak and southern live oak, conferring additional resistance to cannon fire. Reconstructive wood replacement of white oak parts comes from a special grove of \"Quercus alba\" known as the \"\"Constitution\" Grove\" at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division.\nMusical instruments.\nDeering Banjo Company have made several 5-string banjos using white oak - including members of the Vega series, the White Lotus, and the limited edition 40th anniversary model. White Oak has a mellower timbre than more traditionally used maple, and yet still has enough power and projection to not require a metal tone ring.\nOak barrels.\nBarrels made of American white oak are commonly used for oak aging of wine, in which the wood is noted for imparting strong flavors. Also, by federal regulation, bourbon whiskey must be aged in charred new oak (generally understood to mean specifically American white oak) barrels.\nCulture.\nWhite oak has served as the official state tree of Illinois after selection by a vote of school children. There are two \"official\" white oaks serving as state trees, one located on the grounds of the governor's mansion, and the other in a schoolyard in the town of Rochelle. The white oak is also the state tree of Connecticut and Maryland. The Wye Oak, probably the oldest living white oak until it fell because of a thunderstorm on June 6, 2002, was the honorary state tree of Maryland.\nBeing the subject of a legend as old as the colony itself, the Charter Oak of Hartford, Connecticut is one of the most famous white oaks in America. An image of the tree now adorns the reverse side of the Connecticut state quarter.\nThe white oak from the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\", known as the \"Shawshank tree\" and the \"Tree of Hope\", was estimated to be more than 200 years old when it fell. The tree is seen during the last ten minutes of the movie. As the movie gained fame, the tree became popular as well, and used to attract tens of thousands of movie fans and tourists every year. A portion of the tree came down on July 29, 2011, when the tree was split by lightning during a storm. The remaining half of the tree fell during heavy winds just short of five years later, on July 22, 2016.\nThe Bedford Oak is a 500-year-old white oak tree that sits in the town of Bedford in New York. It is the mascot of the town. It sits at the corner of the Hook Road and the old Bedford Road (now Cantitoe Street). The ground the tree stands on was deeded to the Town of Bedford in 1942 by Harold Whitman in memory of his wife, Georgia Squires Whitman. It has seen Westchester history from Native American settlements to the Revolutionary War to modern times.\nThe video game \"\" features a character named Quercus Alba who bears some resemblance to the white oak and plants in general.\nThreats to oaks.\nInsects and the damage they cause account for the greatest amount of threat to acorn production from white oaks, particularly nut weevils, moth larvae, and gall forming cynipids.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73640", "revid": "44044858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73640", "title": "Orange County, Florida", "text": "County in Florida, United States\nOrange County is a county located in the central part of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the county had a population of 1,429,908, making it the fifth-most populous county in Florida and the 28th-most populous county in the United States. Its county seat is Orlando, which, along with it being the county's largest city, is the core of the Orlando metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.67 million in 2020.\nAs of 2022, Orange County has a gross domestic product of $115 billion, the third-largest GDP of Florida's 67 counties and the 27th-largest for the nation's 3,033 counties. The county is a tourist, economic, and cultural hub for the Central Florida region. Popular destinations within the county include Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando, Icon Park, Kia Center, Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, Orlando Museum of Art, and many other attractions. It is the home to the University of Central Florida (UCF), which as of Fall 2023 had a student population of 69,320, making it the fourth-largest on-campus student body of any public university in the United States. The county is home to other notable colleges, including Rollins College and Valencia College. Despite rapid development countywide, swaths of nature still do exist. There are many lakes within the county, most notable of such being Lake Apopka. Wekiwa Springs is a state park, that features natural springs, trails, and campsites.\nHistory.\nThe land that is Orange County was part of the first land to come up from below the Early Oligocene sea 33.9\u201328.4 million years ago and is known as Orange Island. Orange County's Rock Spring location is a Pleistocene fossil-bearing area and has yielded a vast variety of birds and mammals including giant sloth, mammoth, camel, and the dire wolf dating around 1.1 million years ago.\n19th century to mid-20th century.\nImmediately following the transfer of Florida from the Spanish to the United States in 1821, Governor Andrew Jackson created two counties: Escambia to the west of the Suwannee River and St. Johns to the east. In 1824, the area to the south of St. Johns County was organized as Mosquito County, and Enterprise was named its county seat. This large county took up much of central Florida. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized relocation of the Seminole people from Florida to Oklahoma; this resulted in pushback from the Seminole community, leading to the Second Seminole War. In 1842, a bill was passed in the Florida Territorial Council to rename Mosquito County to Leigh Read County, however, this renaming never took place. Two years later, in 1844, residents of Mosquito County petitioned the Territorial Council to rename the county Harrison County, in honor of President William Henry Harrison, who had only served 31 days in office before dying of Pneumonia. The petition was started in response to county residents finding the name unappealing. In 1845 when Florida finally became a state, the county was renamed Orange County. After the population increased in the region, the legislature organized several counties, such as Osceola (1887), Seminole (1913), Lake (1887), and Volusia (1854), from its territory.\nEarly on, the county greatly suffered, due to the Union blockade, but things greatly improved during Reconstruction. A boom in population, resulting from the incorporation of the Town of Orlando in 1875, greatly changed the demographics of the county. Orlando, establishing itself as a city in 1885, experienced rapid growth from 1875 to 1895, due to it becoming the hub of Florida's citrus industry. The fruit that constituted the county's main commodity crop, was the impetus to the aforementioned county's renaming. The dark-green foliage of orange trees filled the county, as did the scent of the orange blossoms when in bloom. Fewer commercial orange groves remained by the end of the twentieth century. The majority of groves were destroyed by the freezing temperatures that occurred in December 1983, January 1985, and December 1989, the worst since 1899.\nDuring the post-Reconstruction period, white people committed a high rate of racial violence against black people in Orange County; racial terrorism was used to re-establish and maintain white supremacy. Whites lynched 33 African Americans here from 1877 to 1950; most were killed in the decades around the turn of the 20th century. This was the highest total of any county in the state, and sixth highest of any county in the country. Florida had the highest per-capita rate of lynchings of any state in the South, where the great majority of these extrajudicial murders took place.\nAmong the terrorist lynchings was the death of Julius \"July\" Perry of Ocoee, whose body was found November 3, 1920, hanged from a lightpole in Orlando, near the house of a judge known to be sympathetic to black voting. But this was part of a much larger story of KKK and other white attempts to suppress black voting in Ocoee and the state. African Americans had organized for a year to increase voter turnout for the 1920 presidential election, with organizations helping prepare residents for voter registration, paying for poll taxes, and similar actions. On Election Day in Ocoee, blacks were turned away from the polls. Perry, a prosperous farmer, was suspected of sheltering Mose Norman, an African-American man who had tried to vote. After Norman was twice turned away, white violence broke out, resulting in a riot through the black community, leaving an estimated 50 to 60 African-Americans dead and all the properties destroyed. Many blacks fled from Ocoee to save their lives, and the town became all-white. Voting efforts were suppressed for decades.\nLater 20th century to present.\nEconomically destroyed at the turn of the century by the decimation of the citrus industry, many farmers walked away from the region. The freeze caused many farmers in central Florida to move to other warm climates, such as to the Caribbean or to California (such as the similarly named Orange County, California). Others awaited other opportunities. One of the region's major land owners and growers was the Tropicana company. They withdrew rather than try to come back from these seemingly endless generational decimation. With no realistic avenues for agricultural use of this rural land, and Florida's continuing strong population growth and its attendant needs (aided and supported by the success of nearby Walt Disney World and Universal Studios Florida), these areas began to be developed for housing and other industries, especially after World War II.\nIn 1962 Orlando Jetport was built. The predecessor of modern-day Orlando International Airport, it was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base. By 1970, four major airlines (Delta Air Lines, National Airlines, Eastern Airlines, and Southern Airways) had begun providing scheduled flights. McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in 1975, in which the airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code (MCO).\nIn 1965, Walt Disney announced plans to build Walt Disney World. The renowned resort opened in October 1971. This had a seismic impact to the region, resulting in an explosive growth in the county's population and in its economy. The success of Disney World, allowed for other theme parks and entertainment attractions to open and thrive in the county, such as Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando. The county now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.\nIn the 21st century, the county's economy has since diversified. Despite the rapid development in the county, thanks to gentrification relics of the historic core of \"Old Orlando\" still reside in downtown Orlando (along Church Street, between Orange Avenue and Garland Avenue), as well as within Orange County communities outside city limits, such as in Eatonville, Windermere, and Winter Park.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (10.0%) is water. Orange County is about above sea level. The county is bordered by Osceola County by the south, on the southwest by Polk County, on the west by Lake County, on the north by Seminole County, on the northeast by Volusia County, and on the east by Brevard County.\nMost of the county lies in the Florida coastal lowlands, while the northwestern areas rise into the Florida Central Highlands. The population center of the county is in the central and western sections in the transition zone from coastal plain to highlands, whereas eastern sections in the coastal plain are more remote in population. Orange County was part of the first land to rise up below from below the Early Oligocene sea about 33.9\u201328.4 million years ago, also known as Orange Island.\nThe headwaters for the Kissimmee River, which forms the northern part of the Everglades, are located in the county. Boggy Creek rises from the Orlando International Airport at above sea level, which is the primary inflow for East Lake Tohopekaliga in nearby Osceola County. Other watersheds within the county include the Ocklawaha and Wekiva rivers, along with the Upper and Middle basins, which are all sub-watersheds within the extensive St. Johns watershed. Lake Apopka is located in the county, on the course of the Ocklawaha River, and is the fourth largest lake in the state of Florida. Wekiwa Springs State Park is a Florida State Park along the course of the Wekiva River.\nDespite Orange County being landlocked in the center of the state, it is still relatively close to many beaches to the east on the Atlantic Ocean, with Cocoa Beach being the closest and a popular destination. The Gulf of Mexico is also relatively close, although a bit farther away, to the west, with many beaches like Clearwater Beach and St. Pete Beach also being popular destinations.\nRegions of Orange County.\nOrange County is divided into six regions; the (central) Downtown area (with urban characteristics); the (southwestern) tourist strip (with a mixture of permanent dwellings, resorts, and hotels); a mixture of working-class, middle-class, and wealthier suburbs in the west (with some exurban characteristics); more historically established suburbs to the north (with inner-ring characteristics, attributed to the SunRail); a mixture of suburbs with more accessibly priced homes in the east (within the influence of University of Central Florida); and working-class neighborhoods and additional tourist attractions to the south (within the influence of nearby Kissimmee in neighboring Osceola County). Florida's Turnpike is popularly regarded as a dividing line between northern areas catering more to permanent residents and southern areas catering more to tourists.\nThere are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits of Orlando, along with many municipalities and unincorporated areas throughout the county. Orlando's city limits resemble a checkerboard, with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits. Such an arrangement results in some areas being served by both Orange County and the City of Orlando. This also explains Orlando's relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population. The city and county are working together in an effort to \"round-out\" the city limits with Orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the city limits.\nThe center of government, commerce and culture in the county, is in Downtown Orlando, bordered by Marks Street in the north, Mills Avenue (SR 15) in the east, Orange Blossom Trail in the west, and Kaley Avenue in the south. Mostly composed of high-rise residential towers and office towers, 46 of the 79 high-rises in the Greater Orlando region are located in downtown. Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, Kia Center, Lake Eola, Orlando Museum of Art, and other attractions are located in downtown, along with corporate offices for banks such as Wells Fargo, Seacoast, and Suntrust banks, and government building such as Orange County Courthouse and Orlando City Hall.\nIn the southern region of the county is the rapidly growing community of Lake Nona. Along with being home to Lake Nona Golf &amp; Country Club, it is also the health district for the city of Orlando, with Lake Nona Medical City. Featuring Nemours Children's Hospital, University of Central Florida's Health Sciences Campus, which includes the university's College of Medicine, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, College of Nursing, College of Dental Medicine, a teaching hospital, and other healthcare amenities.\nThe main tourist strip for the city is in the southwestern section of the county. International Drive, commonly known as I-Drive, is a major thoroughfare that traverses central and southern portions of unincorporated Orange County. An additional extension is known as International Drive South, partly located in the northern portion of Osceola County. Other major roads in this region include, Sand Lake Road, Kirkman Road, SR 536, and Universal Boulevard, which runs parallel to the midsection of International Drive. At its northern end, International Drive is home to Orlando International Premium Outlets and Universal Orlando resort, along with being in close proximity to the Epic Universe theme park that opened in May 2025. Further south on International Drive, it features the Orange County Convention Center, Dezerland Park mall, SeaWorld Orlando (along with Aquatica, SeaWorld's water park), ICON Park (featuring its famous Ferris wheel, Orlando Eye), the World's Largest Entertainment McDonald's, and other tourist ventures.

Nicknamed the 'Theme Park Capital of the World', the county is home to Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld Orlando, among many other theme parks. As of 2022, with over 2.9 million visitors, Orlando was the third-most visited city in the U.S. after New York City and Miami.

One of the two corporate headquarters for Disney Experiences is located in Lake Buena Vista (the other headquarters is located in Glendale, California). There were reportedly plans from Disney, that they were to expand more of their corporate presence in Orange County, with the transferring of DPEP positions over the next couple of years to a new 60-acre corporate campus in the Lake Nona area of the county, with as many as 90% of the transferred positions being Imagineering positions. However, the planned relocation was cancelled in May 2023 amidst the feud between Disney and Florida's governor Ron DeSantis.

Other major hospitality companies with a significant economic presence (both corporate and in its resort properties) within the county include:\nGovernment.\nThe county functions under a charter form of government. The charter serves as a constitution, detailing the structure and operation of the local government. A Charter Review Commission has the power to consider and place amendments on the ballot. Voters then decide whether to accept or reject all amendments put forth. If voters approve an amendment, it is then inserted into the charter.\nFederal representation.\nFour districts of the U.S. House of Representatives represent parts of Orange County.\nDistrict 8 encompasses all of Brevard and Indian River Counties and far eastern Orange County. District 9 encompasses all of Osceola County, eastern Polk County and southern Orange County. District 10 encompasses most of Orange County. District 11 encompasses all of Sumter County, and parts of Lake, Polk, and western Orange County.\nState representation.\nOrange County residents are represented in Tallahassee with 3 Senate seats.\nDistrict 11 encompasses northwestern Orange County, District 13 encompasses north central and northeastern Orange County, and District 15 encompasses all of Osceola County and the southern third of Orange County.\nOrange County residents are represented in Tallahassee with 9 House seats.\nDistrict 37 encompasses southern Seminole and portions of northern Orange County, Districts 35, 46, and 47 encompass Osceola County and Orange County, and Districts 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, and 44 are wholly composed of Orange.\nCounty representation.\nOrange County is served by a board of commissioners. The board consists of an elected mayor and six commissioners. The mayor is elected At-large, while commissioners are elected from single-member districts. The mayor and commissioners each serve staggered four-year terms. Commissioners from Districts 1, 3, and 5 are elected in presidential election years, while the mayor and commissioners from Districts 2, 4, and 6 are elected in alternate years. The county is also served by a clerk of courts, sheriff, property appraiser, tax collector, supervisor of elections, state attorney, and public defender. All positions are four-year terms, requiring direct election by voters in presidential election years.\nPolitics.\nOrange County is located along the pivotal Interstate 4 corridor, which until recently was a powerful swing region in what was one of the country's most critical swing states. Many close elections were won or lost depending on the voting outcome along the corridor. Voters were considered independent, traditionally splitting their votes, electing Democrats and Republicans on the same ballot. As a result of such independence, voters were inundated with non-stop television and radio ads months preceding a general election.\nOrange County was one of the first areas of Florida to turn Republican. It swung from a 15-point victory for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 to a seven-point victory for Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. It eventually became one of the stronger Republican bastions in Florida, as evidenced when it gave Barry Goldwater 56 percent of its vote in 1964. For most of the second half of the 20th century, it was one of the more conservative urban counties in Florida and the nation. From 1948 to 1988, Democrats only cracked the 40 percent barrier twice, in 1964 and 1976. However, the Republican edge narrowed considerably in the 1990s. George H. W. Bush fell from 67 percent of the vote in 1988 to only 45.9 percent in 1992. In 1996, Bob Dole only won the county by 520 votes.\nIn September 2000, Democrats overtook Republicans in voter registration. This was a factor in Al Gore becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the county since 1944. John Kerry narrowly carried the county in 2004 by less than 1,000 votes. In 2008, however, Orange County swung hard to Barack Obama, who won it by the largest margin for a Democrat since Roosevelt. In the years since, it has become one of the strongest Democratic bastions in Florida.\nSince 2000, Republicans have yet to retake the advantage they once enjoyed. In the twelve years that followed, Democrats experienced a modest increase in their voter registration percentage from 41.40% to 42.73% of the electorate. Minor party voters also had modest growth, increasing from 2.17% to 2.37%. In contrast, Republicans experienced a sharp decrease in registered voters, sliding from 40.95% in 2000 down to 29.85% in 2012. The beneficiary of the Republican losses have been unaffiliated voters. The percentage of the electorate identifying as an unaffiliated voter increased from 15.47% to 25.06% during this same period. Orange County is one of two different counties in the entire nation to have voted for Al Gore in 2000 after voting for Dole in 1996, a distinction it shares with Charles County, Maryland.\nHowever, Orange County went to Kamala Harris by just 13 points in 2024, the closest margin in Orange County since 2004. This made Orange County one of just six Florida counties to go for Harris as Donald Trump won the former swing state of Florida by 13 points. Florida is now considered a red state and presidential campaigns are unlikely to focus on the state in the future.\nEducation.\nPublic education.\nThe Orange County Public Schools deliver public education to students countywide. Its functions and expenditures are overseen by an elected school board composed of a chairman, elected at-large; and seven members, elected from single-member districts. Each member is elected to a four-year term: the chairman and three other members are elected in gubernatorial election years, while the other four are elected in presidential election years. As of the 2021\u20132022 school year, the school system operated 205 schools (127 elementary, 9 K-8, 39 middle, 22 high, and 8 exceptional learning), with 206,246 students. As of 2023, it is the 4th largest district statewide and eighth largest in the nation.\nColleges and universities.\nThe University of Central Florida is the sole 4-year public university. As of the Fall 2020 semester, a total of 71,948 students attended the university, making it the largest university in the nation by enrollment. The university's 1,415 acre main campus is situated in northeast Orange County.\nNearby Winter Park is home to Rollins College, a private college situated only a few miles from Downtown Orlando. In 2012, it was ranked #1 by U.S. News &amp; World Report amongst regional universities in the South.\nWith six campuses spread throughout the county, Valencia College offers two-year degree programs, as well three baccalaureate programs.\nThe law schools for Barry University and Florida A&amp;M are also conveniently located in Downtown Orlando.\nFull Sail University is a for-profit university in Winter Park, Florida. Full Sail is not regionally accredited, but is nationally accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC) to award associate's, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees in audio, film, design, computer animation, business, and other fields.[10] The school offers 35 degree programs and 2 graduate certificates and has a student population of more than 16,800.\nLibraries.\nOrange County is served by the Orange County Library System, which was established in 1923. Before the opening of the Albertson Public Library in 1923, a circulating library maintained by the Sorosis Club of Orlando offered book lending services to patrons on a subscription basis. The Albertson Public Library was established with the collection of Captain Charles L. Albertson and the library was named in his honor. In 1924, the Booker T. Washington Branch of the Albertson Library was established to service the African American community of Orlando. In 1966, the current Orlando Public Library building was completed on the grounds of the Albertson Public Library. Currently there are 16 libraries within the Orange County Library system. The library systems offers a diverse selection of materials, free programs and free access to various databases. In addition, the library offers free delivery of most items through its MAYL service.\nOne exception exists in the cities of Maitland and Winter Park which are each part of a separate library taxing districts and as a result residents of these cities are not entitled to receive resident borrowing privileges at OCLS branches even though they are technically and legally residents of Orange County, instead an agreement was reached between Maitland, Winter Park and the OCLS whereas a resident of those cities can go to any OCLS branch and request a \"Reciprocal borrower card\" which is provided free of charge. The Reciprocal borrower cards is valid for one year and can be used at any OCLS branch with the exception of the Melrose Center at the Orlando Public Library which requires a separate Melrose Center specific card which is issued after the user applies for the card and goes through a mandatory orientation class. Access to the OCLS Internet on library owned PCs requires a Reciprocal borrower to pay small session access fee. The OCLS Wi-Fi network which is available at all branches remains free of charge to all users including Reciprocal borrowers and visitors who use their own iPad, Mac, PC, Smartphone or tablet devices. Maitland and Winter Park Library do not provide reciprocal privileges to OCLS patrons and charge non-residents a yearly user fee.\nTransportation.\nMajor highways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCommunities.\nCities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 388,656. Its county seat is Kissimmee. Osceola County is included in the Orlando\u2013Kissimmee\u2013Sanford, Fla. Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nBeing 54.3% Hispanic, Osceola is one of three Hispanic-majority counties in Florida, owing to its large Puerto Rican American population. It also is the 12th-largest majority-Hispanic county in the nation.\nEtymology.\nOsceola County is named for the Native American leader Osceola, whose name means \"Black Drink Cry [Asi Yaholo]\".\nHistory.\nOsceola County was created in 1887. On July 21, 1821, Florida was divided into two counties, named Escambia County to the west and St. John's County to the east. In 1824, the southern part of St. John's County became Mosquito County, with Enterprise as the county seat. In 1844, Brevard County was carved out from Mosquito County. When Florida became a state in 1845, Mosquito County was renamed Orange County. On May 12, 1887, Osceola was named a county, having been created from both Orange and Brevard Counties. Osceola County reached all the way down to Lake Okeechobee until 1917 when Okeechobee County was formed.\nSince the late 20th century, Osceola County has experienced a significant influx of migrants from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the unincorporated territory of the United States, and in the 2000 U.S. census Puerto Rican was the largest self-reported ancestry group.\nGovernment.\nOsceola County is a charter county and a subdivision within the State of Florida. Voters approved the County Charter in March 1992, and it took effect on October 1, 1992. The structure of County government under the charter does not depart dramatically from the structure of a County government outlined in the Florida Statutes.\nOsceola County Government is governed by three sets of elected officials, each of which independently directs separate branches of County Government. These include: the five-member County Commission, five separate Constitutional Officers, and a number of Judicial Officers. Under State law, the County Commission is responsible for funding the budgets of all Osceola County Government, including the independently elected Constitutional Officers and Judicial Officers, as well as the Commission's own departments. Each independent officer has discretion to administer his or her own programs. The County Commission exercises oversight only over its own departments.\nOsceola County has five electoral districts each represented by a commissioner. All the commissioners compose the Board of Commissioners that appoint a County Manager. There also is a Commission Auditor and County Attorney.\nConstitutional officers.\nOsceola County was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections from about 1950 up until 1996, when Bill Clinton carried Florida with a plurality. It swung back to support George W. Bush in 2004, but then heavily supported Democrat Barack Obama in 2008, and up until 2024 it had supported Democrats by large margins. In 2024 the county swung back to support Republican Donald Trump, mirroring trends seen in the rest of the state of Florida.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (11.9%) is water.\nTransportation.\nRail.\nCSX's A-line, formerly the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad mainline, and originally built by the South Florida Railroad in the 1880s, runs through the urbanized northern part of the county.

Instead, Osceola patrons were taken care of by Orange County Library System. Before that, there were two libraries, which are still named after the original independent libraries, run by women's organizations: Veteran's Memorial in Saint Cloud and Hart Memorial Library in Kissimmee.\nIn 1910, land for the Hart Memorial Library was donated by a widow of a former Florida Governor, Carrie S. Hart. It was located on North Stewart Avenue in Kissimmee . In 1914, women pooled money together from themselves and other community members to build the actual building and Annie Palmer Fell, another widow of a prominent Florida man, donated furnishings and books from her personal collection to begin building inventory in the new library. In 1968, the location moved to a 4,000 square foot building on Broadway and Dakin. Hart Memorial Library is the Osceola headquarters and is now located in a 43,000 square building .\nVeteran's Memorial Library was at first a reading room until enough funds were raised to build the first official location on Massachusetts Avenue in Saint Cloud. In the early 70's the location moved to a former SunBank location on 10th Street and New York Avenue. In 1995, this branch moved for its final time to a larger building on Indiana Avenue and 13th street where it is still located today.\nThe first Poinciana Branch was opened in 1988. It was a modular building and consisted of a 14,000 book collection. This branch was eventually moved into a larger location with a collection of 40,000 books and computer access for patrons.\nOsceola Library Systems began as an independent organization on April 1, 1989.\nIn 1990, the Buenaventura Library opened.\nIn 1991, volunteers helped open the Kenansville Branch Library in a shared space with the old Kenansville school.

It was rebuilt in 2007 with a larger collection, including books, DVDs, and computer/wifi access.\nCommunities.\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther unincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlanned development.\nBack in 2009, there were plans to create a new city named Destiny near the intersection of the Florida Turnpike and US 441. The project was halted by The Florida Department of Community Affairs after concerns that there would be mass urban sprawl. The area is now a reserve named after the city's planner, Fred DeLuca. If finished, the city would've had an expected population of 250,000.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73643", "revid": "46085058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73643", "title": "Thrash metal", "text": "Subgenre of heavy metal\nThrash metal (or simply thrash) is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its overall aggression and fast tempo. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead guitar work. \nThe genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex guitar stylings of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk and speed metal and the technicality of progressive rock. Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the conservatism of the Reagan era and the much more moderate, pop-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal subgenre of glam metal which also developed concurrently in the 1980s. Derived genres include crossover thrash, a fusion of thrash metal and hardcore punk.\nThe early thrash metal movement revolved around independent record labels, including Megaforce, Metal Blade, Combat, Roadrunner, and Noise, and the underground tape trading industry in both Europe and North America. The genre was commercially successful from approximately 1985 through 1991, bringing prominence to Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, all grouped together as the \"Big Four\" of U.S. thrash metal. Other bands, such as Overkill, Metal Church, Nuclear Assault, Flotsam and Jetsam, and Bay Area acts Exodus, Testament and Death Angel, never achieved the same level of success as the \"Big Four\" but had also developed a strong following in the metal community, through MTV's \"Headbangers Ball\" or otherwise. Some of the most popular international thrash metal bands from this era were Brazil's Sepultura, Canada's Voivod and Annihilator, Switzerland's Coroner, England's Onslaught, and the genre's German \"Big Four\": Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and Tankard.\nThe thrash metal genre had declined in popularity by the mid-1990s, due to the commercial success of numerous genres such as alternative rock, grunge, and later pop-punk and nu metal. In response, some bands either disbanded or moved away from their thrash metal roots and more towards groove metal or alternative metal. The genre has seen a resurgence in popularity since the 2000s, with the arrival of various bands such as Bonded by Blood, Evile, Hatchet, Havok, Lamb of God, Municipal Waste, and Warbringer, who have all been credited for leading the so-called \"thrash metal revival\" scene.\nCharacteristics.\nThrash metal generally features fast tempos, low-register, complex guitar riffs, high-register guitar solos, and double bass drumming. The rhythm guitar parts are played with heavy distortion, power chords and often palm muted to create a tighter and more precise sound. Vocally, thrash metal can employ anything from melodic singing to shouted or screamed vocals. Most guitar solos are played at high speed and technically demanding, as they are usually characterized by shredding, and use advanced techniques such as sweep picking, legato phrasing, alternate picking, tremolo picking, string skipping, and two-hand tapping. \nDavid Ellefson, the original bassist of Megadeth, described thrash metal as \"a combination of the attitude from punk rock but the riffs and complexities of traditional metal.\" On the origins of thrash metal, Dan Lilker (bassist and co-founding member of Anthrax, S.O.D. and Nuclear Assault) recalls: \"Thrash was just what they called 'faster hardcore,' because you literally thrashed around when you were either playing it or reacting to it. And thrash metal was born because it was influenced by thrash hardcore, and they just thought it was more metal, so they said, 'Okay, this is thrash metal.'\"\nThe guitar riffs often use chromatic scales and emphasize the tritone and diminished intervals, instead of using conventional single-scale-based riffing. For example, the intro riff of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" (the title track of the namesake album) is a chromatic descent, followed by a chromatic ascent based on the tritone.\nSpeed, pacing, and time changes also define thrash metal. Thrash tends to have an accelerating feel which may be due in large part to its aggressive drumming style. For example, drummers often use two bass drums, or a double-bass pedal to create a relentless, driving beat. Cymbal stops/chokes are often used to transition from one riff to another or to precede an acceleration in tempo. Some common characteristics of the genre are fast guitar riffs with aggressive picking styles and fast guitar solos, and extensive use of two bass drums as opposed to the conventional use of only one, typical of most rock music.\nTo keep up with the other instruments, many bassists use a plectrum (pick). However, some prominent thrash metal bassists have used their fingers, such as Frank Bello, Greg Christian, Steve Di Giorgio, Robert Trujillo, and Cliff Burton. Several bassists use a distorted bass tone, an approach popularized by Burton and Mot\u00f6rhead's Lemmy. Lyrical themes in thrash metal include warfare, corruption, injustice, murder, suicide, isolation, alienation, addiction, and other maladies that afflict the individual and society. In addition, politics, particularly pessimism and dissatisfaction towards politics, are common themes among thrash metal bands. Humor and irony can occasionally be found (Anthrax for example), but they are limited, and are an exception rather than a rule.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"thrash\" originated as a way of referring to hardcore punk, seen on the 1982 hardcore compilation album \"New York Thrash\". By 1983, the term \"thrash metal\" had entered colloquial use as a way to denote the fusion of hardcore and metal. The 1983 debut issue of \"Metal Forces\" used the term to describe the bands on the first \"Metal Massacre\" and Mike Varney's first three \"U.S. Metal\" compilation albums. Later the same year, the thirteenth issue of \"Metal Mania\" used the term in an article, saying it was used synonymously with \"heavy thrash\" and \"punk metal\", going on to say acts in the genre included Tank, Metallica, MDC, GBH, Discharge and Crucifix. The term is sometimes incorrectly credited to a 1984 \"Kerrang!\" magazine article by journalist Malcolm Dome, who used the term in reference to the song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" by Anthrax.\nAround 1984, the most dominant name for what is now defined as thrash metal was \"power metal\", a name which eventually evolved to refer to the separate power metal genre. Similarly, for much of the 1980s, the names \"thrash metal\" and \"speed metal\" were generally used synonymously. The separate speed metal genre was defined retrospectively in the 1990s, to refer to 1980s bands who bridged the gap between thrash metal and power metal.\nHistory.\nRoots (1970s\u2013early 1980s).\nThe term \"proto-thrash\" has been used to describe bands as having elements of speed metal or thrash metal before those genres came to prominence in the early-to-mid-1980s. Deep Purple's 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\" is perhaps the earliest proto-thrash/speed metal album, as music journalist Martin Popoff noted, \"It's really about the discipline and classical haughtiness of this record, as well as 'Hard Lovin' Man' which is a great contender for first proto-thrash song ever.\" Queen's 1974 song \"Stone Cold Crazy\" and Black Sabbath's \"Symptom of the Universe\", released the following year, have also been cited as examples of proto-thrash/speed metal; the latter of which was a direct inspiration for Diamond Head's pioneering song \"Am I Evil?\". The new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands emerging from Britain in the late 1970s further influenced the development of early thrash. The early work of artists such as Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Mot\u00f6rhead, Tygers of Pan Tang, Raven, Saxon and Angel Witch, among others, introduced the fast-paced and intricate musicianship that became core aspects of thrash. Phil Taylor's double-bass drumming featured in Mot\u00f6rhead's 1979 song \"Overkill\" has been acknowledged by many thrash drummers, most notably Lars Ulrich, as a primary influence on their playing. Thrash metal bands have also taken inspiration from Judas Priest, with Slayer guitarist Kerry King saying that, \"There would be no Slayer without Priest.\" Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel played a key role in bringing the NWOBHM to a larger audience, as he was responsible for discovering both Metallica and Slayer and producing their earliest studio recordings.\nGreg Prato of Ultimate Guitar notes, \"Although the thrash movement seemed to have much more in common with punk than prog fashion-wise (leather jackets vs. capes), musically, there were certainly moments when thrash leaned more towards the prog side of things.\" Canadian progressive rock band Rush, for example, has been cited a formative influence on the thrash metal movement. In a 2013 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante said: \"When I was first learning to play drums, I would strap on my headphones, play along with [Rush's live album \"All the World's a Stage\"] and be transformed. I remember talking with Cliff and Kirk back when we first met, and we all agreed how much of an influence Rush was on all of us.\"\nThe thrash metal genre is also strongly influenced by punk rock, drawing inspiration from sources ranging from traditional punk bands from the 1970s, including the New York Dolls, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Dead Boys, to late 1970s/early 1980s hardcore punk bands Discharge, GBH, Black Flag, the Misfits, the Dead Kennedys, and Bad Brains. The Ramones' 1976 self-titled debut album in particular has been noted as a key influence on the genre, due to its sound, which introduced the three-chord thrash style of guitar. Void has been credited as one of the earliest examples of hardcore/heavy metal crossover, whose chaotic musical approach is often cited as particularly influential. Their 1982 split LP with fellow Washington band The Faith showed both bands exhibiting quick, fiery, high-speed punk rock. It has been argued that those recordings laid the foundation for early thrash metal, at least in terms of selected tempos, and that thrash is essentially hardcore punk with the technical proficiency missing from that genre. The crossover with hardcore punk has also been cited as important influence on thrash, especially the English hardcore punk band Discharge, whose \"influence on heavy metal is incalculable and metal superstars such as Metallica, Anthrax, Machine Head, Sepultura, Soulfly, Prong and Arch Enemy have covered Discharge's songs in tribute.\" The eponymous debut albums by D.R.I. and Suicidal Tendencies, both released in 1983, have been credited for paving the way for thrashcore.\nIn Europe, the earliest band of the emerging thrash movement was Venom from Newcastle upon Tyne, formed in 1978. Their 1982 album \"Black Metal\" has been cited as a major influence on many subsequent genres and bands in the extreme metal world, such as Bathory, Hellhammer, Slayer, and Mayhem. The European scene was almost exclusively influenced by the most aggressive music Germany and England were producing at the time. British bands such as Tank and Raven, along with German bands Accept (whose 1982 song \"Fast as a Shark\" is often credited as one of the first-ever thrash/speed metal songs) and Living Death, motivated musicians from central Europe to start bands of their own, eventually producing groups such as Sodom, Kreator, and Destruction from Germany, as well as Switzerland's Celtic Frost (formed by two-thirds of Hellhammer), Coroner and Carrion (who later became Poltergeist) and Denmark's Artillery.\nThrash metal in the 1980s.\nBirth and underground expansion (1980\u20131983).\nCritics argue over who can be thought of as the first thrash metal band to exist. Most credit either British band Venom or the genre's so-called \"Big Four\": Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth, with commentators crediting Venom as the first thrash metal band and others tending to favor the \"Big Four\", though many give equal credit to all those five bands. The origins of thrash metal have also been traced to San Francisco Bay Area band Exodus, who formed in 1979 and is the fifth band in what is sometimes considered the \"Big Five\". The band released its first demo in 1982, simply titled \"Demo 1982\", which was widely circulated in the tape trading community and is credited for paving the way for the 1980s Bay Area thrash metal scene. A few commentators argue for other bands, including Overkill and Metal Church (both of whom formed in 1980), as the earliest bands to play thrash metal before releasing albums.\nIn 1981, Los Angeles band Leather Charm wrote a song entitled \"Hit the Lights\". Leather Charm soon disbanded and the band's primary songwriter, vocalist/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, met drummer Lars Ulrich through a classified advertisement. Together, Hetfield and Ulrich formed Metallica, one of the \"Big Four\" thrash bands, with lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who would later form Megadeth, another of the \"Big Four\" originators of thrash, and bassist Ron McGovney. McGovney would be replaced by Cliff Burton (formerly of Trauma), and Mustaine was later replaced by Kirk Hammett of the then-unsigned Exodus, and at Burton's insistence, the band relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area. Before Metallica had even settled on a definitive lineup, Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel asked Hetfield and Ulrich (credited as \"Mettallica\") to record \"Hit the Lights\" for the first edition of his \"Metal Massacre\" compilation in 1982. A re-recorded version of \"Hit the Lights\" would later open their first studio album, \"Kill 'Em All\", released in July 1983. \"Kill 'Em All\" is widely regarded as the first thrash metal album, and one of the album's tracks \"Whiplash\" has been referred to as one of the first songs of the genre.\nAnother \"Big Four\" thrash band formed in Los Angeles in 1981, when guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King met while auditioning for the same band and subsequently decided to form a band of their own. Hanneman and King recruited vocalist/bassist Tom Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo, and Slayer was formed. Slayer was discovered by Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel; the band's live performance of Iron Maiden's \"Phantom of the Opera\" so impressed him that he promptly signed them to his label. In December 1983, five months after the release of Metallica's debut \"Kill 'Em All\", Slayer released their debut album, \"Show No Mercy\".\nTo the north, Canada produced influential thrash and speed metal bands such as Annihilator, Anvil, Exciter, Razor, Sacrifice, and Voivod.\nMainstream popularity (1984\u20131989).\nFirst wave (1984\u20131986).\nThe popularity of thrash metal increased in 1984 with the release of Metallica's sophomore record \"Ride the Lightning\", as well as Anthrax's debut \"Fistful of Metal\" and Metal Church's eponymous debut album. Slayer and Overkill released extended plays on independent labels during this era, \"Haunting the Chapel\" and \"Overkill\" respectively. This led to a heavier-sounding form of thrash, which was reflected in Exodus' debut album \"Bonded by Blood\", Slayer's \"Hell Awaits\" and Anthrax's \"Spreading the Disease\", all three released in 1985. Several other debut albums were released that same year, including Megadeth's \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\", Overkill's \"Feel the Fire\", Kreator's \"Endless Pain\", Destruction's \"Infernal Overkill\", Possessed's \"Seven Churches\", Celtic Frost's \"To Mega Therion\", Watchtower's \"Energetic Disassembly\" and the Sepultura EP \"Bestial Devastation\". \"Seven Churches\" and \"To Mega Therion\" are often credited for pioneering and popularizing the mid-1980s extreme metal scene (as well as the then-developing genres of death metal and black metal, respectively), while \"Energetic Disassembly\" has been cited as the first technical thrash metal album, and as \"the recording most responsible for the development of the progressive metal genre\".\nFrom a creative standpoint, the year 1986 was perhaps the pinnacle of thrash metal, as a number of critically acclaimed and genre-defining albums were released. Metallica's major label debut \"Master of Puppets\" was released in March, becoming the first thrash album to be certified platinum, being certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); it would be the band's last album to feature bassist Cliff Burton, who was killed in a bus accident six months after its release. Kreator released \"Pleasure to Kill\" in April 1986, which would later be a major influence on the death metal scene. Megadeth released \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" in September, an album which proved to be the band's commercial and critical breakthrough and which AllMusic later cited as \"a classic of early thrash\". Slayer, regarded as one of the most sinister thrash metal bands of the early 1980s, released \"Reign in Blood\" in October, an album considered by some to have single-handedly inspired the death metal genre. Also in October, Nuclear Assault released their debut album \"Game Over\", followed a month later by Dark Angel's \"Darkness Descends\", which marked the debut of drummer Gene Hoglan. Flotsam and Jetsam's debut album \"Doomsday for the Deceiver\" (released on the Fourth of July in 1986) received some attention as well, due to the album being \"the first of only a handful\" to ever receive a 6K rating from \"Kerrang!\" magazine, and it is also notable for featuring a then-unknown Jason Newsted, who, not long after the album's release, joined Metallica as Burton's replacement.\nAlso during the mid-to-late 1980s, bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, D.R.I., S.O.D. (who featured three-fifths of Anthrax), and Corrosion of Conformity paved the way to what became known as crossover thrash, a fusion genre that lies on a continuum between heavy metal and hardcore punk, and is arguably faster and more aggressive than thrash metal.\nSecond wave (1987\u20131989).\nBy the mid-to-late 1980s, thrash metal began to achieve major mainstream success worldwide, with many bands of the genre receiving heavy rotation on MTV's \"Headbangers Ball\", and radio stations such as KNAC in Long Beach and Z Rock in Dallas, as well as coverage on numerous publications, including \"Kerrang!\" and \"RIP Magazine\". These outlets not only played a major role in the crossover success of thrash metal during this time, but helped push album sales of the genre's \"Big Four\" and similar bands or moved them from playing clubs to arenas and stadiums.\nAnthrax made its mainstream breakthrough in 1987 with the release of their gold-certified album \"Among the Living\", which borrowed elements from their two previous releases, with fast guitar riffs and pounding drums. Shortly after the release of \"Among the Living\", three Bay Area bands, Testament, Death Angel and Heathen, respectively released their debut albums \"The Legacy\", \"The Ultra-Violence\" and \"Breaking the Silence\". All of the \"Big Four\" of Teutonic thrash metal also released albums in 1987: Kreator's \"Terrible Certainty\", Destruction's \"Release from Agony\", Sodom's \"Persecution Mania\" and Tankard's \"Chemical Invasion\"; those albums cemented their reputations as top-tier German thrash metal bands.\nIn response to thrash metal's growing popularity during this period, several hardcore punk bands began changing their style to a more heavier direction, including Venice, Los Angeles act Suicidal Tendencies, who are often considered to be one of the \"fathers of crossover thrash\", and became more recognized as a thrash metal band in the late 1980s (thanks in large part to the presence of guitarists Rocky George and Mike Clark); the band would reach new heights of success with their first two major-label albums, \"How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today\" (1988) and \"Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit... D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" (1989). D.R.I.'s music took a similar direction with their last three albums of the 1980s, \"Crossover\" (1987), \"4 of a Kind\" (1988), and \"Thrash Zone\" (1989). This trend was expanded by many bands that came from a punk background, including UK acts Discharge and The Exploited, Los Angeles bands Wasted Youth, Cryptic Slaughter, Excel, Beow\u00fclf and No Mercy, and New York hardcore acts Agnostic Front, Murphy's Law, the Cro-Mags, M.O.D. (fronted by former S.O.D. singer Billy Milano), the Crumbsuckers, Ludichrist, Leeway, and Prong.\nFrom 1987 to 1989, Overkill released \"Taking Over\", \"Under the Influence,\" and \"The Years of Decay\", three albums considered their best. Each of the \"Big Four\" of thrash metal bands released albums in 1988: Slayer released \"South of Heaven\", Megadeth released \"So Far, So Good... So What!\", Anthrax released \"State of Euphoria\" while Metallica's \"...And Justice for All\" spawned the band's first video and Top 40 hit, the World War I-themed song \"One\". That same year, Metallica joined Van Halen, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come on the two-month-long arena and stadium tour Monsters of Rock in North America. In the spring of 1989, Anthrax teamed up with Exodus and Helloween on a US arena tour sponsored by \"Headbangers Ball\".\nSepultura's third album, \"Beneath the Remains\" (1989), earned them some mainstream appeal as it was released by Roadrunner Records. Testament's second and third albums, \"The New Order\" (1988) and \"Practice What You Preach\" (1989), nearly gained them the same level of popularity as the \"Big Four\", while Exodus' third album \"Fabulous Disaster\" (1989) garnered the band their first music video and one of their most recognized songs, the mosh-pit anthem \"The Toxic Waltz\". Vio-lence, Forbidden, and Sadus, three relative latecomers to the Bay Area thrash metal scene, released their debut albums \"Eternal Nightmare\", \"Forbidden Evil,\" and \"Illusions\", respectively, in 1988; the latter album demonstrated a sound that was primarily driven by the fretless bass of Steve Di Giorgio. Also in 1988, Blind Illusion released its only studio album for more than two decades, \"The Sane Asylum\", which received some particular attention as it was produced by Kirk Hammett, and is also notable for featuring bassist Les Claypool and former Possessed guitarist Larry LaLonde; after its release, the two would later team up together in Claypool's then-upcoming band Primus.\nCanadian thrashers Annihilator released their highly technical debut \"Alice in Hell\" in 1989, which was praised for its fast riffs and extended guitar solos. In Germany, Sodom released \"Agent Orange\", and Kreator would release \"Extreme Aggression\". Several highly acclaimed albums associated with the subgenre of technical thrash metal were also released in 1989, including Coroner's \"No More Color\", Dark Angel's \"Leave Scars\", Toxik's \"Think This,\" and Watchtower's \"Control and Resistance\", which has been recognized and acknowledged as one of the cornerstones of jazz-metal fusion and a major influence on the technical death metal genre, while Forced Entry's debut album \"Uncertain Future\" helped pioneer the late 1980s Seattle music scene.\nThrash metal in the 1990s.\nContinued popularity (1990\u20131991).\nA number of more typical but technically sophisticated albums were released in 1990, including Megadeth's \"Rust in Peace\", Anthrax's \"Persistence of Time\", Slayer's \"Seasons in the Abyss\", Suicidal Tendencies' \"Lights...Camera...Revolution!\", Testament's \"Souls of Black\", Kreator's \"Coma of Souls\", Destruction's \"Cracked Brain\", Forbidden's \"Twisted into Form\", Exodus' \"Impact Is Imminent\", Death Angel's \"Act III\", Annihilator's \"Never, Neverland\", Sacred Reich's \"The American Way\", Prong's \"Beg to Differ\", Pantera's \"Cowboys from Hell\" and Exhorder's \"Slaughter in the Vatican\"; the latter three are often credited for being an integral part of the then-developing groove metal genre. All of those albums were commercial high points for the aforementioned artists. During this period, Megadeth and Slayer co-headlined one of the most successful tours in thrash metal history called the Clash of the Titans; the first leg in Europe included support from Testament and Suicidal Tendencies, while the second leg in North America had Anthrax and then-emerging Seattle band Alice in Chains, who were the supporting act.\nSeveral albums, some of which had come to be known as technical thrash metal, were released in 1991, including Overkill's \"Horrorscope\", Heathen's \"Victims of Deception\", Dark Angel's \"Time Does Not Heal\", Sepultura's \"Arise\", Coroner's \"Mental Vortex\", Prong's \"Prove You Wrong\", Forced Entry's \"As Above, So Below\" and Wrathchild America's \"3-D\".\nIn 1991, Metallica released their eponymous fifth studio album, known as \"The Black Album\". Produced by Bob Rock (who was then known for working with the likes of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi and The Cult), the album marked a stylistic change in the band, eliminating much of the speed and longer song structures of the band's previous work, and instead focusing on more concise and heavier songs. The album was a change in Metallica's direction from the thrash metal style of the band's previous four studio albums towards a more contemporary heavy metal sound with original hard rock elements, but still had remnant characteristics of thrash metal. \"Metallica\" would go on to become the band's best-selling album and began a wave of thrash metal bands releasing more garage-oriented albums, or else more experimental ones.\nDecline (1991\u20131999).\nThe era of 1991\u20131992 marked the beginning of the end of thrash metal's commercial peak, due to the rising popularity of the alternative metal and grunge movements (the latter spearheaded by Washington-based bands Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam). In response to this climate change, many thrash metal bands that had emerged from the previous decade had called it quits or went on hiatus during the 1990s, while half of the \"Big Four\" and other veteran bands began changing to more accessible, radio-friendly styles. Metallica was a notable example of this shift, particularly with their mid-to-late 1990s albums \"Load\", and \"ReLoad\", which displayed minor blues and southern rock influences, and were seen as a major departure from the band's earlier sound. Megadeth took a more accessible heavy metal route starting with their 1992 album \"Countdown to Extinction\". Testament, Exodus and Flotsam and Jetsam all took a melodic/progressive approach with the albums \"The Ritual\", \"Force of Habit\", and \"Cuatro\", respectively. One of the pioneers of crossover thrash, Corrosion of Conformity, began changing their sound into a slower and Black Sabbath-influenced heavy metal direction with their post-1980s output, adapting influences and textures of sludge, doom metal, blues, and southern rock on several of their albums, including \"Blind\" (1991), \"Deliverance\" (1994) and \"Wiseblood\" (1996).\nThe remainder of the 1990s saw many thrash metal bands expand their sound by adding elements and influences from the groove metal genre, which was then popularized by Pantera, White Zombie and Machine Head. Anthrax, who had recently replaced Joey Belladonna with John Bush as their singer, began stepping away from their previously established thrash metal formula to a more accessible alternative/groove metal approach for the remainder of their 1990s output, starting with and including \"Sound of White Noise\" (1993). Sacred Reich, Overkill, Coroner, Prong, Testament, and Forbidden followed this trend with their respective albums \"Independent\", \"I Hear Black\", \"Grin\", \"Cleansing\", \"Low\", and \"Distortion\". Sepultura's 1993 album \"Chaos A.D.\" also marked the beginning of their transition away from death/thrash metal to groove metal which had influenced then-up-and-coming bands like Korn, who reciprocally became the inspiration behind the nu metal style of the band's next album \"Roots\" (1996). \"Roots\" would influence a generation of bands from Linkin Park to Slipknot, which during the 1990s meant the replacement of death, thrash, and speed, by nu metal and metalcore as popular epicenters of the hardest metal scene.\nStaying away from this new commercial mainstream of groove metal, metalcore, and especially nu metal, the second wave of black metal emerged as an opposed underground music scene, initially in Norway. This crop of new bands differenced themselves from the \"first wave\" by totally distilling black metal from the combined origins with thrash metal, but they preserved from all these sub-genres the emphasis on atmosphere over rhythm.\nAs further extreme metal genres came to prominence in the 1990s (industrial metal, death metal, and black metal each finding their own fanbase), the heavy metal \"family tree\" soon found itself blending aesthetics and styles. For example, bands with all the musical traits of thrash metal began using death growls, a vocal style borrowed from death metal, while black metal bands often utilized the airy feel of synthesizers, popularized in industrial metal. Today the placing of bands within distinct sub-genres remains a source of contention for heavy metal fans, however, little debate resides over the fact that thrash metal is the sole proprietor of its respective spin-offs.\nRevivals (2000\u2013present).\nA few thrash metal bands from the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the genre's U.S. \"Big Four\", continued recording and touring with success in the 2000s. In 2003, Anthrax released their first studio album in five years \"We've Come for You All\", followed a month later by Metallica's double platinum-certified album \"St. Anger\". After experimenting further with a commercialized sound on their previous few albums, Megadeth returned to its heavier sound with their ninth album \"The World Needs a Hero\" (2001). It would be the band's final album before disbanding in the following year, due to an arm injury that had left Dave Mustaine unable to play guitar; he would eventually reform Megadeth for a handful of albums, including \"The System Has Failed\" (2004) which was originally going to be released as a solo album by him, before reuniting with co-founding member and bassist David Ellefson in 2010. Slayer released three albums in the 2000s: \"God Hates Us All\" (2001), which saw a return to their signature thrash metal sound, followed by \"Christ Illusion\" (2006) and \"World Painted Blood\" (2009), both of which marked their first studio albums with drummer Dave Lombardo in nearly two decades. Although their career had declined from its peak in the 1990s, Overkill was perhaps one of the most-active thrash metal groups outside of the \"Big Four\", having never disbanded or taken longer breaks in-between records, and by 2000's \"Bloodletting\", they were the first band in the genre to release more than ten studio albums. Overkill's popularity was reignited in the 2010s, with three of their albums, \"The Electric Age\" (2012), \"White Devil Armory\" (2014) and \"The Grinding Wheel\" (2017), all entering the Top 100 on the \"Billboard\" charts.\nThe resurgence of interest in the thrash metal genre during the early 2000s was widely attributed to the Thrash of the Titans festival, which was held in August 2001 as a co-benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy and Death's Chuck Schuldiner, who were both battling cancer. The show is also notable for seeing several of Testament's Bay Area thrash metal contemporaries reunite, including Exodus, Death Angel, Vio-lence, Forbidden Evil, Sadus and Legacy (a precursor to Testament). Many thrash metal bands outside of the Bay Area would subsequently reunite, including Anthrax (twice with Joey Belladonna and briefly with John Bush), Dark Angel, Nuclear Assault, Sacred Reich, UK bands Onslaught, Sabbat, and Xentrix, and Canada's Sacrifice, renewing interest in previous decades.\nThe term \"thrash-revivalists\" has been applied to such bands as Lamb of God, Municipal Waste, Evile, Havok, Warbringer, Vektor, Bonded by Blood, Hatchet, and Power Trip. Evile's 2007 debut album \"Enter the Grave\", produced by former Metallica producer and engineer Flemming Rasmussen, received considerable praise for its sound, which combined elements of the sounds of Slayer and the Bay Area scene (particularly Exodus and Testament). Los Angeles-based bands Warbringer and Bonded by Blood took a similar approach on their respective debut albums, \"War Without End\" and \"Feed the Beast\", both released in 2008. Perhaps the most commercially successful band from the 2000s and 2010s thrash metal revival movement is Lamb of God, who are also considered a key part of the new wave of American heavy metal movement, have received two gold-certified albums in the U.S., and have gone from playing small clubs to arenas and stadiums.\nNotable bands returned to their roots with albums such as Kreator's \"Violent Revolution\" (2001), Metallica's \"Death Magnetic\" (2008), Megadeth's \"Endgame\" (2009), Slayer's \"World Painted Blood\" (2009), Exodus' \"\" (2010), Overkill's \"Ironbound\" (2010), Anthrax's \"Worship Music\" (2011), Testament's \"Dark Roots of Earth\" (2012), and Flotsam and Jetsam's \"Ugly Noise\" (2012). More recent bands of the genre, such as Havok and Legion of the Damned have turned their focus towards a more aggressive rendition of thrash metal, incorporating elements of melodic death metal.\nDerivative forms.\nThrash metal is directly responsible for the development of underground metal genres, such as death metal, black metal, and groove metal. In addition to this, metalcore, grindcore, and deathcore employ similar riffs in their composition, the former with more focus on melody rather than chromaticism. The blending of punk ethos and metal's brutal nature led to even more extreme, underground styles after thrash metal began gaining mild commercial success in the late 1980s. \nWith gorier subject matter, heavier down tuning of guitars, more consistent use of blast beat drumming, and darker, atonal death growls, death metal was established in the mid-1980s. Black metal, also related to thrash metal, emerged at the same time, with many black metal bands taking influence from thrash metal bands such as Venom. Black metal continued deviating from thrash metal, often providing more orchestral overtones, open tremolo picking, blast beat drumming, shrieked or raspy vocals and pagan or occult-based aesthetics to distinguish itself from thrash metal. Thrash metal would later combine with its spinoffs, thus giving rise to genres like blackened thrash metal and deathrash. \nGroove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of thrash metal and plays them at mid-tempo, with most bands making only occasional forays into fast tempo, but since the early 1990s, it started to favor a more death metal-derived sound. Thrash metal with stronger punk elements is called crossover thrash. Its overall sound is more punk-influenced than traditional thrash metal but has more heavy metal elements than hardcore punk and thrashcore.\nA fusion of thrash metal with shoegaze is called dream thrash. According to Emma Cownley of \"Metal Hammer\", \"Dream thrash combines the ethereal sounds of shoegaze with the distortion, blast beats and tremolo picking of thrash.\" One practitioner of this style is Astronoid.\nRegional scenes.\nThrash metal emerged predominantly from a handful of regional scenes, each of which was generally distinguished by the unique characteristics of its bands.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73644", "revid": "28979433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73644", "title": "Fagaceae", "text": "Family of flowering plants\nThe Fagaceae (; from la\u00a0'beech tree') are a family of flowering plants that includes beeches, chestnuts and oaks, and comprises eight genera with around 1,000 or more species. Fagaceae in temperate regions are mostly deciduous, whereas in the tropics, many species occur as evergreen trees and shrubs. They are characterized by alternate simple leaves with pinnate venation, unisexual flowers in the form of catkins, and fruit in the form of cup-like (cupule) nuts. Their leaves are often lobed, and both petioles and stipules are generally present. Their fruits lack endosperm and lie in a scaly or spiny husk that may or may not enclose the entire nut, which may consist of one to seven seeds. In the oaks, genus \"Quercus\", the fruit is a non-valved nut (usually containing one seed) called an acorn. The husk of the acorn in most oaks only forms a cup in which the nut sits. Other members of the family have fully enclosed nuts. Fagaceae is one of the most ecologically important woody plant families in the Northern Hemisphere, as oaks form the backbone of temperate forest in North America, Europe, and Asia, and are one of the most significant sources of wildlife food.\nSeveral members of the Fagaceae have important economic uses. Many species of oak, chestnut, and beech (genera \"Quercus\", \"Castanea\", and \"Fagus\", respectively) are commonly used as timber for floors, furniture, cabinets, and wine barrels. Cork for stopping wine bottles and a myriad other uses is made from the bark of cork oak, \"Quercus suber.\" Chestnuts are the fruits from species of the genus \"Castanea.\" Numerous species from several genera are prominent ornamentals. Wood chips from the genus \"Fagus\" are often used in flavoring beers. Nuts of some species in the Asian tropical genera \"Castanopsis\" and \"Lithocarpus\" are edible and often used as ornamentals.\nClassification.\nThe Fagaceae are often divided into five or six subfamilies and are generally accepted to include 8 (to 10) genera (listed below). Monophyly of the Fagaceae is strongly supported by both morphological (especially fruit morphology) and molecular data.\nThe Southern Hemisphere genus \"Nothofagus,\" commonly the southern beeches, was historically placed in the Fagaceae as sister to the genus \"Fagus\", but recent molecular evidence suggests otherwise. While \"Nothofagus\" shares a number of common characteristics with the Fagaceae, such as cupule fruit structure, it differs significantly in a number of ways, including distinct stipule and pollen morphology, as well as having a different number of chromosomes. The currently accepted view by systematic botanists is that \"Nothofagus\" should be placed in its own family, Nothofagaceae.\nSubfamilies and genera.\nThere are two subfamilies:\nFagoideae.\nAuth. K. Koch. Monotypic\nThe genus \"Nothofagus\" (southern beeches: from the Southern Hemisphere), formerly included in the Fagaceae, is now treated in the separate monotypic family Nothofagaceae.\nQuercoideae.\nAuth. \u00d5rsted\nThe \"Quercus\" subgenus \"Cyclobalanopsis\" is treated as a distinct genus by the , but as a section or subgenus by most taxonomists.\nDistribution.\nThe Fagaceae are widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Genus-level diversity is concentrated in Southeast Asia, where most of the extant genera are thought to have evolved before migrating to Europe and North America (via the Bering Land Bridge). Members of the Fagaceae (such as \"Fagus grandifolia\", \"Castanea dentata\" and \"Quercus alba\" in the Northeastern United States, or \"Fagus sylvatica\", \"Quercus robur\" and \"Q. petraea\" in Europe) are often ecologically dominant in northern temperate forests. More than 400 species of Fagaceae, mostly \"Castanopsis\" and \"Lithocarpus\", grow in Southeast Asia, with some species in similar dominant roles over large areas.\nPhylogeny.\nModern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73645", "revid": "46085058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73645", "title": "Kreator", "text": "German thrash metal band\nKreator is a German thrash metal band from Essen, formed in 1982. Their current line-up consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Miland \"Mille\" Petrozza, drummer J\u00fcrgen \"Ventor\" Reil, lead guitarist Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6, and bassist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq. The band's line-up has changed multiple times throughout its -year career, most noticeably their bassists and lead guitarists. Petrozza and Reil are the only two original members left in Kreator, although the latter left the band in 1994 but rejoined in 1996. Yli-Sirni\u00f6 has been the lead guitarist of Kreator since 2001, while Leclercq joined in 2019 as the replacement of Christian \"Speesy\" Giesler, who had been in the band since 1994.\nTo date, Kreator has released fifteen studio albums, two EPs, two live albums and three compilation albums. They gained a large underground fanbase within the international thrash metal community, with their second studio album \"Pleasure to Kill\" (1986) regarded as an influential album of the genre. Many of their subsequent albums \u2014 including \"Terrible Certainty\" (1987), \"Extreme Aggression\" (1989) and \"Coma of Souls\" (1990) \u2014 were also highly acclaimed. Despite being an influential band, as well as one of the first European thrash metal acts to sign to a major label (signing to Epic Records in 1988), Kreator would not achieve mainstream popularity until later albums, including their thirteenth studio album \"Phantom Antichrist\" (2012) and its follow-up \"Gods of Violence\" (2017), both of which charted highly in many countries, with the latter reaching number one on the German charts. Their upcoming sixteenth studio album, \"Krushers of the World\", is due for release on 16 January 2026.\nKreator has achieved worldwide sales of over two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them one of the best-selling German thrash metal bands of all time. Along with Destruction, Sodom and Tankard, they are credited as one of the \"Big Four\" of Teutonic thrash metal, responsible for developing and popularizing the German thrash metal scene as well as pioneering the then-emerging death metal and black metal genres during the mid-1980s.\nHistory.\nFormation and early releases (1982\u20131987).\nThe band was originally formed in 1982 as Metal Militia in Essen, Germany, and then became Tyrant. Later they used the name Tormentor until 1984, when they changed to its current name Kreator. The original line-up featured lead vocalist and guitarist Mille Petrozza, drummer J\u00fcrgen \"Ventor\" Reil, and bassist Rob Fioretti. Kreator recorded their debut album, \"Endless Pain\" (1985), in just ten days. The band hired future Sodom guitarist Michael Wulf for the album's tour to play lead, while Petrozza switched to rhythm guitar.\nWulf was only in the band for a few days but, contrary to the liner notes, he did not play on the band's second album, \"Pleasure to Kill\" (1986), which is widely considered a thrash classic and a big influence on the death metal genre. It would not be until 31 years after its release that \"Pleasure to Kill\" entered the German album charts. Produced by Harris Johns (who had also worked with Sodom, Helloween and Voivod), the album showed the band growing in talent and technical ability. The song \"Flag of Hate\" became a concert standard, and the band became one of the most promising up-and-coming European metal acts. The band started their first tour ever (prior to the release of \"Pleasure to Kill\", they had only played five gigs total); they played their first shows outside of Germany during the fall of 1986, touring Europe with Destruction and Celtic Frost, and in the spring of 1987, they toured North America for the first time, supporting Voivod on their \"Killing Technology\" tour. Kreator's first EP, \"Flag of Hate\", was also released in 1986. The band would become a quartet with the addition of guitarist J\u00f6rge Trebziatowski.\nRising popularity (1987\u20131991).\nIn 1987, Kreator released its third studio album, \"Terrible Certainty\", often considered a high-quality record as the arrangements were more complex and the tempos more varied. The album featured another hit, \"Behind the Mirror\". The band's popularity continued growing and a music video for \"Toxic Trace\" received airplay on MTV. They found enough time and money (coming from their concerts) to finance another EP, \"Out of the Dark... Into the Light\" (1988). By this point, Kreator was headlining their own tours and playing at theaters and arenas with bands such as Megadeth, Voivod, Overkill, D.R.I. and Holy Terror.\nBerlin-based independent record label Noise Records licensed Kreator for the territories outside of Europe and Japan to major label Epic Records, with whom the band signed in 1988. Their fourth studio album and debut with Epic (for limited territories), \"Extreme Aggression\", recorded in Los Angeles, became a metal hit in Europe upon its release in 1989. However, the album would not enter the German album charts until 28 years after its release. Continuing the \"Terrible Certainty\" formula while progressing musically with better production by the well-regarded Randy Burns (who had also worked with Megadeth, Possessed, Nuclear Assault, Death, Dark Angel, among others), the album featured the band's first major singles, the title track, \"Betrayer\" and the radio-only \"Love Us or Hate Us\", gaining support from the Southern California radio station KNAC, and the video for \"Betrayer\" receiving airplay on MTV's \"Headbangers Ball\". This, as well as playing with bands like King Diamond, Raven, Coroner, Suicidal Tendencies, Death, and Sadus, greatly expanded their popularity outside of Germany.\nAlso in 1989, German director Thomas Schadt made a documentary about Kreator (focusing on the social aspect of heavy metal in the Ruhr area) titled \"Thrash Altenessen\" (named after the band's hometown, a suburb of Essen). Tritze left Kreator after the release of \"Extreme Aggression\". In 1990, with new guitarist Frank \"Blackfire\" Gosdzik (then-formerly of Sodom), the band released their fifth studio album, \"Coma of Souls\", again produced by Burns. The album was not quite as praised as the band's previous few albums (many felt it was \"rushed\" and repetitive), but it still managed to sell and maintain popularity quite well, with the singles \"When the Sun Burns Red\" and \"People of the Lie\" becoming hits.\nExperimentation (1992\u20132000).\nThe early 1990s brought a decline in the popularity of traditional thrash metal, which was replaced by grunge. By 1992, Kreator had been released from their American contract with CBS/Sony Music, then-home of the likes of Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam. Their sixth studio album, \"Renewal\", was released in the fall of that year, and featured heavy death metal and industrial influences. While reaching a newer audience, the band upset many longtime fans, accusing them of \"selling out\". Kreator experienced a decline in popularity as a result of the backlash against the album.\nThe line-up also underwent significant changes. Founding member Roberto Fioretti left after recording the album and was replaced by Andreas Herz. In 1994, Reil departed as well, leaving Petrozza the sole original band member. Reil was replaced by Joe Cangelosi while Herz left the same year and was replaced by Christian \"Speesy\" Giesler. During this time, Kreator had ended their tenure with Noise Records and signed with GUN Records. The new line-up released the album \"Cause for Conflict\" in 1995. The songs bore a heavy influence of such bands as Pantera and Machine Head, as well as a partial resemblance to \"Renewal\".\nGosdzik and Cangelosi left in 1996 and were replaced by Tommy Vetterli (then-formerly of Coroner) and a returning Reil, respectively. Kreator continued to experiment, producing \"Outcast\" (1997) and \"Endorama\" (1999) with ambient and gothic influences and incorporating samples and loops. However, record sales went down, and by the end of the 1990s, the band had reached commercial and critical nadir. Despite that, Petrozza was quoted as stating: \"For us, success doesn't define in record sales. So all our albums have been successful for us, because we've achieved what we were aiming for.\"\nReturn in style (2001\u20132009).\nIn 2001, with Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 replacing Tommy Vetterli on guitar, Kreator released their tenth studio album, \"Violent Revolution\", which saw the band return to its classic thrash metal style. Despite containing a lot of melodic and so-called \"Gothenburg metal\" riffs, \"Violent Revolution\" was praised highly by fans and critics alike and benefited from the 2000s thrash metal revival movement, led by Overkill, Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus and Testament. The tour was extremely successful and introduced Kreator to a younger generation of metal fans. Yli-Sirni\u00f6, who lived in Germany, was known to be a good guitar player, so the band recruited him. A live album, \"Live Kreation\", and a live DVD, \"Live Kreation: Revisioned Glory\", were both released in 2003, and their eleventh studio album \u2013 emphasizing more on the Gothenburg influences \u2013 \"Enemy of God\" was released in 2005. A special edition was re-released in 2006, called \"Enemy of God: Revisited\". In early 2006, Kreator toured North America with Napalm Death, A Perfect Murder, and The Undying. There was a joint headline European tour with Celtic Frost in 2007 with support from Watain. Kreator were slated to tour in 2008 with King Diamond, Leaves' Eyes, and Cellador, but this tour was canceled due to back issues with King Diamond.\nIn March 2008, the \"At the Pulse of Kapitulation\" DVD was released, featuring \"Live in East Berlin\" and \"Hallucinative Comas\" on one disc. Both had previously been available on VHS only and were long out of print. The band also began working on their twelfth full-length album in late 2007/early 2008, and began recording in July 2008. Recording for the album, titled \"Hordes of Chaos\", wrapped up in late August, with the album released in January 2009. On 23 January 2009, the band began their \"Chaos Over Europe\" tour in Tilburg (the Netherlands) with Caliban, Eluveitie and Emergency Gate as other acts. In April 2009, the band embarked on a North American headlining tour, co-headlined by Exodus, and supported by Belphegor, Warbringer, and Epicurean. In late 2009, Reil was forced to sit out some tour dates due to personal issues, with Marco Minnemann temporarily taking his place.\n\"Phantom Antichrist\" and \"Gods of Violence\" (2010\u20132017).\nKreator signed with Nuclear Blast in early 2010, before embarking on a North American tour in March to celebrate their 25th anniversary. A European tour with Exodus, Death Angel and Suicidal Angels, entitled Thrashfest, took place in late 2010. On 1 June 2012, they released their thirteenth studio album, \"Phantom Antichrist\". Kreator co-headlined a 23-date North American tour that fall with Nuclear Blast labelmates Accept. Entitled the Teutonic Terror Attack 2012 tour, they were supported by Finland's Swallow the Sun. Kreator performed alongside Suidakra in Bangalore on 16 June 2012.\nKreator released a music video for \"Civilization Collapse\" on 28 November 2012.\nIn a November 2013 interview, Mille Petrozza stated that Kreator would begin working on their fourteenth studio album after the \"Phantom Antichrist\" tour for a 2016 release. However, Petrozza said that the album would not be released until 2017. On 30 August that year, they released a double live album called \"Dying Alive\". It contained 24 tracks recorded at Turbinehalle in Oberhausen, Germany. On 14 October 2016, it was announced that Kreator's fourteenth studio album would be called \"Gods of Violence\", and it was released on 27 January 2017. A music video for the album's title track was released on 18 November 2016. \"Gods of Violence\" received generally positive reviews, and was their first album to reach number one on the German charts. To promote the album, Kreator embarked on a headlining European tour in February and March 2017, with support from Sepultura, Soilwork and Aborted, and co-headlined the Decibel Magazine tour with Obituary in March and April. In late April, the band announced an Australian tour with Vader, which took place in September. They embarked on two tours in 2018: one in Europe with Decapitated and Dagoba in January, followed by a co-headlining North American tour with Sabaton in February and March.\nSplit with Christian Giesler, \"Hate \u00dcber Alles\" and \"Krushers of the World\" (2018\u2013present).\nAbout three months after the release of \"Gods of Violence\", Petrozza mentioned the possibility of a follow-up album, saying, \"Maybe we should work with a different producer. Maybe we should go to a different country to record the album. Maybe we should write a more metal or more full-on thrash metal. Whatever we feel, first and foremost, that is the most important thing. Time will tell.\" In a September 2017 interview with Australia's Silver Tiger Media, Petrozza stated that Kreator could do another album after \"Gods of Violence\" but \"not yet.\" When asked in February 2018 about the band's future, Petrozza said, \"I think we're gonna take next year off and write a new record. That's the plan at least. We'll see what happens. I don't put myself under pressure. Let's see how I feel after this tour, and if I have ideas for new music, I will book a studio and start working on demos as soon as I have the time. And then I'll come up with some new stuff.\" He told \"Guitar Interactive\" magazine in July 2018 that Kreator would take 2019 off to focus on writing the new album, which was planned for release in the summer of 2020. Petrozza later stated their new album was not expected to be released until the summer of 2021.\nIn early December, Kreator embarked on the European Apocalypse tour with Dimmu Borgir, Hatebreed and Bloodbath. It was announced that the final concert of the European Apocalypse tour in London would be filmed and produced as a live DVD in 2019. Titled \"London Apocalypticon - Live at the Roundhouse\", this DVD was released on 14 February 2020. Kreator supported Slayer on their final world tour, appearing at the Santiago Gets Louder festival in Chile on 6 October 2019, along with Anthrax and Pentagram Chile.\nOn 16 September 2019, it was announced that Christian \"Speesy\" Giesler had left Kreator after 25 years as their bassist, and was replaced by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq, who had recently left DragonForce.\nOn 26 March 2020, Kreator released a music video for \"666 - World Divided\", which marked their first song in three years and their first one since Leclercq joined the band.\nOn 20 July 2020, Petrozza posted a picture of himself in the studio on his Instagram page, indicating that Kreator was working on their next album. Petrozza confirmed two months later that Kreator had been writing new material \"in the last couple of months\", and that he was recording vocals for the album. In a March 2021 interview, Petrozza revealed that Kreator was supposed to start recording their new album in February, but this plan was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. He went on to say that he wants \"the album to come out and go on a world tour right afterwards\", and revealed that Arthur Rizk would produce it. The band announced in September 2021 that they had begun recording the album at Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin, Germany with Rizk. In December 2021, Petrozza announced on his Instagram page that their new album would be released in the summer of 2022, preceded by a \"new single SOON!\". On 4 February 2022, the band released the title track from \"Hate \u00dcber Alles\" as the album's first single, and announced on the same day that the album would be released on 3 June. The release date was later pushed back to 10 June. A video for the second single from \"Hate \u00dcber Alles\", \"Strongest of the Strong\", was released on 8 April 2022, followed less than a month later by its third single \"Midnight Sun\". A fourth music video was released for \"Conquer and Destroy\" on 22 May 2023, though unlike the previous three music videos, this song was not released as a single.\nKreator promoted \"Hate \u00dcber Alles\" with a world tour, including supporting Mercyful Fate on their first North American tour in over 20 years in late 2022, and touring Europe with Lamb of God and Municipal Waste during the winter of 2023. They also co-headlined the Klash of the Titans tour throughout the spring of 2023, first in Latin America with Testament, and then in North America with Sepultura, the latter supported by Death Angel and SpiritWorld. The band continued to tour in support of \"Hate \u00dcber Alles\" throughout 2024, including touring Japan in January\u2013February with In Flames, co-headlining a North American tour with Testament in September\u2013October (with Possessed as the opening act), and co-headlining a European trek in November\u2013December with Anthrax and support from Testament. They also headlined the Klash of the Ruhrpott festival at Amphitheater Gelsenkirchen in Gelsenkirchen, Germany on 20 July 2024, which saw all of the \"Big Teutonic Four\" bands (Kreator, Sodom, Destruction and Tankard) on stage together for the first time. Touring for \"Hate \u00dcber Alles\" continued into 2025, with the band headlining the Demonic Summer tour with Rotting Christ and Warbringer.\nBy October 2023, Kreator had begun working on new material for their sixteenth studio album, which the band had planned to start recording in early 2025. However, Petrozza later stated that it would not be released until 2026. In a June 2025 interview with \"Loaded Radio\", Leclercq confirmed that the band had been \"putting the final touches to a new album that [would] be released sometime next year\", and in the following month, guitarist Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 announced they were \"waiting for the final mixes\". The resulting album, titled \"Krushers of the World\", is due for release on 16 January 2026.\nFormer Kreator bassist Andreas Herz died in December 2023. The news of his death was confirmed by Petrozza.\nA documentary about the band, \"Kreator \u2013 Hate &amp; Hope\", premiered on 2 July 2025 at the 42nd Munich International Film Festival and received its worldwide release on 4 September.\nMusical style and influences.\nKreator's musical style is similar to those of their compatriots Destruction, Sodom and Tankard, usually more complex and, since \"Violent Revolution\" (2001), more melodic. Along with those bands, Kreator has been referred to as one of the \"Big Four\" of Teutonic thrash metal, and they are often credited with helping pioneer death metal and black metal by containing several elements of what was to become those genres. \nThe band's style has changed several times over the years, from a Venom-inspired speed metal sound, later moving into thrash metal, and including a transitional period from thrash to industrial and gothic metal throughout the 1990s. Eduardo Rivadavia of \"AllMusic\" assessed the band's early material: \"Like many of their European speed metal brethren, Kreator fused the 's thrash innovations with Venom's proto-black metal imagery, sparked it with Mot\u00f6rhead's terminal velocity, and capped it off with the nihilistic outlook typical of heavy metal since the seminal days of Black Sabbath.\" Rivadavia assessed: \"Kreator's career also mirrored speed metal's rising and waning fortunes: moving from strength to strength throughout the '80s. [...] As the new decade gave birth to grunge, Kreator felt it necessary to evolve, spending most of the rest of the decade taking their collective foot off the gas and exploring various combinations of industrial, goth[ic] rock, and alternative sounds resulting on 1999's post-metal \"Endorama\".\" In the early 2000s, Kreator returned to its traditional thrash metal sound, which has continued to the present. \nKreator has been influenced by a variety of music, such as post-punk bands Siouxsie and the Banshees, hardcore punk bands Bad Religion, D.R.I., the Exploited, GBH and Raw Power, and 1970s and 1980s hard rock and heavy metal bands, including Accept, Bathory, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Kiss, Mercyful Fate, Metallica, Mot\u00f6rhead, Possessed, Raven, Rush, Slayer and Venom.\nBand members.\nCurrent\nFormer\nTouring\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73647", "revid": "39911211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73647", "title": "Palm Beach County, Florida", "text": "County in Florida, United States\nPalm Beach County is a county in the southeastern part of Florida, located in the Miami metropolitan area. It is Florida's third-most populous county after Miami-Dade County and Broward County and the 24th-most populous in the United States, with 1,492,191 residents as of the 2020 census. Its county seat and largest city is West Palm Beach, which had a population of 117,415 as of 2020. Named after one of its oldest settlements, Palm Beach, the county was established in 1909, after being split from Miami-Dade County. The county's modern-day boundaries were established in 1963.\nPalm Beach County is one of the three counties that make up the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to 6.14 million people in 2020. The area has been increasing in population since the late 19th century, with the incorporation of West Palm Beach in 1894 and after Henry Flagler extended the Florida East Coast Railway and built the Royal Poinciana Hotel, The Breakers, and Whitehall. In 1928, the Okeechobee hurricane struck Palm Beach County and caused thousands of deaths. More recently, the county acquired national attention during the 2000 presidential election, when a controversial recount occurred.\nIn 2004, Palm Beach County was Florida's wealthiest county, with a per capita personal income of $44,518. It leads the state in agricultural productivity; agriculture is Palm Beach County's second-largest industry, after real estate development. In undeveloped (central and western) Palm Beach County there is significant tropical agricultural production, especially nurseries, truck crops (vegetables), and sugar cane. Palm Beach County has been called the \"Winter Vegetable Capital\" of the nation.\nHistory.\nAround 12,000\u00a0years ago, Native Americans began migrating into Florida. An estimated 20,000\u00a0Native Americans lived in South Florida when the Spanish arrived. Their population diminished significantly by the 18th century, due to warfare, enslavement, and diseases from Europe. In 1513, Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n became the first European in modern-day Palm Beach County when he landed at the Jupiter Inlet. Among the first non-Native American residents were African Americans, many of whom were former slaves or immediate descendants of former slaves, arriving in what was then Spanish Florida in the late 17th century. Finding refuge among the Seminoles, the former slaves or descendants of former slaves fought alongside them against white settlers and bounty hunters during the Seminole Wars. Portions of the Second Seminole War occurred in Palm Beach County, including the Battles of the Loxahatchee in 1838.\nThe county's oldest surviving structure, the Jupiter Lighthouse, was built in 1860, after receiving authorization to the land from President Franklin Pierce in 1854. During the American Civil War, Florida was a member of the Confederate States of America. Two Confederate adherents removed the lighting mechanism from the lighthouse. One of the men who removed the light, Augustus O. Lang, was also the first white settler in Palm Beach County. He built a palmetto shack along the eastern shore of Lake Worth in 1863 after abandoning the cause of the Confederacy. After the Civil War ended, the Jupiter Lighthouse was relit in 1866.\nIn October\u00a01873, a hurricane caused a shipwreck between Biscayne Bay and the New River. The crew survived the wreck but nearly died due to starvation because of the desolation of the area. In response, five Houses of Refuge were built along the east coast of Florida from the Fort Pierce Inlet southward to Biscayne Bay. Orange Grove House of Refuge No. 3 was built near Delray Beach in 1876.\nVery few people lived in modern-day Palm Beach County prior to the arrival of Henry Flagler, who first visited in the early 1890s. A Standard Oil tycoon, Flagler was instrumental in the county's development around the turn of the century. First, he purchased land on both sides of Lake Worth. Other investors followed suit, causing a small boom and bringing in existing businesses and resulting in the establishment of many new businesses. The Royal Poinciana Hotel, constructed by Flagler and his constructed crews to accommodate wealthy tourists, opened for business in February 1894. About a month later, the Florida East Coast Railway, owned by Flagler, reached West Palm Beach. On November\u00a05, 1894, Palm Beach County's oldest city, West Palm Beach, was incorporated. In 1896, another hotel built by Flagler was opened, the Palm Beach Inn, later renamed The Breakers. He also constructed his own winter home, which he and his wife moved into in 1902. The arrivals of Major Nathan Boynton, Congressman William S. Linton, and railroad surveyor Thomas Rickards in the 1890s also proved important because they developed communities that later became Boynton Beach, Delray Beach, and Boca Raton, respectively.\nThe Florida Legislature voted to establish Palm Beach County in 1909, carving it out of what was then the northern portion of Dade County and initially including all of Lake Okeechobee. The southernmost part of Palm Beach County was separated to create the northern portion of Broward County in 1915, the northwestern portion became part of Okeechobee County in 1917, and southern Martin County was created from northernmost Palm Beach County in 1925. The boundaries remained the same until 1963, when the Florida Legislature reduced Palm Beach County's share of Lake Okeechobee from about 80\u00a0percent to less than 40\u00a0percent and divided the lake more equitably among Glades, Hendry, Martin, and Okeechobee counties. A final change to the county's boundaries occurred in 2009, when a small portion of land was given to Broward County.\nThe 1910s and much of the 1920s brought prosperity and rapid population growth to South Florida, coinciding with the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Many local historic districts and landmarks listed in the National Register of Historic Places in Palm Beach County were designed and constructed during the 1920s, with the main contributors being architects Maurice Fatio, Addison Mizner, Marion Sims Wyeth, and the firm Harvey and Clarke, which included Gustav Maass. Total property value in West Palm Beach skyrocketed from $13.6\u00a0million in 1920 to $61\u00a0million in 1925, before briefly reaching a pre-Great Depression peak of $89\u00a0million in 1929. The city's population quadrupled between 1920 and 1927.\nEarly on September 17, 1928, the Okeechobee hurricane made landfall near West Palm Beach as a category-4 storm and crossed Lake Okeechobee shortly thereafter. While the hurricane caused catastrophic impact in eastern portions of the county, the Lake Okeechobee region suffered a much heavier loss of life. Wind-driven storm surge in the lake inundated hundreds of square miles, including the nearby communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, and South Bay. At least 2,500\u00a0deaths occurred, many of whom were black migrant farmers. An assessment of impact throughout the county reported 552\u00a0businesses destroyed, 1,447\u00a0businesses damaged, 3,584\u00a0homes destroyed, and 11,409\u00a0homes damaged, leaving 4,008\u00a0families homeless. However, several cities were excluded, such as Boca Raton, Greenacres, Lantana, and South Palm Beach. Damage in South Florida totaled roughly $25\u00a0million. In response to the storm, the Herbert Hoover Dike was constructed to prevent a similar disaster.\nAs a result of 1926 Miami hurricane and the 1928 storm, Palm Beach County, along with the rest of South Florida, began suffering economic turmoil and pushed the region into the Great Depression, even before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Housing prices dropped dramatically in the county, with the total real estate value in West Palm Beach falling to $41.6\u00a0million in 1930 and then to $18.2\u00a0million in 1935. However, the decade also brought an airport to the county. Morrison Field, later renamed the Palm Beach International Airport, opened in 1936.\nAfter the U.S. entered World War II, it was converted to an Air Force Base in 1942. During the war, thousands of servicemen arrived in Palm Beach County for training and supporting the war effort. Following the conclusion of World War II, a number of veterans returned to the area for work, vacation, or retirement. The base was closed and became a commercial airport again in 1962. Migration to the county by workers, tourists, and retirees continued into the 21st century.\nOn August\u00a028, 1949, a category-4 hurricane struck Lake Worth Beach with maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h), causing considerable damage. Throughout Palm Beach County, the hurricane destroyed 65\u00a0homes and damaged 13,283\u00a0others.\nThe area's first television station, WIRK-TV Channel 21, began broadcasting on September 13, 1953. It went off the air less than three years later. However, NBC affiliate WPTV-TV and CBS affiliate WPEC first aired in 1954 and 1955, respectively \u2013 both of which are still in existence today.\nRichard Paul Pavlick nearly attempted to assassinate then President-elect John F. Kennedy while the family vacationed in Palm Beach in December\u00a01960. On December\u00a011, Pavlick forwent his attempt because Kennedy was with his wife, Jacqueline, and their two children. Four days later, Pavlick's car, which had sticks of dynamite inside, was surrounded by police and he was arrested. Charges against Pavolick were dropped on December\u00a02, 1963, 10\u00a0days after Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Additionally, a secret blast shelter was built on Peanut Island during his presidency because escalating Cold War tensions.\nHurricane David struck near West Palm Beach late on September\u00a03, 1979, with sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h). The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near the coast and caused property damage. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of rainfall. Damage in the county reached $30\u00a0million, most of which was incurred to agriculture.\nThe county became the center of controversy during the 2000 presidential election. Allegedly, the \"butterfly ballot\", designed by Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Theresa LePore, led to an unexpectedly large number of votes for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, rather than for Democrat Al Gore. Due to the aforementioned \"butterfly ballot\" and the closeness of the statewide results between Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush, the Florida Supreme Court mandated manual recounts in all counties with disputed results. However, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the decision in \"Bush v. Gore\" on December\u00a012, allowing Florida Secretary of the State Katherine Harris to award the 25\u00a0electoral votes to Bush, as Harris's tally prior to the state-ordered recounts placed him ahead of Gore by 537\u00a0popular votes. In turn, this gave Bush victory in the national election.\nFollowing the September 11 attacks in 2001, a Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation revealed that 12 of the 19\u00a0hijackers trained or resided in Palm Beach County during the months prior to the attacks. Later that month, during the anthrax attacks, a letter containing spores of this substance was mailed to the American Media, Inc. building in Boca Raton. Three people were exposed to the anthrax, including Robert Stevens, a photo editor who later died after an infection induced by exposure.\nThree hurricanes severely impacted Palm Beach County in 2004 and 2005: Frances, Jeanne, and Wilma. On September\u00a05, 2004, Frances made landfall in Martin County as a category-2 hurricane. With wind gusts in Palm Beach County peaking at , the storm inflicted structural damage on about 15,000\u00a0houses and 2,400\u00a0businesses. Six deaths occurred in the county. Jeanne struck near the same location as a category-3 hurricane on September\u00a026, 2004. The storm also brought strong winds, with an official wind gust of . About 4,160\u00a0homes were damaged and 60\u00a0were destroyed. Jeanne left about $260\u00a0million in damage in the county. On October\u00a024, 2005, Hurricane Wilma struck Collier County as a category-3 hurricane. The storm moved northeastward, directly crossing Palm Beach County. Several locations reported hurricane-force winds, including a wind gust of 117\u00a0mph (188\u00a0km/h) in Belle Glade. Over 90% of Florida Power &amp; Light customers lost electricity. Two deaths occurred in Palm Beach County. The storm inflicted some degree of impact to more than 55,000\u00a0homes and 3,600\u00a0businesses. Palm Beach County suffered about $2.9\u00a0billion in damages.\nIn August\u00a02012, the outer bands of Hurricane Isaac dropped at least of rain near Lion Country Safari. The consequent flooding left neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Loxahatchee Groves, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington stranded for up to several days. As Hurricane Irma approached in September 2017, mandatory or voluntary evacuations were ordered for more than 290,000\u00a0residents of Palm Beach County. Although the storm passed well west of the county, much of the area experienced hurricane-force wind gusts, with a peak gust of in West Palm Beach. Impact was generally limited to widespread power outages and damaged trees and vegetation, though isolated property damage was reported. The storm left about $300\u00a0million in damage in the county, as well as five fatalities.\nToponymy.\nThe coconut palm, \"Cocos nucifera\", is not native to Florida (nor anywhere else in the United States). Its presence in what is today Palm Beach County is due to the shipwreck of the Spanish ship \"Providencia\" in 1878, near today's Mar-a-Lago. It was traveling from Havana to C\u00e1diz, Spain, with a cargo of coconuts. The shipwreck was within walking distance of the shore\u2014the Florida State Archives conserves a picture of a painting\u2014and a deliberate grounding so as to obtain an insurance payout has been proposed. The coconuts were salvaged, too many to be eaten, and thousands were planted. A lush grove of palm trees soon grew on what was later named Palm Beach.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (17.3%) are covered by water. It is the second-largest county in Florida by land area and third-largest by total area. Much of the water is the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Okeechobee. The county has an estimated of farmland.\nThe eastern third of Palm Beach County is highly urbanized, while the central and western portions of the county are suburban or rural. Palm Beach County is one of three counties in the Miami metropolitan area. However, the county's western communities along Lake Okeechobee, such as Belle Glade, South Bay, and Pahokee, have also been considered more part of the rural Florida Heartland.\nThe Atlantic coastline of Palm Beach County is about in length. It consists mainly of barrier islands and peninsulas, including Jupiter Island, Singer Island, and Palm Beach Island. These islands are separated from the mainland by the Intracoastal Waterway, with much of the waterway locally known as the Lake Worth Lagoon. The main barrier landmasses are split by four inlets: the Jupiter Inlet, the Lake Worth Inlet, the South Lake Worth Inlet, and the Boca Raton Inlet. Two of the four inlets are natural, but significantly altered \u2013 the Jupiter and Boca Raton inlets \u2013 while the Lake Worth and South Lake Worth inlets are man-made, with the former dug in the 1890s and the latter created between 1926 and 1927. Several other islands exist within the Intracoastal Waterway, including Hypoluxo Island, Munyon Island, and Peanut Island.\nNatural areas.\nIn addition, the county has an abundance of coral reef patches along its coastline and has made efforts to preserve them.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nCompanies headquartered in Palm Beach County include Office Depot, The ADT Corporation, TBC Corporation, G4S Secure Solutions, NextEra Energy, The GEO Group, American Sugar Refining, Carrier, Globalsat Group, and Bluegreen Vacations.\nThere are a significant number of aerospace facilities in the county, operated by United Technologies, Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne, Sikorsky Aircraft, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and B/E Aerospace. Many of these companies rank among the top 100 employers for the county. The largest employer in Palm Beach County is the School District of Palm Beach County, with 27,168 employees, including more than 12,800 teachers.\nPreviously W. R. Grace and Company had its headquarters in unincorporated Palm Beach County, near Boca Raton, employing about 130 staff. On January 27, 2011, it announced it was closing the Boca headquarters and moving its administrative staff out of state along with some employees. Likewise, A360 Media, LLC, publisher of the \"National Enquirer\", was headquartered in Boca Raton, but moved New York in 2014.\nFor 2010, the median income for a household in the county was $53,242, and for a family was $64,445. Males had a median income of $44,324 versus $37,337 for females. The per capita income for the county was $33,610. About 8.6% of families and 12.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.5% of those under age 18 and 7.7% of those aged 65 or over.\nCulture.\nSports.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals and the Miami Marlins conduct their spring training at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter. Two teams in the Class A-Advanced Florida State League also play their home games at Roger Dean Stadium: the Jupiter Hammerheads, an affiliate of the Miami Marlins, and the Palm Beach Cardinals, an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals.\nPrior to the construction of Roger Dean Stadium, the Montreal Expos and Atlanta Braves held their spring training at Municipal Stadium in West Palm Beach. The West Palm Beach Expos, a Single-A affiliate of the Montreal Expos, also played their games there.\nThe Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, opened in February 2017 in West Palm Beach, accommodates both the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros for spring training.\nAlso popular are the Florida Atlantic Owls, an NCAA Division I school that participates in American Athletic Conference. The FAU football team plays at FAU Stadium, and averaged 17,941 fans during the 2017 season. The FAU basketball team plays at FAU Arena, and averaged 1,346 fans during the 2013\u201314 season.\nUSL Palm Beach is an upcoming American professional soccer team based in Palm Beach County. Founded in 2023, the team plans to make its debut in the USL Championship.\nThe Palm Beach Imperials are an American Basketball Association 2006 expansion franchise.\nTourism.\nTourists can visit these attractions and annual events:\nA number of shopping malls exist throughout Palm Beach County, including the Palm Beach Outlets, CityPlace, Boynton Beach Mall, The Gardens Mall, Town Center at Boca Raton, The Mall at Wellington Green and Mizner Park. Formerly, the Palm Beach and Cross County Malls operated in the county, though they closed in 1997 and 2010, respectively.\nGovernment.\nThe Florida Department of Corrections operates the Glades Correctional Institution in an unincorporated area in Palm Beach County near Belle Glade.\nPalm Beach County's revenue from property taxes, sales taxes and tourist development taxes reached record levels in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, according to the https://'s annual financial report, \"https:// \"\nThe County collected $1.1 billion in property tax revenue in FY 2018, an increase of 6 percent over the previous year. Sales tax collections rose to $175.8 million, marking the eighth consecutive year of growth. Revenue from Tourist Development Tax receipts was $53.8 million, up from $48.5 million in FY 2017. Meanwhile, Local Option Gas Taxes paid by motorists for gasoline decreased for the first time in five years, partially due to higher gasoline prices, which reduced the number of miles driven, according to the Clerk of the Circuit Court &amp; Comptroller's \"https://\" report.\nCounty government.\nThe county is governed by a board of commissioners, consisting of seven commissioners, who are all elected from single-member districts. One of the commissioners is elected County Mayor and one of them is elected Vice Mayor. Commissioners serve staggered terms, and commissioners from Districts 1, 3, 5, and 7 are elected during presidential election years, while the commissioners from Districts 2, 4, and 6 are elected in gubernatorial election years.\nElected county officers include a clerk of courts and comptroller, sheriff, property appraiser, tax collector, and supervisor of elections. State officers serving the Florida judicial district include the state attorney and public defender. All positions are 4-year terms, requiring direct election by voters in presidential election years.\nFive former county commissioners have been accused or found guilty of corruption from 2006 to 2009. A grand jury recommended a strong inspector general. This position was approved by county voters in 2010. A county judge found that the mandate covered municipal government in 2015.\nLaw enforcement.\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBSO) provides police services to the county's unincorporated areas and the 13 municipalities covered by PBSO. PBSO also oversees the county jail system, provides security at all four of the county courthouses, and is the primary law enforcement agency covering Palm Beach International Airport. The Sheriff's Office is composed of roughly 4,200 employees, including approximately 1,600 sworn law enforcement personnel, 700 sworn corrections personnel, 1,900 civilian personnel and 1,800 volunteers. The annual operating budget for the PBSO is more than $800 million, as of 2023. Ric Bradshaw has been sheriff for Palm Beach County since 2005.\nThere are two jail facilities operated by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. One is in Belle Glade, called the West Detention Center, which houses all custody levels from minimum to maximum security. At any one time it can contain up to 991 inmates (total bed capacity), with a staff of 188. The facility has a video visitation program which allows families to communicate with inmates remotely. The largest jail is the Main Detention Center. Three towers - South, East, and West, make up the center. The largest is the South Tower, constructed in 1993 from concrete and steel at a cost of $52 million. The East and West Towers were built in 1983; they now flank the South Tower, completing the Main Detention Center. The Main Detention Center's primary function is to hold high risk inmates, federal inmates, and those inmates who are in need of special medical attention or are otherwise unable to operate at other facilities. The total number of beds at the facility is 2,166. The South Tower can hold 1,285 inmates, the East Tower has 418 beds, and the West Tower has 404 beds.\nSince the founding of Palm Beach County in 1909, 16\u00a0people have served as county sheriff.\nAs of 2025, 24 Officers and 1 K9 of the PBSO have been killed in the line of duty.\nFederal and state representation.\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Palm Beach County is represented by three Democrats and one Republican: Sheila Cherfillus-McCormick of the 20th district, Brian Mast of the 21st district, Lois Frankel of the 22nd district, and Jared Moskowitz of the 23rd district.\nNine districts of the Florida House of Representatives represent parts of Palm Beach County, with the seats held by Kelly Skidmore (D) of 81st district, John Snyder (R) of the 82nd district, Rick Roth (R) of the 85th district, Matt Willhite (D) of the 86th district, David Silvers (D) of the 87th district, Omari Hardy (D) of the 88th district, Mike Caruso (R) of the 89th district, Joseph Casello (D) of the 90th district, and Emily Slosberg (D) of the 91st district. Additionally, the county has four seats in the Florida Senate, which are represented by Gayle Harrell (R) of the 25th district, Tina Polsky (D) of the 29th district, Bobby Powell (D) of the 30th district, and Lori Berman of the 31st district.\nPolitics.\nAs of 2025, the county has a slight Democratic plurality, with large Republican and independent minorities, respectively. In gubernatorial races, the county had been a stronghold for Democrats, a trend that began in 1990 and continued up until 2022, when Republican governor Ron DeSantis won the county with 51% of the vote against the backdrop of his landslide reelection.\nAfter being carried by the Republican Party nominee in every election from 1948 to 1988, Palm Beach County has supported the Democratic Party nominee for the presidency since 1992. Republicans have been gaining an increasing share of the votes in Palm Beach County since 2000. That year, Al Gore defeated George W. Bush in the county by a margin of approximately 27\u00a0percent; two decades later, Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump (who is a resident of the county) by less than 13\u00a0percentage points in 2020 and in 2024, Kamala Harris carried the county over Trump by less than one percentage point.\nTransportation.\nRoadways.\nAn advocacy group has criticized\nPalm Beach County's roadways for being dangerous for non-motorized users. Local municipalities are working to increase safety, but county and state authorities have been hesitant to modify designs.\nExpressways.\nI-95 and Florida's Turnpike are controlled-access expressways that serve Palm Beach county. Southern Boulevard (signed SR 80/US 98), which runs east\u2013west through central Palm Beach County, is a partial freeway from Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach to US 441/SR 7 in Wellington and Royal Palm Beach. In the late 1980s, there were plans to construct two additional expressways in Palm Beach County. One was to be an toll freeway from Royal Palm Beach to downtown West Palm Beach. It would have run between Belvedere Road and Okeechobee Boulevard; necessitating the destruction of several homes and churches along its path. The other proposed route was a northern extension of the Sawgrass Expressway which was to be called \"University Parkway\". The University Parkway would have snaked around suburban developments west of Boca Raton, Delray Beach, and Boynton Beach; its path bordering the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Ultimately, both expressways were canceled due to opposition from county residents.\nRailroads.\nPalm Beach County is serviced by three railroad options:\nSeaport.\nThe Port of Palm Beach is located in Riviera Beach, where Celebration Cruise Line operates 2-day cruises to the Bahamas.\nTrails.\nThe Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail, a segment of the Florida National Scenic Trail, passes through the county.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nAll of Palm Beach County is served by the School District of Palm Beach County. As of 2006, it was the fourth largest school district in Florida and the 11th largest school district in the United States. As of August 2006, the district operated 164 schools, including 25 high schools, and, as of July 22, 2006, had an additional 33 charter schools, with seven more scheduled to open in August 2006. Newsweek listed three Palm Beach County high schools in the top 50 schools in the list 1200 Top U.S. Schools - Atlantic Community High School, Suncoast High School and the Alexander Dreyfoos School of the Arts, all public magnet schools. Private schools in the county include American Heritage School, Cardinal Newman High School, Jupiter Christian School, The King's Academy, The Benjamin School, Oxbridge Academy, Palm Beach Day Academy, Pope John Paul II High School, St Andrew's School and Weinbaum Yeshiva High School.\nPublic libraries.\nPalm Beach County is served by the Palm Beach County Library System, established in 1967 through a Special Act of the Florida Legislature, and operates as a department of county government. It is currently made up of 17\u00a0library branches, as well as a bookmobile which travels to more than 40 stops each month. As Palm Beach County continues to see population growth, the library system will also need to plan for continued expansion. Presently, the county is building a new 33,000-square-foot branch in the Canyon Town Center, located in western Boynton Beach. This new branch is projected to be completed in 2024. The system's Main Library is located on Summit Boulevard in an unincorporated section of West Palm Beach. It is the largest provider of library services in the county, serving an area that is comparable to the size of the state of Delaware, with holdings of over 1.88\u00a0million items.\nUnlike many county library systems, including neighboring Broward and Miami-Dade counties, several municipalities continue to operate their own libraries. The county library systems works together in a cooperative system model which allows interoperation between the county system and the 13\u00a0city libraries in Boca Raton, Boynton Beach, Delray Beach, Highland Beach, Lake Park, Lake Worth Beach, Lantana, Manalapan (J. Turner Moore Public Library), North Palm Beach, Palm Springs, Palm Beach (Society of the Four Arts), Riviera Beach, and West Palm Beach (Mandel Public Library of West Palm Beach).\nThe county's first library began as a Free Reading Room in 1895 in West Palm Beach's first church, the Union Congregational Church, when Reverend Asbury Caldwell began collecting books for a reading club he hoped would keep construction workers out of the city's many drinking establishments located along First Street, or \"Thirst Street\" as it was known. The reading club floundered when Caldwell left West Palm Beach, but in 1899, the West Palm Beach Public Library got its official start, housed in a two-story former Palm Beach Yacht Club building donated by Commodore Charles John Clarke, a Palm Beach yachtsman, with the collection of books from the Reading Room and a $100 donation from Henry Flagler. A permanent building was constructed in 1924 in Flagler Park along the Intracoastal Waterway. Two additional buildings have also housed the library \u2013 one at 100 Clematis Street, a state-of-art building complete with a 250-seat auditorium that opened to much fanfare in 1964. The second, located at 411 Clematis Street, is a four-story building in the West Palm Beach City Center complex, which houses both city hall and the library, is two and one-half times the size of the previous building. In 2012, the West Palm Beach Public Library Foundation formally changed its name to the Mandel Public Library of West Palm Beach after receiving a $5\u00a0million grant from the Mandel Foundation.\nCommunities.\nThe largest city and county seat is West Palm Beach, with a population of 117,415 as of the 2020 US census. Boca Raton, is the southernmost and second-largest, bordering Broward County and having 97,422 people in 2020 within its city limits. Boynton Beach (between Boca Raton and West Palm Beach), is the third-largest city, with a 2020 population nearing 80,380 residents.\nThe county has 39 municipalities in total. The municipalities are numbered corresponding to the attached image, except for the newest municipality, Westlake. Municipality populations are based on the 2020 census.\nGolfview was an incorporated town in Palm Beach County from 1936 until 1997.\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFormer census-designated places.\nSeveral unincorporated parts of Palm Beach County were listed as census-designated places for the 2000 census, but were not listed for the 2010 census:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAdjacent counties.\nPalm Beach County borders Martin County to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Broward County to the south, Hendry County to the west, and extends into Lake Okeechobee in the northwest, where it borders Okeechobee County and Glades County at one point in the center of the lake.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73648", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73648", "title": "Elision", "text": "Omission of sounds in words or phrases\nIn linguistics, an elision or deletion is the omission of one or more sounds (such as a vowel, a consonant, or a whole syllable) in a word or phrase. However, these terms are also used to refer more narrowly to cases where two words are run together by the omission of a final sound. An example is the elision of word-final /t/ in English if it is preceded and followed by a consonant: \"first light\" is often pronounced \"firs' light\" (). Many other terms are used to refer to specific cases where sounds are omitted.\nCitation forms and contextual forms.\nA word may be spoken individually in what is called the citation form. This corresponds to the pronunciation given in a dictionary. However, when words are spoken in context, it often happens that some sounds that belong to the citation form are omitted. Elision is not an all-or-nothing process: elision is more likely to occur in some styles of speaking and less likely in others. Many writers have described the styles of speech in which elision is most commonly found, using terms such as \"casual speech\", \"spontaneous speech\", \"allegro speech\" or \"rapid speech\". In addition, what may appear to be the disappearance of a sound may in fact be a change in the articulation of a sound that makes it less audible. For example, it has been said that in some dialects of Spanish the word-final \"-ado\", as in \"cansado\" (tired) is pronounced /ado/ in citation form but the /d/ is omitted in normal speech, giving \"cansao\". More careful description will show that the Spanish phoneme /d/ is usually pronounced as a voiced dental fricative [\u00f0] when it occurs between vowels. In casual speech it is frequently weakened to a voiced dental approximant [\u00f0\u031e]. The most extreme possibility is complete elision resulting in a diphthong with no observable consonantal tongue gesture. In this view, elision is the final stage in lenition or consonant weakening, the last phase of a cline or continuum describable as d &gt; \u00f0 &gt; \u00f0\u031e &gt; \u2205. Whether the elision is of vowel or consonant, if it is consistent through time, the form with elision may come to be accepted as the norm: \"tabula\" &gt; \"tabla\" as in Spanish, \"mutare\" &gt; \"muer\" (\"change, molt\") in French, \"luna\" &gt; \"lua\" (\"moon\") in Portuguese.\nIt is usual to explain elision and related connected-speech phenomena in terms of the principle of least effort or \"economy of effort\". This concept has been stated as \"If a word or expression remains perfectly intelligible without a certain sound, people tend to omit that sound.\"\nHistorical elisions.\nThere are various ways in which the present form of a language may reflect elisions that have taken place in the past. This topic is an area of diachronic linguistics. Such elisions may originally have been \"optional\" but have over time become \"obligatory\" (or mandatory). An example of historical elision in French that began at the phrasal level and became lexicalized is preposition &gt; in \"today\", now felt by native speakers to be one word, but deriving from , literally \"at the day of today\" and meaning \"nowadays\", although is no longer recognized as meaningful in French. In English, the word \"cupboard\" would originally have contained /p/ between /\u028c/ and /b/, but the /p/ is believed to have disappeared from the pronunciation of the word about the fifteenth century.\nContractions.\nIn many languages there is a process similar but not identical to elision, called contraction, where common words that occur frequently together form a shortened pronunciation. This may be a historical case (for example, French \"\"ce est\" has become \"c'est\" /s\u025b/ and it would now be incorrect to say \"ce est\"\" /s\u0259 \u025b/) or one that is still optional (in English, a speaker may say \"that is\" /\u00f0\u00e6t \u026az/ or \"that's\" /\u00f0\u00e6ts/). Contractions of both sorts are natural forms of the language used by native speakers and are often colloquial but not considered substandard. English contractions are usually vowel-less weak form words. In some cases the contracted form is not a simple matter of elision: for example, \"that's\" as a contraction is made not only by the elision of the /\u026a/ of \"is\" but also by the change of final consonant from /z/ to /s/; \"won't\" for \"will not\" requires not only the elision of the /\u0252/ of \"not\" but also the vowel change /\u026a/ \u2192 /o\u028a/ and in English RP \"can't\" and \"shan't\" change vowel from /\u00e6/ of \"can\" and \"shall\" to /\u0251\u02d0/ in /k\u0251\u02d0nt/, /\u0283\u0251\u02d0nt/. In some languages employing the Latin alphabet, such as English, the omitted letters in a contraction are replaced by an apostrophe (e.g., \"isn't\" for \"is not\"). Written Greek marks elisions in the same way.\nElision in poetry.\nElision is frequently found in verse. It is sometimes explicitly marked in the spelling, and in other cases has to be inferred from knowledge of the metre. Elisions occurred regularly in Latin, but were not written, except in inscriptions and comedy. Elision of a vowel before a word starting in a vowel is frequent in poetry, where the metre sometimes requires it. For example, the opening line of Catullus 3 is Lugete, O Veneres Cupidinesque, but would be read as Lugeto Veneres Cupidinesque (audio). There are many examples of poetic contraction in English verse of past centuries marked by spelling and punctuation. Frequently found examples are over &gt; o'er and ever &gt; e'er. Multiple examples can be seen in lines such as the following from Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard by Thomas Gray, published in 1751:\nDeletion.\nThe term \"deletion\" is used in some modern work instead of \"elision\". When contemporary or historic deletion is treated in terms of Generative phonology it is usual to explain the process as one of substituting zero for a phoneme, in the form of a phonological rule. The form of such rules is typically\n X --&gt; \u2205 (i.e. the segment x becomes zero)\nAn example of a deletion rule (for /r/-deletion in English RP) is provided by Giegerich. If we start with the premise that the underlying form of the word \"hear\" has a final /r/ and has the phonological form /h\u026a\u0259r/, we need to be able to explain how /r/ is deleted at the end of \"hear\" but is not deleted in the derived word \"hearing\". The difference is between word-final /r/ in \"hear\", where the /r/ would form part of the rhyme of a syllable, and word-medial /r/ which would form the onset of the second syllable of \"hearing\". The following rule deletes /r/ in \"hear\", giving /h\u026a\u0259/, but does not apply in the case of \"hearing\", giving /h\u026a\u0259r\u026a\u014b/.\n rhyme\n /r/ --&gt; \u2205/ _____\nExamples.\nEnglish.\nExamples of elision in English:\nMost elisions in English are not mandatory, but they are used in common practice and even sometimes in more formal speech. This applies to nearly all the examples in the above table. However, these types of elisions are rarely shown in modern writing and never shown in formal writing. In formal writing, the words are written the same whether or not the speaker would elide them, but in many plays and classic American literature, words are often written with an elision to demonstrate accent:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Well, we ain't got any,\" George exploded. \"Whatever we ain't got, that's what you want. God a'mighty, if I was alone I could live so easy. I could go get a job an' work, an' no trouble. No mess at all, and when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get whatever I want. Why, I could stay in a cathouse all night. I could eat any place I want, hotel or any place, and order any damn thing I could think of. An' I could do all that every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room and play cards or shoot pool.\" Lennie knelt and looked over the fire at the angry George. And Lennie's face was drawn in with terror. \"An' whatta I got,\" George went on furiously. \"I got you! You can't keep a job and you lose me ever' job I get. Jus' keep me shovin' all over the country all the time.\"\u2014\u200a\nOther examples, such as \"him\" and \"going to\" shown in the table above, are generally used only in fast or informal speech. They are still generally written as is unless the writer intends to show the dialect or speech patterns of the speaker.\nThe third type of elision is in common contractions, such as \"can't\", \"isn't\", or \"I'm\". The apostrophes represent the sounds that are removed and are not spoken but help the reader to understand that it is a contraction and not a word of its own. These contractions used to be written out when transcribed (i.e. \"cannot\", \"is not\", \"I am\") even if they were pronounced as a contraction, but now they are always written as a contraction so long as they are spoken that way. However, they are by no means mandatory and a speaker or writer may choose to keep the words distinct rather than contract them either as a stylistic choice, when using formal register, to make meaning clearer to children or non-native English speakers, or to emphasize a word within the contraction (e.g. \"I \"am\" going!\")\nIn non-rhotic accents of English, is dropped unless it's followed by a vowel, making \"cheetah\" and \"cheater\" completely homophonous. In non-rhotic accents spoken outside of North America, many instances of correspond to in North American English as and are used instead of .\nFinnish.\nThe consonant in the partitive case ending elides when it is surrounded by two short vowels except when the first of the two vowels involved is paragoge (added to the stem). Otherwise, it stays. For example, \u2192 , \u2192 , but \u2192 (not a short vowel), \u2192 (consonant stem), \u2192 (paragogic on a consonant stem).\nFrench.\nElision of unstressed vowels (usually ) is common in the French language and, in some cases, must be indicated orthographically with an apostrophe.\nElision of vowel and consonant sounds was also an important phenomenon in the phonological evolution of French. For example, \"s\" following a vowel and preceding another consonant regularly elided, with compensatory lengthening of the vowel.\nGerman.\nNouns and adjectives that end with unstressed \"el\" or \"er\" have the \"e\" elided when they are declined or a suffix follows. ex. becomes , , etc., and + becomes .\nThe final of a noun is also elided when another noun or suffix is concatenated onto it: + becomes .\nIn both of the above cases, the represents a schwa.\nIcelandic.\nElision () is common in Icelandic. There are a variety of rules for its occurrence, but the most notable is the loss of trailing consonants in common particles as well as the merger of similar vowel sounds. For example, the ubiquitous (verb) structure (\"I am verb-ing\") becomes transformed to (verb); the full particles is spoken only when a person is sounding the sentence out word by word. Another noteworthy and extremely common example along this line includes the phrase (\"really?\"), which is pronounced as . A common example of internal consonant loss in Icelandic is (\"here you go\", \"please\"), pronounced (the hidden sound is unrelated to the elision and occurs when a or precedes ). Another special case of elision is the loss of from the start of (\"this\", \"that\"), which is sometimes pronounced ( (what is this?) -&gt; ). The pronunciation of the full word tends to lay emphasis on it (\"What is \"this\"?\") while the elision of the word leads to its deemphasis (\"\"What\" is this?\"). The loss of the in is similar to how can be lost in \"that\" and \"this\" when asking a question and speaking swiftly in English.\nIrish.\nElision is found in the Ulster dialect of Irish, particularly in final position. , for example, while pronounced in the Conamara dialect, is pronounced in Ulster. is also elided when it begins intervocalic consonant clusters. is pronounced ; is pronounced .\nJapanese.\nElision is extremely common in the pronunciation of the Japanese language. In general, a high vowel ( or ) that appears in a low-pitched syllable between two voiceless consonants is devoiced and often deleted outright. However, unlike French or English, Japanese does not often show elision in writing. The process is purely phonetic and varies considerably depending on the dialect or level of formality. A few examples (slightly exaggerated; apostrophes added to indicate elision):\n\u677e\u4e0b\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f \"Matsushita-san wa imasu ka?\" (\"Is Mr. Matsushita in?\")\nPronounced: \"matsush'tasanwa imas'ka\"\n\u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3059 \"Shitsurei shimasu\" (\"Excuse me\")\nPronounced: \"sh'tsureishimas' \"\nGender roles also influence elision in Japanese. It is considered masculine to elide, especially the final \"u\" of the polite verb forms (\"-masu\", \"desu\"), but women are traditionally encouraged to do the opposite. However, excessive elision is generally associated with lower prestige, and inadequate elision is seen as overly fussy or old-fashioned. Some nonstandard dialects, such as Satsuma-ben, are known for their extensive elision.\nIt is common for successive o sounds to be reduced to a single o sound, as is frequently encountered when the particle \u3092 (wo/o) is followed by the beautifying or honorific \u304a (o).\nLatin.\nLatin poetry featured frequent elision, with syllables being dropped to fit the meter or for euphony. Words ending in vowels would elide with the following word if it started with a vowel or h; words ending with -m would also be elided in the same way (this is called ecthlipsis). In writing, unlike in Greek, this would not be shown, with the normal spelling of the word represented. For instance, line 5 of Virgil's \"Aeneid\" is written as \", even though it would be pronounced as \".\nIt is generally thought that elision in Latin poetry came from ordinary Latin pronunciation. However, at some points in speech where elision was standard in poetry, such as at the end of sentences, there was no elision in prose. Around 30 B.C., there was a sharp decline in the amount of elision. Later revived to a varying degree during the Silver Age, it then declined again.\nOther examples of elision in Latin literature include:\nIn a study of elision in Latin poetry, J. Soubiran argues that \"elision\" would better be called \"synaloepha\", and the process understood as a merging of syllables, in most cases, rather than the loss of one.\nMaori.\nMedial /t/ is sometimes dropped: the prefix \"Ng\u0101ti\" (from \"ng\u0101 \u0101ti\" \"descendants\") applied to tribes can also be realised as \"Ng\u0101i\", \"motu\" (\"island\") can also be realised as \"mou\" (e.g. \"Mou\"tohor\u0101, lit. 'Whale Island').\nMalayalam.\nDropping sounds in connected speech by native speakers is very common in this language from Kerala, southern India. For example, \"entha\" becomes \"ntha\" and \"ippol\" becomes \"ippo\".\nSpanish.\nThe change of Latin into the Romance languages included a significant amount of elision, especially syncope (loss of medial vowels). Spanish has these examples:\nIn addition, speakers often employ crasis or elision between two words to avoid a hiatus caused by vowels: the choice of which to use depends upon whether or not the vowels are identical. This is referred to as https:// or synalepha, and is especially common in poetry and songs. It is not necessarily indicated in writing, but often is in https:// https://. It can appear as a breve below or an underscore between the adjacent words, e.g. \"por-que \u032een-ton-ces\" or \"por-que_en-ton-ces\".\nA frequent informal use is the elision of in the past participle suffix , pronouncing as . The elision of in is considered even more informal, but both elisions common in Andalusian Spanish. Thus, the Andalusian for (\"lament\") has entered Standard Spanish as a term for a special feature of Flamenco singing. Similar distinctions are made with the words and as contracted versions of the literal translations for dancer and singer exclusively used for Flamenco, compared to the and of standard Spanish. The perceived vulgarity of the silent may lead to hypercorrections like * for (cod) or * for .\nTamil.\nTamil has a set of rules for elision. They are categorised into classes based on the phoneme where elision occurs:\nUrdu.\nIn Pakistan, elision has become very common in speech. Commonly used words have single consonants or syllables removed in casual speech and it is becoming more acceptable in formal settings due to an increasing understandability and use. Although not seen when writing in the Urdu script (Nastaleeq), it is often seen in Roman Urdu (Latin alphabet) as the latter is more similar to vernacular Urdu. Most elisions occur by removing a vowel or the consonant /h/ or a combination of the two. Some widely used examples are:\n\"(The difference between the elision May and the original word Main is the lack of nasalization at the end in the former.)\"\nIn sentences, they may appear as:\n\"Kya tum pa\u1e5b ray o?\" (\"Are you studying?\") instead of \"Kya tum pa\u1e5bh rahay ho?\"\nVariations are also common where some individuals may prefer to pronounce a complete word such as \"pa\u1e5bh\" while shortening the rest, depending on the preference of the person, their dialect, or their accent.\nWelsh.\nElision is a major feature of Welsh, found commonly in verb forms, such as in the following examples:\nElision of word-final is almost always found in spoken Welsh to the point where the words are spelt with optional final in words like and has been eradicated from the inflected prepositions: , not * - 'on me', etc. These always retain their final in the literary register, however.\nWelsh also displays elision of initial syllables in singular/plural or collective/singulative pairs where the plural or singulative becomes longer than two syllables. This, however, is now restricted to specific nouns and is not productive. E.g. - 'sock / socks' where the initial has been lost in the plural; - 'birds / a bird' where the initial has been lost in the singulative.\nRelated areas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2025, the population of the county was estimated to be 682,179, making it the tenth-most populous county in the state. Its county seat is Dade City, and its largest city is Zephyrhills. The county is named after United States senator Samuel Pasco.\nPasco County is included in the Tampa Bay Area and historically has been a bedroom community for the Tampa and St. Petersburg cities. It is 30 miles away from the city of Tampa. The county includes numerous parks and trails located along rivers, the Gulf of Mexico, lakes, and highway/railroad right-of-ways. Several nudist resorts are located in Pasco County. The county has become known as the \"naturist capital of the United States\", starting in 1941.\nWest Pasco includes retirement areas, commercial fishing, and suburbs of Tampa. The Suncoast Parkway as well as U.S. 19, U.S. 41, U.S. 98, U.S. 301, and Interstate 75 all pass through Pasco County. The county is directly west of Polk and Sumter counties, north of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, and south of Hernando County.\nRecent companies are creating major centers in the county, such as Moffit Cancer Center's Speros campus. They are expected to bring many jobs, changing the area.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nNative settlement.\nThe earliest known residents of Pasco County were the Timucuans Native American tribe who lived on the land in the early 1200s. Settlers in Florida brought diseases to the area though, wiping out the tribe. Other Native American tribes like the Calusa also lived along the Gulf of Mexico in Pasco County. The tribe had a deep-rooted connection between the land and its inhabitants.\nExploration.\nIn the 1500s, Spanish explorers came into the Florida region, encountering with the Native American tribes. This started major cultural exchanges for the groups. Pasco County, at that point became a point of interest to the Spanish explorers because of its strategic coastal location.\nSeminole conflict.\nThe Creek Native tribe from Georgia and Alabama migrated to Florida with one tribe becoming known as the Seminoles in the region. The tribe fought with the British against American settlers during the First Seminole War and had constant fighting with the Spanish until the buying of Florida to the United States in 1819. The United States military had major conflict with the Native Americans in the Second Seminole War that included the destruction of Fort Dade, of which Dade City is named after.\nCivil war.\nWhen Civil War broke out in 1861, Florida joined the Confederate States of America. Though Pasco County was too far to be changed by the war in much of the conflicts, men from Pasco County supported both sides of the conflict. The closest engagement of Pasco County soldiers was in Bayport, Hernando County, Florida.\nFounding.\nPasco County was founded on June 2, 1887, from the southern third of Hernando County. The legislation was passed by former Governor Edward A. Perry to divide the former Hernando County into three counties. The legislation also created Citrus County from the northern third of Hernando County. The county was named after Samuel Pasco, who had just been elected to the United States Senate, though he never visited the county.\nPasco County's early towns were Anclote, Blanton, Dade City, Earnestville, Fort Dade (not to be confused with Fort Dade on Egmont Key), Macon (Trilby), Lacoochee, St. Leo, and San Antonio.\nDade City was named the temporary county seat with the same legislation to make Pasco County. It stayed temporary until March 14, 1889, when W.B. Lynch got a petition with 320 signatures to hold an election for the county seat. The board accepted the petition with the election for April 11, 1889. On April 16, 1889, Dade city won with 432 votes of the 765.\nCitrus was an important industry when the county was formed in 1887. Though, in December 1894 and then again in February 1895, temperatures fell throughout the state, in an event called The Great Freeze. Many citrus growers lost their crops from the freeze in Pasco County.\n20th Century changes.\nAs early as 1914, residents of the western part of the county proposed forming a separate county or merging with Pinellas County, as Dade City was not centrally located in the county. Several large sawmills operated in the county in the early part of the 20th century. The issue was finally resolved in 1979 with the construction of identical government centers in both Dade City and New Port Richey, now called West Pasco Government Center and East Pasco Government Center.\nEarly train system.\nThe SAL Tarpon Springs branch line from Tarpon Junction 14 miles west of Tampa to Elfers and thence to New Port Richey lost its passenger service and became listed as freight only between 1932 and 1938. The freight branch was truncated to Elfers in 1943. The tracks from Elfers and Chemical (an industrial area in the extreme southwest part of the county along the Anclote River west of Holiday) to Tarpon Springs had its last freight train on December 24, 1986, leaving the western half of the county without freight rail service.\nThe Atlantic Coast Line Railroad until 1957 ran the \"Southland\" through Trilby and Tarpon Springs, en route to St. Petersburg. The train was unusual for providing passenger service direct from Chicago (via the Pennsylvania), Cincinnati and Atlanta on a direct route through the western part of the Florida peninsula, bypassing Jacksonville. The Seaboard Coast Line (a merged line from the Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Coast Line) until 1971 ran a local train (the last passenger train for the region north of St. Petersburg and west of Dade City) through those towns from Jacksonville and Gainesville, bound for St. Petersburg. Prior to the 1967 merger for the SCL that service had been the western branch of the ACL's \"Champion\" from New York City. Until 1968 the SCL ran its \"Sunland\" from Washington, DC and Portsmouth, VA to Tampa.\nLand boom.\nDuring the Florida land boom of the 1920s, New Port Richey became the winter home of silent screen star Thomas Meighan and golfer Gene Sarazen; Meighan attempted to bring other Hollywood figures to the city. The county has experienced significant population growth since the 1970s, growing by over 600%. The growth began along the Gulf coast but is now occurring most rapidly in areas north of Tampa.\nRecent history.\nPasco County has historically been a bedroom community for Tampa and St. Petersburg. Though, recent companies are constructing major centers in the county, such as Moffit Cancer Center's Speros campus, which is expected to bring over 11,000 jobs.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pasco County has a total area of , of which is land and (14.0%) is water.

The play was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Play.\nThe play explores the existential premise that everyone in the world is connected to everyone else in the world by a chain of no more than six acquaintances, thus, \"six degrees of separation\".\nIt was adapted into a film of the same name in 1993.\nSynopsis.\nA young black man named Paul shows up at the home of art dealer Flan Kittredge and his wife Louisa, known simply as \"Ouisa\", who live overlooking Central Park in New York City. Paul has a minor stab wound from an attempted mugging, and says he's a friend of their children at Harvard University. The Kittredges are trying to get the money to buy a painting by Paul C\u00e9zanne and now have this wounded stranger in their home. Paul claims he is in New York to meet his father, Sidney Poitier, who is directing a film version of the Broadway musical \"Cats.\" Paul continues to charm them with his story, though in reality, it is all a lie: Paul is no Harvard student and obtained details on the Kittredges from a male student he had seduced. Eventually Paul uses their home for an encounter with a hustler, but is caught red-handed. The police are called, but Paul escapes.\nSoon after, Paul starts up another con against a sensitive young man named Rick and his live-in girlfriend, Elizabeth. The naive young couple are new to the big city having just moved to New York from Utah and, based on Paul's con, invite him to live with them until he gets everything sorted out with his wealthy father\u2014who Paul tells them is Flan Kittredge. The trio become good friends, with Paul spinning a tale of being estranged from his racist father; the girlfriend tells Rick not to lend Paul any money. One night Paul takes Rick out on the town, and seduces him in order to get the money. Later that night, Rick tells Elizabeth that Paul is gone, that he has all their money, and that he and Paul had sex. In a fit of fury, she cruelly suggests that Rick's father had always questioned his son's sexuality. Soon afterwards Rick commits suicide.\nIn desperation, Paul calls the Kittredges for assistance. Partly due to strained relations with her children, Ouisa finds herself feeling emotionally attached to Paul, hoping to be able to help him in some way despite the fact that he has victimized them. Over a protracted and laborious phone call, he agrees to give himself up to the police; however, during the arrest, he and the couple are separated. Despite their efforts\u2014Ouisa's more than Flan's\u2014his fate is unresolved, except for a possibly tragic end. Towards the end of the play, in a climactic moment of reflection, she delivers the play's most famous monologue:\nHistorical casting.\nKristin Griffith and Swoosie Kurtz read the role of Ouisa Kittredge in workshops in 1989 before Stockard Channing was cast. Channing was originally unavailable and was committed to coming to Broadway in another play, Neil Simon's \"Jake's Women\". The play's Broadway run was canceled. Channing had starred previously in John Guare's \"The House of Blue Leaves\", and he offered her the role for the official Off-Broadway run. Kurtz later replaced Channing during the Broadway run.\nProduction history.\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, on May 16, 1990. Stockard Channing won an Obie Award for Best Actress for her performance. Guare won an Obie Award for his script. \nThe production was transferred to the Vivian Beaumont Theater for its Broadway debut on November 8, 1990. The production closed on January 5, 1992 after 485 performances, directed by Jerry Zaks. John Cameron Mitchell originated the role of Trent, which was his non-replacement debut on Broadway. Kelly Bishop played the role of Ouisa as a replacement on Broadway, and Laura Linney made her Broadway debut as a replacement for the role of Tess. The original Broadway production was nominated for four Tony Awards, winning for Best Direction for Zaks. A US. National tour was launched in 1992. Veronica Hamel also played Ouisa in the first production in Chicago.\nThe play made its UK debut in 1992 at the Royal Court Theatre and then transferred to the West End's Comedy Theatre. In 2010, the play was revived at the Old Vic theatre in London starring Lesley Manville as Ouisa.\nA 1995 production at Canadian Stage in Toronto, Ontario starred Fiona Reid as Ouisa, Jim Mezon as Flan and Nigel Shawn Williams as Paul. Both Williams and Reid won Dora Mavor Moore Awards for their performances, Williams as Outstanding Performance by a Male in a Principal Role \u2013 Play and Reid as Outstanding Performance by a Female in a Principal Role \u2013 Play.\nIn May 2004 Michael Buffong directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Lisa Eichhorn as Ouissa Kittredge, Phillip Bretherton as Flanders Kittredge and O-T Fagbenle as Paul. O-T Fabenle won a MEN Award for his performance.\nThe play was revived on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in a limited engagement opening on April 5, 2017, starring Allison Janney, John Benjamin Hickey and Corey Hawkins, with direction by Trip Cullman.\nBackground.\nThe play was inspired by the real-life story of David Hampton, a con man and robber who managed to convince a number of people in the 1980s that he was the son of actor Sidney Poitier. The writer John Guare was a friend of Inger McCabe Elliott and her husband Osborn Elliott. In October 1983 Hampton came to the Elliotts' New York apartment and they allowed him to spend the night. The next morning Inger Elliott found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told Guare about the story and it inspired him to write the play years later.\nHampton was tried and acquitted for harassment of Guare after the play became a critical and financial success; he felt that, as the real life protagonist of the story, he was due a share of the profits that he ultimately never received.\nA strong influence on the play is the novel \"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J. D. Salinger. There are some very overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on \"The Catcher in The Rye\" to the family who takes him in for the night. There are also more subtle allusions made both in the script and in the cinematography of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on Holden Caulfield-esque characteristics and attitudes.\nFilm adaptation.\nGuare adapted the play for a film released in 1993 directed by Fred Schepisi. Channing was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film."}

The name comes from the French spelling of the mythological character Ariadne. France first proposed the Ariane project and it was officially agreed upon at the end of 1973 after discussions between France, Germany and the UK. The project was Western Europe's second attempt at developing its own launcher following the unsuccessful Europa project. The Ariane project was code-named L3S (the French abbreviation for third-generation substitution launcher).\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) charged A\u00e9rospatiale (whose former assets now form Airbus) with the development of all Ariane launchers and of the testing facilities, while Arianespace handled production, operations and marketing after its creation in 1980. Arianespace launches Ariane rockets from the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou in French Guiana. As a result of the merger in 2000 that founded Airbus, the new corporation's space branch and subsequently its subsidiary with Safran, ArianeGroup, took over the duties of the defunct A\u00e9rospatiale.\nAriane versions.\nAriane 1 was a three-stage launcher, derived from missile technology. The first two stages used hypergolic propellants and the third stage used cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LH2/LOX). Ariane 2\u20134 were enhancements of the basic vehicle. The major differences are improved versions of the engines, allowing stretched first- and third-stage tanks and greater payloads. The largest versions can launch two satellites, mounted in the SPELDA (Structure Porteuse Externe pour Lancements Doubles Ariane) adapter.\nSuch later versions are often seen with strap-on boosters. These layouts are designated by suffixes after the generation number. First is the total number of boosters, then letters designating liquid- or solid-fuelled stages. For example, an Ariane 42P is an Ariane 4 with two solid-fuel boosters. An Ariane 44LP has two solid, two liquid boosters, and a 44L has four liquid-fuel boosters.\nAriane 5 is a nearly complete redesign. The two hypergolic lower stages are replaced with a single LH2/LOX core stage. This simplifies the stack, along with the use of a single core engine (Vulcain). Because the core cannot lift its own weight, two solid-fuel boosters are strapped to the sides. The boosters can be recovered for examination, but are not reused. There are two versions of the upper stage, one hypergolic and restartable with a single Aestus engine and the other with a HM7B cryogenic engine burning LH2/LOX.\nOn 4 May 2007, an Ariane 5-ECA rocket set a new commercial payload record, lifting two satellites with a combined mass of 9.4 tonnes.\nBy January 2006, 169 Ariane flights had boosted 290 satellites, successfully placing 271 of them on orbit (223 main passengers and 48 auxiliary passengers) for a total mass of 575,000\u00a0kg successfully delivered on orbit. Attesting to the ubiquity of Ariane launch vehicles, France's Cerise satellite, which was orbited by an Ariane 4 in 1995, struck a discarded Ariane rocket stage in 1996. The incident marked the first verified case of a collision with a piece of catalogued space debris.\nOn February 16, 2011, the 200th Ariane rocket was launched, successfully carrying the Johannes Kepler ATV into low Earth orbit and providing International Space Station with supplies.\nOn November 26, 2019, flight number 250 was performed, lifting two communications satellites: TIBA-1 and Inmarsat-5 F5 (GX5).\nOn December 25, 2021, Ariane flight VA256 lifted NASA's James Webb Space Telescope towards Earth/Sun Lagrange point L2.\nAriane 5 flew its final mission on 5 July 2023.\nAriane Next is In early development, due for launch from the 2030s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The score was composed by Wojciech Kilar.\n\"Rejs\" is considered as a masterpiece by many and as the earliest cult film in Polish cinema. Shot in a quasi-documentary style, with a cast featuring not more than two or three professional actors, the absurd plot parodies life in the People's Republic of Poland, reducing a weekend river cruise to a hilarious parody of the entire communist system.\nPlot.\nA stowaway (Stanis\u0142aw Tym) sneaks aboard a ship departing on a cruise down the Vistula River. The captain takes him for a Communist Party cultural coordinator and the intruder gladly adapts to his new role, immediately setting to work at manipulating the passengers and crew into silly and vaguely humiliating games. Before long, Tym has got everyone under his thumb and created his own comedic dictatorship. A memorable performance was given by Jan Himilsbach, an amateur actor who formerly carved tombstones.\nProduction.\nThe film was directed in such a way that the characters' behaviors and expressions sound natural and the film resembles a documentary shot with a hidden camera. The characters were played by many non-actors or theater actors who had not acted in films before, and some scenes were improvised. Because of the low budget, the film was shot on black-and-white film stock with a single camera. The only lens the crew had for close-ups malfunctioned, so zooming was done by having the characters move closer to the camera. The non-professional actors didn't know how to move, so the cameraman drew them to the camera by pulling on a string tied to their leg. The film crew called this technique \"Turkish zoom\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73664", "revid": "234689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73664", "title": "Astrolabe", "text": "Astronomical instrument\nAn astrolabe (; ; ) is an astronomical instrument dating to ancient times. It serves as a star chart and physical model of the visible half-dome of the sky. Its various functions also make it an elaborate inclinometer and an analog calculation device capable of working out several kinds of problems in astronomy. In its simplest form it is a metal disc with a pattern of wires, cutouts, and perforations that allows a user to calculate astronomical positions precisely. It is able to measure the altitude above the horizon of a celestial body, day or night; it can be used to identify stars or planets, to determine local latitude given local time (and vice versa), to survey, or to triangulate. It was used in classical antiquity, the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic Golden Age, the European Middle Ages and the Age of Discovery for all these purposes.\nThe astrolabe, which is a precursor to the sextant,\nis effective for determining latitude on land or calm seas. Although it is less reliable on the heaving deck of a ship in rough seas, the mariner's astrolabe was developed to solve that problem.\nApplications.\nThe 10th\u00a0century astronomer \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n al-\u1e62\u016bf\u012b wrote a massive text of 386\u00a0chapters on the astrolabe, which reportedly described more than 1,000\u00a0applications for the astrolabe's various functions.\nThese ranged from the astrological, the astronomical and the religious, to navigation, seasonal and daily time-keeping, and tide tables. At the time of their use, astrology was widely considered as much of a serious science as astronomy, and study of the two went hand-in-hand. The astronomical interest varied between folk astronomy (of the pre-Islamic tradition in Arabia) which was concerned with celestial and seasonal observations, and mathematical astronomy, which would inform intellectual practices and precise calculations based on astronomical observations. In regard to the astrolabe's religious function, the demands of Islamic prayer times were to be astronomically determined to ensure precise daily timings, and the qibla, the direction of Mecca towards which Muslims must pray, could also be determined by this device. In addition to this, the lunar calendar that was informed by the calculations of the astrolabe was of great significance to the religion of Islam, given that it determines the dates of important religious observances such as Ramadan.\nEtymology.\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gives the translation \"star-taker\" for the English word \"astrolabe\" and traces it through medieval Latin to the Greek word \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2: ,\nfrom \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd: \"star\", and \u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd: \"to take\".\nIn the medieval Islamic world the Arabic word (i.e., astrolabe) was given various etymologies. In Arabic texts, the word is translated as (, lit.\u2009'star-taker') \u2013 a direct translation of the Greek word.\nAl-Biruni quotes and criticises medieval scientist Hamza al-Isfahani, who stated:\n \"\"asturlab\" is an Arabisation of this Persian phrase\" (, meaning \"taker of the stars\").\nIn medieval Islamic sources, there is also a folk etymology of the word as \"lines of lab\", where \"Lab\" refers to a certain son of Idris (Enoch). This etymology is mentioned by a 10th\u00a0century scientist named al-Qummi but rejected by al-Khwarizmi.\nHistory.\nAncient era.\nAn astrolabe is essentially a plane (two-dimensional) version of an armillary sphere, which had already been invented in the Hellenistic period and had probably been used by Hipparchus to produce his star catalogue. Theon of Alexandria (c.\u2009335\u2013405) wrote a detailed treatise on the astrolabe. The invention of the plane astrolabe is sometimes wrongly attributed to Theon's daughter Hypatia (born c.\u2009350\u2013370; died \nbut it is known to have been used much earlier.\nThe misattribution comes from a misinterpretation of a statement in a letter written by Hypatia's pupil Synesius (c.\u2009373\u2013414),\nwhich mentions that Hypatia had taught him how to construct a plane astrolabe, but does not say that she invented it.\nLewis argues that Ptolemy used an astrolabe to make the astronomical observations recorded in the \"Tetrabiblos\". However, Emilie Savage-Smith notes\n\"there is no convincing evidence that Ptolemy or any of his predecessors knew about the planispheric astrolabe\".\nIn chapter\u00a05.1 of the \"Almagest\", Ptolemy describes the construction of an armillary sphere, and it is usually assumed that this was the instrument he used.\nAstrolabes continued to be used in the Byzantine Empire. Christian philosopher John Philoponus wrote a treatise (c.\u2009550) on the astrolabe in Greek, which is the earliest extant treatise on the instrument.\nMesopotamian bishop Severus Sebokht also wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in the Syriac language during the mid-7th century.\nSebokht refers to the astrolabe as being made of brass in the introduction of his treatise, indicating that metal astrolabes were known in the Christian East well before they were developed in the Islamic world or in the Latin West.\nMedieval era.\nAstrolabes were further developed in the medieval Islamic world, where Muslim astronomers introduced angular scales to the design, adding circles indicating azimuths on the horizon. It was widely used throughout the Muslim world, chiefly as an aid to navigation and as a way of finding the Qibla, the direction of Mecca. Eighth-century mathematician Muhammad al-Fazari is the first person credited with building the astrolabe in the Islamic world.\nThe mathematical background was established by Muslim astronomer Albatenius in his treatise \"Kitab az-Zij\" which was translated into Latin by Plato Tiburtinus (\"De Motu Stellarum\"). The earliest surviving astrolabe is dated AH 315 In the Islamic world, astrolabes were used to find the times of sunrise and the rising of fixed stars, to help schedule morning prayers (salat). In the 10th century, al-Sufi first described over 1,000\u00a0different uses of an astrolabe, in areas as diverse as astronomy, astrology, navigation, surveying, timekeeping, prayer, Salat, Qibla, etc.\nThe spherical astrolabe was a variation of both the astrolabe and the armillary sphere, invented during the Middle Ages by astronomers and inventors in the Islamic world.\nThe earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates to Al-Nayrizi (fl. 892\u2013902). In the 12th\u00a0century, Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-T\u016bs\u012b invented the \"linear astrolabe\", sometimes called the \"staff of al-Tusi\", which was\n \"a simple wooden rod with graduated markings, but without sights. It was furnished with a plumb line and a double chord for making angular measurements and bore a perforated pointer\". The geared mechanical astrolabe was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan in 1235.\nThe first known metal astrolabe in Western Europe is the Destombes astrolabe made from brass in the eleventh century in Portugal.(p140) Metal astrolabes avoided the warping that large wooden ones were prone to, allowing the construction of larger and therefore more accurate instruments. Metal astrolabes were heavier than wooden instruments of the same size, making it difficult to use them in navigation.\nHerman Contractus of Reichenau Abbey, examined the use of the astrolabe in \"Mensura Astrolai\" during the 11th\u00a0century.(phttps://)\nPeter of Maricourt wrote a treatise on the construction and use of a universal astrolabe in the last half of the 13th\u00a0century entitled \"Nova compositio astrolabii particularis\". Universal astrolabes can be found at the History of Science Museum, Oxford. David A. King, historian of Islamic instrumentation, describes the universal astrolobe designed by Ibn al-Sarraj of Aleppo (a.k.a. Ahmad bin Abi Bakr; fl. 1328) as \"the most sophisticated astronomical instrument from the entire Medieval and Renaissance periods\".\nEnglish author Geoffrey Chaucer (c.\u20091343\u20131400) compiled \"A Treatise on the Astrolabe\" for his son, mainly based on a work by Messahalla or Ibn al-Saffar.\nThe same source was translated by French astronomer and astrologer P\u00e9lerin de Prusse and others. The first printed book on the astrolabe was \"Composition and Use of Astrolabe\" by Christian of Prachatice, also using Messahalla, but relatively original.\nIn 1370, the first Indian treatise on the astrolabe was written by the Jain astronomer Mahendra Suri, titled \"Yantrar\u0101ja\".\nA simplified astrolabe, known as a \"balesilha\", was used by sailors to get an accurate reading of latitude while at sea. The use of the \"balesilha\" was promoted by Prince Henry (1394\u20131460) while navigating for Portugal.(phttps://)\nThe astrolabe was almost certainly first brought north of the Pyrenees by Gerbert of Aurillac (future Pope Sylvester II), where it was integrated into the quadrivium at the school in Reims, France, sometime before the turn of the 11th century.(p143) In the 15th\u00a0century, French instrument maker Jean Fusoris (c.\u20091365\u20131436) also started remaking and selling astrolabes in his shop in Paris, along with portable sundials and other popular scientific devices of the day. Thirteen of his astrolabes survive to this day. One more special example of craftsmanship in early 15th-century Europe is the astrolabe designed by Antonius de Pacento and made by Dominicus de Lanzano, dated 1420.\nIn the 16th\u00a0century, Johannes St\u00f6ffler published \"Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii\", a manual of the construction and use of the astrolabe. Four identical 16th\u00a0century astrolabes made by Georg Hartmann provide some of the earliest evidence for batch production by division of labor.\nGreek painter Ieremias Palladas incorporated a sophisticated astrolabe in his 1612 painting depicting Catherine of Alexandria. The painting, entitled \"Catherine of Alexandria\"; in addition to the saint, showed a device labelled the 'system of the universe' (\u03a3\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2). The device featured the classical planets with their Greek names: Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), Hermes (Mercury), Aphrodite (Venus), Ares (Mars), Zeus (Jupiter), and Cronos (Saturn). The depicted device also had celestial spheres, following the Ptolemaic model, and Earth was shown as a blue sphere with circles of geographic coordinates. A complicated line representing the axis of the Earth covered the entire instrument.\nAstrolabes and clocks.\nMechanical astronomical clocks were initially influenced by the astrolabe; they could be seen in many ways as clockwork astrolabes designed to produce a continual display of the current position of the sun, stars, and planets. For example, Richard of Wallingford's clock (c.\u20091330) consisted essentially of a star map rotating behind a fixed rete, similar to that of an astrolabe.\nMany astronomical clocks use an astrolabe-style display, such as the famous clock at Prague, adopting a stereographic projection (see below) of the ecliptic plane. In recent times, astrolabe watches have become popular. For example, Swiss watchmaker Ludwig Oechslin designed and built an astrolabe wristwatch in conjunction with Ulysse Nardin in 1985. Dutch watchmaker Christaan van der Klauuw also manufactures astrolabe watches today.\nConstruction.\nAn astrolabe consists of a disk with a wide, raised rim, called the \"mater\" (mother), which is deep enough to hold one or more flat plates called \"tympans\", or \"climates\". A tympan is made for a specific latitude and is engraved with a stereographic projection of circles denoting azimuth and altitude and representing the portion of the celestial sphere above the local horizon. The rim of the mater is typically graduated into hours of time, degrees of arc, or both.\nAbove the mater and tympan, the \"rete\", a framework bearing a projection of the ecliptic plane and several pointers indicating the positions of the brightest stars, is free to rotate. These pointers are often just simple points, but depending on the skill of the craftsman can be very elaborate and artistic. There are examples of astrolabes with artistic pointers in the shape of balls, stars, snakes, hands, dogs' heads, and leaves, among others. The names of the indicated stars were often engraved on the pointers in Arabic or Latin. Some astrolabes have a narrow \"rule\" or \"label\" which rotates over the rete, and may be marked with a scale of declinations.\nThe rete, representing the sky, functions as a star chart. When it is rotated, the stars and the ecliptic move over the projection of the coordinates on the tympan. One complete rotation corresponds to the passage of a day. The astrolabe is, therefore, a predecessor of the modern planisphere.\nOn the back of the mater, there is often engraved a number of scales that are useful in the astrolabe's various applications. These vary from designer to designer, but might include curves for time conversions, a calendar for converting the day of the month to the sun's position on the ecliptic, trigonometric scales, and graduation of 360 degrees around the back edge. The \"alidade\" is attached to the back face. An alidade can be seen in the lower right illustration of the Persian astrolabe above. When the astrolabe is held vertically, the alidade can be rotated and the sun or a star sighted along its length, so that its altitude in degrees can be read (\"taken\") from the graduated edge of the astrolabe; hence the word's Greek roots: \"astron\" (\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd) = star + \"lab-\" (\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2-) = to take. The alidade had vertical and horizontal cross-hairs which plots locations on an azimuthal ring called an almucantar (altitude-distance circle).\nAn arm called a radius connects from the center of the astrolabe to the optical axis which is parallel with another arm also called a radius. The other radius contains graduations of altitude and distance measurements.\nA shadow square also appears on the back of some astrolabes, developed by Muslim astrologists in the 9th Century, whereas devices of the Ancient Greek tradition featured only altitude scales on the back of the devices. This was used to convert shadow lengths and the altitude of the sun, the uses of which were various from surveying to measuring inaccessible heights.\nDevices were usually signed by their maker with an inscription appearing on the back of the astrolabe, and if there was a patron of the object, their name would appear inscribed on the front, or in some cases, the name of the reigning sultan or the teacher of the astrolabist has also been found to appear inscribed in this place. The date of the astrolabe's construction was often also signed, which has allowed historians to determine that these devices are the second oldest scientific instrument in the world. The inscriptions on astrolabes also allowed historians to conclude that astronomers tended to make their own astrolabes, but that many were also made to order and kept in stock to sell, suggesting there was some contemporary market for the devices.\nMathematical basis.\nThe construction and design of astrolabes are based on the application of the stereographic projection of the celestial sphere. The point from which the projection is usually made is the South Pole. The plane onto which the projection is made is that of the Equator.\nDesigning a tympanum through stereographic projection.\nThe tympanum captures the celestial coordinate axes upon which the \"rete\" will rotate. It is the component that will enable the precise determination of a star's position at a specific time of day and year.\nTherefore, it should project:\nThe tropics and the equator define the tympanum.\nOn the right side of the image above:\nWhen projecting onto the celestial equatorial plane, three concentric circles correspond to the celestial sphere's three circles of latitude (left side of the image). The largest of these, the projection on the celestial equatorial plane of the celestial Tropic of Capricorn, defines the size of the astrolabe's tympanum. The center of the tympanum (and the center of the three circles) is actually the north-south axis around which Earth rotates, and therefore, the \"rete\" of the astrolabe will rotate around this point as the hours of the day pass (due to Earth's rotational motion).\nThe three concentric circles on the tympanum are useful for determining the exact moments of solstices and equinoxes throughout the year: if the sun's altitude at noon on the \"rete\" is known and coincides with the outer circle of the tympanum (Tropic of Capricorn), it signifies the winter solstice (the sun will be at the zenith for an observer at the Tropic of Capricorn, meaning summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere). If, on the other hand, its altitude coincides with the inner circle (Tropic of Cancer), it indicates the summer solstice. If its altitude is on the middle circle (equator), it corresponds to one of the two equinoxes.\nThe horizon and the measurement of altitude.\nOn the right side of the image above:\nWhen projecting the horizon onto the celestial equatorial plane, it transforms into an ellipse upward-shifted relatively to the center of the tympanum (both the observer and the projection of the north-south axis). This implies that a portion of the celestial sphere will fall outside the outer circle of the tympanum (the projection of the celestial Tropic of Capricorn) and, therefore, won't be represented.\nAdditionally, when drawing circles parallel to the horizon up to the zenith (almucantar), and projecting them on the celestial equatorial plane, as in the image above, a grid of consecutive ellipses is constructed, allowing for the determination of a star's altitude when its \"rete\" overlaps with the designed tympanum.\nThe meridians and the measurement of azimuth.\nOn the right side of the image above:\nWhen projecting the celestial meridian, it results in a straight line that overlaps with the vertical axis of the tympanum, where the zenith and nadir are located. However, when projecting the 40\u00b0 E meridian, another circle is obtained that passes through both the zenith and nadir projections, so its center is located on the perpendicular bisection of the segment connecting both points. In deed, the projection of the celestial meridian can be considered as a circle with an infinite radius (a straight line) whose center is on this bisection and at an infinite distance from these two points.\nIf successive meridians that divide the celestial sphere into equal sectors (like \"orange slices\" radiating from the zenith) are projected, a family of curves passing through the zenith projection on the tympanum is obtained. These curves, once overlaid with the \"rete\" containing the major stars, allow for determining the azimuth of a star located on the \"rete\" and rotated for a specific time of day.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73669", "revid": "23838081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73669", "title": "All-America Football Conference", "text": "Professional American football league operating from 1946\u20131949\nThe All-America Football Conference (AAFC) was a major professional American football league that challenged the established National Football League (NFL) from 1946 to 1949. One of the NFL's most formidable challengers, the AAFC attracted many of the nation's best players, and introduced many lasting innovations to the game. However, the AAFC was ultimately unable to sustain itself in competition with the NFL. After it folded, three of its teams were admitted to the NFL: the San Francisco 49ers, the Cleveland Browns and the original Baltimore Colts (not to be confused with the later Baltimore Colts team, now the Indianapolis Colts).\nThe AAFC was the second American professional football league (the first being the third American Football League of 1940\u20131941) to have its teams play in a double round robin format in the regular season: each team had a home game and an away game with each of the other AAFC teams.\nThe Cleveland Browns were the AAFC's most successful club, winning every annual championship in the league's four years of operation.\nFounding.\nThe AAFC was founded by \"Chicago Tribune\" sports editor Arch Ward on June 4, 1944. Ward was also the originator of baseball's All-Star Game and football's College All-Star Game. Ward brought together a number of wealthy pro football enthusiasts, some of whom had previously attempted to purchase NFL franchises. Ward had previously encouraged the NFL to expand, but now he hoped to bring about a permanent second league and a championship game with the NFL, similar to baseball's World Series.\nThe idea was not originated in vacuum, as two additional upstart leagues were trying to challenge the NFL in 1944:\nOn November 21, 1944, the AAFC chose James \"Sleepy Jim\" Crowley, one of the \"Four Horsemen of Notre Dame\", as its commissioner. Not coincidentally, the NFL commissioner at this time was Elmer Layden, another member of Knute Rockne's legendary 1924 \"Fighting Irish\" backfield at the University of Notre Dame.\nDuring the next months, the AAFC's plans solidified. The league initially issued franchises for Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. Brooklyn and Miami were later added. A group representing Baltimore was considered for admission, but could not secure use of Baltimore's stadium. The league planned to begin to play in 1945, but postponed its opening for a year as World War II continued.\nAs the eight franchises built their teams, no move was more far-reaching than Cleveland's choice of Paul Brown as its head coach. Brown had won six Ohio state championships in nine years at Massillon High School and the 1942 national championship at Ohio State, and had also coached successfully at the military's Naval Station Great Lakes. As coach of the new Cleveland franchise, Brown would become one of American football's greatest innovators and eventually have the team named for him.\nNFL reaction.\nAs might be expected, the NFL did not welcome its new rival. In 1945, Layden remarked that the AAFC, still a year from its first game, should \"first get a ball, then make a schedule, and then play a game\". This insult, often paraphrased as \"tell them to get a ball first\", would be long remembered.\nWashington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall was perhaps the NFL's hardest-liner regarding the AAFC. In 1945, he commented: \"I did not realize there was another league, although I did receive some literature telling about a WPA project\". Later he declared, \"the worst team in our league could beat the best team in theirs\". After the AAFC put a team in Baltimore, Marshall's opposition to it would be a major obstacle to interleague peace. Not coincidentally, his team was badly hurt by the AAFC. A top team from 1936 to 1945, the Redskins began a decades-long title drought after coach Ray Flaherty and many key players defected in 1946.\nLayden's successor, Bert Bell, pursued a policy of official non-recognition, generally answering \"no comment\" to queries about the other league. In 1947, \"Pro Football Illustrated\" previewed both leagues in its annual publication and was banned from NFL stadiums.\nCompetition.\nThe AAFC posed a formidable challenge. In most interleague sports wars, the established league had major advantages over the challenger in prestige, finance, size, and public awareness. The NFL-AAFC war differed in several respects.\nThe NFL was just emerging from its wartime retrenchment. The Cleveland Rams had suspended operations for 1943, and on three occasions teams merged for a season. The Boston Yanks had played only one season as an independent entity.\nMeanwhile, the AAFC had advantages not enjoyed by many challengers:\nYet it remained to be seen if there was a market for this much pro football. Since achieving stability in the early 1930s, the NFL had never fielded more than 10 teams. No competitor had endured for more than two years. In 1946, there would be 18 teams, including three in Chicago, three in New York, and two in Los Angeles.\nBaseball and college football were substantially more popular. Longtime NFL president Joe Carr had said, \"No owner has made money from pro football, but a lot have gone broke thinking they could.\" At a time when the World Series had long been a national institution, and the Rose Bowl drew crowds of 90,000, the NFL's title game typically drew about 35,000 fans. Across the U.S., a growing number of college stadiums designed or retrofitted for football were being built and expanded across the U.S. Most pro football teams in contrast shared stadiums (and sometimes names) with the local baseball team, and as such had to make do in facilities designed for another sport with mediocre sight lines for football. Both leagues saw fit to choose college football legends as their commissioners.\nThere was even a sense that collegians could defeat pros. 1946 saw the famous Army\u2013Notre Dame scoreless tie in Yankee Stadium. At season's end, Arch Ward (the AAFC founder) opined that both teams were superior to either pro champion.\nIt was in this landscape that the AAFC prepared to compete with the NFL.\nManeuvers and intrigue.\nDan Topping, owner of the NFL's Brooklyn Tigers, wished to move his team from Ebbets Field to the much larger Yankee Stadium. New York Giants owner Tim Mara used his territorial rights to block the move. He had good reason: the Yankees had displaced the Giants as New York's premier baseball team after moving into The House That Ruth Built, three rival football leagues had planted teams there hoping to duplicate that feat, and Topping (of Anaconda Copper) was significantly wealthier than Mara.\nTopping responded by buying into the baseball Yankees and transferring his football club to the AAFC. Most of his players followed. His renamed New York Yankees were rewarded with $100,000 from each of the other seven AAFC teams while the AAFC's initial New York investor withdrew. (Note that the AAFC Brooklyn Dodgers were a separate entity never associated with Topping's team.)\nShortly after Topping defected, the NFL owners fired Commissioner Layden, replacing him with Pittsburgh Steelers co-owner Bert Bell. Bell had already made a major contribution to the league: the NFL draft, begun in 1936, was his idea.\nMeanwhile, Dan Reeves' Cleveland Rams had consistently lost money, despite winning the 1945 NFL title. Compounding his problems, the local AAFC competition already looked strong: Arthur McBride was aggressively marketing the Browns, and coach Paul Brown was an Ohio icon. Accordingly, Reeves proposed to move the Rams to Los Angeles.\nWith two teams planned for California, the AAFC had national aspirations. The NFL's thinking was more modest: it rejected Reeves' move because of travel expenses. After the NFL refused to consider his second choice (Dallas), Reeves threatened to move his team to the AAFC. Having already lost Topping, the NFL reconsidered and approved the Los Angeles move.\nIt was unprecedented for the NFL champion to move at all, let alone partly to avoid an unproven rival. On the other hand, the NFL would now face the AAFC as a national rather than regional league, and the AAFC would not have a West Coast monopoly.\nRather than hold a collegiate draft, Crowley encouraged his owners to sign as many good players as possible to compete with the NFL. However, this open market favored Paul Brown, who had built the most extensive recruitment network in all of football. He thus had a head start in signing top players coming out of the colleges and military. Years later, Crowley acknowledged this was a fatal mistake, as it planted the seeds for the Browns' near-total dominance of the league.\nInitial alignment.\nFor 1946, the AAFC began play with 8 teams playing a record 14 games (a double round-robin). The NFL's 10 teams played 11 games, its standard since 1937.\nAgain acting ambitiously, the AAFC chose stadiums larger than the NFL's in Chicago, New York, and Cleveland.\nThe two leagues\u2019 franchises and home fields for 1946 were:\nNFL\nAAFC\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n1946.\nIn the AAFC's first game, on September 6, 1946, the Cleveland Browns hosted the Miami Seahawks, winning 44\u20130 before a professional football record crowd of more than 60,000 fans. This historic game would prove a microcosm of much about the league:\nOther than New York, all of the quality teams were in the Western Division. In the West, Cleveland led with a 12\u20132 record, three games ahead of San Francisco, followed by Los Angeles and Chicago. In the East, New York was the only team to win more than three games, finishing 10\u20133\u20131. Brooklyn and Buffalo were seven games behind, followed by Miami. Despite Brooklyn's record, its tailback Glenn Dobbs led the league in passing and was named the MVP.\nThe title game was a tight affair, with the Browns coming from behind late in the fourth quarter to defeat the Yankees 14\u20139.\nDespite the fiasco in Miami, the AAFC had enjoyed a successful debut, establishing a high level of play and doing well at the gate. The NFL likewise set attendance highs for both its season and title game. However, as salaries shot up with two leagues competing for players, the only teams to make a profit were the two champions, the Browns and the NFL Bears.\n1947.\nThe Chicago Rockets had experienced some disorganization in 1946. In a remarkable move, Commissioner Crowley (a successful former college coach) gave up a five-year contract to become their part-owner and coach. Admiral Jonas H. Ingram was named to replace him as commissioner.\nTo replace the Seahawks, the Baltimore group turned down in 1945 was issued a franchise. The new Baltimore Colts would play in Municipal Stadium. Meanwhile, the Bisons were renamed the Bills and the NFL added a 12th game to its schedule.\nThe AAFC enjoyed its most successful season in 1947. Some notable guests watched the Browns' opening game: the entire coaching staff of the 1946 NFL champion Chicago Bears. The 49ers obtained the rights to Army's legendary \nHeisman Trophy winners Felix Blanchard (\"Mr. Inside\") and Glenn Davis (\"Mr. Outside\"), and amid great publicity unsuccessfully attempted to get the military to permit them to play during their post-graduation furloughs. In other highlights, a Yankees\u2013Dons game in the Los Angeles Coliseum drew a pro record of more than 82,000, and division leaders New York and Cleveland locked horns on November 23 in the most famous game in AAFC history. Before more than 70,000 fans at Yankee Stadium, the Browns rallied from a 28\u20130 deficit to tie 28\u201328.\nNew York won the East with an 11\u20132\u20131 record, 2\u00bd games ahead of Buffalo, with Brooklyn and Baltimore far back. Cleveland, led by MVP quarterback Otto Graham, won the West with a 12\u20131\u20131 record, 3\u00bd games ahead of San Francisco. Los Angeles followed, and Chicago was last at 1\u201313. Former Commissioner Crowley would not return either as coach or owner.\nThe title game was a defensive struggle, with the Browns again defeating the Yankees, 14\u20133.\nBy this time a pattern had emerged among the franchises. The Browns, Yankees, 49ers, Dons, and Bills all had stable ownership and at least one winning season. The Browns led both leagues in attendance by a wide margin, the Yankees and Dons outpaced their crosstown NFL rivals on the field and at the gate, and the 49ers and Bills (despite a small stadium) also enjoyed good attendance.\nHowever, the Dodgers, Rockets, and to a lesser extent the Colts were having serious problems. Playing near the Yankees and the NFL Giants, the Dodgers drew fewer than 12,000 fans per game, least in both leagues. The Rockets faced the NFL's flagship Bears and a Cardinals team enjoying rare success. After a decent start in 1946, the Rockets collapsed on the field and found themselves playing before tens of thousands of empty seats in huge Soldier Field. The first-year Colts did reasonably well at the gate but finished last. All of these teams were at the bottom of the standings and all were sold after the 1947 season, the Rockets for the second time.\n1948.\nAlthough 1947 had been a successful season for the AAFC in many respects, the league still lost money. In 1948, attendance in both leagues declined, and negotiations to end the war became serious.\nOne factor affecting AAFC attendance was the gap between the league's best and worst teams. To counter this, Commissioner Ingram attempted to get the strongest teams to distribute some players to the weakest. He was modestly successful: the Browns sent rookie quarterback Y. A. Tittle to the Colts, who enjoyed their first good season, and the Yankees were generous enough to fall into mediocrity. However, 1948 featured extremes despite Ingram's efforts.\nFor the first time, the division races were close. One featured excellence, the other mediocrity.\nThe 1948 AAFC draft was held on December 16, 1947, in New York City. Tony Minisi was the first overall selection. In the West, San Francisco and Cleveland both remained undefeated far into the season. On November 14, nearly 83,000 (a record) in Cleveland Municipal Stadium watched the 9\u20130 Browns win a 14\u20137 defensive struggle over the 10\u20130 49ers. They met again two weeks later in San Francisco, with the Browns now 12\u20130 and the 49ers 11\u20131. The Browns again won narrowly, this time 31\u201328, clinching first place.\nThe rematch concluded an AAFC Thanksgiving week promotion: the Browns played three games in eight days. New Dodgers' part-owner Branch Rickey (of baseball fame) suggested this experiment, and the Browns were chosen as the guinea pigs. They survived unscathed, and went on to complete an unprecedented 14\u20130 regular season.\nThe 49ers finished a heartbreaking second (and out of the postseason) at 12\u20132. Los Angeles followed at 7\u20137, and Chicago again finished last at 1\u201313. The quarterbacks of the two outstanding teams, Cleveland's Otto Graham and San Francisco's Frankie Albert, shared the MVP.\nIn the East, Buffalo and Baltimore tied at a mediocre 7\u20137, just ahead of 6\u20138 New York. Brooklyn was last at 2\u201312. Buffalo won a playoff and the dubious privilege of meeting Cleveland for the title.\nCleveland won the title in a predictable rout, 49\u20137. With pro football's second perfect season (after the 1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs of the second American Football League) and an 18-game winning streak and a 29-game unbeaten streak in progress, the Browns were making history. Since then, only the 1972 Miami Dolphins team managed to win its league championship with an unblemished record. The Pro Football Hall of Fame recognizes the Browns' latter streak as the longest in the history of professional football.\nThe NFL also had a problem with imbalance. With one exception, every title game from 1933 to 1946 featured either the Giants or Redskins from the East against either the Bears or Packers from the West. The lone exception was 1935, when the Detroit Lions played in the title game against the Giants.\nBut in the late 1940s new powers rose in the NFL, as the Cardinals, Eagles, and Rams all won titles, and the Steelers reached a playoff. All these teams had long histories of futility and had merged or suspended operations during the war. (In fact, the Cardinals were winless from mid-1942 to mid-1945, including a 0\u201310 merged season with the Steelers.)\nAdding to the drama, the division races were often tight. Decades before Pete Rozelle, Bert Bell promoted parity by purposely matching strong teams early in the season, keeping them from getting far ahead in the standings. All this contrasted sharply with the AAFC.\nThe war was getting increasingly costly thanks to rising salaries and dropping attendance. Nearly every team in both leagues lost money \u2013 enough that in December, the NFL officially acknowledged the AAFC as peace talks almost succeeded in ending the war. However, the AAFC wanted four of its teams to be admitted into the NFL, while the NFL was willing to admit only the Browns and 49ers. Although the survival of its Brooklyn and Chicago teams was now in doubt, the AAFC decided to continue the fight.\nRealignment.\nCommissioner Ingram stepped down, and another admiral, Oliver O. Kessing, was named Commissioner.\nAs the war entered its fourth season, financial problems forced reorganization in both leagues. The Dodgers, the AAFC's least-drawing team, merged with the Yankees as the Rockets (renamed the Hornets) and Colts continued their streaks of annual ownership changes.\nIn the NFL, the champion Philadelphia Eagles lost money and were sold. Plagued by league-low attendance, the Boston Yanks moved to New York in a curious move. Yanks owner Ted Collins had long desired a franchise in Yankee Stadium (thus his team's name), and expected the AAFC and its Yankees to be gone in 1949. Instead, with Yankee Stadium and the Yanks name unavailable, Collins' renamed Bulldogs had to share the Polo Grounds with the Giants on unfavorable terms and compete with two superior rivals.\nWith the AAFC now down to seven teams, it realigned into one division, reduced its schedule to 12 games (still a double round-robin), and changed its postseason to a Shaughnessy playoff. In 1948, the 12\u20132 49ers had stayed home while the 7\u20137 Bills played for the title. This would not reoccur, as now the top four teams would qualify for the playoffs. Also, for the first time in pro football, playoff home-field advantage would be based on win\u2013loss record rather than rotating between divisions.\nThe lineup of the rival leagues was now:\nNFL\nAAFC\n1949.\nSince 1934, the College All-Star Game had matched the defending NFL champions against an all-star team of recent college graduates. The game was a major event, as Rose Bowl-sized crowds (more than 105,000 in 1947) watched college football's best often hold their own with the pros. Held in late August at Soldier Field, the game was sponsored by the \"Chicago Tribune\"\u2014whose sports editor, Ward, had founded the AAFC.\nAfter the game's contract with the NFL expired with the 1948 game, Ward refused to renew it. He attempted to help the AAFC by putting its champion into the prestigious game. However, the NFL was able to convince the \"Tribune's\" board to override Ward and force him to re-sign with the NFL, handing the AAFC an embarrassing defeat.\nRed ink on both sides continued to flow. The Colts and Hornets were only kept afloat when Dons owner Ben Lindheimer subsidized them. The Green Bay Packers, then as now owned by a local civic group, had to issue new stock to remain solvent. Now facing two cross-town rivals, the Bulldogs predictably had even lower attendance in New York than in Boston. The Pittsburgh Steelers and Detroit Lions were also having serious financial problems.\nRemarkably, the AAFC actually enjoyed better attendance than the NFL over its four-year run. In an era when sports teams were wholly dependent on gate receipts to remain in business, and when revenues from sources such as media rights were negligible, this had the potential to put the AAFC on essentially an equal financial footing. However, the NFL had a critical advantage in that its ownership was deeply committed to ensuring the survival of their teams. In contrast, it was becoming clear that the AAFC's better-financed owners, who were accustomed to operating profitable businesses, as opposed to underwriting expenses year after year, were not willing to absorb losses indefinitely.\nOn the field, Cleveland finally showed some vulnerability. An opening day tie with the Bills ended their winning streak, and on October 9th the 49ers ended their unbeaten streak in a 56\u201328 upset to move into first place.\nThings soon reverted to form, however. The Browns won the rematch with the 49ers 30\u201328; and Cleveland (9\u20131\u20132) and San Francisco (9\u20133) finished one-two for the fourth consecutive year. Brooklyn\u2013New York and Buffalo were the other playoff qualifiers, followed by Chicago and Los Angeles. Baltimore finished far behind at 1\u201311.\nIn playoff action, Cleveland defeated Buffalo 31\u201321 and San Francisco defeated Brooklyn\u2013New York 17\u20137. The two best teams in AAFC history met at last with the title at stake, with the Browns winning the final title 21\u20137. No MVP was named for this season.\nThe Browns now owned a 52\u20134\u20133 record and all four AAFC titles.\nMerger.\nOn December 9, 1949, two days before the AAFC title game, the two leagues made peace. Three AAFC teams were admitted to the NFL: the Browns, 49ers, and Colts. The Dons merged with the Rams, while the Bills, Yankees, and Hornets folded. The enlarged league was renamed the National\u2013American Football League.\nThe Browns and 49ers, as the AAFC's two strongest teams, were obvious choices. San Francisco was also a natural fit as a potential geographic rival to the Rams, who were alone on the West Coast at the time.\nThe third choice was the subject of some debate. There was some sentiment to admit the Bills rather than the Colts. The Bills had better attendance despite only making the playoffs twice, and had much wealthier ownership. However, Buffalo's size (only Green Bay was smaller) and climate were seen as problems. While Redskins owner George Preston Marshall had long objected to the Colts' proximity to Washington, he ultimately decided that the Colts would be a natural rival to the Redskins. He agreed to accept a $150,000 fee to waive his territorial rights.\nBuffalo fans petitioned the NFL to admit the Bills as well. The league, realizing the pitfalls of having an uneven 13-team league, held a vote on admitting the Bills. While a majority of owners (including the Browns, 49ers, and Colts) were willing to take the Bills, the final vote was only 9\u20134 in favor. League rules of the time required a unanimous vote to admit a new team. Buffalo owner Jim Breuil was content to accept a minority stake in the Browns. Breuil even rebuffed an offer from the next-best pro league in the nation at the time, the minor-league American Football League of the late 1940s, to join their league.\nThe Yankees' players were divided between the Giants (who chose six players) and Bulldogs (who received the rest). Three Bills players were awarded to the Browns. The remaining Bills, Dons, and Hornets entered a dispersal draft.\nWith the AAFC Yankees gone, Bulldogs owner Ted Collins was free to rename his team \"Yanks\" and move into Yankee Stadium. He continued to lose money, however, and sold the team after two seasons to Dallas-based interests, who relocated the team to Dallas and called the team the Dallas Texans.\nThe word \"American\" did not remain in the enlarged league's name for long; it was dropped in March 1950. Although \"National\" and \"American\" became the names of the league's new conferences, within three years the conferences were renamed Eastern and Western. It was not until the AFL\u2013NFL merger twenty years later that the \"American\" and \"National\" conference names were restored.\nThe enlarged NFL was aligned as follows:\nWith two exceptions, this was the NFL's alignment for the rest of the 1950s.\nAdmitting Baltimore over Buffalo proved to be a mistake, as the AAFC's Colts folded after one season in the NFL, bringing the league back to an even 12 teams. However, the aforementioned Dallas Texans also folded after only one season, and a replacement team, also named the Colts, acquired its assets and joined the league as an expansion team in 1953. Meanwhile, the popularity of the original Bills franchise prompted former Detroit Lions minority owner Ralph Wilson to adopt the name \"Buffalo Bills\" for his American Football League franchise ten years after the AAFC dissolved. Both the replacement Colts (now based in Indianapolis) and the replacement Bills are still playing in the NFL, though neither maintains official ties to their namesakes (coincidentally, the Colts and Bills were division rivals in the AFC East from 1970 through 2001, after which the Colts moved to the AFC South).\nAftermath.\n\"The World Series of Pro Football\".\nAfter winning each of their titles, the Browns challenged the NFL champion to an interleague championship. Each year the NFL refused. (Of course, by playing such a game the NFL would legitimize the AAFC and risk more prestige.)\nIn December 1949, with both leagues financially exhausted but now at peace, a profitable interleague playoff was now both possible and desirable. Although Pittsburgh's Art Rooney, whose Steelers were among the shakiest NFL franchises, publicly advocated such a game, most of the NFL was unwilling to risk defeat at the hands of their vanquished, supposedly inferior rival. Officially, however, commissioner Bert Bell maintained that the NFL constitution barred such a game. The football world would have to wait to see how the Browns matched up against the NFL's best.\nAll would not be lost for fans, however. Bell appreciated that the Browns were now an important asset to the NFL, and scheduled a special Saturday night game between them and the NFL's two-time champion Philadelphia Eagles to open the 1950 season. While not quite an unofficial interleague playoff, what took place on September 16, 1950, was no ordinary regular season game.\nThe defending champions of two leagues that had never met on the field were about to play, foreshadowing tensions present in the early Super Bowls of the 1960s. At last the Browns would have the chance to prove themselves, and by extension the AAFC, against the NFL. There was tremendous anticipation from fans and the press, which called the game \"The World Series of Pro Football\". Although the game was played in Philadelphia, it was not played on the Eagles usual home field: because of the huge crowd expected, the game was moved from Shibe Park to Philadelphia Municipal Stadium, site of the Army\u2013Navy Game. Attendance was a whopping 71,237, the third-largest pro football crowd to that date (next to two crowds for Rams games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum the year before), and the largest-ever on the east coast. (This figure also surpassed every previous NFL or AAFC title game, as well as Super Bowl I.) There was even a most valuable player award, unheard of for a regular-season game.\nThe Eagles were widely considered one of the NFL's strongest-ever champions, while many discounted the Browns\u2019 success in their \"inferior\" league. The result was therefore shocking: the Eagles underestimated the highly motivated Browns (coach Greasy Neale did not even scout the Browns\u2019 preseason games), while Paul Brown found some previously unknown weaknesses in the widely imitated \"Eagle Defense\" that allowed the Browns to run up 487 yards of total offense. The Browns led 14\u20133 at halftime and dominated the rest of the game to win decisively, 35\u201310. Quarterback Otto Graham was named the game's MVP.\nThe Browns, 49ers, and Colts in the NFL.\nThe Browns went 10\u20132 to finish in a first-place tie with the New York Giants, then won a playoff 8\u20133 to qualify for the 1950 NFL championship game. Their opponent was a formidable Los Angeles Rams team that averaged nearly 39 points per game, a record that still stands. (Ironically, this was the Rams\u2019 first game in Cleveland since winning the 1945 title as the Cleveland Rams.) In a classic seesaw game, the Browns prevailed on a last-minute field goal, 30\u201328, to win their fifth consecutive league title.\nThe Browns\u2019 1950 season confirmed the quality of their AAFC achievements as nothing else could. After the title game, Commissioner Bell called the Browns \"the greatest team to ever play football.\"\nCleveland remained near the top of the NFL for years, although in 1951 they were finally denied a league title (by the Rams). The Browns played in every NFL title game from 1950 to 1955, winning three of them, for a grand total of seven league titles in ten years.\nThe other ex-AAFC teams did not fare nearly as well.\nThe 49ers, the AAFC's second-best team, struggled in 1950 and finished 3\u20139. However, starting the next year they emerged as one of the better teams in the NFL's Western Conference, reaching the postseason in 1957 after some near-misses.\nThe Colts' prospects were not promising: they had finished 1\u201311 and last in the AAFC in 1949 and also faced the handicap of playing near the Washington Redskins. In 1950, the Colts went 1\u201311 again and disbanded. Their legacy lived on, however: three years later, a new Baltimore Colts franchise team was established after the Dallas Texans folded and the Colts became one of the NFL's storied teams. Although the Colts would controversially move to Indianapolis, on March 29, 1984, the NFL would return to Baltimore for the 1996 NFL season in the form of the Baltimore Ravens. From an organizational perspective, the Ravens are a continuation of the pre-1996 Browns, who played in Cleveland until they controversially agreed to move to Baltimore for the 1996 NFL season. Officially, the NFL considers the \"expansion\" Browns (1999 on) to be one continuous franchise from the original 1946 AAFC team, with it having \"suspended operations from 1996 to 1998\", while the Ravens are considered to have been established in 1996. While the pre-1984 history of the Colts officially remains with the Indianapolis franchise, the Ravens have also recognized it in a number of ways. \n\"See Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350), and Indianapolis Colts for further details of these teams' subsequent histories.\"\nThe AAFC and the NFL record book.\nOne notable difference between the All-America Football Conference and the American Football League (AFL), which merged with the NFL two decades later, is that the records and statistics of AAFC players and teams were not included in the NFL record book for many years, while those of their AFL counterparts were. For example, Joe Namath's pre-1970 statistics with the AFL New York Jets have long been considered official NFL statistics, while Y. A. Tittle's pre-1950 statistics with the AAFC Baltimore Colts were not.\nAccording to the NFL, this was because official scoresheets of AAFC games were not made available to the NFL after the merger. Without these, the NFL could not verify the authenticity of any AAFC statistics or records, and so it chose to ignore them. However, in the case of the AFL\u2013NFL merger, which was completed in 1970, the AFL gave all of its official scoresheets to the NFL, making it possible for the NFL to accept the AFL's statistics and records. \nAnother explanation is that unlike the NFL\u2013AFL agreement, the NFL\u2013AAFC agreement was not a merger between equals: only three of the seven AAFC teams were admitted to the NFL, there was no interleague playoff in December 1949, and \"American\" swiftly disappeared from the enlarged league's name. In contrast, the AFL was able to force the NFL to admit all of its teams, to play an interleague championship game on a neutral field (retroactively known as Super Bowl I), and to maintain the \"American\" name in the form of the American Football Conference.\nA push to have AAFC statistics officially recognized by the NFL started in 2019, but stalled for a number of years. On April 1, 2025, NFL owners approved a proposal from the Competition Committee to officially recognize AAFC records, spanning player, coach, and team statistics. Incorporating AAFC records credited longtime Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown with an additional 52 regular-season and playoff wins, as recognized by the NFL.\nHistorically, the Pro Football Hall of Fame did recognize AAFC statistics.\nLegacy.\nAlthough the AAFC played only four years, it had a major, lasting impact on pro football. Of all the leagues that challenged the NFL, only the American Football League of the 1960s influenced the NFL more than the AAFC. The AAFC put the first pro football teams in Baltimore, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami. Indeed, the AAFC was a coast-to-coast league more than a decade before Major League Baseball. This brought about another innovation: AAFC teams traveled by air while NFL teams still traveled by train. The Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and original Baltimore Colts began in the AAFC, while sixteen AAFC alumni are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nThe AAFC played a 14-game schedule more than a decade before the NFL, and played a major role in popularizing zone defenses in pro football.\nBlack players were excluded from the NFL from 1934 to 1945. The AAFC helped reintegrate professional American football in 1946 when Cleveland signed Marion Motley and Bill Willis. The NFL Rams, having been driven out of Cleveland by the AAFC Browns, signed Kenny Washington and Woody Strode only after the venue they sought to play in, the Los Angeles Coliseum, enforced its policy of integration. Through its poaching of NFL official (and former player-coaching star) Tommy Hughitt, the AAFC took an explicitly anti-racist stance toward rough play, aggressively penalizing racist unsportsmanlike conduct. Motley credited this, along with the AAFC fans' embrace of black talent in the league, with helping to establish the legitimacy of integrated professional football.\nThe AAFC's Paul Brown produced numerous innovations to the game on and off the field. Among them were year-round coaching staffs, precision pass patterns, the face mask, and the practice of coaches\u2019 calling plays via \"messenger guards\". He also was the first coach to have his staff film the opposition and have his team break down those game films in a classroom setting. In fact, the classroom setting and chalkboard analysis can also be attributed to him. His success with the Browns forced the rest of both leagues to adopt his methods. Many of his players and assistants eventually coached champions. Brown declined efforts to draft him to succeed Bert Bell as NFL commissioner, later founded the American Football League's Cincinnati Bengals, and later served on the NFL's key Competition Committee until his death in 1991.\nThese and other AAFC innovations and personalities helped lay the groundwork for professional football's great success.\nThe merger would also benefit the Pittsburgh Steelers. One of the NFL's shakiest franchises financially prior to the merger, the addition of the Browns would help form a rivalry due to the close proximity of Cleveland and Pittsburgh that would be cut to two hours driving time by the time the Ohio Turnpike and the western extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were completed by the mid-1950s, allowing fans of both teams to attend each other's away games. While the Steelers would largely remain non-competitive until their 1970s dominance, the rivalry with the Browns along with their existing rivalry with the Eagles would help stabilize the team's finances.\nFinally, the Browns' NFL Championship in their first year in the NFL and their domination of the league for the next decade, in retrospect, seem to have been harbingers of another upstart league that like the AAFC was ridiculed and reviled by the NFL and its supporters, but would eventually be recognized as the genesis of modern professional football: the American Football League of 1960\u20131969.\nStandings.\n\"W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\n1946.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAAFC Championship: Cleveland 14, New York 9 (December 22 @ Cleveland)\n1947.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAAFC Championship: Cleveland 14, New York 3 (December 14 @ New York)\n1948.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEastern Division playoff: Buffalo 28, Baltimore 17 (December 12 @ Baltimore)\nAAFC Championship: Cleveland 49, Buffalo 7 (December 19 @ Cleveland)\n1949.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nSemifinal #1: Cleveland 31, Buffalo 21 (December 4 @ Cleveland)\nSemifinal #2: San Francisco 17, Brooklyn/New York 7 (December 4 @ San Francisco)\nAAFC Championship: Cleveland 21, San Francisco 7 (December 11 @ Cleveland)\nAll-time standings.\nFranchises are ranked by win percentage.

Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman &amp; Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. In the process, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.\nDickens wrote \"A Christmas Carol\" during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as cards and Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London's street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story or a Christian allegory.\nPublished on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella favourably. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took legal action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens's small profits from the publication. He subsequently wrote four other Christmas stories. In 1849 he began public readings of the story, which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. \"A Christmas Carol\" has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.\n\"A Christmas Carol\" captured the zeitgeist of the early Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. Dickens acknowledged the influence of the modern Western observance of Christmas and later inspired several aspects of Christmas, including family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.\nPlot.\nThe book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled \"staves\".\nStave one.\n\"A Christmas Carol\" opens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge's business partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an ageing miser, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.\nThat night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has a single chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own.\nStave two.\nThe first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge's lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge's neglected fianc\u00e9e Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Scrooge, upset by hearing a description of the man that he has become, demands that the ghost remove him from the house.\nStave three.\nThe second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market where people are buying the makings of Christmas dinner and to celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.\nStave four.\nThe third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. His charwoman, laundress and the local undertaker steal his possessions to sell to a fence. When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.\nStave five.\nScrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon at Fred's Christmas party. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.\nBackground.\nThe writer Charles Dickens was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of his father John. In 1824 John was committed to the Marshalsea, a debtors' prison in Southwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infested shoe-blacking factory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a \"deep personal and social outrage\", which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.\nBy the end of 1842 Dickens was a well-established author with six major works as well as several short stories, novellas and other pieces. On 31 December that year he began publishing his novel \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" as a monthly serial; it was his favourite work, but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties.\nCelebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era. The Christmas tree was introduced in Britain during the 18th century, and its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work \"Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England\" and William Sandys's 1833 collection \"Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern\" led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.\nDickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was \"Christmas Festivities\", published in \"Bell's Weekly Messenger\" in 1835; the story was then published as \"A Christmas Dinner\" in \"Sketches by Boz\" (1836). \"The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton\", another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novel \"The Pickwick Papers\". In the episode, a Mr Wardle describes a misanthropic sexton, Gabriel Grub, who undergoes a Christmas conversion after being visited by goblins who show him the past and future. Slater considers that \"the main elements of the \"Carol\" are present in the story\", but not yet in a firm form. The story is followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens's editorial \"Master Humphrey's Clock\". The professor of English literature Paul Davis writes that although the \"Goblins\" story appears to be a prototype of \"A Christmas Carol\", all Dickens's earlier writings about Christmas influenced the story.\nLiterary influences.\nDickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819\u201320 work \"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\" included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that returning to Christmas traditions might promote a type of social connection that they felt had been lost in the modern world.\nSeveral works had an influence on the writing of \"A Christmas Carol\", including two essays by his friend Douglas Jerrold: one from an 1841 issue of \"Punch\", \"How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas\" and one from 1843, \"The Beauties of the Police\". More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.\nSocial influences.\nDickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered by seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.\nIn February 1843 the \"Second Report of the Children's Employment Commission\" was published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, \"An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child\", but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production until the end of the year. In March he wrote to Dr Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the \"Second Report\", about his change in plans: \"you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force\u2014twenty thousand times the force\u2014I could exert by following out my first idea\".\nIn a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform, and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.\nWriting history.\nBy mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales of \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" were falling off, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with their fifth child. Matters worsened when Chapman &amp; Hall, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by \u00a350 if sales dropped further. He began \"A Christmas Carol\" in October 1843. Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being \"written at white heat\"; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December. He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of around London. Dickens's sister-in-law wrote how he \"wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition\". Slater says that \"A Christmas Carol\" was\nintended to open its readers' hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence, but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor.\nGeorge Cruikshank, the illustrator who had earlier worked with Dickens on \"Sketches by Boz\" (1836) and \"Oliver Twist\" (1838), introduced him to the caricaturist John Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work on \"A Christmas Carol\", and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text. Dickens's hand-written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph \"...\u00a0and to Tiny Tim, who did \"not\" die\"; this was added later, during the printing process.\nCharacters.\nThe central character of \"A Christmas Carol\" is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based businessman, described in the story as \"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\" Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale\u2014one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man. The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty \"is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself\"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.\nScrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentric John Elwes, MP, or Jemmy Wood, the owner of the Gloucester Old Bank and also known as \"The Gloucester Miser\". According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge's views on the poor are a reflection of those of the demographer and political economist Thomas Malthus, while the miser's questions \"Are there no prisons?\u00a0... And the Union workhouses?\u00a0... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\" are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the philosopher Thomas Carlyle, \"Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?\"\nThere are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens's own works. Peter Ackroyd, Dickens's biographer, sees similarities between the character and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is \"a more fantastic image\" than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit's transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser. Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from \"The Pickwick Papers\" was also an influence when creating Scrooge. It is possible that Scrooge's name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man\u2014a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as \"mean man\". This theory has been described as \"a probable Dickens hoax\" for which \"[n]o one could find any corroborating evidence\".\nWhen Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign \"Goodge and Marney\", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner. For the chained Marley, Dickens drew on his memory of a visit to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw\u2014and was affected by seeing\u2014fettered prisoners. For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time \"A Christmas Carol\" was written. The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present, were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged school in the East End of London.\nThemes.\nThe transformation of Scrooge is central to the story. Davis considers Scrooge to be \"a protean figure always in process of reformation\"; Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who \"possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities\". Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running through \"A Christmas Carol\", and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption. Dickens's biographer, Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that \"even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man\". Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex; he based his beliefs and principles on the New Testament. His statement that Marley \"had no bowels\" is a reference to the \"bowels of compassion\" mentioned in the First Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation.\nOther writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a \"secular vision of this sacred holiday\". The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that \"A Christmas Carol\" shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to his friend John Forster as his \"\"Carol\" philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper\u00a0... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside\". From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge's redemption underscores \"the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects\" of Dickens's \"\"Carol\" philosophy\" of charity and altruism.\nDickens wrote \"A Christmas Carol\" in response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularly child poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children\u2014personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers\u2014as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle-class readership.\nPublication.\nAs the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of \"Martin Chuzzlewit\", Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Production of \"A Christmas Carol\" was not without problems. The first printing was meant to have festive green endpapers, but they came out a dull olive colour. Dickens's publisher Chapman and Hall replaced these with yellow endpapers and reworked the title page in harmonising red and blue shades. The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843. Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red Morocco leather and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.\nPriced at five shillings (), the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844. By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print. It was Dickens's most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.\nThe high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only \u00a3230 () rather than the \u00a31,000 () he expected. A year later, the profits were only \u00a3744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.\nReception.\nAccording to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews of \"A Christmas Carol\" \"were almost uniformly kind\". \"The Illustrated London News\" described how the story's \"impressive eloquence\u00a0... its unfeigned lightness of heart\u2014its playful and sparkling humour\u00a0... its gentle spirit of humanity\" all put the reader \"in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author\". The critic from \"The Athenaeum\", the literary magazine, considered it a \"tale to make the reader laugh and cry\u00a0\u2013 to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable\u00a0... a dainty dish to set before a King.\" William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in \"Fraser's Magazine\", described the book as \"a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'\"\nThe poet Thomas Hood, in his own journal, wrote that \"If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease.\" The reviewer for \"Tait's Edinburgh Magazine\"\u2014Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work\u2014spoke well of \"A Christmas Carol\", noting it was \"a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good\". After Dickens's death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as \"a new gospel\", and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better. The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1844, \"Christian Remembrancer\" thought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos. The writer and social thinker John Ruskin told a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as \"mistletoe and pudding\u2014neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds\".\nThere were critics of the book. \"The New Monthly Magazine\" praised the story, but thought the book's physical excesses\u2014the gilt edges and expensive binding\u2014kept the price high, making it unavailable to the poor. The review recommended that the tale should be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly. An unnamed writer for \"The Westminster Review\" mocked Dickens's grasp of economics, asking \"Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get them\u2014for, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without\".\nDickens had criticised the US in \"American Notes\" and \"Martin Chuzzlewit\", making American readers reluctant to embrace his work, but by the end of the American Civil War, the book had gained wide recognition in American households. In 1863 \"The New York Times\" published an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the \"old Christmas\u00a0... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today\".\nAftermath.\nIn January 1844 Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold for twopence. Dickens wrote to his solicitor\nI have not the least doubt that if these Vagabonds can be stopped they must.\u00a0... Let us be the \"sledge-hammer\" in this, or I shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when I come out with a long story.\nTwo days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the basis of copyright infringement and won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay \u00a3700 in costs. The small profits Dickens earned from \"A Christmas Carol\" further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of Bradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.\nDickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories: \"The Chimes\" (1844), \"The Cricket on the Hearth\" (1845), \"The Battle of Life\" (1846) and \"The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain\" (1848); these were secular conversion tales which acknowledged the progressive societal changes of the previous year, and highlighted those social problems which still needed to be addressed. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.\nPerformances and adaptations.\nBy 1849 Dickens was engaged with \"David Copperfield\" and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book. He decided the best way to reach his audience with his \"Carol philosophy\" was by public readings. During Christmas 1853 he gave a reading in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute. He insisted that tickets be reserved for working-class attendees at quarter-price and the performance was a great success. Initially he donated the profits to good causes, although from 1858 he read the book for profit. He read the tale in an abbreviated version 127 times, until 1870 (the year of his death), including at his farewell performance. Each of his readings took three hours.\nIn the years following the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (\"Christmas Shadows\", 1850), Horatio Alger (\"Job Warner's Christmas\", 1863), Louisa May Alcott (\"A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True\", 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man\u00a0\u2013 or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong and needed to be corrected.\nThe novella was adapted for the stage almost immediately. Three productions opened on 5 February 1844, one by Edward Stirling, \"A Christmas Carol; or, Past, Present, and Future\", being sanctioned by Dickens and running for more than 40 nights. By the close of February 1844 eight rival \"A Christmas Carol\" theatrical productions were playing in London. The story has been adapted for film and television more than any of Dickens's other works. In 1901 it was produced as \"Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost\", a silent black-and-white British film; it was one of the first known adaptations of a Dickens work on film, but it is now largely lost. The story was adapted in 1923 for BBC radio. It has been adapted to other media, including opera, ballet, animation, stage musicals and a BBC mime production starring Marcel Marceau.\nDavis considers the adaptations have become better remembered than the original. Some of Dickens's scenes\u2014such as visiting the miners and lighthouse keepers\u2014have been forgotten by many, while other events often added\u2014such as Scrooge visiting the Cratchits on Christmas Day\u2014are now thought by many to be part of the original story. Accordingly, Davis distinguishes between the original text and the \"remembered version\".\nLegacy.\nThe phrase \"Merry Christmas\" had been around for many years\u2014the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534\u2014but Dickens's use of the phrase in \"A Christmas Carol\" popularised it among the Victorian public. The exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!\" entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or overly festive; the name \"Scrooge\" became used as a designation for a miser and was added to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" as such in 1982.\nIn the early 19th century the celebration of Christmas was associated in Britain with the countryside and peasant revels, disconnected to the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation taking place. Davis considers that in \"A Christmas Carol\", Dickens showed that Christmas could be celebrated in towns and cities, despite increasing modernisation. The modern observance of Christmas in English-speaking countries is largely the result of a Victorian-era revival of the holiday. The Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s had produced a resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with Christmastide and, with \"A Christmas Carol\", Dickens captured the zeitgeist while he reflected and reinforced his vision of Christmas.\nDickens advocated a humanitarian focus of the holiday, which influenced several aspects of Christmas that are still celebrated in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit. The historian Ronald Hutton writes that Dickens \"linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation\".\nThe novelist William Dean Howells, analysing several of Dickens's Christmas stories, including \"A Christmas Carol\", considered that by 1891 the \"pathos appears false and strained; the humor largely horseplay; the characters theatrical; the joviality pumped; the psychology commonplace; the sociology alone funny\". The writer James Joyce considered that Dickens took a childish approach with \"A Christmas Carol\", producing a gap between the na\u00efve optimism of the story and the realities of life at the time.\nRuth Glancy, the professor of English literature, states that the largest impact of \"A Christmas Carol\" was the influence felt by individual readers. In early 1844 \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens's novella; in 1874, Robert Louis Stevenson, after reading Dickens's Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need, and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book. In 1867 one American businessman was so moved by attending a reading that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey, while in the early years of the 20th century Maud of Wales\u2014the Queen of Norway\u2014sent gifts to London's crippled children signed \"With Tiny Tim's Love\". On the novella, the author G. K. Chesterton wrote \"The beauty and blessing of the story\u00a0... lie in the great furnace of real happiness that glows through Scrooge and everything around him.\u00a0... Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge, they convert us.\"\nAnalysing the changes made to adaptations over time, Davis sees changes to the focus of the story and its characters to reflect mainstream thinking of the period. While Dickens's Victorian audiences would have viewed the tale as a spiritual but secular parable, in the early 20th century it became a children's story, read by parents who remembered their parents reading it when they were younger. In the lead-up to and during the Great Depression, Davis suggests that while some saw the story as a \"denunciation of capitalism,\u00a0...most read it as a way to escape oppressive economic realities\". The film versions of the 1930s were different in the UK and US. British-made films showed a traditional telling of the story, while US-made works showed Cratchit in a more central role, escaping the depression caused by European bankers and celebrating what Davis calls \"the Christmas of the common man\". In the 1960s, Scrooge was sometimes portrayed as a Freudian figure wrestling with his past. By the 1980s he was again set in a world of depression and economic uncertainty.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOnline resources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNewspapers, journals and magazines.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73672", "revid": "125972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73672", "title": "Wismar", "text": "Wismar (; ), officially the Hanseatic City of Wismar () is, with around 43,000 inhabitants, the sixth-largest city of the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and the fourth-largest city of Mecklenburg after Rostock, Schwerin and Neubrandenburg. The city was the third-largest port city in former East Germany after Rostock and Stralsund.\nWismar is located on the Bay of Wismar of the Baltic Sea, directly opposite the island of Poel, that separates the Bay of Wismar from the larger Bay of Mecklenburg. The city lies in the middle between the two larger port cities of L\u00fcbeck in the west, and Rostock in the east, and the state capital of Schwerin is located south of the city on Lake Schwerin. Wismar lies in the northeastern corner of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, and is the capital of the district of Northwestern Mecklenburg. The city's natural harbour is protected by a promontory. The uninhabited island of Walfisch, lying between Wismar and the island of Poel, administratively belongs to the borough of Wismar-Wendorf.\nIt is estimated that Wismar was founded in 1226 under Henry Borwin I, Lord of Mecklenburg from the House of Mecklenburg, a German dynasty of Slavic origin also known as the Obotrites or Niklotides. In 1259, the city became part of the Hanseatic League. Throughout its history, the city has been under control of various German states as well as the Swedish Empire. It was part of Sweden from 1648 until 1803 ( until 1903, when Sweden officially renounced its claims to the city), and this Swedish chapter of the city is celebrated annually with a large \"Sweden Celebration\". From 1815 until 1918, Wismar lay in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and later in the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\nWismar is a typical representative of the Hanseatic League with its city-wide Brick Gothic structures and iconic gabled patrician houses and was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List alongside the historical old town of Stralsund in 2002. Wismar is the seat of , a university of applied sciences, one of nine institutions of higher education in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. With MV Werften Wismar, the city is one of three cruise ship-producing locations of MV Werften (along with Rostock and Stralsund), and the shipyard with its tall white-blue hall is one of the city's largest employers. St. George's, St. Nicholas' and St. Mary's, of which only the tower is left standing, are the three iconic sacred buildings dominating the skyline of Wismar.\nHistory.\nThe name of the settlement was first recorded in the 12th century as Visemer, Wismar (1147, 1167), Wyssemaria (1229)https://\" \"and is probably of Slavic origin although finally disputed. Wismar could have the same Old Saxon origin like the German city Weimar.\" \"Wismar was part of the Western Slavic Obotrites' territory.\nThe exact date of the city's foundation is not clear. In the oldest existing document of Wismar from 1229, its civic rights are already established. In 1301 Wismar came under the rule of the House of Mecklenburg. In 1259 Wismar joined a defensive agreement with L\u00fcbeck and Rostock, in order to effectively counter the numerous Baltic pirates. Subsequently more cities of the northern Holy Roman Empire would agree to cooperate as commerce and trade was increasingly coordinated and regulated. These policies would provide the basis for the development of the Hanseatic League. By the 13th and 14th centuries Wismar had grown into a flourishing Hanseatic trading hub and an important center of wool processing. Although around 2,000 of its inhabitants perished during the plague of 1376, the town remained reasonably prosperous until the 16th century.\nUnder Swedish rule.\nWith the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 Wismar came under the territorial control of Sweden. Through the acquisition of Wismar and other dominions in the Holy Roman Empire, the Kings of Sweden in their role as imperial princes were entitled to a seat in the Imperial Diet. Wismar became administrative center of Wismar town and the districts of Pod and Neukloster, and after 1653 the \"F\u00fcrstenhof\" (prince's court) served as the seat of the supreme court for all Swedish dominions in the Holy Roman Empire. Wismar's fortifications were extended into an effective all-round defence system under the supervision of Field Marshal Erik Dahlbergh. Remains of these fortifications have been preserved, among other places, in the \u2018Lindengarten' to the east of the wall of the old city. During the Scanian War, the town was besieged and captured by Danish forces in 1675.\nIn 1803, Sweden ceded both the town and lordship to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin for 1,258,000 Riksdalers, but reserved the right of redemption after 100 years. In view of this contingent right of Sweden, Wismar was not represented at the diet of Mecklenburg-Schwerin until 1897. In 1903, Sweden finally renounced its claims to the town. Wismar still retains a few relics of its old privileges, including the right to fly its own flag.\n20th century.\nBy the end of the 19th century Wismar's most important manufacturing branches were the production of iron and steel, roofing-felt, asphalt, paper and machine industry. International sea trade took place at the local harbour, which was deep enough to admit vessels of up to draught at its quays. Exports included grains, oil-seeds and butter as coal, timber and iron were imported. Wismar was production site for several railroad rolling stock manufacturers and since 1933 home to \"Norddeutsche Dornier-Werke\" of aircraft manufacturer Dornier. On 14 May 1881 Rudolph Karstadt opened his first shop (\"Tuch-, Manufaktur- und Konfektionsgesch\u00e4ft\") of the now well established department store chain Karstadt in Wismar.\nDuring World War II, it was the location of a forced labour subcamp of the Nazi prison in B\u00fctzow-Dreibergen. Wismar was heavily bombed and destroyed by Allied air raids. As the line of contact between Soviet and other Allied armies formed in Europe at the end of the war, Wismar was captured by the British 6th Airborne Division's 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion on 2 May 1945, James Hill commanding, in accordance with Operation Eclipse. On 7 May 1945 British Field Marshal Montgomery and Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky met in Wismar. In accord with the \"Occupation Zone Agreements\" of the Yalta Conference Wismar became a part of the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany on 1 July 1945, as British troops retreated and Soviet troops took control over the area.\nDuring the 1949 to 1990 era of the German Democratic Republic, Wismar became East Germany's second-largest port, after Rostock and developed a shipbuilding industry. Although the GDR government had pledged to restore the local churches and historic sites that had been heavily bombed during the war, this commitment was for the most part not fulfilled.\nAfter German reunification in 1990, churches and all historic buildings in the city's town center were restored, and the old towns of Wismar and Stralsund (c. to the east), were listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2011, Wismar became the capital of the district of Nordwestmecklenburg.\nSights and architecture.\nThe historic old town, centered on the huge marketplace (one of the largest in northern Germany at ), is characterized by town houses, manufacture and trading structures of the Hanseatic League, built in Brick Gothic style during the 13th to 15th centuries, 19th-century Romanesque Revival architecture and Art Nouveau houses. Distinctive buildings and military works, built during the period of Swedish control during the 17th and the 18th centuries provide another layer of cultural influence.\nThe market square's focal point is the \"Wasserkunst\", an elaborate wrought-iron fountain imported from Holland in 1602. The northern side of the square is occupied by the Town Hall, built in Neoclassical style from 1817 to 1819. Another notable building on the square is a Brick Gothic patrician's home (\"B\u00fcrgerhaus\") called \"Alter Schwede\" (Old Swede), erected around 1380.\nSt. George's Church, the third so-named edifice on the site, dates from 1404. It had escaped major damage during most of World War II, but on 14 April 1945, three weeks before the end of the war it was badly damaged by \"Blockbuster bombs\" dropped by the British Royal Air Force. Reconstruction after German reunification, costing some 40 million Euros, was completed in 2010.\nThe tower church of St. Mary's Church (\"Marienkirche\") is the only remainder of the original Brick Gothic edifice, built during the first half of the 13th century. It suffered heavy damage in World War II and was partially razed in 1960 during the East German era.\nSt. Mary's Church and the church of St. Nicholas (\"Nikolaikirche\") with its very lofty vaulting, built from 1381 to 1460, serve as prime examples of L\u00fcbeck's St. Mary's Churches architectural influence on the entire region.\nThe \"F\u00fcrstenhof\", a richly decorated specimen of early Italian Renaissance style was once a ducal residence and served later as the seat of the municipal authorities. Built from 1552 to 1565, it was restored from 1877 to 1879. The \"Old School\", dating from about 1300, has not been restored yet. The town hall, rebuilt in 1829, houses a gallery of paintings. The Fine Arts Municipal Gallery \"Baumhaus\" is located in the old harbour area.\nTransport.\nThe nearest major airport is Hamburg Airport, located to the south east of Wismar.\nEconomy.\nNordic Yards Wismar is a shipbuilder located in Wismar and shipbuilding has existed since 1946 at the site.\nIn cinema.\nThe 1922 vampire film \"\" (\"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror\") was set and partially shot in Wismar (renamed \"Wisborg\" in the film). A take from the Marienkirche's (Saint Mary's Church) tower over Wismar marketplace with the Wasserkunst Wismar (waterworks fountain) served as the establishing shot for the Wisborg scene. Other locations included the \"Wassertor\" (Water Gate), the southside of St. Nicholas, the \"Heilig-Geist-Kirche\" (Holy-Spirit-Church) and the harbour area.\nIn later decades, Wismar retained its association with \"Nosferatu\". The setting of Wismar was reused in Werner Herzog's 1979 remake of the film, \"Nosferatu, Phantom der Nacht\"; unable to film in the town, however, Herzog relocated his production to the cities of Delft and Schiedam in the Netherlands. The 2000 metafiction horror film \"Shadow of the Vampire\", which depicts the filming of the 1922 silent film, also takes place in Wismar.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nWismar is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn addition, since 1991 there is a friendship with Halden in Norway.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers, all of which come from imagination, fearlessness, and the electromagnetic spectrum of emotional willpower. The characters are typically depicted as members of the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic law enforcement agency.\nThe first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 by Martin Nodell with scripting or co-scripting of the first stories by Bill Finger during the Golden Age of Comic Books and usually fought common criminals in Capitol City (and later, Gotham City) with the aid of his magic ring. For the Silver Age of Comic Books, John Broome and Gil Kane reinvented the character as Hal Jordan in 1959 and introduced the Green Lantern Corps, shifting the nature of the character from fantasy to science fiction. During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams introduced John Stewart, a new member of the Corps who was one of DC's first Black superheroes. Other notable Green Lanterns include Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz and Jo Mullein.\nThe Green Lanterns are among DC Comics' longest lasting sets of characters. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures.\nPublication history.\nGolden Age.\nMartin Nodell (initially using the pen-name Mart Dellon) created the first Green Lantern in collaboration with Bill Finger. He first appeared in the Golden Age of Comic Books in \"All-American Comics\" #16 (July 1940), published by All-American Publications, one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics.\nThis Green Lantern's real name was Alan Scott, a railroad engineer who, after a railway crash, came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power. From this, he crafted a magic ring that gave him a wide variety of powers. The limitations of the ring were that it had to be \"charged\" every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood. Alan Scott fought mostly ordinary human villains, but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal Vandal Savage and the zombie Solomon Grundy. Most stories took place in New York. Green Lantern rings are made from magic.\nAs a popular character in the 1940s, the Green Lantern featured both in anthology books such as \"All-American Comics\" and \"Comic Cavalcade\", as well as his own book, \"Green Lantern\". He also appeared in \"All Star Comics\" as a member of the superhero team known as the Justice Society of America.\nAfter World War II the popularity of superheroes in general declined. The \"Green Lantern\" comic book was cancelled with issue #38 (May\u2013June 1949), and \"All Star Comics\" #57 (1951) was the character's last Golden Age appearance. When superheroes came back in fashion in later decades, the character Alan Scott was revived, but he was forever marginalized by the new Hal Jordan character who had been created to supplant him (see below). Initially, he made guest appearances in other superheroes' books, but eventually got regular roles in books featuring the Justice Society. He never got another solo series, although he did star in individual stories and in the single-issue 2002 comic book \"Brightest Day, Blackest Night.\" Between 1995 and 2003, DC Comics changed Alan Scott's superhero codename to \"Sentinel\" in order to distinguish him from the newer and more popular science fictional Green Lanterns.\nIn 2011, the Alan Scott character was revamped. His costume was redesigned to be all green and the source of his powers was changed to that of the mystical power of nature (referred to in the stories as \"the Green\").\nSilver Age.\nIn 1959, Julius Schwartz reinvented the Green Lantern character as a science fiction hero named Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan's powers were more or less the same as Alan Scott's, but otherwise this character was completely different from the Green Lantern character of the 1940s. He had a new name, a redesigned costume, and a rewritten origin story. Hal Jordan received his ring from a dying alien and was commissioned as an officer of the Green Lantern Corps, an interstellar law enforcement agency overseen by the Guardians of the Universe.\nHal Jordan was introduced in \"Showcase\" #22 (September\u2013October 1959). Gil Kane and Sid Greene were the art team most notable on the title in its early years, along with writer John Broome. His initial physical appearance, according to Kane, was patterned after his one-time neighbor, actor Paul Newman.\nLater developments.\nWith issue #76 (April 1970), the series made a radical stylistic departure. Editor Schwartz, in one of the company's earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy, worked with the writer-artist team of Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams to spark new interest in the comic book series and address a perceived need for social relevance. They added the character Green Arrow (with the cover, but not the official name, retitled \"Green Lantern Co-Starring Green Arrow\") and had the pair travel through America encountering \"real world\" issues, to which they reacted in different ways \u2014 Green Lantern as fundamentally a lawman, Green Arrow as a liberal iconoclast. Additionally during this run, the groundbreaking \"Snowbirds Don't Fly\" story was published (issues #85\u201386) in which Green Arrow's teen sidekick Speedy (the later grown-up hero Red Arrow) developed a heroin addiction that he was forcibly made to quit. The stories were critically acclaimed, with publications such as \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"Newsweek\" citing it as an example of how comic books were \"growing up\". However, the O'Neil/Adams run was not a commercial success, and the series was cancelled after only 14 issues, though an additional unpublished three installments were finally published as back-ups in \"The Flash\" #217\u2013219.\nThe title saw a number of revivals and cancellations. It changed to \"Green Lantern Corps\" at one point as the popularity rose and waned. During a time there were two regular titles, each with a Green Lantern, and a third member in the Justice League. A new character, Kyle Rayner, was created to become the feature while Hal Jordan first became the villain Parallax, then died and came back as the Spectre.\nIn the wake of ', writer Geoff Johns returned Hal Jordan as Green Lantern in ' (2004\u201305). Johns began to lay the groundwork for \"Blackest Night\" (released July 13, 2010)), viewing it as the third part of the trilogy started by \"Rebirth\". Expanding on the Green Lantern mythology in the second part, \"Sinestro Corps War\" (2007), Johns, with artist Ethan van Sciver, found wide critical acclaim and commercial success with the series, which promised the introduction of a spectrum of colored \"lanterns\".\nAwards.\nThe series and its creators have received several awards over the years, including the 1961 Alley Award for Best Adventure Hero/Heroine with Own Book and the Academy of Comic Book Arts Shazam Award for Best Continuing Feature in 1970, for Best Individual Story (\"No Evil Shall Escape My Sight\", \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #76 by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams), and in 1971 for Best Individual Story (\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\", \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #85 by O'Neil and Adams).\nWriter O'Neil received the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on \"Green Lantern\", \"Batman\", \"Superman\" and other titles, while artist Adams received the Shazam for Best Artist (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on \"Green Lantern\" and \"Batman\". Inker Dick Giordano received the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) for his work on \"Green Lantern\" and other titles.\nIn Judd Winick's first regular writing assignment on Green Lantern, he wrote a storyline in which an assistant of Kyle Rayner's emerged as a gay character in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 3) #137 (June 2001). In \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 3) #154 (November 2001) the story entitled \"Hate Crime\" gained media recognition when his friend Terry Berg was brutally beaten in a homophobic attack. Winick was interviewed on Phil Donahue's show on MSNBC for that storyline on August 15, 2002 and received two GLAAD Media Awards for his Green Lantern work.\nIn May 2011, Green Lantern placed 7th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time.\nLegal disputes.\nDC Comics has been involved in two disputes concerning Green Lantern trade marks before the United States Patent and Trade Mark Office, the first in 2012 and the second in 2016.\nPowers and abilities.\nEach Green Lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of abilities. The ring is powered by willpower. The full extent of the ring's abilities has never been rigorously defined in the stories, but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all of its effects are accompanied by a green light.\nGreen Lantern Oath.\nIn issue #9 of the original Alan Scott \"Green Lantern\" comic book, scriptwriter Alfred Bester, best known as a major science fiction novelist of the 1950s (and one who had included rhymed couplets in his work) introduced the Green Lantern Oaths:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis oath was revived for the Hal Jordan version of the character. Alan Moore and Geoff Johns introduced variants. Oftentimes \"darkest night\" is changed to \"blackest night\", which inspired the name of the crossover event Blackest Night. In reference to the oath, the sequel to Blackest Night was called Brightest Day.\nIn other media.\nFilm.\nStandalone film.\nHal Jordan made his live-action debut in the 2011 film of the same name, portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. The film originally intended on launching a new DC Comics cinematic franchise with a sequel and an untitled Flash film, but due to the film's failure, nothing moved forward.\nDC Extended Universe.\nJohn Stewart was scheduled to appear in Zack Snyder's director cut of \"Justice League\", portrayed by Wayne T. Carr, but the scene was reworked with Martian Manhunter, portrayed by Harry Lennix, at the request of Warner Bros.\nTelevision.\nIn the live-action television series \"Stargirl\", Alan Scott's power battery is shown in a flashback to when the Injustice Society attacked the Justice Society of America's headquarters. JSA member Pat Dugan hid his power battery in his basement. In the second season, Alan Scott's daughter Jennie-Lynn Scott finds Alan's power battery and activates it. She absorbs the battery's energy and breaks it. She then leaves Blue Valley to find her missing brother Todd Rice.\nDC Universe.\nA live-action \"Green Lantern\" television series was announced to be in development at HBO Max set to feature the Alan Scott, Guy Gardner, Jessica Cruz, and Simon Baz versions of Green Lantern along with an original character Bree Jarta with Finn Wittrock and Jeremy Irvine portraying Gardner and Scott respectively. The series was planned to be set in multiple time periods focusing on a separate story for each of the Green Lanterns for that time. In October 2022, it was announced that the series had instead been extensively redeveloped into a solo project centered around John Stewart. In December 2022, sources claimed the series was scrapped, but James Gunn say the series is still in production. The series' title was revealed to be \"Lanterns\" in January 2023. The version with Berlanti was confirmed to have been cancelled, with this new series focusing on Stewart and Hal Jordan as part of DC Studios' new DC Universe. In October 2024, Kyle Chandler and Aaron Pierre were cast as the DCU's Jordan and Stewart. The series is scheduled to air on HBO in 2026.\nIn academic and journalistic jargon.\nSome political pundits and academic political scientists use the phrase \"Green Lanternism\" (or \"political Green Lanternism\") to refer to the common tendency to demand perfection or omnipotence from political leaders, and to blame actually unsolvable or inevitable problems on political leaders' alleged weakness or malice, as if political office-holders' powers and abilities, like Green Lantern's powers and abilities, were limited only by their personal strength of will.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many Scots dislike the term \"Scotch\" and some consider it offensive. The modern usage in Scotland is \"Scottish\" or \"Scots\", and the word \"Scotch\" is now only applied to specific products, mostly food or drink, such as Scotch whisky, Scotch pie and Scotch broth.\nThe verb \"to scotch\" is unrelated to the adjective. Middle English \"scocchen\" derives from Anglo-French \"escocher\" meaning \"to notch, nick or pierce\", from \"coche\", \"a notch, groove\".\nUsage.\nThe adjective or noun \"Scotch\" is an early modern English (16th century) contraction of the English word \"Scottish\" which was later adopted into the Scots language It more or less replaced \"Scottish\" as the prevailing term in England in the 17th century. The English playwright William Shakespeare used the word \"Scotch\" to describe a jig, but always employed the term \"Scottish\" when people were the subject. \"Scots\" (the modern Scots language form of early Scots \"Scottis\") predominated in Scotland until the 18th century when anglicisation became fashionable and \"Scotch\" came to be used in both England and Scotland. A 1788 letter by Robert Burns says in part: \"Apropos, is not the Scotch phrase \"Auld lang syne\" exceedingly expressive? There is an old song and tune which has often thrilled through my soul. You know I am an enthusiast in old Scotch songs.\" http://. Burns wrote of himself in 1787, \"The appellation of a Scotch Bard, is by far my highest pride; to continue to deserve it is my most exalted ambition.\"\nFrom the early 19th century, however, \"Scots\" or \"Scottish\" increasingly became the preferred usages among educated Scottish people, \"Scotch\" being regarded as an anglicised affectation. By 1908, this was described by \"The New York Times\" as a \"long-established\u2026 preference\" (https://). In modern usage in Scotland, \"Scotch\" is rarely used, other than as described in the following paragraph for certain articles; it has gathered patronising and faintly offensive connotations (\"frugal with one's money\").\nIn modern current British usage, in England as in Scotland, the general term for things from or pertaining to Scotland is \"Scottish\". \"Scots\" is used for the Scots language and Scots law, although one increasingly hears it used of people and organisations, especially in newspaper articles. \"Scotch\" remains in use in only a few specific cases. 'Scotch terrier' was once one of these legacy uses, but has increasingly been replaced with Scottish terrier. Only in Ulster, especially in County Donegal (chiefly in East Donegal and Inishowen) and County Tyrone (especially in rural West Tyrone), is the term \"Scotch\" still widely used.\nScotland was one of the first countries in the world to introduce compulsory education for all children in 1696, administered in each parish by the Kirk. When the British government eventually chose to centralise and regulate the system in 1872, the Scottish school system was initially placed under a \"Scotch Education Department\" with offices in London. In 1918, as a result of objections from within Scotland, the department was moved to Edinburgh and renamed the Scottish Education Department. This reflects the linguistic preferences of modern Scotland.\nIn 1965, the historian A.J.P. Taylor wrote in his \"Preface to English History 1914\u20131945\": \"Some inhabitants of Scotland now call themselves \"Scots\" and their affairs \"Scottish\". They are entitled to do so. The English word for both is \"Scotch\", just as we call les fran\u00e7ais the French and Deutschland Germany. Being English, I use it.\"\n\"Scots\" is the modern preferred usage in all levels of society in Scotland, but occasional use of \"Scotch\" in varieties of the Scots language continues with terms such as \"Scotch and English\" (a game), \"Scotch fiddle\" (itchiness), \"Scotch mile and ell\" (measures) and many other examples (see the Scots Dialect Dictionary compiled by Alexander Warrack M.A. (1911) republished by Waverley Books 2000). There are other good indicators that the use of \"Scotch\" has been \"whitewashed out\" and become a shibboleth. Early versions of dictionaries produced in Burns' wake in the 19th century had titles such as \"A Dictionary of the Scotch Dialect of the Lowlands\" and modern place names now written as \"Scots\" e.g., Scotstarvit and Scotscalder existed in previous incarnations as \"Scotch\". Scotch Corner survives as a place-name in England.\nIn a reminiscence on his early training as an advocate in Edinburgh, Sir Walter Scott describes the law as \"Scotch Law\" some four times and as \"Scots Law\" just once. By the 1840s, other writers were using the phrase \"Scots law\", and this usage is now standard (although not universal) world-wide. Scots law reports in the nineteenth century show frequent judicial usage of 'Scotch' as referring to people; by the turn of that century, and since, practically no examples (other than by English judges) can be discovered.\nIn 1978, the song \"Scotch Machine\" by the pan-European group Voyage was released in the UK as \"Scots Machine\".\nIn the 1937 film \"Storm in a Teacup\", the Scottish/Scotch debate is a running joke. In one scene, Vicky (Vivien Leigh) is mixing cocktails. She explains to Frank (Rex Harrison) that her father, Provost Gow (Cecil Parker), who is standing for Parliament as a member of the \"Caledonia League\", \"...wants to be prime minister of the first Scotch parliament.\" \"Scottish, Vicky, Scottish!\" her father pompously corrects her. \"Well then, fix yourself a scottish and soda!\" she replies, and flounces out of the door. In another scene, one of Gow's Caledonia League minions says to him \"I've never seen the like in thirty years of Scotch politics!\", with the same stern rebuke from the provost.\nIn the chorus of his song \"I Love a Lassie (My Scotch Bluebell)\", music hall comedian and singer Sir Harry Lauder sings \"I love a lassie, a bonny hielan lassie... Mary ma Scotch bluebell.\"\nAll editions of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1887 collection of essays \"Memories and Portraits\" use \"Scotch\" as both an adjective and noun throughout. \nThe first edition of John Kenneth Galbraith's \"The Scotch\" was published in the UK under two alternative titles: as \"Made to Last\" and \"The Non-potable Scotch: A Memoir of the Clansmen in Canada\". It was illustrated by Samuel H. Bryant. Galbraith's account of his boyhood environment in Elgin County in southern Ontario was added in 1963. He considered it his finest piece of writing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is situated on the river Hase in a valley penned between the Wiehen Hills and the northern tip of the Teutoburg Forest. With a population of 168,145 Osnabr\u00fcck is the fourth largest city in Lower Saxony. \nMore recently Osnabr\u00fcck has become well known for its industry. Numerous companies in the automobile, paper, steel and grocery sectors are located in the city and its surrounding area.&lt;ref name=\"Staedtereport_Osnabrueck_okt_2009.pdf (application/pdf-Objekt)\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the massive destruction inflicted on the city during World War II, the Altstadt (old town) was eventually reconstructed extensively with designs loyal to the original medieval architecture there. Osnabr\u00fcck was also the home of the largest British garrison outside the United Kingdom. Osnabr\u00fcck's modern, urban image is enhanced by the presence of more than 22,000 students studying at the University and the University of Applied Sciences. Although part of the state of Lower Saxony, historically, culturally and linguistically Osnabr\u00fcck is considered part of the region of Westphalia.\nName.\nThe origin of the name Osnabr\u00fcck is disputed. The suffix \"-br\u00fcck\" suggests a bridge over or to something (from German \"Br\u00fccke\" = bridge) but the prefix \"Osna-\" is explained in at least two different ways: the traditional explanation is that today's name is a corruption of \"Ossenbr\u00fcgge\" (westphalian meaning \"oxen bridge\"), which is etymologically and historically impossible, because the town is older than this corruption of consonants (documented in 13th century, Osnabr\u00fcck was founded in 8th century), but others state that it is derived from the name of the \"Hase\" River which is arguably derived from \"Asen\" (\u00c6sir), thus giving Osnabr\u00fcck the meaning \"bridge to the gods\", and previously Tacitus named people living near the grey river (Hase) Chasuarii. It may also be noted that Osnabr\u00fcck is situated on the northern end of the Teutoburg Forest, which until the 19th century was known as the Osning.\nThe city gave its name to the textile fabric of osnaburg.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedieval.\nOsnabr\u00fcck initially developed as a marketplace next to the bishopric founded by Charlemagne, King of the Franks, in 780. Some time prior to 803, the city became the seat of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck. Although the precise date is uncertain, it is likely that Osnabr\u00fcck is the oldest bishopric in Lower Saxony.\nIn the year 804 Charlemagne was said to have founded the Gymnasium Carolinum in Osnabr\u00fcck. This would make it the oldest German Gymnasium school, but the charter date is disputed by historians, some of whom believe it could be a forgery.\nIn 889 the town was given merchant, customs, and coinage privileges by King Arnulf of Carinthia. Osnabr\u00fcck was first referred to in records as a \"city\" in 1147. A decade later, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa granted the city fortification privileges (\"Befestigungsrecht\"). Most of the towers which were part of the original fortifications are still visible in the city. Osnabr\u00fcck became a member of the Hanseatic League in the 12th century, as well as a member of the Westphalian Federation of Cities.\nThe history of the town in the later Middle Ages was recorded in a chronicle by Albert Suho, one of Osnabr\u00fcck's most important clerics in the 15th century.\nEarly Modern age.\nFrom 1561 to 1639 there was a considerable amount of social unrest and tension in Osnabr\u00fcck due to the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War and also witch hunting. In 1582, during the rule of Mayor Hammacher (1565\u20131588), 163 women were executed as alleged witches; most of them were burned alive. In total, 276 women were executed, along with 2 men who had been charged with wizardry.\nThe first Lutheran services were held in Osnabr\u00fcck in 1543. Over the next century, Lutheranism expanded in the city and several Protestant bishops were elected. However, the Catholic churches continued to operate, and the city never became completely Lutheran. After the Thirty Years' War broke out, a Catholic bishop was elected in 1623, and the city was occupied by troops of the Catholic League in 1628. The Gymnasium Carolinum was upgraded to a Jesuit university in 1632, but the university was closed a year later when the city was taken by Swedish troops and restored to Protestant control.\nPeace negotiations took place in Osnabr\u00fcck and the nearby city of M\u00fcnster from 1643 to 1648. The twin Treaties of Osnabr\u00fcck and M\u00fcnster, collectively known as the Peace of Westphalia, ended the Thirty Years' War. Osnabr\u00fcck was officially recognized as bi-confessional Catholic and Lutheran. The prince-bishopric would be held alternately by a Catholic bishop and a Lutheran bishop. The Protestant bishop would be selected from the descendants of the Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, with priority given to the cadets of what became the House of Hanover. From 1667, prince-bishop Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, built the new baroque palace. His son, George I of Great Britain, died in the palace, at the time residence of his younger brother, prince-bishop Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany, on a travel on 11 June 1727.\nIn the early 18th century, renowned local jurist and social theorist Justus M\u00f6ser wrote a highly influential constitutional history of the town, the \"Osnabr\u00fccker Geschichte\". Following the Seven Years' War, the town's population fell below 6,000, however an economic revival linked to the linen and tobacco industries caused it to rise again from the 1780s onwards.\n19th century.\nThe French Revolutionary Wars brought Prussian troops into the city in 1795, followed by the French in 1803. As a result, the town's population was kept below 10,000 for the whole first decade of the 19th century. The Napoleonic period saw possession of the city change hands several times. Control of Osnabr\u00fcck passed to the Electorate of Hanover in 1803 during the German Mediatisation, and then briefly to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1806. From 1807 to 1810 the city was part of the Kingdom of Westphalia, after which it passed to the First French Empire. After 1815, it became part of the Kingdom of Hanover.\nThe town's first railway line was built in 1855, connecting it with L\u00f6hne. Further rail connections appeared over the following decades, connecting Osnabr\u00fcck with Emden from 1856, Cologne from 1871 and Hamburg from 1874. In 1866, Osnabr\u00fcck was annexed by Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War and administered as part of the Province of Hanover. Growth of the local economy and population was fuelled by expansion in the engineering and textile industries, with the Hammersen Weaving Mill established in 1869 and the \"Osnabr\u00fccker Kupfer- und Drahtwerk\" metallurgical firm following in 1873. The later 19th century also saw growth in the number of schools and the arrival of electricity and modern sanitation.\n20th century.\nBy 1914, Osnabr\u00fcck had over 70,000 inhabitants. The outbreak of the First World War necessitated food rationing; the Allied blockade and a harsh winter in 1917 led to further shortages. Following Germany's defeat in 1918, a council made up of workers and soldiers took control during the November Revolution, but were replaced by the new Weimar Republic the following year. Similarly to many other German cities, Osnabr\u00fcck experienced considerable inflation and unemployment in the 1920s, with over 2,000 out of work by 1923 and nearly 14,000 receiving some form of government assistance by 1928.\nPolitically, Osnabr\u00fcck in the 1920s was a stronghold of support for the Social Democrats and the Catholic Centre Party. However, in the Reichstag elections of September 1930, the Nazi Party received the greatest percentage of votes in the city (nearly 28%) \u2013 a more than seven-fold increase from their electoral performance in Osnabr\u00fcck two years prior. During the campaigns prior to the two federal elections in 1932, both Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels made well-attended speeches in the city.\nFollowing the Nazis' seizure of power in January 1933, Osnabr\u00fcck was subjected to the implementation of National Socialist economic, political, and social programmes. These resulted in economic growth for ethnic Germans who did not run afoul of the new regime, and the town went from having over 10,000 unemployed in early 1933 to actually having a labour shortage five years later. However, dissenters, supporters of opposition parties and German Jews (who had experienced centuries of discrimination in the city) did not share in this growth and found themselves discriminated against, imprisoned or forced to close their businesses and leave town. During World War II, both Jews and Romani people were deported to concentration camps and extermination camps en masse. In October 1942, a subcamp of the 2nd SS construction brigade (forced labour camp) in Bremen was established in Osnabr\u00fcck. 86 of the 250 prisoners died of starvation and maltreatment before the subcamp's dissolution in May 1943. Osnabr\u00fcck was also the location of the Oflag VI-C and Oflag 66 prisoner-of-war camps for Serbian, French and Belgian officers.\nThe war ended for Osnabr\u00fcck on 4 April 1945, when the XVII Corps of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's Second Army entered the city with little resistance. By this time, the city had been extensively bombed and required major reconstructive programmes following the war's end. Leading Nazis fled the city and the British appointed a new mayor, Johannes Petermann. However, during the allied occupation of Germany a British military governor, Colonel Geoffrey Day was placed in charge of administering the city. Relations between the occupiers and the citizens of Osnabr\u00fcck were generally peaceful, though tensions existed; some minor fights broke out between British soldiers and local youths and some Osnabr\u00fcckers resented the relationships that developed between the occupiers and local women. Additionally, the British took over more than seventy homes for their own use by the middle of 1946. Amidst shortages, the black market thrived and became one of the main focuses of police activity.\nAfter World War II West Germany realigned its states; Osnabr\u00fcck became part of the new state of Lower Saxony in 1946. The British continued to maintain Osnabr\u00fcck Garrison, a garrison near the city, which at one point was the largest British garrison in the world, housing some 4,000 troops and employing around 500 local civilians. It was the target of a PIRA attack in 1996. Due to budget cuts, the troops were withdrawn in 2008 and the property returned to the local government.\nAfter three centuries, the city finally obtained its university when the government of Lower Saxony established the University of Osnabr\u00fcck in 1974.\nLargest foreign resident groups in Osnabr\u00fcck as of 2017[ [update]]:\nClimate.\nThe climate is \"Cfb\" (near \"Dfb\") with warm, rainy summers and chilly to cold, dark winters.\nEducation.\nThere are two higher education institutions in Osnabr\u00fcck, University of Osnabr\u00fcck and Osnabr\u00fcck University of Applied Sciences with more than 25,000 students. All of the types of German grammar schools are represented in the city, including seven Gymnasien. Gymnasium Carolinum claims to be the oldest still existing school in Germany. Another well-known Gymnasium is the Ursulaschule, a private school, located directly opposite the Carolinum. The University of Osnabr\u00fcck invested heavily in infrastructure to take on more students for the following years.\nOsnabr\u00fcck, Germany, offers several vocational schools (Berufsbildende Schulen, or BBS) that provide practical education and training across various fields. Here are some notable institutions\nSport.\nThe city's football team is VfL Osnabr\u00fcck, founded in 1899. Currently, the team plays in the 3. Bundesliga. Its basketball team was founded the same year.\nThe Schlosswallhalle has been home to the GiroLive Panthers Osnabr\u00fcck of the 1. Damen-Basketball-Bundesliga.\nPolitics.\nThe current mayor of Osnabr\u00fcck is Katharina P\u00f6tter (CDU), elected in September 2021.\nOsnabr\u00fcck is part of the electoral constituency Stadt Osnabr\u00fcck for elections to the Bundestag.\nTransport.\nThe city of Osnabr\u00fcck is connected by road to the A1, the A30 and the A33.\nIt shares its airport with M\u00fcnster.\nOsnabr\u00fcck Hauptbahnhof (central railway station) is an important rail travel hub. Travellers from the Netherlands heading to either Hamburg, Denmark, or Eastern Europe often have to change here.\nAn extensive bus network operated by the Stadtwerke Osnabr\u00fcck (public utility provider) provides public transport within the city and the surrounding region.https:// The central hub is situated on Neumarkt close to the main shopping street, roughly 10 minutes' walk from the railway station.\nDistricts.\nThe city is divided into 23 districts:\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nOsnabr\u00fcck is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwinning with Derby.\nPreviously Osnabr\u00fcck had made contact with the British authorities as early as 1948, hoping to find an English twin town and therefore achieve greater understanding with their former enemies in the Second World War. This attempt was unsuccessful and Osnabr\u00fcck did not actively consider the idea again for another quarter-century. The twinning agreement with Derby was signed on 17 February 1976. Every year since then the two cities have exchanged envoys. Derby also has a square named after Osnabr\u00fcck in honour of the twinning arrangement; this features an obelisk among other things.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These include the Mars Geyser Hopper spacecraft, a Discovery-class mission concept that would investigate the springtime carbon dioxide Martian geysers found in regions around the south pole of Mars, the Human Exploration using Real-time Robotic\nOperations (\"HERRO\") concept for telerobotic Mars exploration, and concepts for use of In-situ resource utilization for a Mars sample-return mission. In a 1993 paper, he suggested the use of a phased program of Mars exploration, with a series of incremental achievements leading up to human landings on Mars.\nNASA Institute for Advanced Concepts.\nLandis was a fellow of the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (\"NIAC\"), where he worked on a project investigating the use of laser- and particle-beam pushed sails for propulsion for interstellar flight. In 2002 Landis addressed the annual convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on the possibilities and challenges of interstellar travel in what was described as the \"first serious discussion of how mankind will one day set sail to the nearest star\". Dr. Landis said, \"This is the first meeting to really consider interstellar travel by humans. It is historic. We're going to the stars. There really isn't a choice in the long term.\" He went on to describe a star ship with a diamond sail, a few nanometres thick, powered by solar energy, which could achieve \"10 per cent of the speed of light\".\nHe was selected again as a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts fellow in 2012, with feasibility concept of a landsailing rover for Venus exploration, called Venus Landsailing Rover, and in 2015 was the science lead on a NIAC study to design a mission to Neptune's moon Triton.\nIn 2017, Landis's work was the subject of the book \"Land-Sailing Venus Rover With NASA Inventor Geoffrey Landis\", published by World Book as part of their \"Out of This World\" book series for ages 10\u201314+.\nAcademic positions.\nIn 2005\u20132006, he was named the Ronald E.

In 1958, Gumbel published a key book, \"Statistics of Extremes\", in which he derived and analyzed the probability distribution that is now known as the Gumbel distribution in his honor.\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, Gumbel was considered unusual and highly controversial in German academic circles for his vocal support of left-wing politics and pacifism, and his opposition to Fascism. His influential writings about the politically motivated Feme murders made the case that the Weimar Republic was corruptly anti-leftist and anti-republican. Gumbel publicly opposed the Nazi Party and, in 1932, he was one of the 33 prominent signers of the \"Urgent Call for Unity\".\nBiography.\nBorn to a prominent Jewish family in W\u00fcrttemberg, Gumbel graduated in mathematics from the University of Munich, completing his doctoral thesis on the topic of population statistics shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. After a short period of military service, he was discharged in 1915 on medical grounds and he joined the University of Berlin to work with the prominent Russian statistician Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz. From this time onwards he became much more politically active. He joined the Independent Social Democrat Party in 1917, and became a prominent member of the pacifist New Fatherland League which was later renamed the German League for Human Rights. In January 1918, Gumbel took up a position with the electronics company Telefunken, researching sound transmitter waves, and he continued his political activities with the support of one of the firm's founders, Georg Count von Arco, a prominent member of the human rights movement. In 1922, Gumbel became Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the University of Heidelberg, where he soon found that combining academic work with politics was much more controversial, resulting in protests by students and faculty members, who were mostly right-wing, and strong criticism in the right-wing press.\nAmong the Nazis' most-hated public intellectuals, Gumbel was forced out of his position in Heidelberg in 1932. He then moved to France, where he taught at the \u00c9cole libre des hautes \u00e9tudes in Paris, and in Lyon, as well as continuing his political activities and helping other refugees, until the German invasion of 1940. He then left Europe for the United States, where he taught at the New School for Social Research and Columbia University in New York City until his death in 1966.\nWhen he died of lung cancer in 1966, Gumbel's papers were made a part of \"The Emil J. Gumbel Collection, Political Papers of an Anti-Nazi Scholar in Weimar and Exile\". These papers include reels of microfilm that document his activities against the Nazis.\nInfluences.\nEmil Gumbel was strongly influenced from a young age by his uncle, Abraham Gumbel (1852-1930) with whom he had long conversations about political and social issues. The death of Abraham's son (Emil's cousin) in the First World War, is thought to have been a triggering factor in both Abraham and Emil's life-long commitment to pacifism.\nDuring his time at the University of Munich (1910-1914), Gumbel was taught mathematics, economics and the social sciences by eminent scholars known to have liberal political views, including Alfred Pringsheim and Lujo Brentano. He also studied actuarial science and gained insurance qualifications and work experience (including a summer job with a London insurance company), before completing his doctorate dissertation under the supervision of extraordinary professor of statistics Friedrich B\u00f6hm in July 1914.\nAt the University of Berlin (1915-1922), Gumbel became closely associated with Georg Friedrich Nicolai, whose pacifist book, \"The Biology of War\", was banned by the German Government. He also became acquainted with Albert Einstein, who was one of the founding members of the German League for Human Rights. Einstein was subsequently a strong supporter of Gumbel's professional career. Gumbel developed a deep professional bond with the prominent Russian statistician and economist Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, who considered Gumbel to be \"a gifted man [with an] uncommonly active mind\". His recommendation strongly influenced Gumbel's subsequent appointment to professor of mathematics at the University of Heidelberg in 1922.\nAfter the 1919 murder of prominent USPD member, Karl Liebknecht, who Gumbel greatly admired, there was strong criticism by journalist Kurt Tucholsky that the trial judge completely ignored evidence against the Nazi Brownshirts. Horrified, Gumbel ardently investigated many similar political murders that had occurred and published his findings in numerous publications and books, including \"Two Years of Murder\" in 1921, followed by \"Four Years of Political Murder\" in 1922, the deeply controversial \"Conspirators\" in 1924, \"The Armor of War of the Imperialistic States\" in 1928, which dealt with the causes of political murder, and \"Traitors fall victim to the Feme\" in 1929.\nGumbel was an admirer of the British intellectual and pacifist Bertrand Russell, though they never met. He translated some of Russell's work into German.\nFamily.\nIn 1930 Gumbel married Marieluise Czettritz, who he first met at the DLM offices in the mid-1920s. She had two sons from her previous marriage, and retained custody of the youngest, Harald. She died of cancer in 1952.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

And her talent for playing a variety of characters helped to promote later Mexican actresses in American cinema. She acted in popular Western films of the 1950s and 1960s. She was the first Latin American actress nominated for an Oscar, as Best Supporting Actress for her work in \"Broken Lance\" (1954), and was the first to win a Golden Globe Award, for her performance in \"High Noon\" (1952).\nLife and career.\n1924\u20131943: Childhood and early years.\nMar\u00eda Cristina Estela Marcela Jurado Garc\u00eda, known from early childhood as \"Katy\", was born on 16 January 1924, in Mexico City Mexico, the daughter of Luis Jurado Ochoa, a lawyer, and Vicenta Garc\u00eda, a singer. Jurado's younger brothers were Luis Ra\u00fal and \u00d3scar Sergio.\nHer mother was a singer who worked for the Mexican radio station XEW (the oldest radio station in Latin America). Her mother was sister of Mexican musician Belisario de Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda, author of popular Mexican songs such as \"Las Cuatro Milpas\". Jurado's cousin Emilio Portes Gil was President of Mexico (1928\u20131930).\nJurado lived her first years and studied at a school run by nuns in the Guadalupe Inn neighborhood of Mexico City. She later studied to be a bilingual secretary. She wanted to study law and become a lawyer. Her singular beauty drew attention since she was a teenager, and she was invited to work as an actress by producers and filmmakers, among them Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez (one of the most prominent Mexican filmmakers at that time) who offered her a role in his first movie \"The Isle of Passion\" (1941). Although her godfather was Mexican actor Pedro Armend\u00e1riz, her parents never gave their consent.\nAnother filmmaker interested in her was Mauricio de la Serna who offered her a role in the film \"No matar\u00e1s\" (1943). She signed the contract without authorization from her parents, and when they found out, they threatened to send her to a boarding school in Monterrey. Around this time, she met the aspiring actor V\u00edctor Vel\u00e1zquez and married him soon afterward. Her marriage was largely motivated by the desire to continue a career as an actress and to escape the yoke of her parents. Velazquez was the father of her children, Victor Hugo and Sandra. The marriage ended in 1943, shortly after Jurado began her film career.\n1943\u20131951: First Mexican films.\nJurado debuted as an actress in the Mexican film \"No matar\u00e1s\" (1943). From that moment on, her acting talent, but above all her exotic beauty and sensual appeal, gave her the opportunity to work in numerous films. She specialized in playing wicked and seductive women. Jurado said:\nShe appeared in 16 more films over the next seven years in what film historians have named the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. She acted with acclaimed Mexican film stars such as Pedro Infante, Sara Montiel, Pedro Armend\u00e1riz and others. In 1953, she starred in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's film \"El Bruto\", for which she received an Ariel Award for Best Supporting Actress, Mexico's equivalent of an Academy Award.\n1951\u20131968: Success in Hollywood.\nIn addition to acting, Jurado worked as a movie columnist, radio reporter, and bullfight critic to support her family. She was on assignment when filmmaker Budd Boetticher and actor John Wayne spotted her at a bullfight. Neither knew she was an actress. However, Boetticher, who was also a professional bullfighter, cast Jurado in his 1951 film \"Bullfighter and the Lady\", opposite Gilbert Roland, as the wife of an aging matador. She was not interested in working in American films but accepted because the film would be shot in Mexico. She had rudimentary English language skills and memorized and delivered her lines phonetically. Despite this limitation, her strong performance brought her to the attention of Hollywood producer Stanley Kramer, who cast her in the classic Western \"High Noon\" (1952), starring Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. Jurado learned to speak English for the role, studying and taking classes two hours per day for two months. She played saloon owner Helen Ram\u00edrez, former love of reluctant hero Cooper's Will Kane. She earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and gained notice in the American movie industry.\nFrom the success of the film, Jurado began working on numerous American films, most of them in the Western genre. In 1953, she had a role in \"San Antone\", directed by Joseph Kane and opposite Rod Cameron. In the same year, she had a role in \"Arrowhead\" with Charlton Heston and Jack Palance, playing an evil Comanche woman, the love interest of Heston's character.\nIn 1954, actress Dolores del R\u00edo was accused of being a communist sympathizer at the height of the McCarthy era, and the U.S. government refused permission for her to work in the film \"Broken Lance\", directed by Edward Dmytryk and where she was going to interpret Spencer Tracy's Comanche wife. Jurado was selected for the role despite the resistance of the studio because of her youth. After viewing footage of her scenes, studio executives were impressed. Her performance garnered an Academy Award nomination. Jurado was the first Latin American actress to compete for the Oscar.\nIn the same year, Jurado appeared with Kirk Douglas in the Henry Hathaway film \"The Racers\". In 1955, Jurado filmed \"Trial\", directed by Mark Robson, with Glenn Ford. It was a drama about a Mexican boy accused of raping a white girl, with Jurado playing the mother of the accused. For this role, she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. In the same year, she traveled to Italy for the filming of \"Trapeze\", directed by Carol Reed, with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis. On set, Jurado had severe friction with the film's other female star, actress Gina Lollobrigida.\nDespite the fact that she always stated that acting in the theater did not please her, in 1956, Jurado debuted on Broadway in the play \"The Best House in Naples\" (1956), by Eduardo de Filippo.\nIn 1956, she participated in the film \"Man from Del Rio\" (1956), opposite Anthony Quinn, one of the few Hollywood movies to have Mexican actors as main stars.

After marrying Ernest Borgnine, they founded their own production company called Sanvio Corp. The couple traveled to Italy where they partnered with the producer Dino de Laurentiis in \"Barabbas\" (where both acted with Anthony Quinn) and \"I briganti Italiani\", directed by Mario Camerini.\nIn 1961, Jurado returned to Mexico and filmed \"La Bandida\" (1962) where she shared credits with Pedro Armend\u00e1riz and the temperamental Mexican actress Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, with whom Jurado had friction on the set. Her stormy marriage with Borgnine ended in 1963. Depressed, Jurado returned to Mexico and established her residence in the city of Cuernavaca; however, she decided to alternate her work with films between Mexico and the United States.\nIn 1965, Jurado returned to Hollywood for the film \"Smoky\", directed by George Sherman, starring Fess Parker. In 1966, she played the mother of George Maharis's character in \"A Covenant with Death\". In 1968, she appeared in the film \"Stay Away, Joe\" in the role of the half-Apache stepmother of Elvis Presley's character.\n1970\u20132002: Later years.\nIn the next years, Jurado alternated her work between Hollywood and Mexico. In 1970, she filmed \"The Bridge in the Jungle\" opposite John Huston. In 1973, she appeared in \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\", directed by Sam Peckinpah.\nJurado received one of her better dramatic roles in the third of the three short stories comprising the Mexican film \"F\u00e9, Esperanza y Caridad\" (1973). Directed by Jorge Fons, Jurado was cast as a lower-class woman who suffers a series of bureaucratic abuses as she tries to claim the remains of her dead husband. For this performance, she won the Ariel Award for Best Actress, her second Silver Ariel Award of the Mexican Cinema. In the same year, Jurado starred on Broadway again in the Tennessee Williams play \"The Red Devil Battery Sign\" with Anthony Quinn and Claire Bloom.\nIn 1974, Jurado appeared in the American film \"Once Upon a Scoundrel\" (1974) opposite the comedian Zero Mostel. In 1975, she participated in the Mexican film \"Los alba\u00f1iles\", again directed by Jorge Fons. The film was awarded the Golden Bear of the Berlinale 1975. In 1976, she played the role of Chuchupe in the film \"Pantale\u00f3n y Las Visitadoras\", an adaptation of the novel \"Captain Pantoja and the Special Service\" by Mario Vargas Llosa, who also directed the film. However, the filming of this movie turned into a disaster due to the differences between Jurado and Vargas Llosa. Vargas Llosa fired Jurado from the film, and she sued him legally.\nIn 1978, she played a small role in the film \"The Children of Sanchez\", where she shares credits with Anthony Quinn and Dolores del R\u00edo. In 1980, Jurado filmed \"La Seducci\u00f3n\", directed by Arturo Ripstein, for which she was nominated for another Ariel Award for Best Actress.\nIn 1981, her son Victor Hugo died in an accident on a highway near Monterrey while she was filming a movie in Mexico City. This tragedy plunged her into a deep depression that she could never overcome and led her to abandon her acting career for a few years. In 1984, John Huston convinced her to resume her career as an actress. She acted in Huston's film \"Under the Volcano\". In the same year, she co-starred in the short-lived television series \"a.k.a. Pablo\", a sitcom with Paul Rodriguez.\nIn the 1990s, Jurado appeared in two Mexican telenovelas. In 1998, she completed a Spanish-language film for director Arturo Ripstein titled \"El Evangelio de las Maravillas\". She won her second Ariel Award for Best Supporting Actress for this role.\nJurado had a cameo in the film \"The Hi-Lo Country\" (1998) by Stephen Frears, who called her his \"lucky charm\" for his first Western.\nIn 2002, she made her final film appearance in \"Un secreto de Esperanza\". The film was released posthumously.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages.\nKaty Jurado was married twice. Her first husband was the Mexican actor Victor Vel\u00e1zquez (who was the stepfather of the popular Mexican actresses Tere and Lorena Vel\u00e1zquez). Her marriage was largely motivated by the desire to continue a career as an actress and to escape the yoke of her parents. Velazquez was the father of her children, a boy and a girl. The marriage ended in 1943, shortly after Jurado began her film career.\nHer second husband was the American actor Ernest Borgnine. Jurado and Borginine met when he was filming \"Vera Cruz\" (1954) in Mexico. Jurado affirms that from that moment Borgnine did not stop pursuing her. They were married on 31 December 1959. Jurado declared that her five years of courtship with Borgnine were the happiest of her life, but their relationship became complicated after they were married due to his uncontrollable jealousy. The temperament of both led to numerous violent confrontations, some of which were documented by the newspapers of the time. Jurado claimed to have suffered physical violence from Borgnine during their marriage. \nJurado and Borgnine divorced in 1963. After their divorce, Jurado fell into a severe depression that led her to consider suicide. It was for this reason that she decided to leave Hollywood and settle for the rest of her life in the city of Cuernavaca, in Mexico.\nOther relationships.\nEarly in her career in Hollywood, Jurado had affairs with film maker Budd Boetticher and actor Tyrone Power but her most famous relationship is the one she had with Marlon Brando. Brando was smitten with Jurado after seeing her in \"High Noon\". They met when Brando was in Mexico filming \"Viva Zapata!\" (1952). He was involved at the time with Movita Castaneda, and was having a parallel relationship with Rita Moreno. Brando told Joseph L. Mankiewicz that he was attracted to \"her enigmatic eyes, black as hell, pointing at you like fiery arrows\". Jurado commented:\nHowever, their first date became the beginning of an extended affair that lasted intermittently many years. In her maturity, Jurado affirmed that they maintained a \"loving friendship\", and that both even performed an Indian ritual in which they collected blood from their wrists.\nJurado also had a romantic relationship with the Western novelist Louis L'Amour. She said: \"I have love letters that he wrote me until the last day of his life. But we never match. Now I think I should have married that man.\" Jurado claimed to have been one of the people to find the body of Mexican actress Miroslava Stern after her suicide in 1955. According to Jurado, the picture that Stern had between her hands was of the Mexican comedian Cantinflas, but artistic manager Fanny Schatz exchanged the photo for one of the Spanish bullfighter Luis Miguel Domingu\u00edn.\nFamily.\nIn 1981, her son died in an accident on a highway near Monterrey. Jurado was filming a movie when she found out about the accident and professionally wrapped up the shoot after burying her son. This tragedy plunged her into a deep depression that she could never overcome and led her to abandon her acting career for a few years and also to take refuge in alcohol. She later said\nJurado claimed that it was the film maker John Huston who rescued her from depression and convinced her to resume her career in the movie \"Under the Volcano\". Jurado also claimed that, during the filming of the film, Huston confessed to having been in love with her.\nDeath.\nToward the end of her life, Jurado suffered from heart and lung ailments. She died of kidney failure and pulmonary disease on 5 July 2002 at the age of 78 at her home in Cuernavaca, Mexico. She was buried in Cuernavaca at the Pante\u00f3n de la Paz cemetery.\nLegacy.\nJurado has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7065 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to motion pictures.\nIn 1953, Jurado was captured in a portrait by Mexican artist Diego Rivera.\nIn 1992, she was honored with the Golden Boot Award for her notable contribution to the Western genre.\nIn 1998, Mexican singer-songwriter, Juan Gabriel, composed a song for her titled, \"Que rechula es Katy (What a beauty is Katy)\".\nShe was honored with a Google Doodle on 16 January 2018.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals for the Soviet Union. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a female gymnast with nine. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals for over 52 years, winning 14. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.\nEarly life.\nShe was born as Larisa Semyonovna Diriy in Kherson, Ukrainian SSR. Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator. Young Diriy-Latynina survived the occupation of Ukraine by the Nazi Germany in 1940s.\nShe first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. Her first gymnastics coach was Mykhailo Sotnychenko. In 1950 young Diriy-Latynina received her first sports degree (rozriad) and became a member of the Ukrainian students team at the All-Union gymnastics' competitions in Kazan. She graduated from high school in 1953 with a gold medal, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI), and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS under coaching of Oleksandr Mishakov. Her first notable success came at the 4th World Festival of Youth and Students in Bucharest where she won gold medals.

Hooft\" (), was born in Amsterdam as scion of the patrician Hooft family and son of burgemeester (mayor) Cornelis Hooft. He was also uncle to statesmen and burgomasters Cornelis and Andries de Graeff.\nIn 1598, in preparation for his career as a merchant, his father sent him to France and Italy, but Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft was more interested in art and was deeply impressed by the Italian Renaissance.\nIn 1609, he was appointed bailiff of Muiden and the Gooiland. He founded the Muiderkring, a literary society located at his home, the \"Muiderslot\", the castle of Muiden, in which he got to live due to his appointment as sheriff of Muiden. Among the members were the poets and playwrights Constantijn Huygens, Maria Tesselschade, G.A. Bredero and Joost van den Vondel, as well as the Portuguese singer Francisca Duarte. Hooft, Bredero, and Vondel were also founders of the First Nederduytsche Academy.\nWork.\nHooft was a prolific writer of plays, poems and letters, but from 1618 onwards he concentrated on writing a history of the Netherlands (\"Nederduytsche Histori\u00ebn\"), inspired by Roman historian Tacitus. His focus was primarily on the Eighty Years' War between the Netherlands and Spain and though he tried to be as impartial as possible, he did succeed.\nAs a poet, he was influenced by his Renaissance contemporaries in France and Italy.\nPresent-day legacy.\nIn present-day Amsterdam, Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft gives his name to P.C. Hooftstraat, the city's main destination for expensive designer clothes shopping. The south-western end of P. C. Hooftstraat runs into the city's main park, the Vondelpark, named for his friend Joost van den Vondel (see Life above). In many other Dutch cities, there are other streets named after Hooft, many of them also called P. C. Hooftstraat or Pieter C. Hooftstraat.\nIn 1947, 300 years after P.C. Hooft died in The Hague, a literary prize in his name was instituted by the Dutch government. An independent foundation annually awards the prize. Initially it was awarded for specific works, but in recent years it is awarded based on the entire collection of a writer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She remains the only gymnast, male or female, to have won an Olympic gold medal in each individual event. She was also the first gymnast to achieve a perfect 10 at a major competition in the post-1952 era. She held the record for the most individual gold medals (with 7) among all female athletes (not only gymnasts) in Olympic history as well until it was surpassed by swimmer Katie Ledecky in 2024 after 56 years.\nIn addition to her gymnastics success, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was known for her outspoken support of the Czechoslovak democratization movement and her opposition to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, she took this protest to the world stage by quietly looking down and away while the Soviet national anthem was played during the medal ceremonies for the balance beam and floor exercise event finals. While \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1's actions were applauded by her compatriots, they resulted in her becoming a \"persona non grata\" in the new regime.

Her first international title came the following year at the European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships where she won gold on the vault and silver on the balance beam. She first participated in the 1960 Summer Olympic Games, winning a silver medal with the Czechoslovak team, and then won bronze in the all around event at the 1961 European Championships. She fought for the all-around title at home in the 1962 World Championships, held off only by Larisa Latynina, and managed to win her first world title, in the vault. She did not compete at the 1963 European Championships in Paris.\nBetween 1964 and 1968, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 won 19 individual gold medals in major international competitions. In this period she remained undefeated in the all-around in major international competition. She is the only female gymnast ever to win every Olympic, World Championships and European Championships all-around title from one Olympiad to the next one. She was at her peak at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, winning the overall title and taking gold medals in the balance beam and the vault, in addition to another silver medal in the team event. At the 1966 World Championships, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 defended her vault title, winning a team gold \u2013 breaking the Soviet monopoly in that event \u2013 and became all-around world champion. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 dominated the 1965 and 1967 European Championships, taking all five individual titles and scoring two perfect scores of 10 in 1967. She is the only gymnast who has swept all five European individual golds twice.\nPrior to the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 lost her training facility due to the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. Instead, she used potato sacks as weights and logs as beams whilst training in the forests of Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains in northern Moravia. She was again dominant at the 1968 Summer Olympics, winning medals in all six events. She defended her all-around title and won additional gold medals on the floor, uneven bars and vault, as well as two silvers, for the team competition and balance beam. She won the 1968 Olympic all-around title with the highest recorded score up to that time. Her win by 1.4 points has remained the largest margin of victory in Olympics, World, World Cup, or European Championships for women in an all-around competition for 48 years. It was finally surpassed in 2016, ten years after a major rule change (the 2006 implementation of open ended scoring). As of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, she and Larisa Latynina are the only gymnasts to win the gold medal in individual all-around in consecutive Olympic games. She is also one of only two female gymnasts to defend gold medal in the vault apparatus. Her use of the \"Jarabe tapat\u00edo\" as the music for her floor routine and her subsequent marriage in the city made her immensely popular with the Mexican crowd.\nProtest at the 1968 Olympics.\n\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1's wins at the 1968 Olympics were particularly poignant because of the political turmoil in Czechoslovakia. She had publicly voiced her strong opposition to Soviet-style Communism and the Soviet invasion, and had signed Ludvik Vacul\u00edk's protest manifesto \"Two Thousand Words\" in the spring of 1968. Consequently, to avoid being arrested, she left the training facility in the town of \u0160umperk with the help of Zden\u011bk Zerz\u00e1\u0148, chief of Jesen\u00edky Mountain Rescue Service. She spent the weeks leading up to the Olympics hiding in a remote mountain hut at , and was only granted permission to travel to Mexico City at the last minute.\nAt the Olympics, where she once again faced Soviet opposition, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 continued to subtly voice her views. After she appeared to have won the gold medal on floor outright, the judging panel curiously upgraded the preliminary scores of Soviet Larisa Petrik, and declared a tie for the gold instead. All of this occurred on the heels of another very controversial judging decision that cost \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 the gold on beam, instead awarding the title to her Soviet rival Natalia Kuchinskaya. Clearly disheartened and angered by the politics that favored the USSR, she protested during both medal ceremonies by quietly turning her head down and away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem.\nLater career.\n\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was revered by Czech people for her brave demonstration on the world's biggest stage, and she was awarded Czechoslovakia's Sportsperson of the Year award in 1968 (for the fourth and final time). Her federation, however, was none too pleased. For her consistent support of the Czechoslovak democratization movement (the Prague Spring) in 1968, and during the purges which followed the Soviet-led invasion in August 1968, she was deprived of the right to travel abroad and participate in public sport events both in Czechoslovakia and abroad. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was effectively forced into retirement, and was considered a \"persona non grata\" for many years in her home country.\nCzechoslovak authorities refused to publish her autobiography, and insisted that it be heavily censored when it was released in Japan. She was granted leave to work as a coach in Mexico, but reportedly only when the Mexican government threatened to cease oil exports to Czechoslovakia. After return from Mexico in the beginning of 1980s she shared an office with Emil Z\u00e1topek where the two former sport stars and present-day outcasts were given meaningless administrative roles. In the late 1980s, following pressure from Juan Antonio Samaranch, the then president of the International Olympic Committee, who had presented her with the Olympic Order, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was finally allowed to work as a gymnastics coach and judge in her home country.\nAfter the Velvet Revolution in November 1989 brought an end to communist government in Czechoslovakia, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1's status improved dramatically. She became President Havel's adviser on sports and social matters and Honorary President of the Czech-Japan Association. Later, after leaving the President's Office, she was elected President of the Czech Olympic Committee. In 1995, she was appointed to the IOC membership committee.\nEponymous skill.\n\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 has one eponymous skill listed in the Code of Points.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHonours.\n\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 received numerous accolades for her contributions to the sport of gymnastics. In addition to the Olympic Order, she was awarded a 1989 Pierre de Coubertin International Fair Play Trophy by UNESCO and was noted at the ceremony for her \"exemplary dignity\". In 1995, she was honored with the Czech Republic's Medal of Merit. She was inducted into the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame in 1991 and the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2010, she was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd class. She was also presented a 17th-century katana and a ceremonial kimono from the Japanese emperor.\nIn 2014, she was the joint recipient (with AP journalist Iva Drapalova) of the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award, awarded annually by the Prague Society for International Cooperation and Global Panel Foundation, for outstanding civic courage.\nAn inner main belt asteroid (26986) Caslavska is named for her.\nPersonal life and death.\nShortly before the end of the 1968 Olympics, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 married runner Josef Odlo\u017eil, who had been a silver medalist at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. The ceremony, which took place at the Mexico City Cathedral, drew a crowd of thousands. They had a daughter, Radka, and a son, Martin. The couple divorced in 1987. In 1993, her son and ex-husband were involved in an altercation with Martin allegedly punching Josef; he fell to the floor and struck his head, leading to his death after 35 days. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 became severely depressed and apathetic and was rarely seen in public afterwards. For a while she was treated at a psychiatric hospital where she even underwent electroshock treatment, before moved into nursing home. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 eventually overcame her depression (which she had been fighting for about 15 years), cancel all medication and returned to both social and sports lives, coaching younger gymnasts. After many years of seclusion, when she was barely seen except by her closest friends and family, she had seemed to be regaining her appetite for life. She was describing her new-found energy as \u201cmiraculous\u201d and had recovered enough \"joie de vivre\" to delight Mexican spectators, as a guest at a gymnastics event in Acapulco, by demonstrating spontaneously that at 70 she could still do the splits.\n\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015. Her health deteriorated significantly in the summer of 2016, to such an extent that she was taken to a hospital in Prague on 30 August, where she died at the age of 74.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Created by Mort Weisinger and designed by George Papp, he first appeared in \"More Fun Comics\" No. 73 on September 19, 1941 (cover dated November 1941), the same issue that debuted Aquaman. His real name is Oliver Jonas Queen, a wealthy businessman, owner of Queen Industries, and a well-known celebrity in Star City. He uses this position to hide the fact that he is Green Arrow. Partly inspired by Robin Hood, Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle, as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of the Justice League. The world's greatest archer, as well as a competent swordsman and martial artist, Green Arrow deploys a range of trick arrows (in contemporary times, they are referred as \"specialty arrows\") with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas, and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations.\nGreen Arrow enjoyed moderate success in his early years, becoming the cover feature of \"More Fun\", as well as having occasional appearances in other comics. Throughout his first twenty-five years, however, the character never enjoyed greater popularity. In the late 1960s, writer Denny O'Neil, inspired by the character's dramatic visual redesign by Neal Adams, chose to have him lose his fortune, giving him the then-unique role of a streetwise crusader for the working class and the disadvantaged. In 1970, he was paired with a more law and order\u2013oriented hero, Green Lantern, in a ground-breaking, socially conscious comic book series. Since then, he has been popular among comic book fans and most writers have taken an urban, gritty approach to the character. Oliver Queen was killed off in the 1990s and replaced by a new character, Oliver's son Connor Hawke. Connor, however, proved a less popular character, and the original Oliver Queen character was resurrected in the 2001 \"Quiver\" storyline, by writer Kevin Smith. In the 2000s, the character has been featured in bigger storylines focusing on Green Arrow and Black Canary, such as the DC event \"The Green Arrow/Black Canary Wedding\" and the high-profile \"\" storyline, prior to the character's relaunch alongside most of DC's properties in 2011.\nGreen Arrow was not initially a well-known character outside of comic book fandom: He had appeared in a single episode of the animated series \"Super Friends\" in 1973. In the 2000s, the character appeared in a number of DC television properties, including the animated series \"Justice League Unlimited\", \"Young Justice\", \"The Batman\" and \"\", and several DC Universe Animated Original Movies. In live action, he appeared in the series \"Smallville\", played by actor Justin Hartley, and became a core cast member. In 2012, the live action series \"Arrow\" debuted on The CW, in which the title character was portrayed by Stephen Amell, and launching several spin-off series, becoming the starting point for a shared television franchise called the Arrowverse.\nPublication history.\nBeginnings, 1941\u20131968.\nGreen Arrow and Speedy first appeared in \"More Fun Comics\" No. 73 (cover-dated November 1941), which was illustrated by artist George Papp. When Mort Weisinger was creating the character, aside from the obvious allusions to Robin Hood, he took inspiration from a movie serial, \"The Green Archer\", based on the novel by Edgar Wallace. He retooled the concept into a superhero archer with obvious Batman influences. These include Green Arrow's sidekick Speedy, his use of an Arrowcar and Arrow-Plane for transportation, his use of an Arrow-Cave as his headquarters, his alter ego as a wealthy playboy, the use of an Arrow-Signal to summon him, as well as a clown-like arch foe named Bull's Eye, similar to Batman's arch-foe, the Joker. His and Speedy's first origin stories were told in \"More Fun Comics\" No. 89.\nGreen Arrow began as a back-up feature in \"More Fun Comics\", but within four months the Green Arrow and Speedy replaced Doctor Fate and the Spectre as the cover feature. In \"Superhero Comics of the Golden Age\", Mike Benton writes that \"their front cover star status was probably due to Speedy's appeal \u2013 teenage sidekicks were the current rage.\" They were also given a spot as one of five back-up features to be promoted in one of the earliest team-up books, \"Leading Comics\", starting with issue No. 1 (Winter 1941). They appeared in \"More Fun\" until issue No. 107 (January 1946), and then moved to \"Adventure Comics\" from No. 103 (April 1946) to No. 269 (February 1960). Green Arrow and Speedy also appeared in various issues of \"World's Finest Comics\" until issue No. 140 (March 1964).\nHe was one of the few DC characters to keep going after the Golden Age of Comic Books. His longevity was due to the influence of creator Mort Weisinger, who kept him as a backup feature to the headlining Superboy, first in \"More Fun Comics\" and then \"Adventure Comics\"; since Superman-related titles were all but guaranteed success during this period. Green Arrow endured the 1940s and 1950s relatively unchanged, unlike most of his Golden Age contemporaries. As a result, he avoided being revived and \"re-imagined\" for the Silver Age, as the Flash, Green Lantern, and others were.\nAside from sharing \"Adventure Comics\" with him, issue No. 258 featured an encounter between a younger Oliver Queen and Superboy. The Green Arrow and Speedy feature during this period included a short run in 1958 written by Dick and Dave Wood and drawn by Jack Kirby. For much of this period, Green Arrow's adventures were written by France Herron, who was the character's primary scripter 1947\u20131963.\nNeal Adams and Dennis O'Neil, 1969\u20131983.\nIn 1969, artist Neal Adams updated the character's visual appearance by giving him a Van Dyke beard and costume of his own design in \"The Brave and the Bold\" No. 85 (August\u2013September 1969). Writer Dennis O'Neil followed up on Green Arrow's new appearance by completely remaking the character's attitude in \"Justice League of America\" #75 (cover-dated November 1969), having Oliver Queen lose his fortune and become an outspoken advocate of the underprivileged and the political left wing. The story also turned teammate Black Canary into a love interest for Queen.\nIn the early 1970s, Green Arrow became a co-feature with Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) in an acclaimed series of stories by O'Neil and Adams that dealt with various social and political issues. The two co-stars served to represent contrasting socio-political viewpoints: Green Arrow spoke for radical change while Green Lantern was an establishment liberal figure, wanting to work within existing institutions of government and law. Queen convinces Jordan to see beyond his strict obedience to the Green Lantern Corps, to help those who were neglected or discriminated against. O'Neil explained: \"He would be a hot-tempered anarchist to contrast with the cerebral, sedate model citizen who was Green Lantern.\" The duo embark on a quest in a beat-up pickup truck to \"find America\", along the way witnessing the problems of corruption, racism, pollution, as well as overpopulation confronting the nation. One story (in issues #78-79) was even widely interpreted as an allegory for the Manson Family cult murders, though O'Neil has emphasized that the story was about the authoritarian left and not Manson.\nIn \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #85\u201386, it was revealed that Green Arrow's ward, Speedy, was addicted to heroin. Speedy overcame his addiction with the help of the Black Canary. This story prompted a massive public reaction, including a congratulatory letter from the mayor of New York, John Lindsay. However, \"Green Lantern\" sales had been in a major decline at the time Green Arrow was brought on as co-star, and the O'Neil/Adams stories failed to revive them. \"Green Lantern\" was canceled with issue No. 89 (April/May 1972), and the climactic story arc of the Green Lantern/Green Arrow series was published as a back-up feature in \"The Flash\" No. 217 through No. 219. In sharp contrast to the socially-relevant tales which preceded it, this story centered on emotional themes, with Green Arrow struggling to deal with the guilt of having killed a man. Afterwards Green Arrow appeared in solo stories run as backups in \"Action Comics\", starting with No. 421. Elliot S. Maggin, who had made his comics debut with a Green Arrow story published in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) No. 87, was Green Arrow's writer for the next several years.\nIn 1976, the \"Green Lantern/Green Arrow\" title was re-launched, without the socially conscious themes of the original series, with O'Neil writing and Mike Grell drawing. After the title moved to solo Green Lantern stories, solo Green Arrow stories appeared in \"World's Finest Comics\". In his solo series, Oliver landed a job as a newspaper columnist, which allowed him to articulate his political beliefs in a more public field. In \"World's Finest\" No. 255 (1979), Queen unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Star City.\nIn May through August 1983, Green Arrow appeared for the first time in his own comic book, a four issue limited series. This miniseries introduced a running rivalry between Green Arrow and the supervillain Count Vertigo.\nIn 1985, the Earth-Two Green Arrow died in the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", still wearing red boots and gloves. The Golden Age Earth-2 character had been retconned as a time-lost member of the original Seven Soldiers of Victory superhero team, recovered by the Justice League and Justice Society. After the Crisis, the Earth-Two Green Arrow and Speedy were retconned out of existence altogether, given the end of DC's former multiverse.\nMike Grell's reinterpretation.\nIn 1987, DC Comics launched the character into a new ongoing title as part of their mature audience comic line. Written and illustrated by Mike Grell, the revamp was launched with \"\" miniseries. In this three-issue prestige format limited series, a routine adventure against a group of drug runners led to tragedy as the Black Canary was captured and brutally tortured. In response, Oliver murdered his girlfriend's attackers. The miniseries also introduced the enigmatic female Japanese archer, Shado, whose family had suffered in a World War II internment camp. Shado later raped Oliver and became pregnant by him, producing a son named Robert after his father.\nUnder Grell, Green Arrow abandoned the use of his trademark gadget arrows and relocated from Star City to Seattle, Washington. As the series was part of DC Comics' mature audience line, it took on a more gritty, violent, as well as urban tone, with Green Arrow often using deadly force against his enemies. Grell wrote the series for the first 80 issues, downplaying the super-hero aspects of the characters: Oliver abandoned his mask and was never actually referred to as \"Green Arrow\" and Black Canary was never shown using her sonic scream power (sometimes, this was explained as having lost it due to the events of \"The Longbow Hunters\", though this was not consistent with her appearances in other titles published during this period). While crossover specials were conceived to allow other writers (most notably Denny O'Neil, who wrote \"Batman\" and the mature audience comic \"The Question\") to use Green Arrow, Grell wrote him as largely isolated from the rest of the DC Universe; when other DC characters like longtime friend Hal Jordan (also known as Green Lantern) appeared, they did so in street clothes and used only their civilian names.\nIn place of the superhero community, Grell created his own supporting cast. In addition to Shado, Grell introduced Seattle police Lieutenant Jim Cameron, who was disgusted with Green Arrow's vigilante actions (including killing criminals), renegade CIA agent Greg Osborne, who began to monitor Queen's activities, as well as mercenary Eddie Fyers, initially introduced as Queen's adversary, but later to become a companion of necessity when Green Arrow was forced to leave Seattle after false accusations of aiding terrorists. Grell's run ended with \"Green Arrow\" vol. 2 No. 80, shortly after Dinah dumped Oliver.\nDuring this period, the writer also redefined the character's origin in the four-part 1992 limited series, \"Green Arrow: The Wonder Year\". Grell portrayed Oliver Queen as a thrill-seeker who inherits his family business at a very young age. Changed by his sojourn on the island, Oliver decided to take up crime fighting as a means of rebelling against his responsibilities. During his first adventure in Star City, Oliver meets an old flame, Brianna Stone, a former college radical who warns him if he continued to carry his bow, he would one day have to use it for real. Grell's limited series also established Queen's attraction toward dangerous women.\nPost-Grell and character's temporary death.\nOnce Grell left the series, DC almost immediately began restoring Green Arrow to the mainstream DC Universe. His ongoing series (mostly written by Kelley Puckett and drawn by artist Jim Aparo) was removed from the \"Mature Audience\" line (which had evolved into \"Vertigo\") with No. 63, prior to Grell's departure and Green Arrow began appearing in various super-hero titles as a guest: most notably \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 3) #47, which had Oliver aiding Green Lantern in rescuing his longtime girlfriend Carol Ferris and her family from one of Hal's enemies, as well as the 1994 DC Comics miniseries \"\". In \"Zero Hour\", where Hal Jordan seeks to remake the universe after the trauma of Coast City's destruction drives him to destroy the Green Lantern Corps to gain the power to remake the universe, Queen is forced to shoot his old friend at a pivotal moment. Now tightly integrated in the DC Universe, the character Connor Hawke was introduced and revealed as Oliver Queen's son from a previous relationship.\nIn \"Green Arrow\" (vol. 2) #100\u2013101, Queen infiltrated a group of eco-terrorists known as the Eden Corps and sacrificed his life to prevent the group from detonating a bomb that would destroy the city of Metropolis. Superman attempted to intervene, but ultimately did not after Queen rebuked him for suggesting that Queen allow him to sever the arm attached to the bomb. The exchange between Queen and Superman pays tribute to Frank Miller's 1986 work \"The Dark Knight Returns\". Queen later admits in the \"Quiver\" storyline (where he is resurrected) that he refused due to both his own issues at this point in his life and the more practical issue that he would be useless as an archer with one arm. Queen's death allowed the writers to shake up the status quo by making Connor Hawke a replacement Green Arrow. The series, now written by Chuck Dixon, would continue with Hawke as the main focus until issue No. 137, when the series was canceled.\nSmith, Hester and Parks/Meltzer 2000\u20132004.\nQueen is revived in 2000's, \"Green Arrow\" (vol. 3) as part of the \"Quiver\" story arc, written by Kevin Smith and illustrated by Phil Hester and Ande Parks. It is revealed that Hal's resurrection of Oliver (seen on the last page of \"Green Arrow\" (vol. 2) No. 137, the final issue of the Oliver/Connor ongoing series) was in reality a deliberately flawed one. In Hal's final hours before sacrificing his life to save the Earth during \"The Final Night\", Hal speaks with Oliver's soul in the afterlife. The two agree to bring back \"a\" version of Oliver Queen: one without a soul (so Oliver may properly stay in Heaven) and with no memory of the events of \"The Longbow Hunters\" miniseries or of the subsequent events that followed, up until his death, Oliver reasoning that things went wrong for him after the events that drove him to kill for the first time and feeling that the copy of him was restored at the best point in his life.\nFor some years, this resurrected Oliver lives in Star City as a vigilante hero, completely under the radar of his other superhero friends, but eventually he is discovered and learns the truth of his resurrection, leaving the resurrected Oliver feeling uncertain about his state now that he knows he has no soul. His resurrection is eventually used by the grandfather of Stanley Dover in an attempt to gain power over the monster that Dover accidentally bound to his grandson, Dover intending to take Oliver's body- possible only due to his lack of a soul- and use his access to the JLA's resources to find the monster. At the climax of the story, Oliver's soul returns from heaven, re-inhabits his resurrected earthly form and helps his son Connor Hawke fight a horde of demons, the body of Oliver having made contact with his soul and convincing him to return to save their son. Dover is defeated and actually consumed by the Beast, who then leaves of his own accord. Oliver also finds himself independently wealthy again, as Dover had transferred all his financial assets to Oliver in anticipation of taking over his body. He also picked up a new sidekick, Mia Dearden, who would become the new Speedy, under Oliver's tutelage.\nAfter the resurrection storyline, Smith wrote a second and shorter arc involving a super-powered serial killer, calling himself Onomatopoeia, who sought to claim Connor as his latest victim. Smith then left the title and Brad Meltzer took over as writer.\nMeltzer's single storyline for \"Green Arrow\" featured Oliver and his former sidekick, Roy Harper, reuniting and going on a cross-country road trip to pick up old possessions of Oliver's, most notably a spare Green Lantern power ring entrusted to him by Hal Jordan many years earlier. The story also revealed that Oliver knew all along that Connor was his son and was even present at his birth, but that Oliver ultimately abandoned Connor and his mother, because of his fear of the responsibilities of fatherhood. Meltzer's storyline would continue into the miniseries \"\", which featured Oliver's attempts to use the ring against Sinestro- presumed dead for several years- before the ring is reclaimed by the reborn Hal Jordan.\nMeltzer went on to write the miniseries \"Identity Crisis\", which heavily featured Green Arrow as one of the story's main characters, investigating the murder of Sue Dibny \u2013 the wife of the Elongated Man \u2013 and revealing that the League had been involved in mind-wiping various villains in the past to conceal their secret identities.\nDuring this time, the character also appeared in a number of other titles, such as the \"Justice League\", when he is temporarily brought into a 'reserve League' created by Batman after the original League is nearly killed by the powerful Gamemnae, and \"Justice League Elite\", where Oliver joins a 'black ops' super-team as the team's tactical consultant. His time in the Elite is notable for showing a brief affair with Dawn, the wife of the team's magical expert, Manitou Raven.\nJudd Winick, 2004\u20132008.\nJudd Winick took over as \"Green Arrow\"'s writer and made many changes. Mia Dearden, the new Speedy, was revealed to be HIV positive, and attempts were made to expand Green Arrow's Rogues Gallery with Merlyn the archer, Constantine Drakon, as well as Danny Brickwell (the Brick) joining the cast of existing Green Arrow villains such as the illusion-casting Count Vertigo and the enigmatic Onomatopoeia, the latter of whom, himself, was a relatively recent addition. Other DC villains, such as the Riddler, made guest appearances throughout his run.\n2006 saw the title (along with other DC comics titles) jump \"One Year Later\" after the events in \"Infinite Crisis\". Oliver, having once again amassed a large personal fortune, is the newly elected mayor of Star City, continuing his fight for justice both on the streets and within the political system. He also has a new costume, which appears to be a combination of the classic Neal Adams costume and the Mike Grell \"Longbow Hunters\" costume. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Oliver survived a near-fatal attack during the events of the Infinite Crisis, as well as used his recuperation time to retrain. He works with several expert instructors including a sensei known as Natas, who also trained Deathstroke, and becomes proficient in several martial arts including the use of swords, which he makes use of on occasion during this time, and proves that he and his family are now formidable combatants when battling Deathstroke and later Batman's rogue prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Jason Todd. He is eventually forced to resign from his position as mayor after a scandal where he learns that he had been secretly funding the Outsiders, essentially a bounty hunter team at this point in their history, coupled with his uncertain position with the voting public, having never had much more than 50% of the city on his side at a time. Queen is convinced to resign his position in exchange for his successor leaving the various social aid organisations and resources he had established alone, although Ollie was able to beat his opponent by resigning prior to the election and putting someone he trusted in charge of the city. The series concluded with Oliver proposing to Dinah (Black Canary).\nIn 2007, Andy Diggle and Jock's \"\" presented the newest official version of his origin. Using concepts from previous iterations, Oliver Queen is a rich, thrill-seeking activist who is attacked, thrown overboard and washes up on an island where he learns of a smuggling operation. Upon witnessing the inhabitants' slave-like living conditions, he begins to take down the smugglers' operation. He eventually returns to civilization changed by his experiences. In the final part of the story, Oliver claims that a mutiny or the actions of a group of heroin dealers could be used as a cover story for what transpired, referencing the original Green Arrow origin story, as well as Mike Grell's version.\nGreen Arrow/Black Canary.\nAfter the end of the ongoing series, DC Comics published a four-part bi-monthly Black Canary miniseries in which Green Arrow teamed up with Black Canary to help get Sin into school and establish a new life. This series concluded with the Black Canary accepting his proposal. This resulted in DC Comics publishing three interconnected specials revolving around the Green Arrow/Black Canary wedding that tied into that month's \"Countdown\" stories. These were \"The Black Canary Wedding Planner\", \"JLA Wedding Special\", as well as \"The Green Arrow/Black Canary Wedding Special\". The wedding special worked as a lead-in for a new \"Green Arrow/Black Canary\" series. At the conclusion of the wedding special, the Black Canary is forced to kill Green Arrow after he appears to go mad and attacks her.\nThe new ongoing series picked up on this, quickly revealing that Green Arrow was alive (the dead Green Arrow being an impostor) and being held hostage by \"Athena\". The Black Canary, Connor and Mia launch a rescue mission to save Green Arrow. As the team is united and on their way to safety, Connor is struck by a bullet meant for Oliver and is left in a vegetative state. While Connor rests, Oliver and Dinah go out and are officially married, since they had never actually been married in the \"Wedding Special\", but they come home to find Connor has been kidnapped.\nThis storyline led directly into the second arc that followed the rescue of Connor from a mysterious foe. Connor is eventually found, now having recovered thanks to manipulation by Doctor Sivana. With issue No. 15, Andrew Kreisberg took over as the series writer.\n\"Blackest Night\".\nOliver is transformed into a Black Lantern Corps member and attacks his former allies, notably his son, wife and sidekick. During the battle, Connor says he never really forgave his father, while Oliver's internal monologue reveals his thoughts, which express concerns for his \"family\" and disgust at his actions. The team manage to disable Oliver by freezing him with liquid nitrogen.\n\"Cry for Justice\" and \"Rise and Fall\".\nIn the miniseries, JLA foe Prometheus destroys Star City, as part of a grand scheme to \"hurt\" the Justice League community of heroes. During the episode, the identity of the Green Arrow was nearly revealed by an old friend, Moreno. After tricking the Justice League into releasing him, Green Arrow tracks Prometheus to his hidden lair and kills him with a single arrow right between the eyes.\nThis murder, committed in secret, is what Oliver considers justice for the bombings (which also cost the life of Lian Harper, Roy Harper's (Red Arrow) daughter, who was killed in the bombing of Star City) and this immediately leads into the \"Rise and Fall\" storyline, in which Oliver obsessively hunts other super-villains allied with Prometheus during the recent events, including Prometheus's former allies who were involved in the bombing. When his JLA comrades learn of this plot, they confront Green Arrow and he realizes he has crossed a line and turns himself in: Black Canary returns her wedding ring and declares their marriage over. The \"Green Arrow/Black Canary\" series ends during this story arc, as well as in the pages of \"Justice League: Rise and Fall Special\"; Oliver is tried, but found not guilty as most of the jury sympathise with his motives. He is exiled from Star City's remains as a result, choosing to live in the mysterious forest which has grown at its centre.\n\"Brightest Day\".\nFollowing the events of \"Blackest Night\", Deadman was brought to the ruins of Star City by his white ring. Powered by the entity of life on Earth, the ring created a vast green forest, that instantly grew in the presence of the white light, in much of what remained of Star City.\nUnbeknownst to the populace of Star City, Green Arrow returns and lives within the new forest, trying his best to protect a city still reeling from the death and destruction of Prometheus's attacks. With the law breaking down and numerous public figures being murdered, a new owner of Queen Industries, the result of a hostile takeover, arrives to enforce peace and rebuild the city. This self-proclaimed 'Queen' has a connection to Green Arrow's father and claims to be upholding the Queen family legacy where Oliver failed.\nThe New 52.\nIn 2011, DC chose to relaunch its titles with new No. 1 issues and a refreshed continuity and called this initiative The New 52. \"Green Arrow\" was one of 52 titles included in this. In the post-\"Flashpoint\" continuity, Oliver Queen is Green Arrow and he balances his own breaking of laws with his efforts to bring outlaws to justice across the globe. In the new continuity, Queen runs Q-Core, a communications technology company that is part of Queen Industries, through which he funds and armors himself as Green Arrow. He makes scarce allusion to his former partnership with Roy Harper, but Roy's memories in \"Red Hood and the Outlaws\" establish that the pair fell out badly, leading Oliver to expel him from Q-Core, as well as prompting Roy's own downward spiral. He is based once again in Seattle and supported in his vigilante activities by a small team of close friends who are tech geniuses. In addition, his romantic history with the Black Canary, his friendship with Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), and his being a father (to both Connor Hawke and Shado's son Robert Queen II) did not take place as the result of the reboot.\nThe New 52 series was originally written by J. T. Krul, who was later replaced by Keith Giffen and Dan Jurgens, who were in turn replaced by Ann Nocenti. None of these writers' runs were well received by critics or fans. Beginning with issue 17, the series received a new creative team in writer Jeff Lemire and artist Andrea Sorrentino, who brought more positive reception to the book. Lemire's story introduces new mysteries concerning Oliver's original time on the island where he was shipwrecked, as well as a central mythology concerning the ancient Arrow Clan and several other weapon-themed analogues to the Arrow, known as the Outsiders. New antagonists include Komodo, who Oliver learns was his father's archer apprentice and apparent murderer. It has also seen the New 52 debut of several characters, such as Count Vertigo, Shado, the Clock King, Richard Dragon, as well as John Diggle, a character originally created for the TV series \"Arrow\".\nWhen Oliver meets Shado, he learns she had a daughter from Oliver's father (Robert Queen) named Emiko, whom Komodo has raised as his own daughter. When Oliver returns to the island as part of his investigation into the Outsiders, and in search of a relic known as 'the green arrow', he discovers that his father had survived to the present, and disguised as one of Oliver's torturers on the island, he manipulated Oliver's time there, culminating in Oliver's transformation into the warrior he is today and the hero known as Green Arrow. Disgusted at this revelation, and taking the arrow relic with him, Oliver leaves Shado and his father behind, stranded on the island, before returning to America to take down the Outsiders. Shado and Robert followed Oliver to Prague, and Emiko turned against Komodo after learning the truth of her parentage. Robert was killed by Komodo in an attempt to save his daughter, and Komodo was later killed himself by Emiko.\nFrom 2013, DC also chose to include Green Arrow as a headlining character in its \"Justice League of America\" (vol. 3) series, which runs alongside \"Justice League\" (vol. 2) and \"Justice League Dark\". In this book, Queen is part of a crack state-sponsored team assembled by Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor of A.R.G.U.S. to bring in good PR for the US government and serve as a defense against the independent Justice League headed by Superman and Batman should they ever go rogue. Following the cancellation of \"JLA\" at the conclusion of the \"Forever Evil\" storyline, Green Arrow appears in its replacement series, \"Justice League United\", also written by Lemire.\nLemire and Sorrentino left \"Green Arrow\" after issue No. 34, to be replaced by writers Andrew Kreisberg and Ben Sokolowski, and artist Daniel Sampere. Kreisberg was the executive producer of \"Arrow\", and Sokolowski served as a writer for the show. Kreisberg and Sokolowski's first issue featured The New 52 debuts of Felicity Smoak and Mia Dearden. Kreisberg's run saw him face off against the influential magnate John King, who is Mia's father, and his hired gun, Merlyn. At a moment of desperation given King's infinite resources and litany of loyal subjects, Felicity and Diggle recruit some of Green Arrow's allies and old enemies to help in the fight: Batman, Arsenal, Emiko, Katana, Onyx, Cupid and even Lex Luthor, at that time a Justice League member.\nFollowing DC's \"Convergence\" storyline in April\u2013May 2015, the title again received a new creative team in writer Ben Percy and artist Patrick Zircher, whose run was more influenced by the horror genre. Elements from \"Arrow\" were removed, and characters created by Lemire, such as Emiko and Henry Fyff, were restored to major roles. Percy's first arc depicts Green Arrow confronting a racist serial killer using drone-like security technology in Seattle to systematically target criminals and potential criminals based on computer profiling and police data.\nDC Rebirth.\nIn 2016, DC relaunched its entire line of titles once again with the DC Rebirth event, this time intending to restore elements from the DC Universe prior to \"Flashpoint\", while also maintaining the continuity of the New 52. Ben Percy remained the principal writer for the series, with a rotating art team consisting of Otto Schmidt, Juan Ferreyra and Stephen Byrne. During this run, Green Arrow is seemingly betrayed by Emiko as Percy reintroduces Shado, echoing elements from the Grell run, as well as John Diggle. In addition to restoring Green Arrow's trademark Van Dyke beard, the series revisited a romance between Green Arrow and Black Canary for the first time since 2011. Percy also reestablished Green Arrow as a politically conscious figure, with the writer describing him as a \"social justice warrior\". After it was revealed that Emiko was still on Oliver's side, she eventually adopted the codename of \"Red Arrow\".\nThis volume finished in March 2019, with issue No. 50 serving as an extra sized final issue.\nDawn of DC.\nIn November 2022, it was announced that Joshua Williamson would write a new Green Arrow series following Oliver's disappearance at the end of \"Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths\", with Sean Izaakse illustrating and launching in April 2023. On April 25, the day of the first issue's release, it was announced that the initial six-issue miniseries would become a twelve-issue maxiseries.\nOliver eventually reunites with Connor Hawke, Roy Harper, Black Canary, Red Canary, and Liam Harper after defeating Merlyn. Oliver has seemingly worked with Amanda Waller and starts arresting his family. During his work with Waller, he digs up a box that seemingly makes him regain his memory. It is revealed that Martian Manhunter realized Amanda Waller's plans to make the world hate metahumans, so he agreed to create a telepathic implant which will make Ollie fully believe in Waller's goals. Oliver helps disable the Amazon bots and the heroes regain their powers. In the aftermath, Oliver explains he had to do it because the Justice League disbanded so quickly when the Titans were not ready for future loose ends. He then further states that if they all had been more communicative as they did in the past, the events of Absolute Power would never had happened. Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman begrudgingly agree with Oliver's reasonings and tell Oliver that they are bringing back the Justice League.\nSupporting characters.\nAs with other DC superheroes, Green Arrow has an extensive supporting cast of characters, sometimes called Team Arrow, along with a unique rogues gallery of villains. His supporting cast has changed wildly over the course of the series, but has tended to include his sidekick Speedy (Roy Harper and Mia Dearden) and his fellow superhero and main romantic interest, Black Canary. His son Connor Hawke has also been a part of the Arrow vigilante family, along with Black Canary's adopted daughter Sin. For a brief time, Green Arrow was also \"assisted\" by the aspiring superhero Miss Arrowette, with whom he had a brief affair. The New 52 reboot of Green Arrow has also introduced a number of new supporting characters for Oliver, including ex-Queen Industries technology experts Naomi Singh and Henry Fyff, and his archer half-sister Emiko Queen who later takes up the code-name \"Red Arrow\". The characters of Felicity Smoak and John Diggle from the \"Arrow\" TV series were also adapted into the comic books in 2015 (though Felicity was later removed from the continuity). The archer Shado, though not part of Oliver's unit of heroes, has also been a recurring character in Oliver's life. Additionally, Green Arrow has been regularly paired with his fellow superhero Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) in comics, as the two co-starred in the series \"Green Lantern/Green Arrow\" together for many years. The \"Arrow\" version of Team Arrow include Roy Harper/Arsenal, Sara Lance/White Canary, Thea Queen/Speedy, Laurel Lance/Black Canary, Curtis Holt/Mister Terrific, Rene Ramirez/Wild Dog, Rory Regan/Ragman, Evelyn Sharp/Artemis and Dinah Drake/Black Canary.\nAs a Justice League member, Green Arrow will also appear in crossovers with stories featuring other DC flagship characters from time to time. Of his Justice League colleagues, classic stories depict Ollie as having an ongoing feud with Hawkman owing to their differing outlooks on life, and more recently, he has been depicted as a good friend of his Justice League United colleague Animal Man. Green Arrow has also been a member of the Outsiders, both in its incarnation as a covert superhero team led by Batman and in its New 52 form as a secret society based around various weapon clans, including an Arrow Clan which Oliver is the rightful head of. In the Golden Age of Comic Books, Green Arrow and Speedy were also affiliated with the superhero group the Seven Soldiers of Victory.\nEnemies.\nRecurring Green Arrow villains of course include his archenemies Merlyn, a master archer, and Count Vertigo, a foreign dignitary with the power to disrupt his enemy's balance and perception. Other recurring villains have included China White, Clock King, Cupid, Brick, and Constantine Drakon. Since the 2000s, the longstanding DC supervillain Deathstroke has often been depicted as having a particular grudge against Green Arrow.\nOther versions.\nAmalgam Comics.\nTwo versions of Green Arrow exist in the \"Amalgam universe\":\nEarth-Two.\nFor many years, DC Comics wrote stories in what it called a Multiverse, or a series of infinite parallel Earths. This allowed DC writers to freely retcon and retell stories, as well as explain continuity mistakes. The Green Arrow of the 1940s, like all Golden Age characters at that time, resided on Earth-Two and was a member of the Seven Soldiers of Victory and All-Star Squadron along with his sidekick Speedy. Despite having a different origin than the modern Green Arrow, the Golden Age character's development largely parallels the modern one's.\nDuring DC's landmark event \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Green Arrow is now in his 60s and is among the superheroes summoned by Monitor. He assists Changeling of Earth-One and Mento of Earth-One in fighting Shaggy Man II of Earth-One. While noticing that Shaggy Man is not a living being, Green Arrow defeated it with an explosive arrow. Green Arrow was among those who were killed by the Anti-Monitor's Shadow Demons which he tried to fight in Chicago as Peacemaker of Earth-Four was unable to get to him in time. This was because Green Arrow of Earth-Two was not as fast as he used to be due to his current age. The Anti-Monitor's defeat destroyed all the planets of the Multiverse and rebooted the DC universe with a single Earth.\nModern DC alternate universes.\nDC's weekly series \"52\" established a new 52-Earth Multiverse. The ongoing series \"Countdown\" showcased several of these. On Earth-3, an evil equivalent of Green Arrow is a member of the supervillain co-op called the Crime Society of America. Another evil equivalent exists in the Antimatter Universe called Deadeye. On Earth-15, Roy Harper has replaced Oliver as Green Arrow. In the gender-reversed world of Earth-11, Oliver is now Olivia Queen, and that world's version of the Black Canary closely resembles him in appearance. The \"Kingdom Come\" (Earth-22) and \"Dark Knight Returns\" (Earth-31) stories and their variations of Oliver were later amalgamated into the 52-Earth Multiverse.\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Oliver Queen is the head of Green Arrow Industries, a major military contracting company, as well as leads an ex-military band of Green Arrows. Even though Oliver is an inventive genius, he steals advanced gadgets from super-villains for military use. one day, Oliver discovers his Green Arrows were killed by a female raider at his base at Starfish Island and killing his best friend/head of security Roy Harper. Taking his weapons and gadgets to hunt down the woman in battle, Oliver shockingly learns that she is a daughter of his and Vixen, Oliver's former lover, as well as the reason she attacked him was because Green Arrow Industries built factories which specializing in testing super-villain weapons in American towns that inadvertently became targets for the super-villains looking to gain their weapons back. Shocked by her revelation, Oliver had only been stalling before his daughter is killed by his reserve teams he earlier called.\nEarth-31/\"The Dark Knight Returns\".\nThe character appears in Frank Miller's ' and the sequel ' listed as Earth-31. Despite missing an arm (implied to be because of Superman), Oliver still proves to be an effective archer (he grasps the nocks of his arrows in his teeth). Oliver was later requested by Batman to help the Dark Knight fight against Superman. Oliver accepts, and implants Batman's synthetic kryptonite into the tip of one of his arrows, causing Batman to emerge as the winner. After Batman fakes his death for him to go underground, Oliver, sporting a mechanical arm as a prosthesis for his left arm, joins Batman in his war against a corrupted American government run by Alexander Luthor. In \"The Dark Knight Returns\", Queen is portrayed as an anarchist, while in \"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\", he is explicitly described as a \"billionaire turned Communist.\"\nOther DC Elseworlds stories.\nIn \"\" and , Oliver is a featured as a disabled ex-hero, having lost an arm, an eye, and the use of his legs in a fight with Amazo, which also resulted in the death of Hawkman. Bitter and furious, he now spreads fear on Perry White's talk show about the JLA being aliens and claims that they are planning to conquer the world; his former teammates speculate that this is his method of coping. In the sequel, Oliver's brain is transplanted into Amazo's body\u00a0\u2013 the Flash having removed Amazo's computerized brain in an earlier fight\u00a0\u2013 restoring his sanity, allowing him to defeat the creature threatening the universe at the cost of his own life, after mending fences with his former teammates.\nIn ', Oliver Queen is mentioned as having been executed, found guilty of supporting underground Jewish \"pornographers\". He has a cameo as Bruce Wayne's society friend in Dean Motter's '. Oliver Queen also appears in Mike Mignola's ', where he is portrayed as a guilt-ridden latter-day Templar equipped with magic arrows dipped in the blood of Saint Sebastian. He is killed in issue No. 2 by Poison Ivy. Oliver appears in ', where Oliver Queen is a reporter for the \"Daily Planet\" working underneath Perry White and eventually Lois Lane.\nAn older, balding Green Arrow appears in Mark Waid and Alex Ross' futuristic \"Kingdom Come\", in which Oliver has joined forces with Batman to oppose Superman's army/Justice League. He married his longtime love Dinah Lance and they have a daughter, Olivia Queen aka Black Canary II.\nGreen Arrow appears in \"League of Justice\", a \"The Lord of the Rings\"\u2013inspired fantasy where the character is renamed \"Longbow Greenarrow\": a mysterious wizard resembling Gandalf. \"JLA: Age of Wonder\" shows Green Arrow as a defender of the poor and an enemy of oppression.\n\"Injustice\" series.\nIn the ' universe, where the Joker kills Lois Lane and her unborn child, driving Superman to autocratic madness, Green Arrow joins Batman's Insurgency against Superman's Regime, recognizing the corrupt Man of Steel's harsher approach to ending crime. In ', he is married to Black Canary and also unintentionally becomes close to Harley Quinn, who he saves from a near-death encounter with Superman. Near the end of Year One (the comic's first volume) he is beaten to death by Superman in his Fortress of Solitude after the former mistakenly believes that the Insurgency has come to harm his adopted parents kept there (though in reality it was a botched attempt to gain a super pill meant to give humans great power). With his final action, Oliver is able to use an arrow to deliver the super pill to the Insurgency so that the mission was not in vain. Year Two reveals Canary to be pregnant with Oliver's child, leaving her determined to take down Superman for his murder.\nSuperman: American Alien.\nIn the 2016 comic book Superman: American Alien by Max Landis, which features an alternate retelling of Clark's journey to becoming Superman, Oliver Queen encounters Clark Kent two times in his life. First is when Clark was nineteen and Oliver mistakes him for Bruce Wayne, whom he had thrown a birthday party for despite being aware that Wayne would never show up. Clark, after some hesitation, decides to enjoy himself and befriends Oliver, though he briefly becomes annoyed and shocked at how much money Oliver and his friends waste. Years later, after getting off Starfish Island, Oliver has matured more and encounters Clark again, who has begun his new career at the Daily Planet. At first believing him to be Bruce, Clark quickly comes clean. Oliver forgives him before introducing him to Lex Luthor, partly to annoy the latter.\nEarth 2.\nIn the pages of \"Earth 2: World's End\", Oliver Queen is an ally of Batman and operates as Red Arrow. When Batman was killed during the Apokoliptian invasion, Red Arrow continued to guard the Codex that contained the DNA of every animal, plant, and organism in an underwater fortress built by Bruce Wayne. When Batman and Huntress arrive at the underwater fortress, they meet Oliver Queen who assists in fighting the second Apokoliptian invasion. He and the Codex are among those evacuated from Earth when it was destroyed.\nCollected editions.\nThe trade paperback edition of \"The Archer's Quest\" (#16\u201321) was released as Volume 4 in the series after \"Straight Shooter\" (#26\u201331) was released as Volume 3. The hardcover editions of \"Quiver\", \"The Sounds of Violence\", as well as \"The Archer's Quest\" were never numbered. The hardcover edition of \"Green Arrow/Black Canary: The Wedding Album\" was reprinted minus the last two pages of issue #5.\nIn other media.\n\"Smallville\".\nJustin Hartley portrayed Oliver Queen/Green Arrow in \"Smallville\", and is first introduced in the season six episode \"Sneeze\". DC Comics writer Mark Waid had particular praise for Hartley's performance, stating \"I think Justin Hartley nails Green Arrow perfectly, I mean, there's that brashness, that, cockiness \u2013 but not to the point where you want to smack him \u2013 but right up to the edge.\"\nGeoff Johns, former President and CCO of DC Entertainment, and who wrote for Hartley in the episode \"Absolute Justice\" concurred, saying \"I love Justin as Green Arrow. I didn't realize how good he was until I saw him on screen. Like, I knew he was good; but every line he delivered was perfect. He can make any line sound good. So I was pleasantly surprised by how much he stole the scenes.\"\nThe character starts off as a recurring character who is already an established vigilante in his home of Star City, and is originally paired with Lois Lane in a romantic storyline. After a rough start, he becomes a trusted ally and friend of Clark Kent. Green Arrow retains his many unique arrows and demonstrates expert archery skill, along with skilled use of a crossbow with many trick arrows. In the episode \"Justice\", Oliver teams up with Clark to put an end to Lex Luthor's experimentation with supervillains by teaming up with other superheroes Clark has met on his journeys, forming a prototypical Justice League. Oliver is seen again in season seven for the episode \"Siren\", in which he continues his fight against LuthorCorp and meets another superhero, Black Canary, whom he recruits for his Justice League. In a flashback sequence in the season seven episode \"Veritas\", a young version of Oliver Queen can be seen being played by Luke Gair.\nFrom season eight through season ten, Hartley is a series regular, and is woven into the backstory of \"Smallville\" through the Queens' business connections with the Luthor, Teague, and Swann families; Oliver was a childhood friend and schoolmate, and later a teenage bully, of Lex Luthor. In the season eight episode \"Requiem\", Oliver risks his friendship with Clark by killing Lex, something which Clark would never support. Over the course of the series, Oliver and Clark become increasingly close friends and they establish themselves full-time as superheroes, working with other members of the Justice League when required. Oliver later becomes romantically involved with Clark's best friend, Lois's cousin Chloe Sullivan, whom he ultimately marries. In the series finale, Oliver serves as the best man at Clark and Lois' wedding service, and Chloe is shown to have a son in the future, who is implied to be Oliver's. \"Smallville Season Eleven\", a comic book continuation of the show, reveals he is Oliver's son; Jonathan Queen, named after Clark's adoptive father.\nDuring the sixth season of \"Smallville\", there was talk of spinning off Justin Hartley's portrayal of the character Green Arrow into his own series. Hartley however refused to entertain the idea, feeling it was his duty to respect what \"Smallville\" had accomplished in five seasons, and not \"steal the spotlight\" because there was \"talk\" of a spin-off after his two appearances. According to Hartley, \"talking\" was as far as the spin-off idea ever got. A spin-off series in which Oliver led the Justice League made it into early development. The series was to have been helmed by Stephen S. DeKnight, who would later go on to be the showrunner for the first season of Marvel's \"Daredevil\".\nArrowverse.\nIn January 2012, following \"Smallville\"'s conclusion, The CW prepared a new series centered on the character Green Arrow. Andrew Kreisberg, Greg Berlanti and Marc Guggenheim were announced to be developing the series. A week later, the series was ordered to pilot, to be directed by David Nutter, who had previously directed the pilot for \"Smallville\". When developing the series, producer Marc Guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to \"chart [their] own course, [their] own destiny\", and avoid any direct connections to \"Smallville\". Thus rather than continuing on with Hartley's incarnation of the character, they opted to cast a new actor in the role and establish the series as its own separate continuity. At the end of the same month, Canadian actor Stephen Amell was cast in the titular role of Oliver Queen.\nThe series, titled simply \"Arrow\", follows the story of former playboy billionaire turned vigilante Oliver Queen after he is rescued from a presumably deserted island, where he was shipwrecked five years earlier. It also features flashbacks to his time away. Guggenheim described the show as more of a \"hero show\" than a superhero one, wanting the show to be realistic, and stated that much of the inspiration for the flashback sequences was drawn from \"\". Andrew Kreisberg explained that, \"We designed [Oliver] as a character a little more tortured\" than the comic series Green Arrow. The series premiered in North America on October 10, 2012, and was picked up for a full season later that month. The show went on to air for seven full seasons, with a shortened eighth and final season, consisting of ten episodes, concluding in January 2020. The series became the progenitor of a franchise of television shows and other associated media based around adaptations of a variety of DC Comics characters, set within a shared universe, collectively known as the 'Arrowverse', including \"The Flash\", \"Supergirl\", \"Legends of Tomorrow\", \"Black Lightning\", and \"Batwoman\".\nDC Extended Universe.\nStephen Amell had expressed interest in portraying the DC Extended Universe version of Green Arrow but Warner Bros. have explicitly said to have their TV and film universes separate. Green Arrow is mentioned in the eighth episode of \"Peacemaker\".\n\"Injustice 2\".\nOliver Queen/Green Arrow appears in the 2017 video game \"Injustice 2\". In the game, he is married to Black Canary and is part of Batman's insurgency. He is tasked alongside other allies such as a reformed Harley Quinn to take down a group of supervillains formed by Gorilla Grodd known as \"The Society\".\n\"Batman: Arkham Series\".\nQueen Industries is first mentioned in \".\" In \",\" Queen Industries is shown owning various properties around Gotham. Green Arrow himself is never directly mentioned. A Queen Industries building is also a major landmark in the Metropolis of .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The agency's primary purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities. The governor of the state in which the disaster occurs must declare a state of emergency and formally request from the president that FEMA and the federal government respond to the disaster. The only exception to the state's gubernatorial declaration requirement occurs when an emergency or disaster takes place on federal property or to a federal asset\u2014for example, the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, or the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" in the 2003 return-flight disaster.\nWhile on-the-ground support of disaster recovery efforts is a major part of FEMA's charter, the agency provides state and local governments with experts in specialized fields, funding for rebuilding efforts, and relief funds for infrastructure development by directing individuals to access low-interest loans, in conjunction with the Small Business Administration. In addition to this, FEMA provides funds for response personnel training throughout the United States and funds for non-federal entities to provide housing and services for migrants released from Department of Homeland Security custody.\nHistory.\nFederal emergency management in the U.S. has existed in one form or another for over 200 years.\nPrior to 1930s.\nA series of devastating fires struck the port city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, early in the 19th century. The 7th U.S. Congress passed a measure in 1803 that provided relief for Portsmouth merchants by extending the time they had for remitting tariffs on imported goods. This is widely considered the first piece of legislation passed by the federal government that provided relief after a disaster.\nBetween 1803 and 1930, \"ad hoc\" legislation was passed more than 100 times for relief or compensation after a disaster. Examples include the waiving of duties and tariffs to the merchants of New York City after the great fire of New York in 1835. After the collapse of the John T. Ford's Theater in June 1893, the 54th Congress passed legislation compensating those who were injured in the building.\nPiecemeal approach (1930s\u20131960s).\nAfter the start of the Great Depression in 1929, President Herbert Hoover had commissioned the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932. The purpose of the RFC was to lend money to banks and institutions to stimulate economic activity. RFC was also responsible for dispensing federal dollars in the wake of a disaster. RFC can be considered the first organized federal disaster response agency.\nThe Bureau of Public Roads in 1934 was given authority to finance the reconstruction of highways and roads after a disaster. The Flood Control Act of 1944 also gave the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers authority over flood control and irrigation projects and thus played a major role in disaster recovery from flooding.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (1973\u20131979).\nFederal disaster relief and recovery was brought under the umbrella of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in 1973 by Presidential Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, and the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration was created as an organizational unit within the department. This agency would oversee disasters until its incorporation into FEMA in 1978.\nPrior to implementation of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978 by E.O. 12127 and E.O. 12148, many government agencies were still involved in disaster relief; in some cases, more than 100 separate agencies might be jockeying for control and jurisdiction of a disaster.\nOver the years, Congress increasingly extended the range of covered categories for assistance, and several presidential executive orders did the same. By enacting these various forms of legislative direction, Congress established a category for annual budgetary amounts of assistance to victims of various types of hazards or disasters, it specified the qualifications, and then it established or delegated the responsibilities to various federal and non-federal agencies.\nIn time, this expanded array of agencies themselves underwent reorganization. One of the first such federal agencies was the Federal Civil Defense Administration, which operated within the Executive Office of the President. Functions to administer disaster relief were then given to the President himself, who delegated to the Housing and Home Finance Administration. Subsequently, a new office of the Office of Defense Mobilization was created. Then, the new Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization, managed by the EOP; after that, the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization, which renamed the former agency; then, the Office of Civil Defense, under the Department of Defense (DoD); the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW); the Department of Agriculture; the Office of Emergency Planning (OEmP); the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (replacing the OCD in the DoD); the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the General Services Administration (GSA) (upon termination of the OEmP).\nThese actions demonstrated that, during those years, the nation's domestic preparedness was addressed by several disparate legislative actions, motivated by policy and budgetary earmarking, and not by a single, unifying, comprehensive strategy to meet the nation's needs over time. Then, in 1978 an effort was made to consolidate the several singular functions; FEMA was created to house civil defense and disaster preparedness under one roof. This was a very controversial decision.\nFEMA as an independent agency (1979\u20132003).\nFEMA was established under the 1978 \"Reorganization Plan No. 3\" and was activated by President Jimmy Carter in an Executive Order on April 1, 1979.\nIn July, Carter signed Executive Order 12148 shifting disaster relief efforts to the new federal-level agency. FEMA absorbed the Federal Insurance Administration, the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration, the National Weather Service Community Preparedness Program, the Federal Preparedness Agency of the General Services Administration and the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration activities from HUD. FEMA was also given the responsibility for overseeing the nation's Civil Defense, a function which had previously been performed by the Department of Defense's Defense Civil Preparedness Agency.\nOne of the disasters FEMA responded to was the dumping of toxic waste into Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York, in the late 1970s. FEMA also responded to the Three Mile Island nuclear accident where the nuclear-generating station suffered a partial core meltdown. These disasters, while showing the agency could function properly, also uncovered some inefficiencies.\nIn 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed James Lee Witt as FEMA Director. In 1996, the agency was elevated to cabinet rank; this was not continued by President George W. Bush. Witt initiated reforms that would help to streamline the disaster recovery and mitigation process. The end of the Cold War also allowed the agency's resources to be turned away from civil defense to natural disaster preparedness.\nAfter FEMA's creation through reorganization and executive orders, Congress continued to expand FEMA's authority by assigning responsibilities to it. Those responsibilities include dam safety under the National Dam Safety Program Act; disaster assistance under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; earthquake hazards reduction under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 and further expanded by Executive Order 12699, regarding safety requirements for federal buildings and Executive Order 12941, concerning the need for cost estimates to seismically retrofit federal buildings; emergency food and shelter under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987; hazardous materials, under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.\nIn addition, FEMA received authority for counterterrorism through the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici amendment under the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996, which was a response to the recognized vulnerabilities of the U.S. after the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.\nCongress funded FEMA through a combination of regular appropriations and emergency funding in response to events.\nFEMA under Department of Homeland Security (2003\u2013present).\nFollowing the attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better coordinate among the different federal agencies that deal with law enforcement, disaster preparedness and recovery, border protection and civil defense. FEMA was absorbed into DHS effective March 1, 2003. As a result, FEMA became part of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate of Department of Homeland Security, employing more than 2,600 full-time employees. It became Federal Emergency Management Agency again on March 31, 2007, but remained in DHS.\nPresident Bush appointed Michael D. Brown as FEMA's director in January 2003. Brown warned in September 2003 that FEMA's absorption into DHS would make a mockery of FEMA's new motto, \"A Nation Prepared\", and would \"fundamentally sever FEMA from its core functions\", \"shatter agency morale\" and \"break longstanding, effective and tested relationships with states and first responder stakeholders\". The inevitable result of the reorganization of 2003, warned Brown, would be \"an ineffective and uncoordinated response\" to a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.\nHurricane Katrina in 2005 demonstrated that the vision of further unification of functions and another reorganization could not address the problems FEMA had previously faced. The \"Final Report of the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina\", released February 15, 2006, by the U.S. Government Printing Office, revealed that federal funding to states for \"all hazards\" disaster preparedness needs was not awarded unless the local agencies made the purposes for the funding a \"just terrorism\" function. Emergency management professionals testified that funds for preparedness for natural hazards were given less priority than preparations for counter-terrorism measures. Testimony also expressed the opinion that the mission to mitigate vulnerability and prepare for natural hazard disasters before they occurred had been separated from disaster preparedness functions, making the nation more vulnerable to known hazards, like hurricanes.\nAfter allegations of mismanagement during Hurricane Katrina, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) was transferred from the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of Health and Human Services by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, signed by President George W. Bush on December 18, 2006. In the same year, congress passed the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which made FEMA a more independent agency within DHS, and better define its primary mission. The act also added a Surge Capacity Force, which allows the Department of Homeland Security to supplement FEMA employees with additional personnel from various federal departments in the event the agency is overwhelmed. The Force has been activated for Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria, and the 2017 California wildfires.\nIn fall 2008, FEMA took over coordination of the Ready Campaign, the national public service advertising campaign in collaboration with the Ad Council, to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. The Ready Campaign and its Spanish-language version Listo asks individuals to do three things: build an emergency supply kit, make a family emergency plan and be informed about the different types of emergencies that can occur and how to respond. The campaign messages have been promoted through television, radio, print, outdoor and web PSAs, as well as brochures, toll-free phone lines and the English and Spanish language websites.\nIn 2013, as a response to FEMA's response to Hurricane Sandy, congress passed the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 which allowed federally recognized tribes to directly request a presidential declaration of emergency.\nThe Stafford Act was amended by the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (PETS Act) in 2006, and the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) in 2018. DRRA made efforts to focus FEMA effort on improving resiliency, preparedness, and mitigating vulnerabilities for large disasters.\nFEMA was put in charge of procuring medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to a tweet posted on April 12, 2022, by Deanne Criswell, the FEMA flag, used between 1981 and 2003, was reintroduced.\nFEMA under second Trump Administration (2025).\nThe Trump administration has the stated goal of reducing or eliminating the federal role of FEMA, and having individual states assume emergency management responsibilities instead. In 2025, FEMA was subjected to cuts by the Trump administration, firing more than 200 new and veteran employees on February 17, 2025. On March 24, 2025, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she would move to eliminate FEMA.\nIn May 2025, the interim leader of FEMA, Cameron Hamilton, was dismissed from his position one day after he testified to Congress: \"I do not believe it is in the best interest of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\" He was replaced as interim FEMA leader by Marine Corps veteran David Richardson, who promptly told FEMA staff: \"I alone in FEMA, speak for FEMA \u2026 Don't get in my way \u2026 because I will run right over you. I will achieve the president's intent.\"\nIn August 2025, more than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed an open letter, later called the \"Katrina Declaration,\" which criticized recent policy changes under the Trump administration and warned they undermined the agency\u2019s ability to respond to disasters. The letter cited requirements for DHS approval of FEMA contracts, the reassignment of staff to immigration enforcement, cuts to preparedness programs, and the suppression of climate science. Following the letter, several current FEMA employees who signed by name were placed on paid administrative leave. FEMA stated the leave was not disciplinary, while critics and advocacy groups described it as retaliatory and raised concerns about political interference in FEMA operations.\nRichardson, the acting FEMA administrator, resigned on November 17, 2025. \nOrganization.\nDuring the debate of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, some called for FEMA to remain as an independent agency. Following the failed response to Hurricane Katrina, critics called for FEMA to be removed from the Department of Homeland Security. Today, FEMA exists as a major agency of the Department of Homeland Security. The Administrator for Federal Emergency Management reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security. In March 2003, FEMA joined 22 other federal agencies, programs and offices in becoming the Department of Homeland Security. The new department, headed by Secretary Tom Ridge, brought a coordinated approach to national security from emergencies and disasters \u2013 both natural and man-made.\nFEMA manages the National Flood Insurance Program. Other programs FEMA previously administered have since been internalized or shifted under direct DHS control.\nFEMA is also home to the National Continuity Programs Directorate (formerly the Office of National Security Coordination). ONSC was responsible for developing, exercising, and validating agency-wide continuity of government plans as well as overseeing and maintaining continuity readiness including the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center. ONSC also coordinated the continuing efforts of other Federal Executive Agencies.\nFEMA began administering the Center for Domestic Preparedness in 2007.\nFEMA administers the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) which provides funding to state governments, local governments, Tribal governments, and Territorial governments along with specified Urban Areas and counties along international borders to invest in security enhancements. HSGP is broken out into three primary grant programs: State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), and Operation Stonegarden (OPSG). As of 2024, the Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program (THSGP) is funded as a percentage carveout of HSGP as well. The Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) used to be funded under the HSGP as well, but Congress now funds that program separate from HSGP. NSGP provides funding for nonprofit organizations more at risk to terrorist actions and domestic violence extremeism to invest in target hardening. This includes, but is not limited to, organizations such as educational facilities, hospitals, and house of worship. In 2024, FEMA administered over $3 billion across the suite of homeland security grants.\nBudget.\nIn 2018, FEMA had an annual budget of $30 billion that is used and distributed in different states according to the emergencies that occur in each one. An annual list of the use of these funds is disclosed at the end of the year on FEMA's website.\nCadres.\nFEMA maintains 23 cadres of various work functions and skillsets to prepare, respond, and recover from various disasters.\nPre-disaster mitigation programs.\nFEMA's Mitigation Directorate is responsible for programs that take action before a disaster, in order to identify risks and reduce injuries, loss of property, and recovery time. The agency has major analysis programs for floods, hurricanes and tropical storms, dams, and earthquakes.\nFEMA works to ensure affordable flood insurance is available to homeowners in flood plains, through the National Flood Insurance Program, and also works to enforce no-build zones in known flood plains and relocate or elevate some at-risk structures.\nPre-Disaster Mitigation grants are available to acquire property for conversion to open space, retrofit existing buildings, construct tornado and storm shelters, manage vegetation for erosion and fire control, and small flood control projects. Critics say this program is underperforming because it is starved for funding compared to disaster response and recovery, the process of applying for a buyout is unreasonably slow, and is wasting taxpayer dollars because the National Flood Insurance Program has paid to reconstruct some properties up to 18 times. 1% of NFIP-insured properties are responsible for more than one quarter of the money the program has paid out.\nThe Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds rebuilding after a current disaster in a way that reduces the impact of a similar future disaster.\nResponse capabilities.\nFEMA's emergency response is based on small, decentralized teams trained in such areas as the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), Urban Search and Rescue (USAR), Disaster Mortuary Operations Response Team (DMORT), Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT), and Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS).\nNational Response Coordination Center (NRCC).\nFEMA's National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) is a multiagency center located at FEMA HQ that coordinates the overall Federal support for major disasters and emergencies, including catastrophic incidents in support of operations at the regional level. The FEMA Administrator, or their delegate, activates the NRCC in anticipation of, or in response to, an incident by activating the NRCC staff, which includes FEMA personnel, the appropriate Emergency Support Functions, and other appropriate personnel (including nongovernmental organization and private sector representatives). During the initial stages of a response, FEMA will, as part of the whole community, focus on projected, potential, or escalating critical incident activities. The NRCC coordinates with the affected region(s) and provides needed resources and policy guidance in support of incident-level operations. The NRCC staff specifically provides emergency management coordination, planning, resource deployment, and collects and disseminates incident information as it builds and maintains situational awareness\u2014all at the national-level. FEMA maintains the NRCC as a functional component of the NOC for incident support operations.\nAn example of NRCC activity is the coordination of emergency management activities that took place in connection with the 2013 Colorado floods.\nDisaster Medical Assistance Teams.\nDisaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT) provide medical care at disasters and are typically made up of doctors and paramedics. There are also National Nursing Response Teams (NNRT), National Pharmacy Response Teams (NPRT) and Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams (VMAT). Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORT) provide mortuary and forensic services. National Medical Response Teams (NMRT) are equipped to decontaminate victims of chemical and biological agents.\nUrban Search and Rescue (US&amp;R).\nThe Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces perform rescue of victims from structural collapses, confined spaces, and other disasters, for example, mine collapses and earthquakes.\nMobile Emergency Response Support (MERS).\nThese teams provide communications support to local public safety. For instance, they may operate a truck with satellite uplink, computers, telephone, and power generation at a staging area near a disaster so that the responders can communicate with the outside world. There are also Mobile Air Transportable Telecommunications System (MATTS) assets which can be airlifted in. Also, portable cell phone towers can be erected to allow local responders to access telephone systems.\nThe first test of the national wireless emergency system by FEMA was broadcast to an estimated 225 million electronic devices at 14:18 EDT on October 3, 2018. The text message was accompanied by a flashing warning sign and warning tone. The president may direct FEMA to broadcast such alerts only for national emergencies or if the public is in danger. The facility may not be used for personal messages from the president. Mobile phone owners can not opt out of these warnings.\nPreparedness for nuclear incidents.\nOn August 1, 2008, FEMA released \"Planning Guidance for Protection and Recovery Following Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) and Improvised Nuclear Device (IND) incidents\", which provide an action guide in the case of radioactive contamination. This guidance is specified as action guide for Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDD) and Improvised Nuclear Devices (IND) involving high levels of radiation. According to the Federation of American Scientists, during the Cold War FEMA prepared assessments of the likely consequences of a full-scale Soviet nuclear attack on the United States for use in planning mitigation and recovery efforts. FEMA also prepared plans for evacuating major U.S. cities in response to a nuclear war, dubbed CRP-2B.\nTraining.\nFEMA offers a large number of training classes, either at its own centers, through programs at the state level, in cooperation with colleges and universities, or online. The latter are free classes available to anyone, although only those with U.S. residency or work eligibility can take the final examinations. More information is available on the FEMA website under the \"Emergency Personnel\" and \"Training\" subheadings. Other emergency response information for citizens is also available at its website.\nFEMA runs the Incident Workforce Academy, a two-week emergency preparedness training program for FEMA employees. The first class of the academy graduated in early 2014.\nThe Training and Education Division within FEMA's National Integration Center directly funds training for responders and provides guidance on training-related expenditures under FEMA's grant programs. Information on designing effective training for first responders is available from the Training and Education Division. Emergency managers and other interested members of the public can take independent study courses for certification at FEMA's online Emergency Management Institute.\nEmergency Management Institute training and certifications.\nEMI offers credentials and training opportunities for United States Citizens. Note that students do not have to be employed by FEMA or be a federal employee for some of the programs. However, they do need to create a FEMA SID to take the final exams\nEMI maintains a strategic partnership with Frederick Community College. FCC has contracted with the Emergency Management Institute to provide college credit for the Independent Study Program (ISP). FCC offers eight specialized Letters of Recognition, an Undergraduate Certificate, and an Associate of Applied Science degree in Emergency Management.\nFEMA Corps.\nFEMA Corps, who range in age from 18 to 26 years old, is a cadre dedicated to disaster response and recovery. It is a new partnership between The Corporation for National and Community Service's AmeriCorps NCCC (National Civilian Community Corps) and FEMA.\nThe Corps, described as a \"dedicated, trained, and reliable disaster workforce\", works full-time for 10 months on federal disaster response, recovery, mitigation, and preparedness efforts across numerous sections. Over 150 members of the inaugural FEMA Corps class graduated in June 2013, at the Southern Region AmeriCorps NCCC campus in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Pacific Region campus in Sacramento, California and the Southern Region campus both support a FEMA Corps class annually. The Corps work on teams of 6 to 10 people and follow the traditional NCCC model of living together and traveling together. In addition to working with FEMA, Corps members must perform AmeriCorps responsibilities such as Physical Training three times a week, National Days of Service, and Individual Service Projects in communities throughout the United States. Members receive $6.10 a day for food ($15 a day when deployed to on disaster project) and a living stipend of approximately $3,500 over 10 months (Approximately $175 every two weeks). Team leaders receive a larger stipend of approximately $10,000 over the course of 10 months (Approximately $500 every two weeks). The Segal AmeriCorps education award is distributed to Corps members who successfully finish their term of service, completing 1,700 or more total hours. The amount of a full-time Segal AmeriCorps Education Award is equivalent to the maximum value of the Pell Grant for the fiscal year in which the term of national service is approved, and can therefore change between different classes.\nDonations management.\nFEMA has led a Public-Private Partnership in creating a National Donations Management Program making it easier for corporations or individuals not previously engaged to make offers of free assistance to States and the Federal Government in times of disaster. The program is a partnership among FEMA, relief agencies, corporations/corporate associations and participating state governments.\nCriticisms.\nHurricane Andrew.\nIn August 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck the Florida and Louisiana coasts with 165\u00a0mph (265\u00a0km/h) sustained winds. FEMA was widely criticized for its response to Andrew, summed up by the famous exclamation, \"Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one?\" by Kate Hale, emergency management director for Miami-Dade County, Florida. FEMA and the federal government at large were accused of not responding fast enough to house, feed and sustain the approximately 250,000 people left homeless in the affected areas. Within five days the federal government and neighboring states had dispatched 20,000 National Guard and active duty troops to South Dade County to set up temporary housing. This event and FEMA's performance was reviewed by the National Academy of Public Administration in its February 1993 report \"Coping With Catastrophe\" which identified several basic paradigms in Emergency Management and FEMA administration that were causes of the failed response.\nFEMA had previously been criticized for its response to Hurricane Hugo, which hit South Carolina in September 1989, and many of the same issues that plagued the agency during Hurricane Andrew were also evident during the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nAdditionally, upon incorporation into DHS, FEMA was legally dissolved and a new Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate was established in DHS to replace it. Following enactment of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 FEMA was reestablished as an entity within DHS, on March 31, 2007.\nSouthern Florida hurricanes.\nSouth Florida newspaper \"Sun-Sentinel\" has an extensive list of documented criticisms of FEMA during the four hurricanes that hit the region in 2004.\nSome of the criticisms include:\nThe rising sea levels, global temperatures, and increase of flooding and severe storms has called for a change within the procedure of flood insurance. The communities that are directly impacted by these changes include coastal communities and waterfront homes. The procedural design of flood insurance is done through FEMA's (Federal Emergency Management Agency) National Flood Insurance Program. Previously the Insurance Program created in 1968 was constructed around the \"100-year floodplain\" which is the \"area that would be inundated by the 100-year flood, better thought of as an area that has a one percent or greater chance of experiencing a flood in any single year\", and large subsidies for coastal homes, especially in Florida. However, in 2019, major changes were made, and the new program called Risk Rating 2.0 was introduced, which prices a house on its individual flood risk. It will account for the distance one's house is from a flood source, the types and frequency of flooding, and characteristics of the cost to rebuild. This new program will greatly impact states like Florida that have intense risk of hurricanes and sea level rise. Through the initial program, the homes on the coast were mostly being subsidized at the cost of the homeowners more inland, and more likely lower-income and people of color. However, as previously stated, with Risk Rating 2.0, homeowners in higher risk areas of greater flooding will be paying for that risk through insurance, and with that may come with re-evaluating the longevity of one's place on the coasts of Florida. On the other hand, with FEMA's program as a national program, we see different impacts in places like New England. It has been indicated that states like Maine will be greatly impacted positively by the new program. The bays, inlets, and coves are proved to be good protective measures for most waterfront properties. In addition to Maine, states like Iowa and Nebraska will see impacts to their flood insurance policies. It is stated that almost 50% of Nebraskans and 40% of Iowans will see a decrease in their policies. Overall we see many different types of complications to this new set-up, such as retirees on fixed incomes, long-term mortgages, and depreciation of household value. As this program is relatively new, impacts of the program will continue to be seen in the following years.\nHurricane Katrina.\nFEMA received intense criticism for its response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster in August 2005. FEMA had pre-positioned response personnel in the Gulf Coast region. However, many could not render direct assistance and were able to report only on the dire situation along the Gulf Coast, especially from New Orleans. Within three days, a large contingent of National Guard and active duty troops were deployed to the region.\nThe enormous number of evacuees simply overwhelmed rescue personnel. The situation was compounded by flood waters in the city that hampered transportation and poor communication among the federal government, state, and local entities. FEMA was widely criticized for what is seen as a slow initial response to the disaster and an inability to effectively manage, care for, and move those who were trying to leave the city.\nThen-FEMA Director Michael D. Brown was criticized personally for a slow response and an apparent disconnection with the situation. Brown would eventually be relieved of command of the Katrina disaster and soon thereafter resigned.\nAccording to the U.S. House of Representatives Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina:\nOther failings were also noted. The Committee devoted an entire section of the report to listing the actions of FEMA. Their conclusion was:\nFor years emergency management professionals have been warning that FEMA's preparedness has eroded. Many believe this erosion is a result of the separation of the preparedness function from FEMA, the drain of long-term professional staff along with their institutional knowledge and expertise, and the inadequate readiness of FEMA's national emergency response teams. The combination of these staffing, training, and organizational structures made FEMA's inadequate performance in the face of a\ndisaster the size of Katrina all but inevitable.\nPursuant to a temporary restraining order issued by Hon. Stanwood R. Duval, United States District Court Judge, Eastern District of Louisiana as a result of the McWaters v. FEMA class-action, February 7, 2006, was set as the deadline for the official end of any further coverage of temporary housing costs for Katrina victims.\nAfter the February 7 deadline, Katrina victims were left to their own devices either to find permanent housing for the long term or to continue in social welfare programs set up by other organizations. There were many Katrina evacuees living in temporary shelters or trailer parks set up by FEMA and other relief organizations in the first months after the disaster hit, but much more were still unable to find housing.\nIn July 2007, ice that had been ordered for Katrina victims but had never been used and kept in storage facilities, at a cost of $12.5 million, was melted down.\nIn June 2008, a CNN investigation found that FEMA gave away about $85 million in household goods meant for Hurricane Katrina victims to 16 other states.\nBuffalo snowstorm.\nFEMA came under attack for their response to the October Surprise Storm in Buffalo, New York, on October 13, 2006. As FEMA legally cannot interfere with state business unless asked, FEMA responded that as per procedure, the governor of the state of New York, George Pataki, had not asked for FEMA's assistance. FEMA Headquarters had been in constant contact with State congressional offices providing them with the latest information available. Claims state that FEMA officials did not arrive until October 16, three days after the storm hit. The snowstorm damage by this time included downed power wires, downed trees, and caused structural damage to homes and businesses.\nDumas, Arkansas, tornadoes.\nMany people of Dumas, Arkansas, especially victims of tornadoes on February 24, 2007, criticized FEMA's response in not supplying the number of new trailers they needed, and sending only a set of used trailers, lower than the needed quantity. Following the storm, U.S Senator Mark Pryor had criticized FEMA's response to the recovery and cleanup efforts.\nCalifornia wildfires.\nFEMA came under intense criticism when it was revealed that a press conference on the October 2007 California wildfires was staged. Deputy Administrator Harvey E. Johnson was answering questions from FEMA employees who were posing as reporters. Many of these questions were \"softball\" questions (i.e., \"Are you happy with FEMA's response so far?\"), intentionally asked in a way that would evoke a positive response giving the impression that FEMA was doing everything right. In this way, any scrutiny from real reporters (many of whom were given only a 15-minute notice) would have been avoided. Fox News, MSNBC, and other media outlets aired the staged press briefing live. Real reporters were notified only 15 minutes in advance and were able to call into only a conference line, which was set to \"listen-only\" mode. The only people there were primarily FEMA public affairs employees.\nHurricane Maria.\nFEMA has funded over 11,000 recovery projects totaling more than $33.9 billion for Hurricane Mar\u00eda, primarily focused on restoring permanent infrastructure. This includes nearly $600 million approved for materials and equipment to help rebuild Puerto Rico's power grid. Planned improvements include the installation of approximately 2,500 miles of transmission lines, 23 miles of submarine cable to serve the islands of Vieques and Culebra, more than 300 substations, nearly 200,000 transformers, and about 13,400 miles of distribution feeders.\nIn September 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Dominica and Puerto Rico with 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h) sustained winds. Maria was the fifth-strongest storm to ever strike the United States with stronger winds than those brought by Irma and similar rain brought to Houston by Hurricane Harvey. \nDespite FEMA's preemptive efforts in Puerto Rico, the island was still devastated beyond expectation. The agency had prepared some provisions for displaced residents before the storm struck, including: roughly 124 FEMA staff members being positioned on the island, food, water, and bedding. However, people reported the FEMA food packages were unhealthy snacks such as the confectionery Skittles. FEMA was widely criticized for its response to Maria, as the island quickly fell into a humanitarian crisis.\nThe island also experienced a massive loss of power as a result of flood and wind damage sustained during Maria. In the beginning of October 2017, Lieutenant General Todd Semonite, chief and commanding general of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, explained the extent of and necessity of aid for this power crisis. Semonite described some specifics of the outage to reporters, explaining that the island requires \"2,700 megawatts of electricity to operate and at last count had 376 megawatts available.\" This translates to about 14 percent of the grid being functional.\nFEMA Administrator William \"Brock\" Long told reporters in a briefing following the storm that Puerto Rico politics had hindered the ability of the federal government to send aid. He explained that political divisions had prevented unity for leaders in this time of crisis, describing that their issue was \"even worse\" than the mainland United States' issue between Democrats and Republicans. Residents, in some cases, were required to fill out paperwork in English rather than Spanish with little to no hope of receiving the aid they had requested.\nBrigadier General Jose Reyes of the Puerto Rico National Guard discussed a strategy to quicken the arrival of resources via the Port of Ponce, located on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. Reyes also attributed the delay in these services to the unprecedented series of storms that demanded attention from the agency within a short period of time. Regarding this, General Reyes told reporters \" We were not even getting back on our feet after Irma, then suddenly we got hit by Maria.\" He also addressed the disparities between aid sent to mainland disaster-stricken areas and Puerto Rico, explaining that in areas such as Florida and Texas, who had recently struck with similar damages, transportation of resources is relatively simpler. This is because they are able to utilize infrastructure to transport aid. Transporting similar resources to Puerto Rico has proved to be more difficult, as they must travel across the ocean, either in aircraft or in ships. Long also mentioned that Puerto Rico's international airport was not able to operate at full capacity, which posed an additional obstacle for federal aid imports.\nLong resigned on March 8, 2019, following criticism of his handling of Hurricane Maria and an ethical complaint over misuse of official vehicles, costing $151,000. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said that Long would have to reimburse the government for the cost of the vehicles and staff involved in the trips, many of which were between Washington and his home in North Carolina. Nielsen submitted her own resignation as Secretary of Homeland Security less than a month later on April 7, 2019.\nHurricane Harvey.\nHurricane Harvey made landfall in late August 2017 as a Category 4 Hurricane with 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) sustained winds. The Hurricane predominantly affected southeast Texas; however, its effects were felt as far as Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee in the form of flash flooding. Harvey slowly progressed around southeast Texas, where it produced heavy precipitation over the region. This caused heavy flooding in residential areas such as Colorado City, Liberty, and Montgomery, Texas.\nHarvey was the first of a series of hurricanes and tropical storms to affect the United States between August and September 2017. The effects of these storms included extreme flooding, damage from high speed winds, structural damage, and humanitarian concerns regarding the availability of basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter.\nSome recipients were forced to wait up to two months before receiving aid from FEMA, as technical complications held up both their application for it and the processing of said applications. Some residents were denied Federal Aid and have to dispute their denial in efforts to rebuild and repair properties without taking a considerably large financial loss.\nCoronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).\nIn early April 2020, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that the Trump administration was \"quietly\" seizing medical supplies from states and hospitals, citing hospital and clinic officials catering to seven states. These officials stated that the administration has not informed them how they can otherwise get access to their ordered supplies. A FEMA representative said the agency, working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, has developed a system for identifying needed supplies from vendors and distributing them equitably. The federal government also seized an order for thermometers meant for Florida, an order for masks from the Texas Association of Community Health Centers, and an order for testing supplies meant for the PeaceHealth hospital system in Washington, Oregon and Alaska.\nOn April 24, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said \"We've had situations when things we've ordered that have gone through Customs were confiscated by FEMA to be diverted to other locations. We know everyone is dealing with a serious challenge. Through Customs, we've had situations where those items have been taken and put out on the market for the highest bidder, putting cities against cities and states against states.\"\nMassachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders cited a shipment of 3 million masks that the state had negotiated to buy from BJ's Wholesale Club, until the federal government impounded them from the Port of New York and New Jersey on March 18. A further order from MSC Industrial Supply for 400 masks to be delivered on March 20 was also claimed by the federal government using force majeure. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker reached out to the New England Patriots professional American football team, who used the team plane \"AirKraft\" to bring approximately 1.2 million N95 masks from China to Boston.\nIn late April, reports of the actions taken by FEMA in Massachusetts prompted Maryland Governor Larry Hogan to deploy the Maryland National Guard and task them with guarding a shipment of 500,000 COVID-19 testing kits purchased from South Korean company LabGenomics by the Government of Maryland. The tests were subsequently held in an \"undisclosed location,\" under the continued supervision of the Maryland National Guard.\nThe state of Colorado was set to purchase 500 ventilators before Federal Emergency Management Agency swooped in and bought them first. President Trump announced on Twitter that the federal government would be sending 100 ventilators to Colorado at the request of Senator Cory Gardner. The incident caused Colorado Governor Polis to make future supply purchases in secret.\nIn late April, 5,000,000 masks meant for hospitals of the Veterans Health Administration were seized by FEMA and redirected to the Strategic National Stockpile, stated Richard Stone, Executive in Charge, Veterans Health Administration. After an appeal from Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to FEMA, the agency provided the VA with 500,000 masks.\nHurricane Ian.\nOn August 10, 2023, the United States House Subcommittee on Government Operations and the Federal Workforce, a subcommittee under the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, held a televised investigative hearing on the federal government's response to and overall recovery efforts from Hurricane Ian, which struck Florida in September 2022.\nHurricanes Helene and Milton.\nBetween November 2024\u2013March 2025, the United States Congress held four separate televised investigative hearings on the federal government's response to, overall recovery efforts from, and criminal events following Milton and Hurricane Helene a few weeks earlier. These two hurricanes sparked widespread misinformation and political turmoil to the point where Helene was described as the \"flashpoint\" for the 2024 presidential election.\nJuly 2025 Central Texas floods.\nBy the time of the July 2025 Central Texas floods disaster, the Trump administration had reduced FEMA staff by one-fifth since taking office, and FEMA preparedness training ceased for months, shutting out over 7,000 trainees. Therefore, FEMA's response to this catastrophic event will likely be closely scrutinized. The National Emergency Management Association, as part of a coalition of stakeholders, states in a June 30, 2025, letter to Department of Homeland Security that FEMA \u201chas not opened applications for a large number of key grants and is missing legally mandated deadlines to ensure the funds can be distributed.\u201d Such grants support emergency management staffing and resources for 82% of U.S. counties, particularly in rural areas.\nThe Trump administration has the stated goal of reducing\u2014or even eliminating\u2014the federal role of FEMA, and having individual states assume emergency management responsibilities instead; there is evidence that the flow of information from and within FEMA is thus being deliberately stifled\u2014a situation which is hampering the agency's ability to efficiently communicate and work with state officials, and even with other parts of the federal government, thus \u201cjeopardizing emergency response and homeland security capabilities, putting \u2018critical infrastructure\u2019 at risk.\u201d With regard to the July 2025 Central Texas floods, a former FEMA administrator observes that \u201cTexas has already requested assistance for search and rescue\u2026 Oklahoma and Louisiana are sending search and rescue teams in,\u201d and she points out that out-of-state teams are, in fact, FEMA trained and funded, begging the questions she poses: \u201cWhat happens if that funding for their ongoing training goes away?\u201d and \u201cHow are they going to be able to sustain that?\u201d\nFederalism and FEMA.\nThe costs of a disaster to states and localities can escalate quickly. Federal assistance becomes fully available with the approval of the President and at the request of the governor. Public help for governments to repair facilities is 75% federally funded with local governments responsible for covering the rest (unless the state grants aid or loans). FEMA does not compensate for buildings that have been improperly maintained by the state or local government nor does it pay to upgrade or improve facilities. FEMA coordinates but does not fund disaster assistance provided by the Small Business Administration or the Farmers Home Administration. FEMA grant-in aid funds come from revenue sharing, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation. Grants for disaster preparedness can be used by flood control districts.\nMany states have disaster relief agencies of their own. In the event of a disaster outside of a state's operating capacity, the director of said agency will advise the Governor whether or not to proclaim a state of emergency. Declaring a state of emergency, upon Presidential approval, entitles a state to federal assistance.\nProclaiming a state of emergency does not guarantee federal assistance. States also rely on mutual aid agreements, such as the Civil Defense and Disaster Compact and Emergency Management Assistance Compact. A mutual aid agreement can be between neighboring states, cities, counties and cities, states and cities or an entire region. These agreements allow agencies to share resources so they are better prepared for emergencies.\nLocal governments have the most immediate responsibility. Four factors shape local disaster response:\nHaving a mostly intact tax base allows local governments to maintain steady revenue stream. Business unharmed by a disaster will be able to continue to generate sales tax revenue. Cities with access to large revenue reserves and strong mutual aid agreements will have greater response capacity. While cities with large municipal debt that would be unable to pay back state or federal loans would be in a difficult situation.\n\"U.S. v. Parish of Jefferson et al\".\nThis case gave FEMA the right to sue in order to recover funds paid out in flood insurance claims for flood damage as a result of poor decisions by local officials and developers. The case also gave FEMA the power to sue localities who fail to meet flood plain management requirements.\nList of FEMA heads.\nThe following persons served as the head of FEMA:\nTable notes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73804", "revid": "1278321644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73804", "title": "Nephites", "text": "People mentioned in the Book of Mormon\nIn the Book of Mormon, the Nephites () are one of four groups (along with the Lamanites, Jaredites, and Mulekites) said to have settled in the ancient Americas. The term is used throughout the Book of Mormon to describe the religious, political, and cultural traditions of the group of settlers.\nThe Nephites are described as a group of people that descended from or were associated with Nephi, a son of the prophet Lehi, who left Jerusalem at the urging of God in about 600\u00a0BC and traveled with his family to the Western Hemisphere and arrived to the Americas in about 589\u00a0BC. The Book of Mormon notes them as initially righteous people who eventually \"had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness\" and were destroyed by the Lamanites in about AD\u00a0385.\nSome Mormon scholars have suggested that the Nephites settled somewhere in present-day Central America. However, non-Mormon scholars and, notably, the Smithsonian Institution, have stated that they have seen no evidence to support the Book of Mormon as a historical account.\nArchaeology.\nThe existence of the Nephites is part of the Mormon belief system.\nThe Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), part of Brigham Young University, has performed extensive archaeological research on this subject, and publications on the subject and other historical topics are issued regularly by FARMS. This research is disputed by many researchers, including Michael Coe, a scholar in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican history, as well as the Smithsonian Institution.\nIn 1973, Coe addressed the issue in an article for \"\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mormon archaeologists over the years have almost unanimously accepted the Book of Mormon as an accurate, historical account of the New World peoples. ... Let me now state uncategorically that as far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the foregoing to be true, and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group. ...\nThe bare facts of the matter are that nothing, absolutely nothing, has even shown up in any New World excavation which would suggest to a dispassionate observer that the Book of Mormon, as claimed by Joseph Smith, is a historical document relating to the history of early migrants to our hemisphere.\nIn 1996, the Smithsonian Institution issued a statement that addressed claims made in the Book of Mormon by stating that the text is primarily a religious text and that archeologists affiliated with the Institution found \"no direct connection between the archeology of the New World and the subject matter of the book.\" The statement further says that there is genetic evidence that the Native Americans are closely related to peoples of Asia and that archaeological evidence indicates that the Native Americans migrated from Asia over a land bridge over the Bering Strait in prehistoric times. The statement said that there was no credible evidence of contact between Ancient Egyptian or Hebrew peoples and the New World, as indicated by the text of the Book of Mormon. The statement was issued in response to reports that the name of the Smithsonian Institution was being improperly used to lend credibility to the claims of those looking to support the events of the Book of Mormon. The National Geographic Society issued a similar letter in response to an inquiry from the Institute for Religious Research saying that \"the Society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated \"The Book of Mormon\"\".\nBook of Mormon narrative.\nKings.\nAfter the Nephites arrived in America, up to the reign of Mosiah II (c. 592\u201391 BC), the Nephites were ruled by kings. Nephi's brother Jacob explains that subsequent kings bore the title \"Nephi\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The people having loved Nephi exceedingly\u2026 were desirous to retain in remembrance his name. And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name they would.\u2014\u200a\nJudges.\nThe last Nephite king was Mosiah\u00a0II. About 91\u00a0BC, he declared that, instead of naming a new king, he would finish out his reign as king, after which the Nephites would elect judges to govern them. There were at least three levels of judges: one chief judge, several higher judges, and several lower judges. (Some passages speak of multiple \"chief judges\", probably synonymous with \"higher judges\"; for example, Alma 62:47; 3\u00a0Nephi 6:21.)\nJudges were paid according to the amount of time they spent officiating. Mosiah\u00a0II set the rate at one senine of gold (or the equivalent senum of silver) for one day's work (Alma 11:1,\u00a03). He also arranged for checks in this system to avert corruption as much as possible:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher judge.\nIf your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the people.\u2014\u200a\nAfter announcing the governmental shift from kings to judges, Mosiah explained the principle behind the change:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The sins of many people have been caused by the iniquities of their kings...\nNow it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law\u2014to do your business by the voice of the people.\u2014\u200a\nThe system of judges lasted for 120 years, when it was briefly overthrown for about three years (c. 30\u201333\u00a0AD) by an aristocratic cadre, led by a man named Jacob. It was replaced by a loose system of tribes and kinships, which lasted until Jesus appeared in America and established a society that approached the ideals of Zion. The society endured for about two centuries before the people fell into wickedness again.\nAfter 4\u00a0Nephi, no mention is made of whether the Nephites used judges or kings. Mormon mentions that \"the Lamanites had a king\" (Mormon 2:9). His inclusion of that detail, phrased as it is, can be seen as a contrast to the Nephites having a chief judge. Since no change in government form is specifically mentioned after 4\u00a0Nephi, it is possible that the Nephites continued to use judges until their destruction in about AD\u00a0385.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
