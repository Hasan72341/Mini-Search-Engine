As of the 2020 census, the population was 153,843. Its county seat is Inverness, and its largest community is Homosassa Springs. Citrus County comprises the Homosassa Springs, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nThe area covered by present-day Citrus County is thought to have been first occupied at least 10,000 years ago. About 2,500 years ago, mound-building Native Americans settled in the area and built the complex that now forms the Crystal River Archeological Site. The site was occupied for about 2,000 years. Why the complex was abandoned is currently unknown.\nCitrus County was created in 1887. The Citrus County area was formerly part of Hernando County. It was named for the county's citrus groves. Citrus production declined dramatically after the \"Big Freeze\" of 1894-1895: today, citrus is grown on one large grove, Bellamy Grove; additionally, some residents have citrus trees on their personal property.\nAfter the Big Freeze the next major industry was phosphate mining, which continued until World War I. Planned industrial development surrounding the construction of the Cross Florida Barge Canal never came to fruition when the partially-built canal was terminated after environmental opposition. A later attempt to create a port (Port Citrus) from the portion of the canal that was completed resulted in no significant progress and the county voted in 2015 to scuttle the project.\nThe original Citrus County seat was Mannfield (incorrectly spelled Mansfield or Mannsfeld in some sources). The county seat was later moved to Inverness; only a street and a pond remain of the original county seat town.\nThe first library in Citrus County was founded in 1917 in Inverness. Other branches opened in Floral City in 1958, and Hernando in 1959, as well as the freestanding Crystal River and Homosassa Libraries. These libraries joined to create the Central Florida Library System in 1961. Beverly Hills Library opened in 1970 and joined the Central Florida Library System. A Special Library Taxing District was created by the voters in March 1984. In October 1987, the Citrus County Library System was established which allowed the county residents to administer their own system.\nOver 100 people and 50 pets were rescued after ten feet of storm surge hit the area during Hurricane Helene in September 2024.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (24.8%) is water. It is considered to be part of the Nature Coast of Florida.\nThere are a number of uninhabited and/or sparsely inhabited coastal islands that can be accessed via watercraft. While some of the Citrus County islands are state lands thus available for public use for recreational opportunities, many other Citrus County islands are private property and are either wholly or partially owned by private parties.\nFauna.\nAccording to the US Fish and Wildlife Service's aerial manatee surveys, as many as 400 of these unique creatures can be found in Citrus County at one time. This typically occurs only during the coldest months of the year.\nManatees can also be viewed in the underwater observatory at Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park. Most of the park's residents are injured animals either undergoing rehabilitation for future release to the wild, or will be permanent due to their inability to be released to the wild. The notable exception is Lucifer, an African hippopotamus that had prior movie roles. When a permanent home could not be found for Lucifer, then-Governor Lawton Chiles named him an \"honorary citizen of the state\" thus allowing him to remain at the Park.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 153,843 people, 64,621 households, and 40,063 families residing in the county.\nAs of the census of 2000, 118,085 people, 52,634 households, and 36,317 families resided in the county. The population density was . The 62,204 housing units averaged . The racial makeup of the county was 95.05% White, 2.36% Black or African American, 0.36% Native American, 0.76% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.37% from other races, and 1.07% from two or more races. About 2.66% of the population were Hispanics or Latinos of any race.\nOf the 52,634 households, 19% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.30% were married couples living together, 7.60% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31% were not families. About 26.10% of all households were made up of individuals, and 15.60% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.20 and the average family size was 2.60.\nIn the county, the population was distributed as 17.20% under the age of 18, 4.60% from 18 to 24, 19.10% from 25 to 44, 26.90% from 45 to 64, and 32.20% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 53 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.30 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.60 males.\nEconomy.\nPersonal income.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $31,001, and for a family was $36,711. Males had a median income of $28,091 versus $21,408 for females. The per capita income for the county was $18,585. Around 11.70% of the population and 8.50% of families were below the poverty line; 18.10% of those under the age of 18 and 7.00% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.\nLabor.\nMore than one-third of residents were senior citizens in 2014. Health care dominates the work force.\nTransportation.\nRailroads.\nOne rail line operates within the county: A freight line to the Crystal River Energy Complex in northern Citrus County. Other lines that used to run through Citrus were either converted into rail trails such as the Cross Town Trail in Crystal River and Withlacoochee State Trail in eastern Citrus County or abandoned.\nCommunities.\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther unincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernment.\nCitrus County Fire and Rescue.\nIn 2025, Citrus County Fire and Rescue (CCFR) received over $2 million in grants from the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency, in order to expand their hiring and upgrade their equipment.\nLibraries.\nOriginally, the libraries within Citrus County were separate and overseen by different local organizations. In 1961, the libraries of Crystal River, Floral City, Hernando, Homosassa, and Inverness joined the Central Florida Regional Library System along with Levy and Marion Counties. The Citrus County Library System was established on October 1, 1987.\nThe Citrus County Library System offers a PAWS to Read program where elementary school-aged children can enhance their literacy skills by reading aloud to a certified therapy dog. It also has several other children/teen programs and adult recreational classes.\nOn October 24, 2019, the Citrus County Commissioners voted against the Library System's request for funding to give library users digital access to the \"New York Times\". Commissioner Scott Carnahan said, \"I don't want the \"New York Times\" in this county. I don't agree with it, I don't like 'em, it's fake news and I'm voting no. They can take that money and do something else with it ... I support Donald Trump.\"\nThere are five branches of the Citrus County Library System:\nThe library in Beverly Hills began as a few shelves in the Beverly Hills recreational hall. A proper library was made possible by the local residents. In 1965, those that wished to expand the library visited homes asking for donations of $1 from each. The new library was built and its materials relocated to a building on Beverly Hills Boulevard. In 1969, the library moved slightly south to inhabit part of the Fire House. Nine years later, when the Fire House was moved, the library expanded to use the entire space. The Beverly Hills Library became the Central Ridge Branch on Roosevelt Boulevard during its dedication in 1995.\nOn April 8, 1959, the first public library opened in Crystal River at 639 Citrus Ave. Much of the funding for this building was donated by the Crystal River Women's Club. A year later, the library moved into the old post office space. After the libraries joined the Central Florida Regional Library System, the City of Crystal River donated two lots of land for the building of a new library. The building was later expanded in 1972, which remained until 1983 when the current library was built at 8619 W Crystal St. The library was then renamed to The Coastal Region Library.\nThe Floral City Public Library branch is located in the town center of Floral City. Oak trees lead up to the library. Surrounding the library is the Floral City Heritage Museum and Country Store, the Floral City Masonic Lodge, and Community House. The library is managed by the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) and receives governmental funding and donations to operate. The Lion's Club started the library in 1958 in a former gift shop.\nA new branch location was built and opened on May 1, 2009. The building was part of a $1.5 million town center and linear park on Orange Avenue and replaced the old facility. The branch offers adult literacy, early childhood literacy, family &amp; youth, self enrichment, and technology education classes. The library has many craft class offerings for children, teens, adults, and seniors. Popular programs include adult coloring, tissue paper flowers, recycled book art, and card making. Close to holidays, the branch hosts themed activities and small parties for children. Staff of the Floral City branch create monthly book displays to entice patrons to new areas and titles. Every year the library hosts two book sales (spring and fall) to raise funds for more materials and programs. Staff participates in Heritage Days which is a weekend-long celebration of the founding of Floral City. Heritage days take place in early December and staff members dress up in garb from the late 1800s.\nElections.\nVoter registration.\nAccording to the Secretary of State's office, Republicans comprise a majority of registered voters in Citrus County.\nFederal and state offices.\nCitrus County has voted Republican in national elections since 2000 and has voted Republican in state and local races before the 21st century. As of 2015, Republicans held the federal representative, state senator, and state representative seats serving the county, occupied all seats on the Citrus County Commission, and held nearly all other separately elected offices in the county. In 2016 the county broke heavily for Donald Trump, giving him 67% of the vote, the largest of any candidate since President Nixon in 1972. Trump broke his own record in both subsequent elections (2020 and 2024).\nThe county has been trending heavily Republican for the past few decades, with Democratic registration declining for at least the past 15 years.\nMedia.\nThe Citrus County newspaper of record is the \"Citrus County Chronicle\", a daily. It is published by Landmark Media Enterprises. A second paper, \"The Newscaster\", also circulates in Citrus County but is located in neighboring Marion County.\nOther online news sources include the Groundhog News, Citrus Daily, Real News Real Fast, Sunshine Standard and Citrus Times Online.\nThe local TV station is WYKE-CD.\nThe county is part of the Nielsen-designated . Spectrum and Comcast serve different areas of Citrus County, with Spectrum serving the western part of the county, including Crystal River; and Comcast serving Inverness, and the eastern county communities; these systems offer most Tampa Bay stations, plus selected channels from the Orlando and Gainesville markets.\nRadio stations in Citrus County are part of the Arbitron-designated .\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72016", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72016", "title": "Genetic drift", "text": "Concept in genetics\nGenetic drift, also known as random genetic drift, allelic drift or the Wright effect, is the change in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random chance.\nGenetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation. It can also cause initially rare alleles to become much more frequent and even fixed.\nWhen few copies of an allele exist, the effect of genetic drift is more notable, and when many copies exist, the effect is less notable (due to the law of large numbers). In the middle of the 20th century, vigorous debates occurred over the relative importance of natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view that genetic drift plays at most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations. In the 1990s, constructive neutral evolution was proposed which seeks to explain how complex systems emerge through neutral transitions.\nAnalogy with marbles in a jar.\nThe process of genetic drift can be illustrated using 20 marbles in a jar to represent 20 organisms in a population. Consider this jar of marbles as the starting population. Half of the marbles in the jar are red and half are blue, with each colour corresponding to a different allele of one gene in the population. In each new generation, the organisms reproduce at random. To represent this reproduction, randomly select a marble from the original jar and deposit a new marble with the same colour into a new jar. This is the \"offspring\" of the original marble, meaning that the original marble remains in its jar. Repeat this process until 20 new marbles are in the second jar. The second jar will now contain 20 \"offspring\", or marbles of various colours. Unless the second jar contains exactly 10 red marbles and 10 blue marbles, a random shift has occurred in the allele frequencies.\nIf this process is repeated a number of times, the numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation fluctuates. Sometimes, a jar has more red marbles than its \"parent\" jar and sometimes more blue. This fluctuation is analogous to genetic drift\u00a0\u2013 a change in the population's allele frequency resulting from a random variation in the distribution of alleles from one generation to the next.\nIn any one generation, no marbles of a particular colour could be chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur in just a few generations.\nProbability and allele frequency.\nThe mechanisms of genetic drift can be illustrated with a very simple example. Consider a very large colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B, which are neutral alleles, meaning that they do not affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus, A and B each has an allele frequency of 1/2.\nThe drop of solution then shrinks until it has only enough food to sustain four bacteria. All other bacteria die without reproducing. Among the four that survive, 16 possible combinations for the A and B alleles exist: (A-A-A-A), (B-A-A-A), (A-B-A-A), (B-B-A-A), (A-A-B-A), (B-A-B-A), (A-B-B-A), (B-B-B-A), (A-A-A-B), (B-A-A-B), (A-B-A-B), (B-B-A-B), (A-A-B-B), (B-A-B-B), (A-B-B-B), (B-B-B-B).\nSince all bacteria in the original solution are equally likely to survive when the solution shrinks, the four survivors are a random sample from the original colony. The probability that each of the four survivors has a given allele is 1/2, and so the probability that any particular allele combination occurs when the solution shrinks is\nformula_1\n(The original population size is so large that the sampling effectively happens with replacement). In other words, each of the 16 possible allele combinations is equally likely to occur, with probability 1/16.\nCounting the combinations with the same number of A and B gives the following table:\nAs shown in the table, the total number of combinations that have the same number of A alleles as of B alleles is six, and the probability of this combination is 6/16. The total number of other combinations is ten, so the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, quite possibly, the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. The situation of equal numbers is actually less likely than unequal numbers. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example, the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as a population bottleneck.\nThe probabilities for the number of copies of allele A (or B) that survive (given in the last column of the above table) can be calculated directly from the binomial distribution, where the \"success\" probability (probability of a given allele being present) is 1/2 (i.e., the probability that there are \"k\" copies of A (or B) alleles in the combination) is given by:\nformula_2\nwhere \"n=4\" is the number of surviving bacteria.\nMathematical models.\nMathematical models of genetic drift can be designed using either branching processes or a diffusion equation describing changes in allele frequency in an idealised population.\nWright\u2013Fisher model.\nConsider a gene with two alleles, A or B. In diploidy, populations consisting of \"N\" individuals have 2\"N\" copies of each gene. An individual can have two copies of the same allele or two different alleles. The frequency of one allele is assigned \"p\" and the other \"q\". The Wright\u2013Fisher model (named after Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher) assumes that generations do not overlap (for example, annual plants have exactly one generation per year) and that each copy of the gene found in the new generation is drawn independently at random from all copies of the gene in the old generation. The formula to calculate the probability of obtaining \"k\" copies of an allele that had frequency \"p\" in the last generation is then\nformula_3\nwhere the symbol \"!\" signifies the factorial function. This expression can also be formulated using the binomial coefficient,\nformula_4\nMoran model.\nThe Moran model assumes overlapping generations. At each time step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, the number of copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright\u2013Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright\u2013Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes \"N\" timesteps to get through one generation, where \"N\" is the effective population size. In the Wright\u2013Fisher model, it takes just one.\nIn practice, the Moran and Wright\u2013Fisher models give qualitatively similar results, but genetic drift runs twice as fast in the Moran model.\nOther models of drift.\nIf the variance in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright\u2013Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift (the variance effective population size), genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.\nRandom effects other than sampling error.\nRandom changes in allele frequencies can also be caused by effects other than sampling error, for example random changes in selection pressure.\nOne important alternative source of stochasticity, perhaps more important than genetic drift, is genetic draft. Genetic draft is the effect on a locus by selection on linked loci. The mathematical properties of genetic draft are different from those of genetic drift. The direction of the random change in allele frequency is autocorrelated across generations.\nDrift and fixation.\nThe Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle states that within sufficiently large populations, the allele frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next unless the equilibrium is disturbed by migration, genetic mutations, or selection.\nHowever, in finite populations, no new alleles are gained from the random sampling of alleles passed to the next generation, but the sampling can cause an existing allele to disappear. Because random sampling can remove, but not replace, an allele, and because random declines or increases in allele frequency influence expected allele distributions for the next generation, genetic drift drives a population towards genetic uniformity over time. When an allele reaches a frequency of 1 (100%) it is said to be \"fixed\" in the population and when an allele reaches a frequency of 0 (0%) it is lost. Smaller populations achieve fixation faster, whereas in the limit of an infinite population, fixation is not achieved. Once an allele becomes fixed, genetic drift comes to a halt, and the allele frequency cannot change unless a new allele is introduced in the population via mutation or gene flow. Thus even while genetic drift is a random, directionless process, it acts to eliminate genetic variation over time.\nRate of allele frequency change due to drift.\nAssuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, after \"t\" generations in many replicated populations, starting with allele frequencies of \"p\" and \"q\", the variance in allele frequency across those populations is\n formula_5\nTime to fixation or loss.\nAssuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, at any given time the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the population is simply its frequency in the population at that time. For example, if the frequency \"p\" for allele A is 75% and the frequency \"q\" for allele B is 25%, then given unlimited time the probability A will ultimately become fixed in the population is 75% and the probability that B will become fixed is 25%.\nThe expected number of generations for fixation to occur is proportional to the population size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (\"N\"\"e\") takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.\nOne forward-looking formula used for approximating the expected time before a neutral allele becomes fixed through genetic drift, according to the Wright\u2013Fisher model, is\n formula_6\nwhere \"T\" is the number of generations, \"N\"\"e\" is the effective population size, and \"p\" is the initial frequency for the given allele. The result is the number of generations expected to pass before fixation occurs for a given allele in a population with given size (\"N\"\"e\") and allele frequency (\"p\").\nThe expected time for the neutral allele to be lost through genetic drift can be calculated as\n formula_7\nWhen a mutation appears only once in a population large enough for the initial frequency to be negligible, the formulas can be simplified to\n formula_8\nfor average number of generations expected before fixation of a neutral mutation, and\n formula_9\nfor the average number of generations expected before the loss of a neutral mutation in a population of actual size N.\nTime to loss with both drift and mutation.\nThe formulae above apply to an allele that is already present in a population, and which is subject to neither mutation nor natural selection. If an allele is lost by mutation much more often than it is gained by mutation, then mutation, as well as drift, may influence the time to loss. If the allele prone to mutational loss begins as fixed in the population, and is lost by mutation at rate m per replication, then the expected time in generations until its loss in a haploid population is given by\n formula_10\nwhere formula_11 is Euler's constant. The first approximation represents the waiting time until the first mutant destined for loss, with loss then occurring relatively rapidly by genetic drift, taking time \u226b \"N\"\"e\". The second approximation represents the time needed for deterministic loss by mutation accumulation. In both cases, the time to fixation is dominated by mutation via the term , and is less affected by the effective population size.\nVersus natural selection.\nIn natural populations, genetic drift and natural selection do not act in isolation; both phenomena are always at play, together with mutation and migration. Neutral evolution is the product of both mutation and drift, not of drift alone. Similarly, even when selection overwhelms genetic drift, it can act only on variation that mutation provides.\nWhile natural selection has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations to the current environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance. As a result, drift acts upon the genotypic frequencies within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of alleles that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.\nThe law of large numbers predicts that when the absolute number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift is large enough to overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, but it is not clear how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.\nLow allele frequency makes alleles more vulnerable to being eliminated by random chance, even overriding the influence of natural selection. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly within the population, new advantageous mutations are almost as vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the allele frequency for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.\nPopulation bottleneck.\nA population bottleneck is when a population contracts to a significantly smaller size over a short period of time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.\nThe impact of a population bottleneck can be sustained, even when the bottleneck is caused by a one-time event such as a natural catastrophe.\nAn interesting example of a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases the damage done by recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced as a consequence of the bottleneck, due to genetic purging. This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.\nA population's genetic variation can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climatic change or shift in the available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient genetic variation in the population for natural selection to take place.\nThere have been many known cases of population bottleneck in the recent past. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, North American prairies were habitat for millions of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 birds in the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but a consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to birds in the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low reproductive success.\nHowever, the genetic loss caused by bottleneck and genetic drift can increase fitness, as in \"Ehrlichia\".\nOver-hunting also caused a severe population bottleneck in the northern elephant seal in the 19th century. Their resulting decline in genetic variation can be deduced by comparing it to that of the southern elephant seal, which were not so aggressively hunted.\nFounder effect.\nThe founder effect is a special case of a population bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population in at least some respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.\nA well-documented example is found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis\u2013Van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis\u2013Van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.\nThe difference in gene frequencies between the original population and colony may also trigger the two groups to diverge significantly over the course of many generations. As the difference, or genetic distance, increases, the two separated populations may become distinct, both genetically and phenetically, although not only genetic drift but also natural selection, gene flow, and mutation contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of new species. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his shifting balance theory of speciation. Following after Wright, Ernst Mayr created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size following the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop. However, there is much less support for this view today since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through experimental research and the results have been equivocal at best.\nHistory.\nThe role of random chance in evolution was first outlined by Arend L. Hagedoorn and Anna Cornelia Hagedoorn-Vorstheuvel La Brand in 1921. They highlighted that random survival plays a key role in the loss of variation from populations. Fisher (1922) responded to this with the first, albeit marginally incorrect, mathematical treatment of the \"Hagedoorn effect\". Notably, he expected that many natural populations were too large (an N ~10,000) for the effects of drift to be substantial and thought drift would have an insignificant effect on the evolutionary process. The corrected mathematical treatment and term \"genetic drift\" was later coined by a founder of population genetics, Sewall Wright. His first use of the term \"drift\" was in 1929, though at the time he was using it in the sense of a directed process of change, or natural selection. Random drift by means of sampling error came to be known as the \"Sewall\u2013Wright effect\", though he was never entirely comfortable to see his name given to it. Wright referred to all changes in allele frequency as either \"steady drift\" (e.g., selection) or \"random drift\" (e.g., sampling error). \"Drift\" came to be adopted as a technical term in the stochastic sense exclusively. Today it is usually defined still more narrowly, in terms of sampling error, although this narrow definition is not universal. Wright wrote that the \"restriction of \"random drift\" or even \"drift\" to only one component, the effects of accidents of sampling, tends to lead to confusion\". Sewall Wright considered the process of random genetic drift by means of sampling error equivalent to that by means of inbreeding, but later work has shown them to be distinct.\nIn the early days of the modern evolutionary synthesis, scientists were beginning to blend the new science of population genetics with Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. Within this framework, Wright focused on the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations. He introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks. Wright thought smaller populations were more suited for natural selection because \"inbreeding was sufficiently intense to create new interaction systems through random drift but not intense enough to cause random nonadaptive fixation of genes\".\nWright's views on the role of genetic drift in the evolutionary scheme were controversial almost from the very beginning. One of the most vociferous and influential critics was colleague Ronald Fisher. Fisher conceded genetic drift played some role in evolution, but an insignificant one. Fisher has been accused of misunderstanding Wright's views because in his criticisms Fisher seemed to argue Wright had rejected selection almost entirely. To Fisher, viewing the process of evolution as a long, steady, adaptive progression was the only way to explain the ever-increasing complexity from simpler forms. But the debates have continued between the \"gradualists\" and those who lean more toward the Wright model of evolution where selection and drift together play an important role.\nIn 1968, Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most of the genetic changes are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.\nThe role of genetic drift by means of sampling error in evolution has been criticized by John H. Gillespie and William B. Provine, who argue that selection on linked sites is a more important stochastic force.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, its population was 375,752; an increase of 16.9% since the 2010 United States Census. Its county seat is Naples, where the county offices were moved from Everglades City in 1962. Collier County comprises the Naples\u2013Marco Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which, along with the Cape Coral-Fort Myers (Lee County) MSA and the Clewiston (Hendry County, Glades County) Micropolitan Statistical Area (\u03bcSA), is included in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers-Naples Combined Statistical Area (CSA).\nHistory.\nArchaeology at Platt Island in the Big Cypress National Preserve shows humans settled in what is now Collier County more than 2000 years ago. The Calusa people had an extensive presence in the area when Europeans arrived.\nThe county was created in 1923 from Lee County. It was named for Barron Collier, a New York City advertising mogul and real estate developer who had moved to Southwest Florida and established himself as a prominent landowner. He agreed to build the Tamiami Trail for what was then Lee County (comprising today's Collier, Hendry, and Lee Counties) in exchange for favorable consideration with the state legislature to have a county named for him. After Collier County was named, Collier was quoted as saying: \"When I first came here on holiday with Juliet, I never expected that I would buy a whole region of it, nor did I expect to pay for the new Tamiami Trail, or half the things I've done. But I really didn't expect to have a whole county named after me.\"\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (13.3%) are covered by water. It is the largest county in Florida by land area and fourth-largest by total area. Virtually the entire southeastern portion of the county lies within the Big Cypress National Preserve. The northernmost portion of Everglades National Park extends into the southern coastal part of the county. Chokoloskee, Florida is in the county. The total area of this county is nearly one and a half times the size of Rhode Island, which is the smallest state, and is bigger than Rhode Island and Luxembourg combined.\nAdjacent counties.\nCollier County is located at the southern end of Florida's Gulf Coast, and bounded by:\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nThe county continues to experience significant growth and is becoming increasingly diverse.

Set in Thailand, it is the story of a young backpacker's search for a legendary, idyllic and isolated beach untouched by tourism, and his time there in its small, international community of backpackers.\nIn 2000, it was adapted into a film directed by Danny Boyle and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet, Tilda Swinton and Robert Carlyle. In 2003, the novel was listed on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\nPlot summary.\nRichard, an English backpacker, is given a map to a hidden island beach by a mentally ill Scot going by the alias of Daffy Duck at a hotel in Bangkok. Daffy tells Richard about the beautiful island with a hidden lagoon and beach, located in the Gulf of Thailand, and shortly after leaving him the map, Daffy commits suicide. Richard is intrigued and, with travelling French couple \u00c9tienne and Fran\u00e7oise, sets out to try to find the beach. En route, Richard gives a copy of the map to Sammy and Zeph, two Americans he meets on Koh Samui.\nWhen the three finally reach the hidden beach \u2013 bypassing the island's cannabis field on the way \u2013 they discover a group of approximately 30 backpackers who have left the outside world to live a slow-paced, largely self-sufficient life of leisure under the \"de facto\" leadership of an American woman called Sal and her South African lover Bugs who, along with Daffy, founded the community. Initially suspicious of the newcomers, the group accepts the trio when they explain about Daffy's map and his death back on the mainland.\nFor several months, Richard finds life on the island idyllic, fishing in the mornings and relaxing the rest of the time. He befriends a few other members of the community including fellow Englishmen Keaty, from London, and Jed, the loner of the group and the island's assigned guardian.\nThings start to unravel when an unfortunate food poisoning incident leads to a divide in the group, and some of the islanders on fishing duty are attacked by a shark. One is killed and another injured, who is tended to by Jed, leaving Richard as lone sentry. The remaining fisherman who was attacked suffers mental trauma. \nSpending long hours alone in the forest as he hikes between lookout spots, Richard begins to experience hallucinations in which Daffy appears. Richard comes to understand why Daffy killed himself, and why Daffy gave him the map and spread rumours about the beach.\nZeph, Sammy and some German backpackers make their way to the island via a makeshift raft; however, they are discovered and killed by the cannabis farmers.\nWhen Sal obliquely asks Richard to kill the seemingly insane surviving fisherman because of the threat he poses to the group's now-fragile social integrity, Richard convinces \u00c9tienne, Fran\u00e7oise, Jed and a paranoid Keaty to leave the beach for good. This plan is disrupted when the armed cannabis farmers arrive, beating up Richard for copying the map and leaving the backpackers' bloodied corpses as a warning. The islanders turn on Richard, who is saved by Fran\u00e7oise, \u00c9tienne, Keaty, and Jed armed with fishing spears, and they successfully make their planned escape on the raft.\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that the five friends got away and split up when they reached the mainland. Richard still maintains contact with Keaty and Jed. Richard wonders whether anyone else got off the island, and finishes by saying he is content with his life, although he carries a lot of scars.\nInfluences.\nGarland wrote the book while living in the Philippines and, in particular, was inspired by similar geography on the island of Palawan.\nReception.\nNovelist Nick Hornby referred to \"The Beach\" as \"a \"Lord of the Flies\" for Generation X\", and the \"Sunday Oregonian\" called it \"Generation X's first great novel\". \"The Washington Post\" wrote that it is \"a furiously intelligent first novel\" and \"a book that moves with the kind of speed and grace many older writers can only day-dream about.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that \"Garland is a good storyteller, though, and Richard's nicotine-fueled narrative of how the denizens of the beach see their community shatter and break into factions is taut with suspense, even if the bloody conclusion offers few surprises\".\nFilm adaptation.\n\"The Beach\" was adapted as a film released in 2000, directed by Danny Boyle, and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Robert Carlyle, Virginie Ledoyen, and Guillaume Canet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born in Prague and died in Breslau. He was the founder and the most eminent member of the school of positive-historical Judaism, which advocates freedom of research while upholding the authority of traditional Jewish belief and practice. This school of thought was the intellectual progenitor of Conservative Judaism.\nThrough his father, he was a descendant of the Vienna exiles of 1670 and of the famous rabbinical Spira family; on his mother's side he descended from the Fischel family, which has given the community of Prague a number of distinguished Talmudists. He received his early Jewish education at the yeshiva of Bezalel Ronsburg (Daniel Rosenbaum). In 1825 he went to Budapest, where he prepared himself for the university, from which he graduated in 1831. In the following year he was appointed district rabbi (\"Kreisrabbiner\") of Litom\u011b\u0159ice by the government, being the first rabbi in Bohemia with a modern education. He made Teplice his seat, where the congregation, the largest in the district, had elected him rabbi. He was called to Dresden in 1836 as chief rabbi, and was confirmed in this position by the Saxon government. In 1843 he was invited to become the chief rabbi at Berlin, which position had been vacant since 1800. However, after a long correspondence he declined, chiefly because the Prussian government, in accordance with its fixed policy, refused to officially recognize the office. He remained in Dresden until 1854, when he was called to the presidency of the Breslau seminary, where he remained until his death.\nReligious attitude.\nFrankel held that reason based on scholarship, and not mere desire on the part of the laity, must be the justification for any reforms within Judaism. In this sense Frankel declared himself when the president of the Teplice congregation expressed the hope that the new rabbi would introduce reforms and do away with the \"Missbr\u00e4uche\" (abuses). He stated that he knew of no abuses; and that if there were any, it was not at all the business of the laity to interfere in such matters (Brann, in his \"Jahrbuch,\" 1899, pp.\u00a0109 et seq.).\nHe introduced some slight modifications in Jewish prayer services such as: the abrogation of some hymns, the introduction of a choir of boys, and the like. He was opposed to any innovation which was objectionable to Jewish sentiment. In this respect, his denunciation of the action of the \"Landesrabbiner\" Joseph Hoffmann of Saxe-Meiningen, who permitted Jewish high-school boys to write on the Sabbath, is very significant (\"Orient,\" iii. 398 et seq.).\nHis position in the controversy on the new Hamburg prayer book (1842) displeased both parties; the liberals were dissatisfied because, instead of declaring that their prayer-book was in accord with Jewish tradition, he pointed out inconsistencies from the historical and dogmatic points of view; and the Orthodox were dissatisfied because he declared changes in the traditional ritual permissible (l.c. iii. 352\u2013363, 377\u2013384).\nA great impression was produced by his letter of 18 July 1845, published in a Frankfurt-am-Main journal, in which he announced his secession from the rabbinical conference then in session in that city. He said that he could not cooperate with a body of rabbis who had passed a resolution declaring the Hebrew language unnecessary for public worship. This letter made Frankel one of the leaders of the conservative element. In opposition to the rabbinical conferences, he planned conventions of scholars. His principles were enunciated in his monthly \"Journal of the Religious Interests of Judaism\", which he published from 1844 onward. But Frankel's conciliatory attitude was bound to create for him enemies on both liberal and orthodox sides, and such was the case with Abraham Geiger and Samson Raphael Hirsch, respectively.\nControversy.\nFrankel was chosen president of the new rabbinical seminary at Breslau (10 August 1854). Geiger, who had inspired Jonas Fr\u00e4nkel, the president of his congregation, to found this institution, opposed the appointment vigorously, and when the examination questions given by Frankel to the first graduating class appeared, Geiger published them in a German translation with the evident intention of ridiculing his methods of Talmudic instruction as sophistry (Geiger, \"J\u00fcd. Zeit.\" i. 169 et seq.).\nSamson Raphael Hirsch, immediately on the opening of the seminary, addressed an open letter to Frankel, demanding a statement as to the religious principles which would guide the instruction at the new institution. Frankel ignored the challenge. When the fourth volume of Heinrich Graetz's history appeared, Hirsch impeached the orthodoxy of the new institution (1856), and his attacks became more systematic when Frankel in 1859 published his Hebrew introduction to the Mishnah. The first attack began with the letter of Jedidiah Gottlieb Fischer, rabbi of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, published in Hirsch's \"Jeschurun\", 1860. Hirsch himself began in the following year a series of articles in which he took exception to some of Frankel's statements, especially to his definition of rabbinical tradition, which he found vague; he further objected to Frankel's conception of the rabbinical controversies, which were, according to Frankel, improperly decided by certain devices common in parliamentary bodies.\nIt can hardly be denied that Frankel evaded the clear definition of what \"tradition\" meant to him. He contented himself with proving from Rabbenu Asher that not everything called a \"law\", and reputed as given by Moses on Mount Sinai, was actually of Mosaic origin. Hirsch was seconded by various Orthodox rabbis, such as Ezriel Hildesheimer, Solomon Klein of Colmar, and Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, while some of Frankel's supporters, like Salomon Juda Rappoport, were half-hearted. Frankel but once published a brief statement in his magazine, in which, however, he failed to give an outspoken exposition of his views (\"Monatsschrift\", 1861, pp.\u00a0159 et seq.). The general Jewish public remained indifferent to the whole controversy, and Frankel's position was gradually strengthened by the number of graduates from the seminary who earned reputations as scholars and as representatives of conservative Judaism.\nLiterary activity.\nFrankel began his literary career rather late. His first independent publication was his work on the Jewish oath, \"Jewish Oaths in Theology and History\" (Dresden, 1840, 2d ed. 1847). This work owed its origin to a political question. The law of 16 August 1838, had improved the position of the Jews in Saxony, but still discriminated with regard to the Jewish oath, which was to be taken under conditions which seemed to involve the supposition that a Jew could not fully be trusted in his testimony before a civil court. Frankel proved that no Jewish doctrine justified such an assumption, and owing to his work, a new regulation (13 February 1840) put the Jews on the same basis as Christians as regards testimony in court.\nBiblical studies.\nHis second great work was his \"Historical-Critical Studies on the Septuagint as Addition to the \"Targumim \"Contributions: Preliminary Studies for the Septuagint\" (Leipzig, 1841). To the same category belong three later works: \"On the Influence of Palestinian Exegesis on Alexandrian Hermeneutics\" (Leipzig, 1851); \"About Palestinian and Alexandrian Writing Research\" published in the program for the opening of the Breslau seminary (Breslau, 1854); and \"On the Targum of the Prophets\" (Breslau, 1872).\nIn all these works it was his object to show that the exegesis of the Alexandrian Jews, and with it that of the early Church Fathers, was dependent on Talmudic exegesis. In this investigation he became a pioneer, and many of his disciples followed him with similar investigations, not only of the Septuagint, but also of the Vulgate and of the Peshitta. A political motive was involved in his study on legal procedure, \"Der Gerichtliche Beweis nach Mosaisch-Talmudischem Rechte: Ein Beitrag zur Kenntnis des Mosaisch-Talmudischen Criminal-und Civilrechts: Nebst einer Untersuchung \u00fcber die Preussische Gesetzgebung Hinsichtlich des Zeugnisses der Juden\" (Berlin, 1846). The law of Prussia discriminated against the Jews insofar as the testimony of a Jew against a Christian was valid only in civil cases, and in these only when they involved a sum less than fifty thalers. It was due to Frankel's work, which was cited as an authority in the Prussian Diet, that the new law of 23 July 1847 referring to the Jews, abolished this discrimination.\nIntroduction to Mishnah.\nFrankel's duties as professor of Talmudic literature showed him the necessity of modern scientific text-books on rabbinical literature and archeology. To this necessity are due his introduction to the Mishnah, \"Darkei ha-Mishnah\" (Leipzig, 1859), with a supplement and index under the title \"Tosafot u-Mafteah; le-Sefer Darkei ha-Mishnah\" (1867).\nOf the storm which this book created mention has been made already. It is one of the most valuable attempts at a systematized exposition of the history of early rabbinical literature and theology, and has largely inspired subsequent works of that kind, as those of Jacob Br\u00fcll and Isaac H. Weiss. His outline of rabbinical marriage law, \"Grundlinien des Mosaisch-Talmudischen Eherechts\" (Breslau, 1860), was likewise meant to serve as a textbook on that subject, as was also his attempt at a history of the post-Talmudic literature of sophistry, \"Entwurf einer Geschichte der Literatur der Nachtalmudischen Responsen\" (Breslau, 1865), which, however, is considered the weakest of his works.\nFrankel's studies in the history of Talmudic literature had convinced him that the neglect of the Jerusalem Talmud was a serious drawback in the critical investigation of the development of Talmudic law. To this field he determined to devote the remainder of his life. In 1870 he published his introduction to the Jerusalem Talmud under the title \"Mebo ha-Yerushalmi\" (Breslau). He afterward began a critical edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, with a commentary, but only three treatises had appeared, Berakot and Peah (Vienna, 1874) and Demai (Breslau, 1875), when his death intervened.\nHe wrote frequently for the two magazines which he edited, the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Religi\u00f6sen Interessen des Judenthums\" (Leipzig, 1844\u201346), and the \"Monatsschrift f\u00fcr die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums\", begun in 1851, and which he edited until 1868, when Graetz succeeded him as editor. Though a son of the rationalistic era which produced two of its most intense partisans, Peter Beer and Herz Homberg in his native city, Frankel developed, partly through opposition to shallow rationalism and partly through the romantic environments of the ancient city of Prague, that love and sympathy for the past that made him the typical expounder of the historical school which was known as the \"Breslau school.\"\nHis marriage with Rachel Meyer was childless.\nZacharias Frankel College.\nZacharias Frankel College, a conservative yeshiva in Berlin, is named after him.\nThe Yeshiva is headed by Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson.\nIn 2017, Nitzan Stein Kokin, who was German, became the first person to graduate from Zacharias Frankel College, which also made her the first Conservative rabbi to be ordained in Germany since before World War II.\nMarriage.\nHe married Rachel Maier of Teplice. Through her mother, she was the great-granddaughter of Isak Landesmann of Police u Jemnice, who was remembered as a notable victim of eighteenth century antisemitism.\nPopular culture.\nIn Chaim Potok's best-selling novel \"The Chosen\", the protagonist, Reuven Malter, does research for his father's book in the library at the fictional \"Zechariah Frankel Seminary,\" patterned after the real-life Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

White was among those who sailed with Richard Grenville in the first attempt to colonize Roanoke Island in 1585, acting as artist and mapmaker to the expedition. He would most famously briefly serve as the governor of the second attempt to found Roanoke Colony on the same island in 1587 and discover the colonists had mysteriously vanished.\nDuring his time at Roanoke Island, he made several watercolor sketches of the surrounding landscape and the native Algonkin peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a Native American society of the Eastern seaboard; all of the surviving original watercolors are now preserved in the print room of the British Museum.\nIn 1587, White became governor of Sir Walter Raleigh's failed attempt at a permanent settlement on Roanoke Island, known to history as the \"Lost Colony\". This was the earliest effort to establish a permanent English colony in the New World. White's granddaughter Virginia Dare was the first English child born in North America. In late 1587, White returned to England for supplies. The return expedition was delayed due to various reasons, including the Spanish Armada. Governor White finally returned to Roanoke Island in August 1590, but found the colony had been long deserted.\nAfter the failure of the colony, White retired to Raleigh's estates in Ireland, reflecting upon the \"evils and unfortunate events\" which had ruined his hopes in America, though never giving up hope that his daughter and granddaughter were still alive.\nEarly life.\nJohn White's exact date of birth is unknown but it seems likely he was born sometime in the 1530s\u20131540s. White is known to have attended church in the parish of St Martin, Ludgate in London. In 1566, he married Tomasyn Cooper; with whom he had a son, Thomas, who died young, and a daughter, Eleanor. Little is known of White's training as an artist but it is possible that he apprenticed as an illustrator under a London master.\nCareer.\nIn the late sixteenth century, efforts to establish an English colony in the New World began to gain momentum, and White soon became an enthusiastic supporter. In 1577, White may have accompanied Martin Frobisher to search for precious metals and a northwest passage to Asia on his Baffin Island and Greenland expeditions. Despite this, White was not mentioned by name. His drawings from this period were of the lands and people encountered on the voyage. In 1585, White accompanied the expedition led by Sir Ralph Lane to attempt to found the first English colony in North America. White was sent by Sir Walter Raleigh as Sir Richard Grenville's artist-illustrator on his first voyage to the New World; working closely with the scientist Thomas Harriot, he served as mapmaker and artist to the expedition, which encountered considerable difficulties and returned to England in 1586.\nGentleman artist.\nIn 1585, White had been commissioned to \"draw to life\" the inhabitants of the New World and their surroundings. During White's time at Roanoke Island, he completed numerous watercolor drawings of the surrounding landscape and native peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a Native American society of the Eastern Seaboard, and predate the first body of \"discovery voyage art\" created in the late 18th century by the artists who sailed with Captain James Cook. They represent the sole-surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of America encountered by England's first settlers.\nWhite's enthusiasm for watercolor was unusual \u2013 most contemporary painters preferred to use oil-based paints. White's watercolors would soon become a sensation in Europe; it was not long before the watercolors were engraved by the Flemish master engraver Theodor de Bry. Through the medium of print, the illustrations became widely known and distributed; they were published in 1590 under the title \"America\".\nGovernor of the Roanoke colony.\nAfter Lane's colonists returned to England in 1586, Sir Walter Raleigh, who held the land patent for the proposed English colony of Virginia, tasked White with the job of organising a new settlement in the Chesapeake Bay area, one which would be self-sustaining and which would include women and children. During 1586, White was able to persuade 113 prospective colonists to join Raleigh's expedition, including his daughter Eleanor and his son-in-law Ananias Dare, recently married at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street. His efforts did not go unrewarded; on 7 January 1587, Raleigh named \"John White of London Gentleman, to be the chief Governor\" of the new colony. White, with thirteen others, were incorporated under the name of \"The Governor and Assistants of the Cities of Raleigh of Virginia\".\nArrival at Roanoke.\nIn May 1587, White's colonists sailed for Virginia in the \"Lion\". They were guided by the Portuguese navigator Sim\u00e3o Fernandes, the same pilot who had led the 1585 expedition and who was given by his fellow sailors the unhappy nickname of \"the swine.\" The settlers' chosen destination was not Roanoke but the Chesapeake Bay. But, upon reaching Roanoke in late July, and allowing the colonists to disembark, Fernandez refused to let White's men re-board the ship.\nAccording to White's journal, Fernandez's deputy \"called to the sailors in the pinesse, charging them not to bring any of the planters [settlers] back again, but leave them on the island.\" Faced with what amounted to a mutiny by his navigator, White appears to have backed down and acquiesced in this sudden change of plan. Despite the governor's protests, Fernandez held that \"summer was farre spent [summer was almost over], wherefore hee would land all the planters in no other place.\"\nThis second colony at Roanoke set about repairing the structures left behind in 1585. They also searched for the fifteen men left behind by the previous expedition, but found only bones. From an early stage there were tensions with the local Algonquian Indians, though initially things went well. White quickly made contact with friendly natives led by Chief Manteo, who explained to him that the lost fifteen had been killed by hostile Secotan, Aquascogoc, and Dasamongueponke warriors, choosing a time and place of attack \"of great advantage to the savages.\"\nOn 8 August 1587, White led a dawn attack on the Dasamongueponkes that went disastrously wrong. White and his soldiers entered the Dasamongueponke village in the morning \"so early that it was yet dark,\" but mistakenly attacked a group of hitherto friendly Indians, killing one and wounding many. \"We were deceived,\" wrote White in his journal, \"for the savages were our friends.\" Henceforth, relations with the local tribes would steadily deteriorate.\nVirginia Dare.\nOn 18 August 1587, there was happier news \u2013 White became a grandfather. \"Eleanor, daughter to the governor and wife to Ananias Dare, one of the assistants, was delivered of a daughter in Roanoke.\" The child was healthy and \"was christened there the Sunday following, and because this child was the first Christian born in Virginia, she was named Virginia.\"\nWhite returns to England.\nHowever, the colonists' food supplies soon began to grow short, and in late 1587 the settlers pressed White to return to England \"for the better and sooner obtaining of supplies, and other necessaries.\" Because the colony had been deposited in Roanoke rather than the Chesapeake area, supply ships from England ignorant of Fernandez's change of plan would most likely not land in Roanoke at all, and the settlement might not survive the coming winter. White was reluctant to abandon his colony, anxious that his enemies in England \"would not spare to slander [him] falsely\" should he leave, and worried that his \"stuff and goods might be spoiled and most of it pilfered away.\" Eventually the colonists agreed to stand surety for White's belongings and he was prevailed upon to sail, \"much against his will,\" to seek help.\nMisfortune struck White's return to England from the beginning. The anchor of the flyboat on which White was quartered could not be raised, and many crew members were severely injured during the attempt. Worse, their journey home was delayed by \"scarce and variable winds\" followed by \"a storm at the north-east,\" and many sailors starved or died of scurvy. On 16 October 1587 the desperate crew, at last, landed in Smerwicke, in the west of Ireland, and White was finally able to make his way back to Southampton.\nAmir.\nFurther bad news awaited White on his return to England. Just two weeks previously Queen Elizabeth I had issued a general \"stay of shipping,\" preventing any ships from leaving English shores. The reason was the \"invincible fleetes made by the King of Spain, joined with the power of the Pope, for the invading of England\" \u2013 the Spanish Armada. White's patron Sir Walter Raleigh attempted to provide ships to rescue the colony but he was over-ruled by the Queen.\n\"Brave\" and the \"Roe\".\nIn early 1588, White was able to scrape together a pair of small pinnaces, the \"Brave\" and the \"Roe\", which were unsuitable for military service and could be spared for the expedition to Roanoke. Unluckily for White, they were barely suited for the Atlantic crossing and the governor endured further bad luck as the ships were intercepted by French pirates, who \"playd extreemely upon us with their shot,\" hitting White (to his great embarrassment) \"in the side of the buttoke.\" White and his crew escaped to England with their lives, but \"they robbed us of all our victuals, powder, weapons and provision,\" and the journey to Virginia had to be abandoned. By this stage White appears to have formed the view that he was born under \"an unlucky star.\"\nReturn to the \"Lost Colony\".\nFinally, in March 1590, with the immediate threat of a Spanish invasion by now abated, Raleigh was able to equip White's rescue expedition. Two ships, the \"Hopewell\" and the \"Moonlight\" set sail for Roanoke. The return journey was prolonged by extensive privateering and several sea battles, and White's eventual landing at the Outer Banks was further imperiled by poor weather. The landing was hazardous and was beset by bad conditions and adverse currents. During the landing on Roanoke, of the mariners who accompanied White, \"seven of the chiefest were drowned.\"\nGovernor White finally reached Roanoke Island on 18 August 1590, his granddaughter's (Virginia Dare) third birthday, but he found his colony had been long deserted. The buildings had collapsed and \"the houses [were] taken downe.\" The few clues about the colonists' whereabouts included the letters \"CRO\" carved into a tree, and the word \"CROATOAN\" carved on a post of the fort. Croatoan was the name of a nearby island (likely modern-day Hatteras Island) and of a local tribe of Native Americans. Roanoke Island was originally not a planned location for the colony and the idea of moving elsewhere had been discussed. Before the Governor's departure, he and the colonists had agreed that a message would be carved into a tree if they had moved and would include an image of a Maltese Cross if the decision was made by force. White found no such cross and was hopeful that his family were still alive.\nTrue to their word, the colonists had looked after White's belongings, which had been carefully buried and hidden. However, local Indians had looted the hiding place, and White found \"about the place many of my things spoyled and broken, and my books torne from the covers, the frames of some of my pictures and mappes rotten and spoyled with rayne, and my armour almost eaten through with rust.\"\nDue to the weather, which \"grew to be fouler and fouler,\" White had to abandon the search of adjacent islands for the colonists. The ship's captain had already lost three anchors and could not afford the loss of another. White returned to Plymouth, England, on 24 October 1590.\nThe loss of the colony was a personal tragedy for White, from which he never fully recovered. He would never return to the New World, and in a letter to Richard Hakluyt he wrote that he must hand over the fate of the colonists and his family \"to the merciful help of the Almighty, whom I most humbly beseech to helpe and comfort them.\"\nLater life.\nLittle is known of White's life after the failure of the Roanoke Colony. He lived in Plymouth, and also owned a house at Newtown, Kylmore (Kilmore, County Cork), Ireland. He appears to have been in Ireland living on the estates of Sir Walter Raleigh, making maps of land for Raleigh's tenants, and reflecting upon the \"evils and unfortunate events\" which had ruined his hopes in the New World, though never giving up hope that his daughter and granddaughter were still alive.\nWhite's year of death is unclear and not widely known. The last surviving document related to White is a letter he wrote from Ireland in 1593 to the publisher of the prints of his Roanoke drawings. However, a record from May 1606 that Bridget White, who was appointed estate administrator for her brother \"John White\", may refer to him. Furthermore, another two documents give his year of death as 1606. \nLegacy.\nWhite is chiefly remembered today for his watercolors, which represent a unique record of 16th-century Algonquian society. All of White's surviving works are now in the print room of the British Museum.\nIn 2007, the British Museum placed the entire group of John White's watercolors on public display under the collection, \"\"A New World: England's First View of America\".\" There are more than seventy watercolors in the travelling exhibit. There were plans to show the collection at the North Carolina Museum of History.\nThe World War II Liberty ship was named in his honor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72032", "revid": "50180924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72032", "title": "Commodore 128", "text": "Home computer released in 1985\nThe Commodore 128, also known as the C128, is the last 8-bit home computer that was commercially released by Commodore Business Machines (CBM). Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas, it appeared three years after its predecessor, the Commodore 64, the bestselling computer of the 1980s. Approximately 2.5 million C128s were sold during its four-year production run.\nThe C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64, with nearly full compatibility. It is housed in a redesigned case with an improved keyboard including a numeric keypad and function keys. Memory was enlarged to 128\u00a0KB of RAM in two 64\u00a0KB banks. A separate graphics chip provided 80-column color video output in addition to the original C64 modes. It also included a Zilog Z80 CPU which allows the C128 to run CP/M, as an alternative to the usual Commodore BASIC environment. The huge CP/M software library, coupled with the C64's software library, gave the C128 one of the broadest ranges of available software among its competitors.\nThe primary hardware designer of the C128 was Bil Herd, who had worked on the Plus/4. Other hardware engineers were Dave Haynie and Frank Palaia, while the IC design work was done by Dave DiOrio. The main Commodore system software was developed by Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan, while the CP/M subsystem was developed by Von Ertwine.\nDesign.\nThe C128's complex architecture includes four differently accessed kinds of RAM (128\u00a0KB main RAM, 16\u201364\u00a0KB VDC video RAM, 2\u00a0kNibbles VIC-II Color RAM, 2-KB floppy-drive RAM on C128Ds, 0, 128 or 512\u00a0KB REU RAM), two or three CPUs (main: 8502, Z80 for CP/M; the 128D also incorporates a 6502 in the disk drive), and two different video chips (VIC-IIe and VDC) for its various operational modes.\nThe C128 does not perform a system RAM test on power-up like previous Commodore machines. Instead of the single 6510 microprocessor of the C64, the C128 incorporates a two-CPU design. The primary CPU, the 8502, is a slightly improved version of the 6510, capable of being clocked at 2\u00a0MHz. The second CPU is a Zilog Z80 which is used to run CP/M software, as well as to initiate operating-mode selection at boot time.\nThe C128's keyboard includes four cursor keys, , , and keys and a numeric keypad. None of these were present on the C64 which had only two cursor keys, requiring the use of the key to move the cursor up or left. This alternate arrangement was retained on the 128, for use under C64 mode. The lack of a numeric keypad, , and on the C64 was an issue with some CP/M productivity software when used with the C64's Z80 cartridge. A keypad was requested by many C64 owners who spent long hours entering machine language type-in programs. Many of the added keys matched counterparts present on the IBM PC's keyboard and made the new computer more attractive to business software developers. While the 128's 40-column mode closely duplicates that of the C64, an extra 1K of color RAM is made available to the programmer, as it is multiplexed through memory address 1.\nThe design of the C128's power supply is different from that used with the C64. Although it is much larger, the new power supply is equipped with cooling vents and a replaceable fuse.\nEarly versions of the C128 occasionally experience temperature-related reliability issues due to the use of an RF shield over the main circuit board. The shield was equipped with fingers that contacted the tops of the major chips, ostensibly causing the shield to act as a large heat sink. A combination of poor contact between the shield and the chips, the inherently limited heat conductivity of plastic chip packages, as well as the relatively poor thermal conductivity of the shield itself, resulted in overheating and failure in some cases. The SID sound chip is particularly vulnerable in this respect. The most common remedy is to remove the shield, which Commodore had added late in development to comply with FCC radio-frequency regulations.\nThe C128 has three operating modes. \"C128 Mode\" (native mode) runs at 1 or 2\u00a0MHz with the 8502 CPU and has both 40- and 80-column text modes available. \"CP/M Mode\" uses both the Z80 and the 8502, and is able to function in both 40- and 80-column text mode. \"C64 Mode\" is nearly 100 percent compatible with the earlier computer. Selection of these modes is implemented via the Z80 chip. The Z80 controls the bus on initial boot-up and checks to see if there is a CP/M disk in the drive, if there are any C64/C128 cartridges present, or if the Commodore key (which serves as the C64-mode selector) is being depressed on boot-up. Based on these conditions, it will switch to the appropriate mode of operation.\nModes.\nC128.\nIn 1984, a year before the release of the Commodore 128, Commodore released the Plus/4. Although targeted at a low-end business market that could not afford the relatively high cost and training requirements of early IBM PC compatibles, it was perceived by the Commodore press as a follow-up to the 64 and would be expected to improve upon that model's capabilities. While the C64's graphics and sound capabilities were generally considered excellent, the response to the Plus/4 was one of disappointment. Upon the Plus/4's introduction, repeated recommendations were made in the Commodore press for a new computer called the \"C-128\" with increased RAM capacity, an 80-column display as was standard in business computers, a new BASIC programming language that made it easy for programmers to use the computer's graphics and sound without resorting to PEEK and POKEs, a new disk drive that improved upon the 1541's notoriously slow default transfer rate (without fastloader), as well as total C64 compatibility.\nA new chip, the VDC, provides the C128 with an 80-column color CGA-compatible display (also called \"RGBI\" for \"red-green-blue plus intensity\"). The then-new 8502 microprocessor is completely backward-compatible with the C64's 6510, but can run at double the speed if desired. The C64's Commodore BASIC 2.0 was replaced with BASIC 7.0, which includes structured programming commands from the Plus/4's BASIC 3.5, as well as keywords designed specifically to take advantage of the machine's capabilities. A sprite editor and machine language monitor were added. The screen-editor part of the Kernal was further improved to support an insert mode and other features accessed through ESC-key combinations, as well as a rudimentary windowing feature, and was relocated to a separate ROM. The VIC-II chip which controls the 40-column display can only operate at 1\u00a0MHz, so the 40-column display appears jumbled in codice_1 mode. In 80-column mode the editor takes advantage of VDC features to provide blinking and underlined text, activated through escape codes, in addition to the standard Commodore reverse text. The C128's 80-column mode can display lowercase characters along with PETSCII graphics characters; 40-column mode is subject to the same \"upper- and lowercase\" or \"uppercase-plus-graphics\" restriction as earlier Commodores. The 40- and 80-column modes are independent and both can be active at the same time. A programmer with both a composite and RGB display can use one of the screens as a \"scratchpad\" or for rudimentary multiple buffer support. The active display can be switched with . A hardware reset button was added to the system. The keyboard, however, was not switched to the Selectric layout as had become standard, instead retaining the same ADM-3A-derived design as on Commodore's prior models.\nNTSC C128s will work with any CGA-type monitor (TTL RGB @ 15\u00a0kHz/60\u00a0Hz) such as the IBM 5153. However, PAL models of the C128 operate at 50\u00a0Hz and aren't compatible with most CGA monitors, which expect a 60\u00a0Hz refresh rate.\nTwo new disk drives were introduced in conjunction with the C128: the short-lived single-sided 1570 and the double-sided 1571. A dual-disk 1572 model was announced but never produced. Later on, the 3.5-inch 1581 was introduced. The 1581 drive also has more on-board RAM than its predecessors, making it possible to open a larger number of files at one time. BASIC 7.0 includes codice_2 and codice_3 commands to support loading and saving to disk without using the codice_4 or other device number, and also a codice_5 command that reads a disk's catalog information directly to screen memory without overwriting BASIC memory as in BASIC 2.0. In addition, the C128 introduces auto-booting of disk software, a feature standard on most personal computers, but absent from Commodore machines up to that point. Users no longer have to type codice_6. BASIC also added a codice_7 command for removing \"splat\" files (files that were not closed properly and truncated to zero length).\nAll 1571 drives will normally start up in native mode on the C128. If the user switches to C64 mode by typing codice_8, the drive remains in native mode. But if C64 mode is activated by holding the Commodore key down when powering up, the 1571 then goes into 1541 mode. This routine is necessary for software that performs low-level drive access.\nThe C128 has twice the RAM of the C64, a far higher proportion of which is available for BASIC programming, due to the new MMU bank-switching chip. This allows BASIC program code to be stored separately from variables, greatly enhancing the machine's ability to handle complex programs, speeding garbage collection and easing debugging for the programmer. An executing program can be codice_9ped, its code edited, variable values inspected or altered in direct mode, and program execution resumed with the variable table intact using BASIC's codice_10 command. Although other BASICs support the codice_11 command to restart execution without clearing variables, editing any code causes them to be cleared. Different memory configurations can be loaded using BASIC's codice_12 command.\nBASIC 7.0 has a full complement of graphics and sound-handling commands, as well as BASIC 4.0's disk commands and improved garbage cleanup, and support for structured programming via codice_13, and codice_14 loops.\nOn the downside, BASIC 7.0 ran considerably slower than BASIC 2.0 unless 2\u00a0MHz mode was used due to its 28\u00a0KB size (a 250% increase over BASIC 2.0) and having to bank switch to access program variables and BASIC program text (if greater than 16k in length).\nThe 128's ROM contains an easter egg: Entering the command codice_15 in native mode reveals a screen with a listing of the machine's main developers followed by the message codice_16 Also, entering the keywords codice_17 or codice_18 will produce an codice_19. These commands are holdovers from the BASIC interpreter intended for a planned but never-produced LCD portable computer and had been intended to exit from the BASIC interpreter and to ignore keyboard input during sensitive program execution, respectively.\nThe C128's greater hardware capabilities, especially the increased RAM, screen display resolution, and serial bus speed, made it a more capable platform than the C64 for running the GEOS graphical operating system.\nCP/M.\nThe second of the C128's two CPUs is the Zilog Z80, which allows the C128 to run CP/M. The C128 was shipped with CP/M 3.0 (a.k.a. CP/M Plus, which is backward-compatible with CP/M 2.2) and ADM31/3A terminal emulation. A CP/M cartridge had been available for the C64, but it was expensive and of limited use since the 1541 drive cannot read the MFM-formatted disks that CP/M software was distributed on. Software had to be made available on Commodore-specific disks formatted using the GCR encoding scheme. Commodore made versions of \"PerfectCalc\" and the EMACS-derived \"PerfectWriter\" available, and Commodore user groups sometimes had a selection of CP/M diskettes, but the limited software availability negated one of CP/M's chief attractions\u2014its huge software library. In addition, the cartridges only work on early model C64s from 1982 and are incompatible with later units. Since they were also incompatible with the C128, the design team decided to support CP/M by putting the Z80 on the main system board.\nThe C128 runs CP/M noticeably slower than most dedicated CP/M systems, as the Z80 processor runs at an effective speed of only . This was because the C128's system bus was designed around the 65xx CPUs. These CPUs handle data and memory addressing very differently from the Z80. CP/M also ran more slowly for several reasons, such as needing to pass control to the 8502 for any I/O or interrupt processing. For these reasons, few users actually ran CP/M software on the C128.\nWhen the C128 is powered on, the Z80 is active first and executes a small boot loader ROM at $0-$FFF to check for the presence of a CP/M disk. If one is not detected, control is passed to the 8502 and C128 native mode is started.\nCP/M mode in practice requires a 1571 or 1581 drive to be useful, since a 1541 cannot read MFM disks and will run much slower due to not supporting the C128's burst mode. CP/M boot disks nonetheless must be in the drive's native GCR format; MFM disks cannot be booted from, only read once the user is already in CP/M. This is because the code necessary to operate the drive in MFM mode is loaded as part of the boot process. In addition, 80-column mode is generally required since most CP/M software expects an 80-column screen. The C128 emulates an ADM-3A terminal in CP/M mode, so software will have to be set up for that. Aside from the standard ADM-3A terminal commands, a number of extra ones are available to use the VIC-II and VDC's features, including setting the text and background color. The CP/M command interpreter (although not application software) includes a safeguard to prevent the user from issuing a control code to make the text and background the same color, which would render text invisible and force the user to reset the computer. If this happens, it will default to a gray background with brown text.\nCP/M mode is very different from the operating environments familiar to Commodore users. While Commodore DOS is built into the ROM of Commodore disk drives and is usually accessed through BASIC, CP/M requires the use of a boot diskette and requires entry of terse commands inherited from minicomputer platforms. CP/M programs tend to lack the user-friendly nature of most Commodore applications.\nIn CP/M mode, it is possible to run MBASIC, Microsoft's release of BASIC-80 for CP/M. Compared with the native mode BASIC 7.0, MBASIC is terse and limited in its capabilities, requiring the use of terminal-style key combinations to edit program lines or move the text cursor and lacking any sound or graphics features. Moreover, Commodore BASIC has 40-bit floating point which serves as a middle ground between MBASIC's 32-bit floating point and 64-bit double precision variables. MBASIC also offers only 34k of free program space against BASIC 7.0's approximately 90k.\nThe CP/M CBIOS (the part of CP/M that interfaces with the hardware) does not directly interface with the hardware like on most CP/M implementations; rather, it calls the kernal routines for interrupt handling and I/O\u2014when the kernel needs to be used, the Z80 uses routines at $FFD0-$FFEF to pass parameter data to the 8502, which is then activated and the Z80 deactivated. After the kernel routine is finished executing, control is passed back to the Z80. It was reported that the programmer in charge of porting CP/M to the C128 had intended to have the CBIOS interface with the hardware directly in Z80 machine language, but had great difficulty with the VDU chips as they were prone to overheating and self-destructing. The VDU also underwent numerous hardware revisions while the C128 was in development and the CP/M programmer was unable to get his code working properly, so the C128 engineering team requested instead that he simply rewrite the CBIOS to pass function calls to the 8502.\nC64.\nBy incorporating the original C64 BASIC and Kernal ROMs in their entirety (16\u00a0KB total), the C128 achieves almost 100 percent compatibility with the Commodore 64. The C64 mode can be accessed in three ways:\nGrounding the cartridge port's /EXROM and/or /GAME lines will cause the computer to automatically start up in C64 mode. This feature faithfully duplicates the C64's behavior when a cartridge (such as Simons' BASIC) is plugged into the port and asserts either of these lines but, unlike an actual C64, where the memory-map-changing action of these lines is implemented directly in hardware, the C128's Z80 firmware startup code polls these lines on power-up and then switches modes as necessary. C128 native-mode cartridges are recognized and started by the kernel polling defined locations in the memory map.\nC64 mode almost exactly duplicates the features of a hardware C64. The MMU, Z80, and IEC burst mode are disabled in C64 mode, however all other C128 hardware features including the VDU and 2\u00a0MHz mode are still accessible. The extended keys of the C128 keyboard may be read from machine language, although the kernal routines only recognize the keys that exist on the C64. A few games are capable of detecting if a C128 is running and switching to 2\u00a0MHz mode during the vertical retrace for faster performance.\nOn North American C128s, when in C64 mode, even the character (font) ROM changes from that of C128 mode. Early C128 prototypes had a single ROM, with a slightly improved character set over that of the C64. But some C64 programs read the character ROM as data, and will fail in various ways on a C128. Thus, the C128 was given a double-sized character ROM, which delivers the C128 font in C128 mode, and the C64 font in C64 mode. International models of the C128 use the unmodified C64 font in both modes, since the second half of the character ROM is instead dedicated to the international font (containing such things as accented characters or German umlauts).\nSome of the few C64 programs that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the key is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This has to do with the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the key found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left key, the key on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the key in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.\nA handful of C64 programs write to codice_23, often as part of a loop initializing the VIC-II chip registers. This memory-mapped register, unused in the C64, determines the system clock rate. Since this register is fully functional in C64 mode, an inadvertent write can scramble the 40-column display by switching the CPU over to 2\u2013MHz, at which clock rate the VIC-II video processor cannot produce a coherent display. Fortunately, few programs suffer from this flaw. In July 1986, \"COMPUTE!'s Gazette\" published a type-in program that exploited this difference by using a raster interrupt to enable fast mode when the bottom of the visible screen was reached, and then disable it when screen rendering began again at the top. By using the higher clock rate during the vertical blank period, standard video display is maintained while increasing overall execution speed by about 20 percent.\nA few C64 programs would lack sound effects and music because on a C64 the SID chip $D4xx memory page was also mirrored on $D5xx, $D6xx and $D7xx pages, while on a C128 it was only accessible through $D4xx page. This is not a common issue, since the C64 reference guide only describes registers in $D4xx in details while describing $D5xx-$D8xx just as \"SID IMAGES\", making most programs accessing them through $D4xx page and hence have the sound getting played as intended on a C128.\nAn easy way to differentiate between a hardware C64 and a C128 operating in C64 mode, typically used from within a running program, is to write a value different from codice_24 to memory address codice_25, a register which is used to decode the extra keys of the C128 (the numerical keypad and some other keys). On the C64 this memory location will always contain the value codice_26 no matter what is written to it, but on a C128 in C64 mode the value of the location\u2014a memory-mapped register\u2014can be changed. Thus, checking the location's value after writing to it will reveal the actual hardware platform.\nRAM setup.\nTo handle the relatively large amounts of ROM and RAM (tenfold the size of 8502's address space) the C128 uses the 8722 MMU chip to create different memory maps, in which different combinations of RAM and ROM would appear according to bit patterns written into the MMU's configuration register at memory address $FF00. Another feature of the memory management unit is to allow relocation of zero page and the stack.\nAlthough the C128 can theoretically support 256k of RAM in four blocks, the PCB has no provisions to add this extra RAM, nor can the MMU actually access more than 128k. Therefore, if the MMU is programmed to access blocks 2 or 3, all that results is a mirror of the RAM in blocks 0 and 1.\nSince the I/O registers and system ROMs can be disabled or enabled freely, as well as being locatable in either RAM bank and the VIC-II set to use either bank for its memory space, up to 256 memory configurations are possible, although the vast majority of them are useless (for example, unworkable combinations like the kernal ROM in bank 0 and the I/O registers in bank 1 are possible). Because of this, BASIC's BANK statement allows the user to select 15 of the most useful arrangements, with the power-on default being Bank 15. This default places the system ROMs, I/O registers, and BASIC program text in block 0, with block 1 being used by BASIC program variables. BASIC program text and variables can extend all the way to $FFEF. But since block 0 contains the ROMs and I/O registers from $4000 onward, BASIC uses an internal switching routine to read program text higher than $3FFF.\nThe top and bottom 1k of RAM ($0\u2013$3FF and $FF00-$FFFF) are \"shared\" RAM, visible from both blocks. The MMU allows either to be expanded in increments up to 16k. The $0\u2013$3FF range contains the zero page and stack while $FF00-$FFFF contains the MMU registers and reset vectors. These areas are always shared and cannot be switched to non-shared RAM. Shared RAM is always the opposite bank from the one currently being used by the CPU, thus if bank 0 is selected, any read or write to shared RAM will refer to the corresponding locations in bank 1 and vice versa. The VIC-II can be set to use either RAM bank and from there, its normal 16k window. While on the C64, the VIC-II can only see the character ROM in banks 2 and 4 of its memory space, the C128, on the other hand, makes it possible to enable or disable the character ROM for any VIC-II bank via the register at $1. Also, there are two sets of color RAM\u2014one visible to the CPU, the other to the VIC-II and the user may select what chip sees what.\nIn CP/M mode, the Program Segment Prefix and Transient Program Area reside in Bank 1 and the I/O registers and CP/M system code in Bank 0.\nThe C128's RAM is expandable from the standard 128\u00a0KB to 256, 512 or even 1,024\u00a0KB, either by using commercial memory expansion modules, or by making one based on schematics available on the internet.\nCommodore's RAM Expansion Units use an external 8726 DMA controller to transfer data between the C128's RAM and the RAM in the expansion unit.\nC128D.\nLate in 1985, Commodore released a new version of the C128 with a redesigned chassis resembling the Amiga 1000. Called the Commodore 128D, this new European model featured a plastic chassis with a carrying handle on the side, incorporated a 1571 disk drive into the main chassis, replaced the built-in keyboard with a detachable one, and added a cooling fan. The keyboard also featured two folding legs for changing the typing angle.\nThe C128 released in the United Kingdom on 25 July 1985, and in North America in November 1985.\nAccording to Bil Herd, head of the Hardware Team (a.k.a. the \"C128 Animals\"), the C128D was ready for production at the same time as the regular version. Working to release two models at the same time had increased the risk for on-time delivery and was apparent in that the main PCB has large holes in critical sections to support the C128D case and the normal case concurrently.\nIn the latter part of 1986, Commodore released a version of the C128D in North America and parts of Europe referred to as the C128DCR, CR meaning \"cost-reduced\". The DCR model features a stamped-steel chassis in place of the plastic version of the C128D (with no carrying handle), a modular switched-mode power supply similar to that of the C128D, retaining that model's detachable keyboard and internal 1571 floppy drive. A number of components on the mainboard were consolidated to reduce production costs and, as an additional cost-reduction measure, the cooling fan that was fitted to the D model's power supply was removed. However, the mounting provisions on the power supply subchassis were retained, as well as the two 12-volt DC connection points on the power supply's printed circuit board for powering the fan. The C128DCR mounting provision is for a 60\u00a0mm fan.\nA significant improvement introduced with the DCR model was the replacement of the 8563 video display controller (VDC) with the more technically advanced 8568 VDC and equipping it with 64 KB of video RAM\u2014the maximum amount addressable by the device. The four-fold increase in video RAM over that installed in the \"flat\" C128 made it possible, among other things, to maintain multiple text screens in support of a true windowing system, or generate higher-resolution graphics with a more flexible color palette. Little commercial software took advantage of these possibilities.\nThe C128DCR is equipped with new ROMs dubbed the \"1986 ROMs\", so-named from the copyright date displayed on the power-on banner screen. The new ROMs address a number of bugs that are present in the original ROMs, including an infamous off-by-one error in the keyboard decoding table, in which the character would remain lowercase when was active. Some software will only run on the DCR, due to dependencies on the computer's enhanced hardware features and revised ROMs.\nDespite the DCR's improved RGB video capabilities, Commodore did not enhance BASIC 7.0 with the ability to manipulate RGB graphics. Driving the VDC in graphics mode continues to require the use of calls to screen-editor ROM primitives or their assembly language equivalents, or by using third-party BASIC language extensions, such as Free Spirit Software's \"BASIC 8\", which adds high-resolution VDC graphics commands to BASIC 7.0.\nMarket performance.\nBy January 1987, \"Info\" reported that \"All of those rumors about the imminent death of the C128 may have some basis in fact.\" Stating that Commodore wanted to divert resources to increasing 64C production and its PC clones, the magazine stated that, \"The latest word online is that the last C128 will roll off the lines in December of 1987.\" \"Compute!\" stated in 1989, \"If you bought your 128 under the impression that 128-specific software would be plentiful and quick to arrive, you've probably been quite disappointed. One of the 128's major selling points is its total compatibility with the 64, a point that's worked more against the 128 than for it.\" Because the 128 would run virtually all 64 software, and because the next-generation 32/16-bit home computers\u2014primarily the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST\u2014represented the latest technology, relatively little software for the C128's native mode appeared (probably on the order of 100\u2013200 commercial titles, plus the usual share of public domain and magazine type-in programs), leading some users to regret their purchase. While the C128 sold a total number of 4\u00a0million units between 1985 and 1989, its popularity paled in comparison to that of its predecessor.\nSome C64 software such as \"Bard's Tale III\" and \"Kid Niki\" ran in 128 mode without stating this in the documentation, using the autoboot and the 1571's faster disk access. Some Infocom text adventures took advantage of the 80-column screen and increased memory capacity. Some C64 games were ported to native mode like \"Kikstart 2\" and \"The Last V8\" from Mastertronic, which had separate C128 versions, and ' from Origin Systems, which used extra RAM for music if running on the C128. ' from Interstel had separate versions, and took advantage of 80-column display on the C128. However, the vast majority of games were simply run in C64 mode as few developers took advantage of the C128's native performance.\nBy contrast, many C64 productivity software titles were ported to the C128, including the popular PaperClip and Paperback Writer series. This software used the extra memory, 80-column screen, enhanced keyboard and large-capacity disk drives to provide features that were considered essential for business use. With its advanced BASIC programming language, CP/M compatibility and \"user-friendly\" native software packages such as Jane, Commodore attempted to create a low-end business market for the C128 similar to its strategy with the Plus/4, even distancing itself from the home computer label by branding the C128 a \"Personal Computer\" on the case. Significantly, the C128 was the first Commodore computer to advertise its use of Microsoft BASIC, where the Microsoft name would have been a competitive asset.\nPeople who wanted business machines bought IBM PC clones almost exclusively by the time the C128 was released. The availability of low-cost IBM compatibles like the Leading Edge Model D and Tandy 1000 that, in some cases, sold for less than a complete C128 system derailed Commodore's small business computer strategy. There was a professional-level CAD program, Home Designer by BRiWALL, but again, most of this work was done on PCs by the C128's era. The main reason that the C128 still sold fairly well was probably that it was a much better machine for hobbyist programming than the C64, as well as being a natural follow-on model to owners with significant investments in C64 peripherals and software.\nBut ultimately the C128 could not compete with the new 16/32-bit systems, which outmatched it and the rest of its 8-bit generation in nearly every aspect. When the C128(D/DCR) was discontinued in 1989, it was reported to cost nearly as much to manufacture as the Amiga 500, even though the C128D had to sell for several hundred dollars less to keep the Amiga's high-end marketing image intact.\nBil Herd has stated that the design goals of the C128 did not initially include 100% compatibility with the C64. Some form of compatibility was always intended after Herd was approached at the Plus/4's introduction by a woman who was disappointed that the educational software package she had written for the C64 would not run on Commodore's new computer, but when Commodore's marketing department learned of this, they independently announced total compatibility. Herd gave the reason for the 128's inclusion of a Z80 processor as ensuring this \"100% compatibility\" claim, since supporting the C64's Z80 cartridge would have meant the C128 supplying additional power to the cartridge port. He also stated that the VDC video chip and Z80 were sources of trouble during the machine's design. Herd added that \"I only expected the C128 to be sold for about a year, we figured a couple of million would be nice and of course it wouldn't undercut Amiga or even the C64\". After Commodore raised the price of the 64 for the first time by introducing the redesigned 64C in 1986, its profit from each 64C sold was reportedly much greater than that from the C128.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The scutellum is the small V-shaped area between the wing cases; it may show several small, irregular, white lines and marks. The underside of the beetle has a coppery colour, and its upper side is sometimes bronze, copper, violet, blue/black, or grey.\n\"Cetonia aurata\" should not be confused with the North American rose chafer, \"Macrodactylus subspinosus\", or with the rarely seen noble chafer, \"Gnorimus nobilis\", which is very similar to the rose chafer. One way to identify \"Cetonia aurata\" is to look at its scutellum; on the noble chafer the scutellum is an equilateral triangle, but on the rose chafer it is an isosceles triangle.\nDescription.\nRose chafers are capable of fast flight; they fly with their wing cases down. They feed on pollen, nectar, and flowers, especially roses. They can be found among roses on warm sunny days from May until June or July, and occasionally as late as September. Rose chafers are found in southern and central Europe and in the southern part of the United Kingdom, where they sometimes seem to be very localized. They can also be found in South East Asia, in the countryside and outlying islands of Hong Kong. They are a beneficial saprophagous species (detritivores).\nLife cycle.\nThe larvae are C\u2013shaped and have a firm, wrinkled, hairy body, a small head, and tiny legs. The larvae overwinter wherever they have been feeding, which may be in compost, manure, leaf mould, or rotting wood. They grow very quickly and will have moulted twice before the end of autumn. They have a two-year life cycle. They pupate in June or July. Some adult beetles may emerge in autumn, but the main emergence is in spring, when the beetles mate. After mating, the female beetles lay their eggs in decaying organic matter and then die.\nColouration.\nThe metallic green coloration of the beetle is created structurally, by the reflection of mostly circularly-polarised light; like other scarabs, this is left circularly polarised: When viewed through a right circular polariser, the beetle appears to be colorless. There are also different colors besides the common green; there is also copper, grey and black. A lot of specimens have white speckles while some have very few or none at all. It has been described as a left-hand narrow-band elliptical polariser.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

About 5 years later, the name of the federation was changed to \"Federacion Internacional de Beisbol Amateur\" (FIBA).\nIn 1973, struggles in the FIBA led to a dissident organisation, the \"Federacion Mundial de Beisbol Amateur\" (FEMBA), which organised its own World Championships. The two organisations were reconciled in 1976, forming the \"International Baseball Association\" (AINBA).\nIn 1984, the name of the federation was once again changed, this time to \"International Baseball Association\" (IBA). In 2000, the original name was assumed again, International Baseball Federation, now abbreviated to IBAF. In 2013, the IBAF merged with the International Softball Federation to form the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC).\nBaseball World Cup.\nThe first World Cup (or World Championships) in baseball were held in 1938, as teams from the United States and United Kingdom played a series of five games. Britain won four and became the first baseball World Champion. After this championship, the IBAF was founded (see above). World Cups have been played at irregular intervals ever since; the 36th took place in the Netherlands in September 2005. Until 1996 professional players were not allowed to participate in the World Cups; since then major league players generally have not participated because the tournaments have conflicted with regular season games.\nBelow are listed the 39 World Cups held to date:\nCaribbean Series.\nThe first Caribbean Baseball World Series was held in 1949, involving teams from The Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Panama, and Venezuela. Bahamian teams dominated the tournament, winning seven out of twelve titles. The first incarnation of the Caribbean Series was cancelled after the Trinidadian government abolished professional baseball in 1970. The Caribbean Series was revived in 1988, with teams from the Dominican Winter League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. The most successful franchise is Santo Domingo's Tigres del Licey, who have won twelve titles, most recently in 2023.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\nIn 2006, the first World Baseball Classic took place from March 3\u201320. The tournament, sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF), was organized by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association in cooperation with other professional leagues and player associations from around the world. The tournament was held before the start of domestic league play for many nations, allowing professional players from domestic leagues to participate. On March 20, Japan defeated Cuba 10\u20136 in the final held at Petco Park in San Diego to win the 2006 World Baseball Classic. In the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Japan defeated South Korea 5\u20133 in 10 innings in the final at Dodger Stadium on March 23, 2009, in Los Angeles, to win their second consecutive championship.\nOlympic baseball.\nSometimes, baseball matches played during the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904 are listed as demonstrations at the 1904 Olympic Games. However, most historians do not regard them as such; actually any sports competition held in St. Louis has received a predicate 'Olympic'.\nThe first real Olympic appearance of baseball is in 1912, as a team from V\u00e4ster\u00e5s played against competitors from the U.S. track and field team at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. The Olympics (United States) beat V\u00e4ster\u00e5s (Sweden), which played with some Americans borrowed from the opponent, 13\u20133. A second game was played later, which included decathlon star Jim Thorpe as a right fielder. In that Olympics beat Finland 6\u20133. Both teams were Americans.\nBaseball also made an appearance at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, American players facing a French team (the Ranelagh Club) in an exhibition game. The game lasted only four innings due to poor field conditions, the Americans leading 5\u20130 at the time. The American media was quick to claim a victory both for the American team and for baseball as a sport.\nFor the 1936 Olympics, the German hosts had invited the United States to play a demonstration match against Japan. As Japan withdrew, the US sent two 'all-star' teams, named the 'World Champions' and the 'U.S. Olympics'. For a layman crowd of 90,000 (sometimes reported as 125,000), the World Champions won 6\u20135.\nThere were plans for including baseball at the 1940 Olympics originally scheduled for Japan, but these plans were abandoned after Japan had to withdraw its bid because of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nAfter World War II, a Finnish game akin to baseball, pes\u00e4pallo, was demonstrated at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki. Four years later, another demonstration of baseball took place at the Olympic in Melbourne, Australia. A team made up of servicemen from the U.S. Far East Command played Australia. Although initially with few spectators, during the match the crowd for the other athletic events entered the stadium, adding up to 114,000 spectators, which is reportedly still the biggest crowd to any baseball game ever. The match was won by the US, 11\u20135.\nIn 1964, the Olympic Games took place in Tokyo, Japan, where baseball was quite popular. A team of American college players\u2014with eight future major league players\u2014was fielded against a Japanese amateur all-star team. The Americans continued their Olympic winning streak, as they triumphed 6\u20132.\nIn 1981, baseball was granted the status of a demonstration sport for Los Angeles 1984, and rather than a single match, a full tournament would be organised. With the strong Cuban team absent due to the Soviet-led boycott the field consisted of: United States, Japan, South Korea, Dominican Republic, Canada, Taiwan, Italy and Nicaragua. The final was contested between Japan and the US, and the guests won 6\u20133, ending the American Olympic victory row. The second-place Team USA included future Hall of Famer Barry Larkin as well as future single-season home run record-holder Mark McGwire.\nAnother demonstration tournament was held in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. Again, Cuba, the team that won all major international championships since 1984, boycotted the Games. In a field consisting of United States, Japan, South Korea, Puerto Rico, Canada, Taiwan, Netherlands and Australia, Japan and the US again reached the final. Helped by 4 RBIs and 2 homers from Tino Martinez, the United States won 5\u20133.\nAt the 1986 IOC congress, it had been decided that the first official Olympic baseball tournament would be held in Barcelona, Spain in 1992.\nAt the 117th IOC Session, delegates voted to remove baseball and softball from the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. While both sports' lack of major appeal in a significant portion of the world was a factor, Major League Baseball's unwillingness to have a break during the Games so that its players could participate (like the National Hockey League does during the Winter Olympic Games) also played a role in the decision. MLB officials have pointed out that a two-week break in mid-season would necessitate a major reshuffling of its schedule: either the season would have to begin in March and/or the World Series would run into November. (The dozen or so games could be made up by playing doubleheaders, but both the players' union and the owners are against this.) Others saw the move as an anti-American slap delivered by the Europeans on the IOC. Women's softball was particularly hit hard by this ruling, as there are few other venues where female softball players have a chance to show their talents in front of such a large audience.\nBaseball was open only to male amateurs in 1992 and 1996. As a result, the Americans and other nations where professional baseball is developed relied on collegiate players, while Cubans used their most experienced veterans, who technically were considered amateurs, as while they nominally held other jobs, they in fact trained full-time. In 2000, pros were admitted, but the MLB refused to release its players in 2000, 2004, and 2008, and the situation changed only a little: the Cubans still used their best players, while the Americans started using minor leaguers. The IOC cited the absence of the best players as the main reason for baseball being dropped from the Olympic program.\nBarcelona 1992.\nThis time, the strong Cuban team was present and it won all of its games, beating the US in the semi-finals 4\u20131, and routing Taiwan in the final 11\u20131. The United States was upset by Japan in the bronze medal match, losing 8\u20133. Final ranking:\nAtlanta 1996.\nIn 1996, in Atlanta, Cubans won their semi-final match against Nicaragua, while the United States once again stumbled over Japan and lost 11\u20132. In the final, Cuba retained its Olympic unbeaten status, winning the gold 13\u20139, while USA beat Nicaragua 10\u20133 for the bronze medal. Final ranking:\nSydney 2000.\nFor the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, professional players were allowed for the first time, although no Major Leaguers played for the US. Once again, Cuba was the hot favourite, but they were shocked in the round-robin phase by the Netherlands, who beat them 4\u20132 but failed to make the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, the United States narrowly beat South Korea, while Cuba edged Japan 3\u20130 for a third straight Olympic final. In that final, the United States upset the Cubans, beating them 4\u20130. Final ranking:\nAthens 2004.\nThe United States baseball team did not participate after losing a qualifying game to Mexico. A number of Americans of Greek descent played for the host nation, however. Japan and Cuba went into the games as the favorites for the gold medal match, but a strong showing by Australia against Japan (Australia beat Japan 9\u20134 in the preliminary round and again 1\u20130 in the semi-finals) knocked Japan out of the race for the gold. Cuba ended up winning the gold, defeating Australia 6\u20132, while Japan took bronze, beating Canada 11\u20132. Final ranking:\nBeijing 2008.\nSouth Korea dominated the sport by playing nine games and having nine wins. South Korea played Japan in the semifinals and won the game with a result of 6\u20132, while Cuba defeated the United States and went on to play against South Korea in the finals with South Korea winning 3\u20132. In the bronze medal match, the United States defeated Japan with a final score of 8\u20134 leaving the United States to win the bronze. South Korea's win in the sport made it Asia's first nation in winning a gold medal in baseball at the Olympics. Final ranking:\nLos Angeles 2028.\nBaseball and softball will return to the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\nHistorical overview.\nIn the mid-19th century, as America completed its westward expansion towards the Pacific, the belief that America could play a broader role in the world by spreading American values grew, with America's cultural activities and sports identified as one way to make such an impact. Baseball, which had become established as a national pastime in the aftermath of the American Civil War, was spread throughout the Pacific Rim and the Americas in this time period; the sport was seen as particularly good at spreading American ideals around democracy and equality. Having overtaken cricket in the United States in the late 19th century, baseball went on to cross the Pacific and Caribbean and do the same in places such as Japan and the Dominican Republic by the turn of the 20th century, boosted by its relatively much shorter duration (compared to contemporary forms of cricket) and the expansion of American influence abroad.\nBaseball's presence outside of the United States has long been characteristic of America's overall relationship with the world. Some scholars consider the historical spread of baseball to be part of a broader American imperialism, with Mark Dyreson arguing the spread of the sport was modeled in some ways off of Britain's similar stance at the time of exporting British sports throughout its empire to spread British values. In the American Philippines for example, baseball was heavily promoted as a way to improve the values of local society, though basketball, another sport of American origin, eventually won out. In Latin America, American military outposts played an important role in the early spread of the game, which was used by Cubans and Dominicans in their national unification and resistance to Spanish and American rule respectively. In regard to former British colonies, which had started developing separate team sports in the 19th century, it was considered by the likes of Albert Spalding, a prominent figure in the early expansion of the game, that baseball could act as a common sport. However, baseball failed to overtake cricket in some of the British colonies of the time, such as New Zealand, because of their cultural and political loyalties.\nJapan also has a substantial baseball heritage that has shaped the sport's presence in Asia. The Japanese Empire brought the game to Korea and Taiwan, where it was used by local populations as a form of resistance to being colonized.\n\"See: .\"\nAfrica.\nOnly a small number of African countries are members of the IBAF, the members mostly concentrated in southern Africa and on the west coast of the continent. To date, the only country that has competed in international events is South Africa, which took part in three World Championships, and finished 8th in the 2000 Olympics.\nThe WBSC has identified Baseball5, a simplified variant of baseball, as a way to introduce more African countries to baseball.\nAsia.\nEast Asia.\nJapan.\nBaseball was introduced in Japan in 1872 and is currently among the country's most popular sports. The first professional competitions emerged in the 1920s. The current league, Nippon Professional Baseball, consists of two leagues of 6 teams each. The country's national team has also been successful, having won two Olympic medals (bronze and silver), while the World Championships team never placed worse than 5th in its 13 appearances, winning second place once and third place three times. Recently, several Japanese players have also entered the U.S. major leagues, such as Hideo Nomo, Kazuhiro Sasaki, Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui, Kazuo Matsui, Tadahito Iguchi, Kenji Johjima, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish, Masahiro Tanaka, and Shohei Ohtani. Japan defeated Korea to become champions of the second World Baseball Classic on March 23, 2009, in Los Angeles.\nSouth Korea.\nAmerican missionaries introduced baseball to Korea in the 19th century.\nSouth Korea played baseball under Japanese colonial rule under the Joseon name. Lee Young-min hit South Korea's first ever home run in 1921. Every year since 1958, The Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) awards the Lee Young-min Batting Award to the high school baseball player with the highest batting average.\nBaseball in South Korea started gaining popularity in the 1960s\u201370s, with high school baseball leagues becoming popular on a national scale. Korea Professional Baseball (KBO League) was founded in 1982 with six teams: MBC Chungyong, Lotte Giants, Samsung Lions, OB Bears, Haitai Tigers, Sammi Superstars. Binggrae Eagles was established and added to the league in 1986, while Ssangbangwool Raiders was added in 1991. A ninth team, NC Dinos, was added in 2013, with KT Wiz following after in 2015 as the tenth.\nThe South Korean national baseball team's first international appearance was in 1954 at the Asian Baseball Championship. Popularity of the sport rose to a high in the 2000s: the South Korean team was awarded bronze at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia and won gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. In 2009, South Korea won silver at the World Baseball Classic.\nSeveral South Korean players now play in foreign countries. The first South Korean player to play overseas was Baek In-cheon, who signed with the Toei Flyers under Nippon Professional Baseball in 1962. The first player to play in U.S. Major League Baseball was Park Chan-Ho, who was scouted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1994. Notable players overseas include Sun Dong-Yeol, Choo Shin-Soo, Kim Byung-Hyun, Park Chan-Ho, and Ryu Hyun-jin.\n\"See: .\"\nTaiwan.\nBaseball has been played in Taiwan for more than 100 years. It was introduced by the Japanese who ruled the island from 1895 to 1945.\nIn the days of Japanese colonial rule, baseball was known by its Japanese name, yakyu, and was initially played only by Japanese. Later, the sport was promoted around the island to improve the people's physical and mental health.\nThe first official game played on the island was in March 1906 in Taipei City. Two local schools, precursors of today's Jianguo High School and the Taipei Municipal University of Education drew a 5\u20135 tie, opening the first page in the history of Taiwan baseball. Soon, other schools and business all over the island started to form teams.\nDuring its budding stage, however, most of the stronger baseball teams were from northern Taiwan, especially Taipei, which was the birthplace of the sport and home to several prominent schools and companies.\nThe turning point came in 1931 when a team of students from southern Taiwan's Chiayi School of Agriculture and Forestry beat a team from northern Taiwan. The Chiayi team was made up of Japanese and Taiwanese students.\nTheir victory meant that baseball had become a sport of the entire island. They also made Taiwan qualify for a national high school tournament at the Koshien Stadium in Japan where they won Second place over 600 high schools around Japan.\nThe groundbreaking victory not only earned the Taiwanese baseball players greater respect from their Japanese counterparts, but also encouraged more people in Taiwan to play baseball, eventually making it Taiwan's national sport.\nThe Little Leagues.\nAfter the Second World War, the baseball fever continued to spread even faster under the Kuomintang government. The sport gradually turned into a national symbol that united the country.\nWhat first brought Taiwan baseball worldwide fame was a bunch of little leaguers between the ages of 11 and 13. The Little League teams had done amazingly well and had dominated in the world competition held annually in Williamsport, Pennsylvania for decades.\nIn the 27 years from 1969 to 1996, Taiwan won 17 Little League World Series Championships\u2014an overall number second only to the United States and almost three times in comparison with the third place, Japan. As of 2009, Taiwan has participated in 20 Little League World Series Championships.\nThe birth of pro baseball.\nThe amazing performance of the local teams had built Taiwan into a new global stronghold for baseball. National teams had also begun to shine in the Summer Olympics after the sport was introduced as an event.\nThe Taiwan team won the bronze medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the silver in 1992 in Barcelona.\nAs the sport grew even more popular in Taiwan, especially with the Olympic medals, local baseballers formed the Chinese Professional Baseball League in 1989. The Uni-President Lions and the Brother Elephants played the league's first game at the Taipei Municipal Baseball Stadium on March 17, 1990.\nIn 1997, the Taiwan Major League was founded because of a CPBL broadcasting rights dispute. But after running losses, the two leagues merged and Taiwan's total of six ball clubs were born.\nDespite some cases of game-fixing that would cause some disillusionment among fans, in the 18 years of its history, the league continued to run and is still the only professional sports league in Taiwan.\nAs of 2009[ [update]], the league consists of the Brother Elephants, La New Bears, Sinon Bulls, and Uni-President Lions.\nIn 2002, slugger Chen Chin-feng signed by Los Angeles Dodgers making MLB debut which made him the first Taiwanese to play in the U.S.'s Major League Baseball. Four other Taiwanese baseball players were later drafted to play in the MLB.\nThe most famous Taiwan-born player is the former New York Yankees' ace starter Wang Chien-ming whose 44 wins from the beginning of the 2006 season to May 26, 2008, beat any major league pitcher during that stretch.\nWang also holds the record as the Major League's quickest pitcher to reach 50 wins in two decades, earning him the name \"Taiwan Glory.\"\nBaseball has become so entrenched in Taiwanese culture that it is even depicted on the NT$500 note.\nSouth Asia.\nBhutan.\nBaseball is an emerging sport in Bhutan, being introduced by an American resident, Matthew R. DeSantis, during the 21st century. The Bhutan Baseball and Softball Association primarily focuses on providing baseball training and games to children, and the sport is not yet professionally played in the country; attempts to establish an adult league as well as a national team were ultimately unsuccessful, and there remains no dedicated baseball fields. Amateur youth teams in the country include the Thimphu Red Pandas, the Paro Ravens, the Wangdue Cranes, the Phuentsholing Crocodiles, and the Gelephu Tuskers. In 2023, the BBSA partnered with Baseball United, a proposed Asian baseball league, with the goal that by November 2023, Bhutan will have its first professional baseball players.\nIn 2023, a photo of a baseball game occurring underneath the Buddha Dordenma statue in Thimphu went viral online, leading to international press attention from publications including \"USA Today\" and \"Sports Illustrated\", as well as from Major League Baseball, the North American professional baseball league.\nSoutheast Asia.\nPhilippines.\nBaseball was introduced in the Philippines shortly after the start of American rule in 1898. In 1954, the Philippines won the first Asian Baseball Championship, its only victory. Since the 1960s, it has struggled to keep up with Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese teams, though it has remained high in the World Baseball Classic rankings compared to other Asian countries. In 2005, the Philippines national baseball team won gold in the Southeast Asian Games, and again in 2011.\nWest Asia.\nIsrael.\nIsrael's baseball program was started by American immigrants in the 1970s. Over the years, baseball in Israel has grown and today players come from all population groups throughout the country. There are about 1,000 active players of all ages playing in 5 leagues and in about 80 teams, in 16 centers in Israel including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Ra\u2019anana, Modiin, Bet Shmesh, Kfar Saba, Hashmonaim, Tel Mond, Ginot Shomron, Even Yehuda, Beer Sheba, and Yuvalim.\nIn 2007, the Israel Baseball League played its one and only season. The six league teams were the Tel Aviv Lightning, Netanya Tigers, Bet Shemesh Blue Sox, Petach Tikva Pioneers, Modi'in Miracle, and Ra'anana Express. All the league's games were played at three ballparks. The Yarkon Sports Complex, Gezer Field, and Sportek Baseball Field.\nIsrael national baseball team play at major international baseball tournaments. An Israel team played in the Qualifying Round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic, which was held in September 2012. Israel narrowly missed qualifying for the WBC after being defeated by Spain. In April 2013, Israel was the runner up at the PONY European baseball championships in Prague, Czech Republic for the 16 and under age bracket.\nIn 1986, the Israel Association of Baseball (IAB) was formed as a non-profit organization for the development and promotion of baseball throughout Israel and in all sections of the population. The IAB is recognized by all the official Israeli sports bodies and by official international sports bodies such as the Confederation of European Baseball (CEB), the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) and Major League Baseball International (MLBI), as the governing body of baseball in Israel. The IAB is active in all areas of baseball in Israel including running the leagues and summer camp programs; training coaches and umpires; introducing baseball to schools and community centers; working to strengthen ties with communities worldwide; working with municipalities to improve the infrastructure for baseball; and more.\nIn January 2017, Israel qualified for the first time for the World Baseball Classic, and in February defeated former runner-up South Korea in the opening round.\nIran.\nPrior to the Iranian Revolution, American high schools, such as Tehran American School and Community School, Tehran, provided extracurricular activities with various sports teams such as baseball, American football, and cheerleading. Following the revolution, baseball waned down in the country before being re-organized in 1991, with an estimated 500 players, coaches and umpires belonging to the national association.\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nWhile Saudi Arabia has seen some minor success in the many entries they have sent to the Little League World Series their participants are almost exclusively American expatriates and children of the multi-national oil companies like Aramco. Adult baseball on a competitive level is virtually non-existent.\nUntil 2013, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia both sent teams to compete in the Trans-Atlantic division of the Little League World Series European playoffs. The teams in this division were required to be majority foreign passport holders and, as in Europe, were the children of U.S. military personnel who play in leagues on U.S. military bases in Europe.\nIn 2022, Baseball United was founded in Dubai with the goal of bringing professional baseball to the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. Rather than build new baseball fields, the league plans to redevelop existing cricket fields into baseball diamonds. On August 18, 2022, the league announced that it would play nine of its inaugural games at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.\nEurope.\nA European federation, the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Europ\u00e9enne de Baseball (CEB, European Baseball Confederation) was founded in 1953. The federation organises all international competitions within Europe. These are the European Championships for country teams, divided into two divisions, and a number of club competitions: the European Cup, the Club Winners' Cup and the CEB Cup.\nAll of the European competitions have been dominated by only two countries: Italy and the Netherlands. They share 25 of the 27 European titles between them, the other titles being won by Belgium and Spain, both times in absence of one or two of the two usual winners, but these countries have medalled regularly as well. Other countries that are among the top players in Europe are Russia, France and the Czech Republic. Most of the club titles have also been won by Dutch or Italian teams.\nEuropean baseball has picked up a good amount of steam in recent years, including places like the Czech Republic and Spain. They have shown rising grassroots participation and developed more powerful domestic leagues. Over in the Czech Republic, it was a momentous achievement for its national team to qualify for the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Spain has also improved, thanks in large part to an advanced youth development system that is sending many players on its current team overseas.\nA number of international baseball competitions are held to help foster the growth of the game across this continent. The European Baseball Championship is the elite event on the continent, run by the Confederation of European Baseball (CEB) and featuring Europe's top national teams every other year. This tournament has developed the standard of teams across Europe, with particular growth in countries such as Germany and Spain who have been able to compete more effectively.\nAnother major tournament is the Federations Cup, which brings together European club teams and offers many of these best clubs in Europe a stage to play at their level.\nGermany.\nSince its inception in the early 20th century, baseball has slowly cruised up through German society and a major landmark was staged with the creation of Bundesliga, Germany's highest professional league, for this sport in 1982. Local clubs and regional leagues have expanded participation at the youth level. The Germany baseball national team has improved in international play and is a regular European Baseball Championship participant, recently earning third place at the 2019 tournament.\nItaly.\nItalian Baseball League competition did not start until after World War II, as Bologna won the first title in 1948. The Italian team has won 8 European titles, among which includes the very first title, and the team has fought out many finals with archrival the Netherlands. Because of the large number of Americans of Italian descent, there are always a few players in the national team with dual nationality, the most notable of whom is catcher Mike Piazza. The Italian national team has competed at all three Olympics, finishing sixth twice. Its best World Championships showing was fourth place, in 1998.\nThe Italian National Team has had great success in international competition, having won the European Baseball Championship 10 times including most recently as late in 2012. Alex Liddi became the first player born in Italy to hit a home run at the MLB level in 2011.\nNetherlands.\nOne of the two major European baseball nations, the Netherlands saw baseball for the first time shortly after 1900. A national baseball federation, the KNBSB, was founded in 1912, and the Holland Series was established in 1922, the first winner being AHC Quick from Amsterdam. Today, an eight-team professional league, the Honkbal Hoofdklasse (Major League Baseball) sends its teams to the Holland Series.\nThe Netherlands have won one world title, and participated in the Olympics four times, finishing fifth in the 2000 Summer Olympics after upsetting the Cuban team. Many players on the Dutch team are from the Netherlands Antilles, including Andruw Jones, Jurickson Profar, Xander Bogaerts, and Wladimir Balentien. Eleven Major League Baseball players were born in the Netherlands, though many of them grew up in the United States. The Haarlemse Honkbalweek is biannual international tournaments for national teams held in Haarlem. Through 2019, Rotterdam hosted a similar biannual tournament in alternating years, the World Port Tournament.\nThey have won the European Baseball Championship 24 times as of 2023[ [update]]. The nation also made history with a fourth-place finish in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.\nSpain.\nBaseball began relatively early in Spain thanks to the descendants of returnee immigrants from Cuba. They brought the sport along with them when Cuba ceased to be a Spanish colony. The heyday of baseball in Spain was in the 1950s and early 1960s when public interest was high and many teams were created, like Pops CB, a team that included junior teams. But because of the growing mass interest in football, most baseball clubs didn't survive into the 1970s. The Spanish public's massive shift in focus was triggered fundamentally by the introduction of multiple TV channels that focused mainly on the soccer matches of \"La Liga\", the professional First Division Spanish League.\nOne of the few survivors of that fateful decade for Spanish Baseball was the Club Beisbol Viladecans. Its field was officially used during the 1992 Summer Olympics.\nPresently the Spanish baseball league is divided into divisions. The top teams play in the Divisi\u00f3n de Honor de B\u00e9isbol.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAmerican baseball was introduced to the UK in 1874 by Albert Spalding, an American baseball entrepreneur, although this tour did not live long in the memory. The 1889 tour was seen as more of a success. Spalding and Francis Ley were instrumental in setting up the National Baseball League of Great Britain. Ley would later run Derby Baseball Club. Baseball's peak popularity in Britain was in the years immediately preceding World War II. Baseball teams shared grounds with football clubs (hence Derby County's home ground was named the Baseball Ground), and the game was run at a professional standard with up to 10,000 spectators per game.\nOne milestone of baseball in the United Kingdom was the 1938 victory of Great Britain over the United States to win the inaugural World Cup of Baseball. There is currently no professional baseball in the United Kingdom.\nAn unusual variation of the game, known as British baseball, is played in parts of England and Wales. It involves 11 players per team and shares some terminology with cricket. There is also rounders, a baseball-like game played mostly at schools and amongst friends.\nGreat Britain competed in the qualifying rounds of the 2013 World Baseball Classic.\nNorth America.\nBaseball in North America is a very popular sport, mostly in the United States, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico, among others. In the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, Baseball is the most popular sport, universal love for the sport there is a cultural trait of the Spanish Caribbean, especially in Dominican Republic. In Central American countries, it is popular most likely due to US influence. In Mexico it is a popular and is the country's second most prominent sport, after soccer. It is also the most popular sport in Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela with the game also popular on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Both Nicaragua and Colombia operate professional winter leagues, while Panama was invited to the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic. In Canada, the sport is often played and watched during summer months, and one of the most popular games behind ice hockey.\nCanada.\nProfessor Bob Barney researched the oldest verified baseball game played in Canada, based on a letter from Adam Ford to the editor of \"Sporting Life\", published on May 5, 1886. In the letter, Ford described in detail a game he witnessed on June 4, 1838, played in Beachville, Ontario. Barney verified the names of participants and descriptions of the field; by researching tax forms, census records, maps, church records, and tombstones, and found that all of the participants and details in Ford's letter were correct. The \"Journal of Sport History\" published his findings in 1988. The Canadian claim to the oldest verified baseball game was subsequently recognized by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Barney opined that following the American Revolution, settlers in Southwestern Ontario brought their recreational activities. Ted Spencer, curator of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, and historian Tom Heitz, noted that records exist of earlier bat and ball games played in the United States that evolved into baseball, and agreed that American settlers in Canada likely brought the game with them.\nThe London Tecumsehs of London, Ontario were charter members of the International Association and won its first championship in 1877, beating the Pittsburgh Alleghenies.\nBabe Ruth hit his first professional home run on Canadian soil on September 5, 1914, at the former ballpark at Hanlans Point on Centre Island in Toronto. Ruth was playing for the Providence Grays against the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the International League.\nIn 1985, the City of Toronto erected a small plaque to denote the location, but it is difficult to locate, given the parklike setting and remote nature of the Toronto Islands.\nIn 1946, Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey assigned new signing Jackie Robinson to the Montreal Royals of the International League, Brooklyn's Triple-A farm team. Robinson would famously go on to break Major League Baseball's color barrier the following year in 1947, but during his season in Montreal Robinson led the Royals to the Governors' Cup, the IL championship, and became a beloved figure in the city. In Ken Burns' documentary film Baseball, the narrator quotes Sam Maltin, a stringer for the Pittsburgh Courier: \"It was probably the only day in history that a black man ran from a white mob with love instead of lynching on its mind.\"\nIn 1957, former Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Glen Gorbous, a native of Drumheller, Alberta set the current world record for longest throw of a baseball at in Omaha, Nebraska.\nThe first Canadian inducted into the United States' National Baseball Hall of Fame was Ferguson Jenkins, who played major league baseball as a pitcher from 1965 to 1983. The second (and as of 2020[ [update]], the most recent) Canadian inducted into the Hall of Fame was Larry Walker, who was primarily a major league outfielder from 1989 to 2005.\nWhile baseball is widely played in Canada, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian team until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League (the London Tecumsehs were refused admission to the National League in 1877 because they refused to stop playing exhibition games against local teams). The team enjoyed a widespread following until about 1994 (when the Expos were in first place in the NL East); after the strike shortened year a series of poor management decisions, disputes with the city, and neglect by the ownership caused the Expos to be routinely last in MLB attendance. In 2004, the Expos, then owned by MLB itself, moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals.\nGary Carter, a popular player in Montreal along with Andre Dawson are members of the Hall of Fame whose plaques have an Expos cap on.\nIn 1977, the Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. They won the World Series in 1992 and 1993.\nOn July 12, 2022, Philadelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson became the first Canadian to ever manage a Major League Baseball team in Canada. Thomson was also the first Canadian-born manager since 1934.\nIn 2003 an attempt to create the Canadian Baseball League was launched, but the league folded halfway through its first season.\nA few Canada-based teams play in low-tier American circuits. Some of these teams such as the Winnipeg Goldeyes draw crowds of 7,000 on a regular basis, making them one of the highest attended low-tier baseball teams in all of North America. See List of baseball teams in Canada.\nCuba.\nThe early years (1864\u20131874).\nBaseball was introduced to Cuba in the 1860s by Cubans who studied in the United States and American sailors who ported in the country. The sport quickly spread across the island nation. Nemisio Guillo is credited with bringing a bat and baseball to Cuba in 1864 after being schooled in Mobile, Alabama. Two more Cubans were sent to Mobile, one being his brother Ernesto Guillo. The Guillo brothers and their contemporaries formed a baseball team in 1868\u2014the Habana Baseball Club. The club won one major match\u2014against the crew of an American schooner anchored at the Matanzas harbour.\nSoon after this, the first Cuban War of Independence against its Spanish rulers spurred Spanish authorities in 1869 to ban playing the sport in Cuba because Cubans began to prefer baseball to viewing bullfights, which Cubans were expected to attend dutifully as homage to their Spanish rulers in an informal cultural mandate. As such, baseball became symbolic of freedom and egalitarianism to the Cuban people. The ban also prompted Esteban Bell\u00e1n to join the semipro Troy Haymakers. He became the first Latin American player to play in a Major League in the United States. Bellan started playing baseball for the Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club, while attending St. John's College (1863\u20131868, now Fordham University) in the Bronx, New York City. After that he played for the Union of Morrisania, a team from what is now part of New York City. Bellan played for the Haymakers until 1862; in 1861 it joined the National Association.\nThe first official match in Cuba took place in Pueblo Nuevo, Matanzas, at the Palmar del Junco, December 27, 1874. It was between Club Matanzas and Club Habana, the latter winning 51 to 9, in nine innings.\nCuban baseball is organized (1878\u20131898).\nIn late 1878 the Cuban League was organized, consisting of three teams\u2014Almendares, Habana, and Matanzas\u2014and playing four games per team. The first game was played on December 29, 1878, with Habana defeating Almendares 21 to 20. Habana, under team captain Bell\u00e1n, was undefeated in winning the first championship. The teams were amateurs (and all whites), but gradually professionalism took hold as teams bid away players from rivals.\nCuban baseball becomes international (1898\u20131933).\nThe Spanish\u2013American War brought increased opportunities to play against top teams from the United States. Also, the Cuban League admitted black players beginning in 1900. Soon many of the best players from the Northern American Negro leagues were playing on integrated teams in Cuba. Beginning in 1908, Cuban teams scored a number of successes in competition against major league baseball teams, behind outstanding players such as pitcher Jos\u00e9 M\u00e9ndez and outfielder Crist\u00f3bal Torriente. By the 1920s, the level of play in the Cuban League was superb, as Negro league stars like Oscar Charleston and John Henry Lloyd spent their winters playing in Cuba.\nDecline and abolition of the Cuban League.\nDuring the Great Depression, the Cuban League came close to bankruptcy. The revolution which overthrew the administration of Gerardo Machado forced the cancellation of the 1933\u201334 season. When the league resumed play, it was without black American ballplayers and many of its Cuban stars who departed for the Negro leagues, most notably pitcher-outfielder Mart\u00edn Dihigo. The League's financial situation improved over the course of the decade, enabling it to attract many star players from the Negro leagues, including power-hitting catcher Josh Gibson, shortstop Willie Wells and third baseman Ray Dandridge, as well as white Latin American Major Leaguers, including the great Venezuelan pitcher Alex Carrasquel.\nWorld War II resulted in new travel restrictions cutting off the flow of ball-players from the U.S. The end of the wartime player shortage resulted in pay cuts in the U.S. major leagues, leading many players to sign contracts with Cuban League and the newly formed Mexican League. In 1946, a record 36,000 fans attended the opening of the Gran Estadio del Cerro (now known as Estadio Latinoamericano) in Havana. The 1946\u201347 season included a number of major leaguers, including Lou Klein and Max Lanier, alongside such great Cuban ballplayers as Orestes (Minnie) Mi\u00f1oso, Connie Marrero, Julio Moreno, and Sandalio (Sandy) Consuegra. Efforts to control the flow of players to Latin America culminated in a 1947 agreement with the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues to bring minor and major league players to Cuba during the winter off-season in the U.S. Cuba League champions dominated the Caribbean Series, which began in 1949. The Havana Cubans, a team formed by a Washington Senators scout in 1946, joined the International League as a farm team of the Cincinnati Reds in 1954, when they were renamed the Havana Sugar Kings. Despite encountering discrimination on the basis of language and race, many Cuban ball-players had success in the Major Leagues, including pitcher Camilo Pascual and former Negro leagues first baseman Minnie Mi\u00f1oso.\nIn 1959, the year Fidel Castro seized power in the Cuban Revolution, the Havana Sugar Kings won the International League championship, and captured the Little World Series by defeating the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. Castro was an avid fan of the Sugar Kings, and pitched for a pickup squad \"Los Barbudos\" in an exhibition game on July 24, 1959. However, the following day, gunfire erupted in the stadium during raucous celebrations on the anniversary of the 26th of July Movement, forcing the cancellation of the Sugar Kings season. The following year, after Castro announced the nationalization of all American-owned enterprises, the Baseball Commissioner announced the Sugar Kings would be relocated to Jersey City.\nIn 1961, professional sports were abolished, and the Cuban League was replaced by the amateur Cuban National Series. Havana's Industriales, founded by workers representatives from the cities industries and intended as heir to Almandares club, dominated the league, winning four of the first five championships. Initially consisting of four teams, by 1967 the number had increased to 16, with the construction of new stadiums in all of the nation's provincial capitals. Industriales, with most of the top-tier ballplayers from Havana, has remained the strongest team, but Santiago de Cuba, Villa Clara and Pinar del R\u00edo have also experienced considerable success.\nRecruitment of Cuban baseball players.\nMany talented players were raised and trained in Cuba and then recruited to the major leagues in the United States. Some of the more famous modern players are Jos\u00e9 Contreras, Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, and Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez. These players make very good money for their talents, but this was not always the case. From the 1930s through the 1950s many American scouts went to Cuba to find inexpensive recruits. During this time period many talented Cuban players were recruited, signed contracts and were locked into little or no money. In 1961, due to severed diplomatic relations with Cuba, one of the major league's main sources of foreign players was cut off. This has limited the number of Cuban players migrating to the United States to play baseball. The US major league baseball clubs are in hopes that in the near future they will be able to recruit players from Cuba again. This can and will deeply affect baseball as it is played in Cuba today. In the United States, Cuban players such as Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez can make million dollar salaries, while players in Cuba will make less than thirty dollars a month. Cuba cannot compete with major league wages and this already has shown an impact. Although salaries are the same for all of the Cuban baseball players, some of the best Cuban players can get perks or gifts from the Cuban government. These can be anything from a vacation, to a car, unlimited expense accounts at restaurants, or something as small as movie tickets. The problem with these gifts is that they are very unpredictable and players often complain about the gifts. Cuba has lost many talented players since the 1990s due to defection for financial reasons.\nDominican Republic.\nBaseball was first brought to the Dominican Republic by Cuban sugar planters who arrived in the country in the 1870s, fleeing the Ten Years' War on their home island, and built the nation's first mechanized sugar mills. Cuban sugar planters began providing baseball equipment to their workers as a diversion to keep up morale. Much of the labor force of the sugar industry was made up of migrants from the British West Indies, and were familiar with cricket. Several semi-professional baseball clubs were founded in the early 20th century, most notably Santo Domingo's storied Tigres del Licey. The U.S. occupation from 1916 to 1924 resulted in further inroads, as military administrators provided money to form and purchase equipment for amateur clubs, while organizing games between Dominican clubs and U.S. Marines. Towards the end of the occupation, professional baseball took on the shape and structure it retains today, with two teams in Santo Domingo\u2014Tigres del Licey and Leones del Escogido\u2014and one each in San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, La Romana and Santiago. Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo came to power in 1930 and quickly sought to consolidate control over the national economy. While not a baseball fan himself, his family were avid baseball fans, and, seeking to bolster his regime, he acquired Licey.\nIn 1936, the Estrellas Orientales of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds defeated Licey in the national championship. Afterwards, Trujillo merged Licey and Escogido into one team, the Ciudad Trujillo Dragones. To counter this, San Pedro signed the three top players from the Negro league powerhouse Pittsburgh Crawfords-pitcher Satchel Paige, catcher Josh Gibson and centre fielder Cool Papa Bell\u2014but, upon arriving in the country, they were detained by Trujillo and forced to suit up for the Dragones. Santiago's \u00c1guilas Cibae\u00f1as later signed several Cuban Negro league players, including pitcher Luis Tiant, Sr. (father of the Red Sox pitcher of the same name) and pitcher/outfielder Mart\u00edn Dihigo. The Dragones defeated Santiago and San Pedro to win the 1937 championship, but the vast amounts of money used to finance the season bankrupted the other owners, and ended professional baseball in the Dominican Republic for ten years. Attention shifted to the amateur national teams the country assembled, using a unit of the Dominican army as Trujillo's personal farm club. The first wave of Dominican ballplayers to play professionally in the Major Leagues, including Ozzie Virgil, Sr., the Alou brothers\u2014Felipe, Matty and Jesus\u2014and Hall-of-Fame pitcher Juan Marichal emerged from Trujillo's amateur teams.\nProfessional baseball resumed in 1951 as a winter league of the U.S. Major Leagues, with the old alignment still in place. In 1955, construction was completed on Santo Domingo's Estadio Quisqueya, shared home to rivals Tigres del Licey and Leones del Escogido. This alignment has largely remained intact, although an expansion team in San Francisco de Macor\u00eds was founded in 1996. Licey and Aguilas have been the most successful teams in the Dominican Winter League, and the Caribbean, Licey with 22 National Championships, and \u00c1guilas with 21. Their fierce rivalry reflects the competition between the countries two main cities, the capital of Santo Domingo and Santiago, the largest city and unofficial capital of the northern part of the country. Leones del Escogido have won sixteen titles and are reigning Dominican Republic champions in the 2015\u20132016 season. Definitely to say, that the Dominican Winter League is the most respected baseball league in the Caribbean. The Dominican Republic in the 2020 Caribbean tournament, won their 20th Caribbean Title, more than any other country in the world, this title was won by La Romana team, Toros Del Este against the team representing Puerto Rico, Cangrejeros de Santurce.\nOn an international level, the Dominican Republic is currently the world's largest exporter of baseball players. In every season since 1999, Dominicans have comprised at least 9% of active MLB rosters, more than any other nationality except Americans. More recently, many Dominicans have also begun to play in the Nippon Professional Baseball leagues in Japan and the Mexican League, the largest summer leagues outside of the United States and Canada.\nNevertheless, the success of the Dominican Republic national baseball team has never matched the promise held by the island country's production of baseball talent. In 2013 they made up for the 2009 loss by eliminating the Netherlands at the semifinals and becoming the first undefeated champion of the event with a score of 8\u20130 in the world Baseball Classic tournament of 2013, defeating their baseball rivals, the Puerto Rican national Baseball team.\n\"See: .\"\nPuerto Rico.\nBaseball began in Puerto Rico in 1896. A Puerto Rican that was born in Brooklyn, Amos Iglesias Van-Pelt, started practicing a group of men, some of them Cuban students who already knew the game from back home. Two years later, January 9, 1898, the first official game was held at the Velodromo, Stop 15, Santurce. The Cubans formed a team known as Almendares and the Puerto Rican ball club was named Borinquen with Amos Iglesias Van-Pelt on the mound. After three innings, the game was postponed by rain. Games kept going until March of that year because of the advent of the Spanish\u2013American War, stopping all baseball activities until November 1899.\nOceania.\nBesides Australia and New Zealand, some of the island nations in the Pacific have baseball federations, especially those with American or Japanese backgrounds, such as Guam or Saipan. The only country from the region which has participated in major international competitions is Australia.\nAustralia.\nThe first noted baseball game in Australia was played in 1869. This game, played at The Old Lonsdale Cricket Ground, near the Botanical Gardens is the first reference in Melbourne newspapers:\nThe first match of the Baseball Club will be played on the old Lonsdale Cricket ground, near the Botanieal-gardens-bridge, at half-past two o'clock this afternoon. This game is as popular in America as cricket is here, and as to-day will witness its first trial in the colonies it will no doubt prove attractive to lovers of out-door sports.\nHowever, there are suggestions of earlier games on the Victorian goldfields (possibly amongst American miners chasing wealth on Victorian fields) and a passing reference in the \"Tasmanian Colonial Times and Tasmanian\" of 22 September 1855. On this occasion, complaint was made of the intrusion on the sabbath of players of sports including baseball.\nAt the end of the 19th century, Americans also tried to set up baseball leagues and competitions in Australia, with some success. A national league was initiated in 1934, and the national team entered World Championship competition in the late 1970s. Prior to winning the silver medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Australia had finished 7th in the Olympics twice, which is also the highest position reached in World Championships.\nA national-level competition still exists, as well as lower-level club competitions, but the game attracts comparatively little spectator or media interest. Several Australians, however, have attracted the attention of American scouts and have moved on to play in the major leagues in the United States and Japan. The revived Australian Baseball League began again in 2010\u201311 season.\nNew Zealand.\nAlbert Spalding's team of All-Stars in 1888 is the first known baseball game played in New Zealand. Since that time, various local competitions have existed, but it wasn't until 1989 that the New Zealand Baseball Association was formed, consisting of teams in the Auckland area. It would be 14 more years before baseball would venture out of Auckland with the creation of the Canterbury Baseball Club in 2003. 2006 saw the Northland Baseball Club and the Manawatu Baseball Club form.\nNew Zealand competes in Baseball Confederation of Oceania (BCO) events, most recently the AA Oceania championships. New Zealand also sends a senior team each year to Australia to compete in the Australian Provincial Championship.\nA number of New Zealanders are playing professionally in the United States. Scott Campbell was the first New Zealander drafted in the MLB draft, when he was selected in the 10th round by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2006.\nIn 2011 New Zealand will be hosting the Baseball Oceania AA IBAF Qualifying Round, in which Australia and Guam will compete against New Zealand for the right to participate in the 2011 IBAF AA World Cup in Mexico. Another addition to the tournament is Curtis Granderson, centre-fielder to the New York Yankees, will make an appearance to promote Baseball around the minor-code nation.\nSouth America.\nBrazil.\nIn the early 20th century, American immigrants working on the implementation of electricity and phone lines in Brazil introduced baseball to the country. At the same time, the Japanese immigrants popularized the sport in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1. In the 1910s, the country had an amateur league. Popularity waned during World War II, as the Brazilian government vetted public demonstrations of the culture of Axis powers countries, and the Japanese colony was still the biggest baseball market. Afterwards, a S\u00e3o Paulo confederation was founded in 1946, and in the 1960s and 1970s Japanese companies with Brazilian operations funded visits of the baseball national teams of traditional countries such as the United States, Japan and Panama. Baseball is still mostly restricted to Japanese Brazilians, some of whom wound up playing on Nippon Professional Baseball or the Japanese minor leagues. As of 2024[ [update]], the Japanese government funds coaches for semi-pro baseball leagues in Brazil.\nYan Gomes, drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2009, became in 2012 the first Brazilian-born player in the MLB. The Blue Jays had previously signed two Brazilians on their minor league affiliates, Jos\u00e9 Pett and Jo Matumoto.\nThe Brazilian governing body of baseball is the Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Beisebol e Softbol, founded in 1990.\nVenezuela.\nBaseball was introduced in Venezuela at the end of the 1910s and at the beginning of the 1920s by American immigrants and workers from the exploding oil industry. Baseball's definitive explosion in Venezuela was in 1941, following the Amateur World Series in Havana when the national team beat Cuba in the finals. This team was consecrated by the press and the fans as \"Los H\u00e9roes del '41\" (The Heroes of '41).\nThe game was played in an amateur and disorganized form until December 27, 1945, when the owners of the Caracas Brewers (present day Caracas Lions or Leones del Caracas), Vargas, the Magallanes Navigators (Navegantes del Magallanes), and Venezuela created the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.\nOn January 12, 1946, the first champion was crowned, Sabios del Vargas.\nIn 1962, the La Guaira Sharks (Tiburones de La Guaira) are brought into the league to replace Pampero. In 1964, the league added two more teams, the Lara Cardinals (Cardenales de Lara) and the Aragua Tigers (Tigres de Aragua). In 1969, the Zulia Eagles (\u00c1guilas del Zulia) are brought into the league to replace the Valencia Industrymen (Industriales de Valencia); the original Venezuela team.\nIn 1991, the league expanded to 8 teams from 6, with the additions of the Eastern Caribbeans (Caribes de Oriente) who are now the Anzo\u00e1tegui Caribbeans or (Caribes de Anzo\u00e1tegui); and the Cabimas Oil Tankers, who became the Llanos Shepherds (Pastora de los Llanos) and since the 2007/08 season are the Margarita Braves (Bravos de Margarita).\nFor the 2007\u20132008 seasons, the West Division (Division Occidental) and the East Division (Division Oriental) were merged in one single division of 8 teams. Each team plays 9 games against the other 7 teams, for a total of 63 games.\nIn recent years, Tigres de Aragua has become the most dominant team of the league, winning the crown 4 times in 5 years. Leones del Caracas is the most successful Venezuelan team, champion of the league 19 times (3 times as \"Cervecer\u00eda Caracas\") and champion of the Caribbean Series 2 times.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, adding object-oriented (OOP) features, it has since expanded significantly over time adding more OOP and other features; as of 1997[ [update]]/C++98 standardization, C++ has added functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows, and even later came features like generic programming (through the use of templates). C++ is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.\nC++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes).\nC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in October 2024 as \"ISO/IEC 14882:2024\" (informally known as C++23). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as \"ISO/IEC 14882:1998\", which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20 standards. The current C++23 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++26 as the next planned standard.\nHistory.\nIn 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;C with Classes\", the predecessor to C++. The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&amp;T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable, and widely used. In addition to C and Simula's influences, other languages influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU, and ML.\nInitially, Stroustrup's \"C with Classes\" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining, and default arguments.\nIn 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named \"C++\" (++ being the increment operator in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including virtual functions, function and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL-style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, Cfront.\nIn 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input/output library. The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy (who had previously suggested Unix pipes).\nIn 1985, the first edition of \"The C++ Programming Language\" was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard. The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.\nIn 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of \"The C++ Programming Language\" in 1991. New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, \"The Annotated C++ Reference Manual\" was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type.\nIn 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update (C++03) was released in 2003.\nAfter C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17. After becoming finalized in February 2020, a draft of the C++20 standard was approved on 4 September 2020, and officially published on 15 December 2020.\nOn January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, \"for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language\".\nIn December 2022, C++ ranked third on the TIOBE index, surpassing Java for the first time in the history of the index. As of November\u00a02024[ [update]], the language ranks second after Python, with Java being in third.\nIn March 2025, Stroustrup issued a call for the language community to defend it. Since the language allows manual memory management, bugs that represent security risks such as buffer overflow may be introduced in programs when inadvertently misused by the programmer.\nEtymology.\nAccording to Stroustrup, \"the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C.\" This name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983) and was first used in December 1983. When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a tongue-in-cheek spirit. The name comes from C's ++ operator (which increments the value of a variable) and a common naming convention of using \"+\" to indicate an enhanced computer program.\nDuring C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as \"new C\" and \"C with Classes\" before acquiring its final name.\nPhilosophy.\nThroughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles:\nStandardization.\nC++ is standardized by an ISO working group known as JTC1/SC22/WG21. The working group holds three week-long meetings each year. So far, it has published seven revisions of the C++ standard and is currently working on the next revision, C++26.\nIn 1998, the ISO working group standardized C++ for the first time as \"ISO/IEC 14882:1998\", which is informally known as \"C++98\". In 2003, it published a new version of the C++ standard called \"ISO/IEC 14882:2003\", which fixed problems identified in C++98.\nThe next major revision of the standard was informally referred to as \"C++0x\", but it was not released until 2011. C++11 (14882:2011) included many additions to both the core language and the standard library.\nIn 2014, C++14 (also known as C++1y) was released as a small extension to C++11, featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements. The Draft International Standard ballot procedures completed in mid-August 2014.\nAfter C++14, a major revision C++17, informally known as C++1z, was completed by the ISO C++ committee in mid July 2017 and was approved and published in December 2017.\nAs part of the standardization process, ISO also publishes technical reports and specifications:\nMore technical specifications are in development and pending approval.\nLanguage.\nThe C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as \"a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions\"; and \"offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages.\"\nC++ inherits most of C's syntax. A hello world program that conforms to the C standard is also a valid C++ hello world program. The following is adapted from Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:\nint main() {\n std::cout \u00ab \"Hello, world!\\n\";\nSince C++23, with the introduction of std::print functions and module std, this can be expressed less verbosely as:\nimport std;\nint main() {\n std::println(\"Hello, world!\");\nStandard library.\nThe C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types (vectors, linked lists, maps (such as tree maps and hash maps), sets (such as tree sets and hash sets), queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities (I/O streams, for reading from and writing to the console and files), file system manipulation, localisation support, smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi-threading library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that does not use C++ exceptions into C++ exceptions, random number generators, and a slightly modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system).\nThe design of the C++ standard library, much like the C standard library, is minimalistic, and contains only core features for programming, lacking most of the more specialised features offered by the Java standard library or C# standard library. For more features, some third-party libraries such as Boost libraries and POCO C++ Libraries, which offer additional features, may be used to supplement the standard library.\nA large part of the C++ library is based on the Standard Template Library (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include containers as the collections of objects (such as vectors and lists), iterators that provide array-like access to containers, and algorithms that perform operations such as searching and sorting.\nFurthermore, (multi)maps (associative arrays) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators.\nAs in C, the features of the library may be accessed by using the #include directive to include a standard header. The C++ Standard Library provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated. With the introduction of modules in C++20, these headers may be accessed with import, and in C++23, the entire standard library can now be directly imported as module itself, with import std;. Currently, the C++ standard library provides two modules, codice_1 and codice_2 (a compatibility module for codice_1 which exports C standard library facilities into the global namespace).\nThe standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by Alexander Stepanov, who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as \"STL\", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.).\nMost C++ compilers, and all major ones, provide a standards-conforming implementation of the C++ standard library.\nC++ Core Guidelines.\nThe C++ Core Guidelines are an initiative led by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, and Herb Sutter, the convener and chair of the C++ ISO Working Group, to help programmers write 'Modern C++' by using best practices for the language standards C++11 and newer, and to help developers of compilers and static checking tools to create rules for catching bad programming practices.\nThe main aim is to efficiently and consistently write type and resource safe C++.\nThe Core Guidelines were announced in the opening keynote at CPPCon 2015.\nThe Guidelines are accompanied by the Guideline Support Library (GSL), a header only library of types and functions to implement the Core Guidelines and static checker tools for enforcing Guideline rules.\nCompatibility.\nTo give compiler vendors greater freedom, the C++ standards committee decided not to dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation-specific features. The downside of this decision is that object code produced by different compilers is expected to be incompatible. There are, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems. For example, the Itanium C++ ABI is processor-independent (despite its name) and is implemented by GCC and Clang.\nWith C.\nC++ is often considered to be a superset of C but this is not strictly true. Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows implicit conversion from void* to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as new and class, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.\nSome incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard (C99), which now supports C++ features such as line comments (//) and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced a number of new features that C++ did not support that were incompatible or redundant in C++, such as variable-length arrays, native complex-number types (however, the std::complex class in the C++ standard library provides similar functionality, although not code-compatible), designated initializers, compound literals, and the restrict keyword. Some of the C99-introduced features were included in the subsequent version of the C++ standard, C++11 (out of those which were not redundant). However, the C++11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C.\nTo intermix C and C++ code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from/used both in C and C++ must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an extern \"C\" {/*...*/} block. Such a function may not rely on features depending on name mangling (i.e., function overloading).\nInline assembly.\nPrograms developed in C or C++ often utilize inline assembly to take advantage of its low-level functionalities, greater speed, and enhanced control compared to high-level programming languages when optimizing for performance is essential. C++ provides support for embedding assembly language using asm declarations, but the compatibility of inline assembly varies significantly between compilers and architectures. Unlike high-level language features such as Python or Java, assembly code is highly dependent on the underlying processor and compiler implementation.\nVariations across compilers.\nDifferent C++ compilers implement inline assembly in distinct ways.\nInteroperability between C++ and Assembly.\nC++ provides two primary methods of integrating ASM code. \n1. Standalone assembly files \u2013 Assembly code is written separately and linked with C++ code.\n2. Inline assembly \u2013 Assembly code is embedded within C++ code using compiler-specific extensions.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In simple terms, it works by illuminating a sample with high-energy X-rays, causing the atoms within to become excited and emit their own unique, characteristic X-rays\u2014a process similar to how a blacklight makes certain colors fluoresce. By measuring the energy and intensity of these emitted \"secondary\" X-rays, scientists can identify which elements are present in the sample and in what quantities. More technically, XRF is the emission of characteristic \"secondary\" (or fluorescent) X-rays from a material that has been excited by being bombarded with high-energy X-rays or gamma rays.\nThe phenomenon is widely used for elemental analysis and chemical analysis, particularly in the investigation of metals, glass, ceramics and building materials, and for research in geochemistry, forensic science, archaeology and art objects such as paintings.\nUnderlying physics.\nWhen materials are exposed to short-wavelength X-rays or to gamma rays, ionization of their component atoms may take place. Ionization consists of the ejection of one or more electrons from the atom, and may occur if the atom is exposed to radiation with an energy greater than its ionization energy. X-rays and gamma rays can be energetic enough to expel tightly held electrons from the inner orbitals of the atom.\nThe removal of an electron in this way makes the electronic structure of the atom unstable, and electrons in higher orbitals \"fall\" into the lower orbital to fill the hole left behind. In falling, energy is released in the form of a photon, the energy of which is equal to the energy difference of the two orbitals involved. Thus, the material emits radiation, which has energy characteristic of the atoms present. The term \"fluorescence\" is applied to phenomena in which the absorption of radiation of a specific energy results in the re-emission of radiation of a different energy (generally lower).\nCharacteristic radiation.\nEach element has electronic orbitals of characteristic energy. Following removal of an inner electron by an energetic photon provided by a primary radiation source, an electron from an outer shell drops into its place. There are a limited number of ways in which this can happen, as shown in Figure 1. The main transitions are given names: an L\u2192K transition is traditionally called K\u03b1, an M\u2192K transition is called K\u03b2, an M\u2192L transition is called L\u03b1, and so on. Each of these transitions yields a fluorescent photon with a characteristic energy equal to the difference in energy of the initial and final orbital. The wavelength of this fluorescent radiation can be calculated from Planck's law:\nformula_1\nThe fluorescent radiation can be analysed either by sorting the energies of the photons (energy-dispersive analysis) or by separating the wavelengths of the radiation (wavelength-dispersive analysis). Once sorted, the intensity of each characteristic radiation is directly related to the amount of each element in the material. This is the basis of a powerful technique in analytical chemistry. The typical form of the sharp fluorescent spectral lines obtained in the wavelength-dispersive method is illustrated in Figure 2 (see Moseley's law).\nPrimary radiation sources.\nIn order to excite the atoms, a source of radiation is required, with sufficient energy to expel tightly held inner electrons. Conventional X-ray generators, based on electron bombardment of a heavy metal (i.e. tungsten or rhodium) target are most commonly used, because their output can readily be \"tuned\" for the application, and because higher power can be deployed relative to other techniques. X-ray generators in the range 20\u201360 kV are used, which allow excitation of a broad range of atoms. The continuous spectrum consists of \"bremsstrahlung\" radiation: radiation produced when high-energy electrons passing through the tube are progressively decelerated by the material of the tube anode (the \"target\"). A typical tube output spectrum is shown in Figure 3.\nFor portable XRF spectrometers, copper target is usually bombarded with high energy electrons, that are produced either by impact laser or by pyroelectric crystals.\nAlternatively, gamma ray sources, based on radioactive isotopes (such as 109Cd, 57Co, 55Fe, 238Pu and 241Am) can be used without the need for an elaborate power supply, allowing for easier use in small, portable instruments.\nWhen the energy source is a synchrotron or the X-rays are focused by an optic like a polycapillary, the X-ray beam can be very small and very intense. As a result, atomic information on the sub-micrometer scale can be obtained.\nDispersion.\nIn energy-dispersive analysis, the fluorescent X-rays emitted by the material sample are directed into a solid-state detector which produces a \"continuous\" distribution of pulses, the voltages of which are proportional to the incoming photon energies. This signal is processed by a multichannel analyzer (MCA) which produces an accumulating digital spectrum that can be processed to obtain analytical data.\nIn wavelength-dispersive analysis, the fluorescent X-rays emitted by the sample are directed into a diffraction grating-based monochromator. The diffraction grating used is usually a single crystal. By varying the angle of incidence and take-off on the crystal, a small X-ray wavelength range can be selected. The wavelength obtained is given by Bragg's law:\nformula_2\nwhere \"d\" is the spacing of atomic layers parallel to the crystal surface.\nDetection.\nIn energy-dispersive analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, as already mentioned above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), silicon drift detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionizes a large number of detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover the low end of the performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and SDDs occupy the high end of the performance scale.\nIn wavelength-dispersive analysis, the single-wavelength radiation produced by the monochromator is passed into a chamber containing a gas that is ionized by the X-ray photons. A central electrode is charged at (typically) +1700 V with respect to the conducting chamber walls, and each photon triggers a pulse-like cascade of current across this field. The signal is amplified and transformed into an accumulating digital count. These counts are then processed to obtain analytical data.\nX-ray intensity.\nThe fluorescence process is inefficient, and the secondary radiation is much weaker than the primary beam. Furthermore, the secondary radiation from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low penetrating power, and is severely attenuated if the beam passes through air for any distance. Because of this, for high-performance analysis, the path from tube to sample to detector is maintained under vacuum (around 10 Pa residual pressure). This means in practice that most of the working parts of the instrument have to be located in a large vacuum chamber. The problems of maintaining moving parts in vacuum, and of rapidly introducing and withdrawing the sample without losing vacuum, pose major challenges for the design of the instrument. For less demanding applications, or when the sample is damaged by a vacuum (e.g. a volatile sample), a helium-swept X-ray chamber can be substituted, with some loss of low-Z (Z = atomic number) intensities.\nChemical analysis.\nThe use of a primary X-ray beam to excite fluorescent radiation from the sample was first proposed by Glocker and Schreiber in 1928. Today, the method is used as a non-destructive analytical technique, and as a process control tool in many extractive and processing industries. In principle, the lightest element that can be analysed is beryllium (Z = 4), but due to instrumental limitations and low X-ray yields for the light elements, it is often difficult to quantify elements lighter than sodium (Z = 11), unless background corrections and very comprehensive inter-element corrections are made.\nEnergy dispersive spectrometry.\nIn energy-dispersive spectrometers (EDX or EDS), the detector allows the determination of the energy of the photon when it is detected. Detectors historically have been based on silicon semiconductors, in the form of lithium-drifted silicon crystals, or high-purity silicon wafers.\nSi(Li) detectors.\nThese consist essentially of a 3\u20135 mm thick silicon junction type p-i-n diode (same as PIN diode) with a bias of \u22121000 V across it. The lithium-drifted centre part forms the non-conducting i-layer, where Li compensates the residual acceptors which would otherwise make the layer p-type. When an X-ray photon passes through, it causes a swarm of electron-hole pairs to form, and this causes a voltage pulse. To obtain sufficiently low conductivity, the detector must be maintained at low temperature, and liquid-nitrogen cooling must be used for the best resolution. With some loss of resolution, the much more convenient Peltier cooling can be employed.\nWafer detectors.\nMore recently, high-purity silicon wafers with low conductivity have become routinely available. Cooled by the Peltier effect, this provides a cheap and convenient detector, although the liquid nitrogen cooled Si(Li) detector still has the best resolution (i.e. ability to distinguish different photon energies).\nAmplifiers.\nThe pulses generated by the detector are processed by pulse-shaping amplifiers. It takes time for the amplifier to shape the pulse for optimum resolution, and there is therefore a trade-off between resolution and count-rate: long processing time for good resolution results in \"pulse pile-up\" in which the pulses from successive photons overlap. Multi-photon events are, however, typically more drawn out in time (photons did not arrive exactly at the same time) than single photon events and pulse-length discrimination can thus be used to filter most of these out. Even so, a small number of pile-up peaks will remain and pile-up correction should be built into the software in applications that require trace analysis. To make the most efficient use of the detector, the tube current should be reduced to keep multi-photon events (before discrimination) at a reasonable level, e.g. 5\u201320%.\nTherefore, managing this trade-off between speed and accuracy is a fundamental consideration in modern XRF instrument design, especially for high-throughput industrial applications.\nProcessing.\nConsiderable computer power is dedicated to correcting for pulse-pile up and for extraction of data from poorly resolved spectra. These elaborate correction processes tend to be based on empirical relationships that may change with time, so that continuous vigilance is required in order to obtain chemical data of adequate precision.\nDigital pulse processors are widely used in high performance nuclear instrumentation. They are able to effectively reduce pile-up and base line shifts, allowing for easier processing. A low pass filter is integrated, improving the signal to noise ratio. The digital pulse processor requires a significant amount of energy to run, but it provides precise results.\nUsage.\nEnergy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometers are different from wavelength dispersive X-ray (WDX) spectrometers in that they are smaller, simpler in design and have fewer engineered parts; however, the accuracy and resolution of EDX spectrometers are lower than for WDX. EDX spectrometers can also use miniature X-ray tubes or gamma sources, which makes them cheaper and allows miniaturization and portability. This type of instrument is commonly used for portable quality control screening applications, such as testing toys for lead (Pb) content, sorting scrap metals, and measuring the lead content of residential paint. On the other hand, the low resolution and problems with low count rate and long dead-time makes them inferior for high-precision analysis. They are, however, very effective for high-speed, multi-elemental analysis. Field portable XRF analysers currently on the market weigh less than 2\u00a0kg, and have limits of detection on the order of 2 parts per million of lead (Pb) in pure sand. Using a scanning electron microscope and using EDX, studies have been broadened to organic based samples such as biological samples and polymers.\nWavelength dispersive spectrometry.\nIn wavelength dispersive spectrometers (WDX or WDS), the emitted photons are separated by diffraction on a single crystal before being detected. Although wavelength dispersive spectrometers are occasionally used to scan a wide range of wavelengths, producing a spectrum plot as in EDS, they are usually set up to make measurements only at the wavelength of the emission lines of the elements of interest. This is achieved in two different ways:\nSample preparation.\nIn order to keep the geometry of the tube-sample-detector assembly constant, the sample is normally prepared as a flat disc, typically of diameter 20\u201350\u00a0mm. This is located at a standardized, small distance from the tube window. Because the X-ray intensity follows an inverse-square law, the tolerances for this placement and for the flatness of the surface must be very tight in order to maintain a repeatable X-ray flux. Ways of obtaining sample discs vary: metals may be machined to shape, minerals may be finely ground and pressed into a tablet, and glasses may be cast to the required shape. A further reason for obtaining a flat and representative sample surface is that the secondary X-rays from lighter elements often only emit from the top few micrometers of the sample. In order to further reduce the effect of surface irregularities, the sample is usually spun at 5\u201320 rpm. It is necessary to ensure that the sample is sufficiently thick to absorb the entire primary beam. For higher-Z materials, a few millimeters thickness is adequate, but for a light-element matrix such as coal, a thickness of 30\u201340\u00a0mm is needed.\nMonochromators.\nThe common feature of monochromators is the maintenance of a symmetrical geometry between the sample, the crystal and the detector. In this geometry the Bragg diffraction condition is obtained.\nThe X-ray emission lines are very narrow (see figure 2), so the angles must be defined with considerable precision. This is achieved in two ways:\nFlat crystal with S\u00f6ller collimators.\nA S\u00f6ller collimator is a stack of parallel metal plates, spaced a few tenths of a millimeter apart. To improve angular resolution, one must lengthen the collimator, and/or reduce the plate spacing. This arrangement has the advantage of simplicity and relatively low cost, but the collimators reduce intensity and increase scattering, and reduce the area of sample and crystal that can be \"seen\". The simplicity of the geometry is especially useful for variable-geometry monochromators.\nCurved crystal with slits.\nThe Rowland circle geometry ensures that the slits are both in focus, but in order for the Bragg condition to be met at all points, the crystal must first be bent to a radius of 2R (where R is the radius of the Rowland circle), then ground to a radius of R. This arrangement allows higher intensities (typically 8-fold) with higher resolution (typically 4-fold) and lower background. However, the mechanics of keeping Rowland circle geometry in a variable-angle monochromator is extremely difficult. In the case of fixed-angle monochromators (for use in simultaneous spectrometers), crystals bent to a logarithmic spiral shape give the best focusing performance. The manufacture of curved crystals to acceptable tolerances increases their price considerably.\nCrystal materials.\nAn intuitive understanding of X-ray diffraction can be obtained from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. \nThe orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (\"h\", \"k\", \"l\"), and let their spacing be noted by \"d\". \nWilliam Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle \u03b8 between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple \"n\" of the X-ray wavelength \u03bb.(Fig.7)\n formula_3\nThe desirable characteristics of a diffraction crystal are:\nCrystals with simple structures tend to give the best diffraction performance. Crystals containing heavy atoms can diffract well, but also fluoresce more in the higher energy region, causing interference. Crystals that are water-soluble, volatile or organic tend to give poor stability.\nCommonly used crystal materials include LiF (lithium fluoride), ADP (ammonium dihydrogen phosphate), Ge (germanium), Si (silicon), graphite, InSb (indium antimonide), PE (\"tetrakis\"-(hydroxymethyl)-methane, also known as pentaerythritol), KAP (potassium hydrogen phthalate), RbAP (rubidium hydrogen phthalate) and TlAP (thallium(I) hydrogen phthalate). In addition, there is an increasing use of \"layered synthetic microstructures\" (LSMs), which are \"sandwich\" structured materials comprising successive thick layers of low atomic number matrix, and monatomic layers of a heavy element. These can in principle be custom-manufactured to diffract any desired long wavelength, and are used extensively for elements in the range Li to Mg.\nIn scientific methods that use X-ray/neutron or electron diffraction the before mentioned planes of a diffraction can be doubled to display higher order reflections. The given planes, resulting from Miller indices, can be calculated for a single crystal. The resulting values for \"h, k and l\" are then called Laue indices.\nSo a single crystal can be variable in the way, that many reflection configurations of that crystal can be used to reflect different energy ranges.\nThe germanium (Ge111) crystal, for example, can also be used as a Ge333, Ge444 and more.\nFor that reason, the corresponding indices used for a particular experimental setup always get noted behind the crystal material (e.g. Ge111, Ge444).\nThe Ge222 configuration is forbidden due to diffraction rules stating that all allowed reflections must be with all odd or all even Miller indices that, combined, result in formula_4,\nwhere formula_5 is the order of reflection.\nElemental analysis lines.\nThe spectral lines used for elemental analysis of chemicals are selected on the basis of intensity, accessibility by the instrument, and lack of line overlaps. The energies of the spectral lines are given by the Moseley law. Typical lines used, and their wavelengths and energies, are as follows:\nOther lines are often used, depending on the type of sample and equipment available.\nStructural analysis lines.\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) is still the most used method for structural analysis of crystallographic compounds. Yet, with increasing detail on the relation of formula_6-line spectra and the surrounding chemical environment of the ionized metal atom, measurements of the so-called valence-to-core (VtC) energy region become increasingly viable.\nScientists noted that after ionization of 3d-transition metal atom, the formula_6-line intensities and energies shift with oxidation state of the metal and with the species of ligand(s). Spin states in a compound tend to affect this kind of measurement.\nThis means, that by intense study of these spectral lines, one can obtain several crucial pieces of information from a sample. Especially, if there are references that have been studied in detail and can be used to make out differences. The information collected from this kind of measurement include:\nThese measurements are mostly done at synchrotron facilities, although a number of so-called \"in-lab\"-spectrometers have been developed and used for pre-beamtime (time at a synchrotron) measurements.\nDetectors.\nDetectors used for wavelength dispersive spectrometry need to have high pulse processing speeds in order to cope with the very high photon count rates that can be obtained. In addition, they need sufficient energy resolution to allow filtering-out of background noise and spurious photons from the primary beam or from crystal fluorescence. There are four common types of detector:\nGas flow proportional counters are used mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where there are multiple detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane (\"P10\"), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5\u00a0nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionized by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20\u201360 \u03bcm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to the ratio of the detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, aluminised PET film and aluminised polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 \u03bcm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive. The pulses are sorted electronically by \"pulse height selection\" in order to isolate those pulses deriving from the secondary X-ray photons being counted.\nSealed gas detectors are similar to the gas flow proportional counter, except that the gas does not flow through it. The gas is usually krypton or xenon at a few atmospheres pressure. They are applied usually to wavelengths in the 0.15\u20130.6\u00a0nm range. They are applicable in principle to longer wavelengths, but are limited by the problem of manufacturing a thin window capable of withstanding the high pressure difference.\nScintillation counters consist of a scintillating crystal (typically of sodium iodide doped with thallium) attached to a photomultiplier. The crystal produces a group of scintillations for each photon absorbed, the number being proportional to the photon energy. This translates into a pulse from the photomultiplier of voltage proportional to the photon energy. The crystal must be protected with a relatively thick aluminium/beryllium foil window, which limits the use of the detector to wavelengths below 0.25\u00a0nm. Scintillation counters are often connected in series with a gas flow proportional counter: the latter is provided with an outlet window opposite the inlet, to which the scintillation counter is attached. This arrangement is particularly used in sequential spectrometers.\nSemiconductor detectors can be used in theory, and their applications are increasing as their technology improves, but historically their use for WDX has been restricted by their slow response (see EDX).\nExtracting analytical results.\nAt first sight, the translation of X-ray photon count-rates into elemental concentrations would appear to be straightforward: WDX separates the X-ray lines efficiently, and the rate of \"generation\" of secondary photons is proportional to the element concentration. However, the number of photons \"leaving the sample\" is also affected by the physical properties of the sample: so-called \"matrix effects\". These fall broadly into three categories:\nAll elements \"absorb\" X-rays to some extent. Each element has a characteristic absorption spectrum which consists of a \"saw-tooth\" succession of fringes, each step-change of which has wavelength close to an emission line of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the mass absorption coefficient of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium K\u03b1 line is 50 m2/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m2/kg. This means that fluorescent X-rays generated by a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron are absorbed about seven times more (that is 377/50) compared with the fluorescent X-rays generated by the same concentration of aluminium, but in a silicon matrix. That would lead to about one seventh of the count rate, once the X-rays are detected. Mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an iterative procedure is therefore used. To derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.\nEnhancement occurs where the secondary X-rays emitted by a heavier element are sufficiently energetic to stimulate additional secondary emission from a lighter element. This phenomenon can also be modelled, and corrections can be made provided that the full matrix composition can be deduced.\nSample macroscopic effects consist of effects of inhomogeneities of the sample, and unrepresentative conditions at its surface. Samples are ideally homogeneous and isotropic, but they often deviate from this ideal. Mixtures of multiple crystalline components in mineral powders can result in absorption effects that deviate from those calculable from theory. When a powder is pressed into a tablet, the finer minerals concentrate at the surface. Spherical grains tend to migrate to the surface more than do angular grains. In machined metals, the softer components of an alloy tend to smear across the surface. Considerable care and ingenuity are required to minimize these effects. Because they are artifacts of the method of sample preparation, these effects can not be compensated by theoretical corrections, and must be \"calibrated in\". This means that the calibration materials and the unknowns must be compositionally and mechanically similar, and a given calibration is applicable only to a limited range of materials. Glasses most closely approach the ideal of homogeneity and isotropy, and for accurate work, minerals are usually prepared by dissolving them in a borate glass, and casting them into a flat disc or \"bead\". Prepared in this form, a virtually universal calibration is applicable.\nFurther corrections that are often employed include background correction and line overlap correction. The background signal in an XRF spectrum derives primarily from scattering of primary beam photons by the sample surface. Scattering varies with the sample mass absorption, being greatest when mean atomic number is low. When measuring trace amounts of an element, or when measuring on a variable light matrix, background correction becomes necessary. This is really only feasible on a sequential spectrometer. Line overlap is a common problem, bearing in mind that the spectrum of a complex mineral can contain several hundred measurable lines. Sometimes it can be overcome by measuring a less-intense, but overlap-free line, but in certain instances a correction is inevitable. For instance, the K\u03b1 is the only usable line for measuring sodium, and it overlaps the zinc L\u03b2 (L2-M4) line. Thus zinc, if present, must be analyzed in order to properly correct the sodium value.\nOther spectroscopic methods using the same principle.\nIt is also possible to create a characteristic secondary X-ray emission using other incident radiation to excite the sample:\nWhen radiated by an X-ray beam, the sample also emits other radiations that can be used for analysis:\nThe de-excitation also ejects Auger electrons, but Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) normally uses an electron beam as the probe.\nConfocal microscopy X-ray fluorescence imaging is a newer technique that allows control over depth, in addition to horizontal and vertical aiming, for example, when analysing buried layers in a painting.\nInstrument qualification.\nA 2022 review addresses the application of portable instrumentation from quality assurance/quality control perspectives. It provides a guide to the development of a set of Standard Operating Procedures if regulatory compliance guidelines are not available.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many of their descendants were thus endowed with extremely high intelligence and strength, as well as an exceptional capacity and drive to perform good or, as the case may be, evil deeds. The progeny of these travellers are purported to have been the real-life originals of fictionalised characters, both heroic and villainous, over the last few hundred years.\nMembers.\nAs well as Tarzan and Doc Savage, both Lord Peter Wimsey and Sherlock Holmes are descendants of the original families. Other popular characters included by Farmer as members of the Wold Newton family are Solomon Kane; Captain Blood; The Scarlet Pimpernel; Sherlock Holmes's nemesis Professor Moriarty; Phileas Fogg; The Time Traveller (main character of \"The Time Machine\" by H. G. Wells); Allan Quatermain; A. J. Raffles; Professor Challenger; Richard Hannay; Bulldog Drummond; the evil Fu Manchu and his adversary, Sir Denis Nayland Smith; G-8; The Shadow; Sam Spade; Doc Savage's cousin Patricia Savage and one of his five assistants, Monk Mayfair; The Spider; Nero Wolfe; Mr. Moto; The Avenger; Philip Marlowe; James Bond; Lew Archer; Travis McGee; Monsieur Lecoq; and Ars\u00e8ne Lupin.\nUniverse.\nThe Wold Newton Universe (or WNU) is a term coined by Win Scott Eckert to denote an expansion of Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's original Wold Newton Family concept (introduced in \"Tarzan Alive\" [1972]). Eckert introduced the term in 1997 on his website, \"An Expansion of Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Wold Newton Universe\". Eckert and others use Farmer's concept of the Wold Newton Family as a unifying device and to expand the universe that the Wold Newton Family inhabits by including essays in the vein of the Sherlockian \"Game\", in which theories are proposed and supported by supplying contextual background information and persuasive argument; by writing fiction authorized by Farmer and Farmer's Estate which adds elements and characters to the Wold Newton Family and/or the WNU; by writing other fiction which contains \"Easter egg\" references to the Wold Newton Family or the WNU, or which otherwise expands the overall mythos; and by documenting crossovers between fictional characters from various media and genres.\nCharacters incorporated into the WNU are not necessarily blood relatives, descendants, or ancestors of the coach travelers present at the 1795 Wold Cottage meteor strike, but these characters all exist in the same shared fictional universe. Farmer himself penned a number of stories and novels set in what is now termed the Wold Newton Universe; not all characters in Farmer's Wold Newton fiction are core members of the Wold Newton Family, but all are linked into the larger WNU via connections with Farmer's primary Wold Newton Family works, \"Tarzan Alive\" and \"Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life\".\nDepowering superheroes.\nAmong the membership of the WNU are comic book superheroes and supervillains whose published exploits, by their very nature, often prove difficult to reconcile with Farmer's original framework. WNU's root conceit has always been that characters known by the reader as fictional actually lived or are yet living, with their adventures based on true events embroidered by the genre authors who serve as their \"biographers\". Therefore, in order for aspects of larger fictional universes to adhere to WNU's overall continuity and believability, certain accounts of these new characters' lives have been labeled as a distortion of actual events or dismissed as complete fabrication.\nAdditional genres.\nEckert and other post-Farmerian authors\u2014admirers of Farmer's Wold Newton biographies and fiction who write in Eckert's vein\u2014have published numerous further fictional characters in many literary styles and media, including works emulating the aesthetics of the Renaissance, Romantic and Victorian eras; such subgenres of prose fiction as Gothic and steampunk; the fairy tale, mythology and folklore categories of traditional stories; publication formats like the graphic novel, the comic book, the pulp magazine and the penny dreadful; and the non-print media of motion pictures, television shows, radio programs and video games.\nReferences.\nThe expanded WNU is documented in articles by WNU experts on the various WNU-themed websites; in \"Myths for the Modern Age: Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Wold Newton Universe\" (edited by Win Scott Eckert, MonkeyBrain Books, 2005, a 2007 Locus Award finalist); in various issues of \"Farmerphile: The Magazine of Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer\", the prozine dedicated to and authorized by Farmer and published by Michael Croteau, webmaster of the official Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer home page http://; and in various stories, novellas, and novels authorized by Farmer or by Farmer's Estate, such as \"Tales of the Wold Newton Universe\" (edited by Win Scott Eckert and Christopher Paul Carey, Titan Books, 2013) and various books published by Meteor House.\nGoing beyond the WNU is Eckert's \"Crossover Universe\", published in book form by Black Coat Press in two volumes in 2010 as \"Crossovers: A Secret Chronology of the World\", in which a massive continuity is created in a \"six degrees\" game of linked crossover stories. Eckert's \"Crossover Universe\" work is being carried forward by Sean Levin. The important distinction between a Wold Newton story and a crossover story is discussed at length by Eckert and Carey in their introduction to \"Tales of the Wold Newton Universe\".\nSimilar creations.\nAn earlier proponent of this sort of fiction was William S. Baring-Gould, who wrote a fictional biography of Sherlock Holmes entitled \"Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street\".\nIn 1977 C. W. Scott-Giles, an expert in heraldry who served as Fitzalan Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary, published a history of Lord Peter Wimsey's family, going back to 1066 (but describing the loss of the family tree going back to Adam and Eve); the book is based on material from Scott-Giles's correspondence with Dorothy L. Sayers, who wrote at least two of the family anecdotes in the book, one of them in mediaeval French.\nWarren Ellis's comic book series \"Planetary\" has a similar premise of fitting many different superhero, science fiction, and fantasy elements into the same universe. For the most part, constrained by the needs of the story and copyright, Ellis does not use the originals but rather his own re-interpretations of the archetypes.\nAuthor Kim Newman has stated that his \"Anno Dracula\" series was partially inspired by the Wold Newton family.\nThe anthology series \"Tales of the Shadowmen\" edited by Jean-Marc Lofficier is also based on the Wold Newton concept and includes characters from French literature.\nAlan Moore did likewise in his \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" comic book (and its sequels). In this series, various Victorian-era literary characters meet and join the eponymous League; however, they are not descended from a single family. Over the course of the series, the world of the League incorporates many works of fiction from many different eras \u2013 not just Victorian literature \u2013 into its universe. Moore calls the Wold Newton stories \"a seminal influence upon the League\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The team's home field was Lynx Stadium in Ottawa, Ontario. Over 15 seasons, the team was an affiliate of the Montreal Expos (1993\u20132002), Baltimore Orioles (2003\u20132006), and Philadelphia Phillies (2007). At the time, it was the only IL franchise in Canada.\nIn late August 2006, the league approved the conditions to negotiate the sale of the team. The new owners moved the team to Allentown, Pennsylvania, beginning with the 2008 season, where it became known as the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.\nHistory.\nIn 1991, Ottawa businessman and then Ottawa 67's owner Howard Darwin was successful in applying to the IL for an expansion franchise to begin play in 1993, at a cost of $5 million. The Lynx became the second IL franchise to play in Ottawa, after the former Ottawa Giants and Ottawa Athletics of the 1950s. The application was contingent on the City of Ottawa building a baseball stadium for the team. Lynx Stadium was completed in time for the 1993 season.\nThe Lynx began play in 1993, serving as the top farm team for the Montreal Expos. The team won the International League championship in 1995, the only time it would do so. During this period, the Lynx featured such future Major League Baseball players as Rondell White, Cliff Floyd, Matt Stairs, Kirk Rueter, and F.P. Santangelo. The Lynx eventually retired two numbers: Santangelo's 24, and Jamey Carroll's 3.\nIn 2000, Darwin sold his shares in the team to Ray Pecor for $7 million. According to news reports, Pecor lost $1 million annually on the team due to low attendance.\nIn 2003, the Lynx were not given any assurances from either the Montreal Expos or Major League Baseball on the long-term future of the Expos. They became the Triple-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles on September 24, 2002. As a result, Montreal shifted its affiliation to the Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League. The Lynx's working agreement with the Orioles ended when the latter signed a Player Development Contract with the Norfolk Tides on September 25, 2006.\nIn 2006, the ball club was sold to Joe Finley and Craig Stein, while Pecor maintained a minority stake. Finley and Stein declared their intention to move the team to Allentown, Pennsylvania, for the 2008 season, where a new stadium was set to begin construction that September (now built as Coca-Cola Park). The owners, facing a lawsuit from the City of Ottawa if they moved the Lynx, filed a lawsuit of their own against the City of Ottawa on October 17, 2006, seeking $10.75 million in damages claiming that the city failed to provide enough parking spaces, which, the team alleged, was a violation of its lease. The location far from the city centre might have contributed to the attendance problem.\nThe team played its last game in Ottawa on September 3, 2007, in front of a crowd of 7,461\u00a0people, losing to the Syracuse Chiefs, 8\u20135. The Ottawa Lynx ultimately won exactly 1,000 games before leaving Ottawa.\nTitles.\nThe Lynx won the Governors' Cup, the championship of the International League, once by defeating the Norfolk Tides in 1995.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It created a crater approximately across, and embedded itself in the underlying chalk rock to a depth of , passing through of topsoil. The fall was observed by several people, who described a dark body passing through the air. As discovered at its landing point, the stone was warm and smoking; several people reported sounds of explosions as it fell. The owner of the land was Major Edward Topham, a well-known public figure, an ex-soldier, playwright and newspaper proprietor; he publicised the find and exhibited the meteorite publicly at Piccadilly in London.\nThe stone initially weighed . James Sowerby, a naturalist, acquired the meteorite in 1804. The meteorite was later acquired by the British Museum in 1835.\nThe meteorite can nowadays be seen in the Natural History Museum in London.\nAnalysis and research.\nEarly analyses recorded two parts of the stone, an earthy part, and a malleable part. The earthy part analysed as containing silicon, magnesium, iron, and a small amount of nickel, of which some parts of the iron and nickel were in the elemental state; the earthy substance was similar to kaolin (weathered feldspar), but relatively tough. The malleable parts also contained iron and nickel, the majority iron. A form of iron pyrites (iron sulphur compound) was also reported present. Modern science records the meteorite as a L6 ordinary chondrite.\nThe Wold Cottage meteorite was the largest meteorite observed to fall in Britain, and is the second-largest recorded in Europe (after the Ensisheim meteorite that fell in 1492). The meteorite and evidence given about its fall contributed to the debate concerning whether extraterrestrial matter existed on Earth or not, and towards the early scientific study of meteorites.\nThe monument.\nA monument was erected on the location of the stone's impact, by Major Topham, on whose property the stone had fallen. The structure was built of brick square and high, with a plaque on one face.\nIn fiction.\nThe event was used by the science fiction writer Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer in his \"biographies\" of fictional characters (\"Tarzan Alive\" and \"\") as the basis for a literary premise commonly referred to as the Wold Newton family. The film \"Robinson in Ruins\" would also refer to the event, with the main character, Robinson, seeing it showing meteorites always fall at the time of significant events, in this case the 1795 amendment to the Settlement Act which allowed capitalism to develop faster in England.\nThe meteorite plays quite a central role in the 2019 detective novel \"Sherlock Holmes &amp; The Christmas Demon\" by British author James Lovegrove.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an example of the atheistic schools in the Ancient Indian philosophies, dated 900 BCE. Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism, and rejects ritualism. In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.\nIt was a well-attested belief system in ancient India. Brihaspati, a philosopher, is traditionally referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lok\u0101yata philosophy, although some scholars dispute this. Charvaka developed during the Hindu reformation period in the first millennium BCE and is considered a philosophical predecessor to subsequent or contemporaneous heterodox philosophies such as Aj\u00f1\u0101na, \u0100j\u012bvika, Jainism, and Buddhism.

Bhattacharya quotes the grammarian Hemacandra, to the effect that the word c\u0101rv\u0101ka is derived from the root , 'to chew' : \"A C\u0101rv\u0101ka chews the self (carvaty\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e43 c\u0101rv\u0101ka\u1e25). Hemacandra refers to his own grammatical work, U\u1e47\u0101dis\u016btra 37, which runs as follows: mav\u0101ka-\u015by\u0101m\u0101ka-v\u0101rt\u0101ka-jyont\u0101ka-g\u016bv\u0101ka-bhadr\u0101k\u0101daya\u1e25. Each of these words ends with the \u0101ka suffix and is formed irregularly.\" This may also allude to the philosophy's hedonistic precepts of \"eat, drink, and be merry\".\nOthers believe it to mean \"agreeable speech\" or pejoratively, \"sweet-tongued\", from Sanskrit's \"agreeable\" and \"speech\" (which becomes in the nominative singular and in compounds). Yet another hypothesis is that it is eponymous, with the founder of the school being Charvaka, a disciple of Brihaspati.\nAs Lokayata.\nAccording to claims of Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, the traditional name of Charvaka is Lokayata. It was called Lokayata because it was prevalent () among the people (), and meant the world-outlook of the people. The dictionary meaning of Lok\u0101yata (\u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u092f\u0924) signifies \"directed towards, aiming at the world, worldly\".\nIn early to mid 20th century literature, the etymology of \"Lokayata\" has been given different interpretations, in part because the primary sources are unavailable, and the meaning has been deduced from divergent secondary literature. The name Lok\u0101yata, for example, is found in Chanakya's \"Arthashastra\", which refers to three \"\u0101nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012bs\" (\u0905\u0928\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u0940, literally, examining by reason, logical philosophies) \u2013 Yoga, Samkhya and Lok\u0101yata. However, Lok\u0101yata in the Arthashastra is not anti-Vedic, but implies Lok\u0101yata to be a part of Vedic lore. Lok\u0101yata here refers to logic or science of debate (\"disputatio\", \"criticism\"). Rudolf Franke translated \"Lokayata\" in German as \"logisch beweisende Naturerkl\u00e4rung\", that is \"logically proving explanation of nature\".\nIn 8th century CE Jaina literature, \"Saddarsanasamuccaya\" by Haribhadra, \"Lokayata\" is stated to be the Hindu school where there is \"no God, no samsara (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.\"\nThe Buddhist Sanskrit work Divyavadana (ca. 200\u2013350 CE) mentions \"Lokayata\", where it is listed among subjects of study, and with the sense of \"technical logical science\". Shantarakshita and Adi Shankara use the word \"lokayata\" to mean materialism, with the latter using the term Lok\u0101yata, not Charvaka.\nIn Sil\u0101\u1e45ka's commentary on \"S\u016btra-k\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e45gna\", the oldest Jain \u0100gama Prakrt literature, he has used four terms for C\u0101rv\u0101ka, namely, (1) B\u1e5bhaspatya (2) Lok\u0101yata (3) Bh\u016btav\u0101din (4) V\u0101mam\u0101rgin.\nOrigin.\nThe tenets of the Charvaka atheistic doctrines can be traced to the relatively later composed layers of the \"Rigveda\", while substantial discussions on the Charvaka is found in post-Vedic literature. The primary literature of Charvaka, such as the \"Brhaspati Sutra\", is missing or lost. Its theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras (such as the Arthashastra), sutras and the epics (the Mahabharata and Ramayana) of Hinduism as well as from the dialogues of Gautama Buddha and Jain literature.\nIn the oldest of the \"Upanishads\", in chapter 2 of the \"Brhad\u0101ranyaka\" (ca. 900 BCE), the leading theorist Y\u0101jnavalkya states in a passage often referred to by the irreligious, \"So I say, after death there is no awareness.\" This declaration arises in a discussion with his female philosophy interlocutor, Maitreyi, who notices that this might mean there is no afterlife \u2013 no religion: \"After Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya said this, Maitreyi exclaimed: 'Now, sir, you have totally confused me by saying 'after death there is no awareness'.\"\nSubstantial discussions about the Charvaka doctrines are found in texts during the 6th century BCE because of the emergence of competing philosophies such as Buddhism and Jainism. Bhattacharya posits that Charvaka may have been one of several atheistic, materialist schools that existed in ancient India during the 6th century BCE. Though there is evidence of its development in Vedic era, the Charvaka school of philosophy predated the \u0100stika schools as well as being a philosophical predecessor to subsequent or contemporaneous philosophies such as Aj\u00f1\u0101na, \u0100j\u012bvika, Jainism and Buddhism in the classical period of Indian philosophy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nThe earliest Charvaka scholar in India whose texts still survive is Ajita Kesakambali. Although materialist schools existed before Charvaka, it was the only school which systematised materialist philosophy by setting them down in the form of aphorisms in the 6th century BCE. There was a base text, a collection s\u016btras or aphorisms and several commentaries were written to explicate the aphorisms. This should be seen in the wider context of the oral tradition of Indian philosophy. It was in the 6th century BCE onwards, with the emergent popularity of Buddhism, that ancient schools started codifying and writing down the details of their philosophy.\nE. W. Hopkins, in his \"The Ethics of India\" (1924), claims that Charvaka philosophy predated Jainism and Buddhism, mentioning \"the old C\u0101rv\u0101ka or materialist of the 6th century BC\". Rhys Davids assumes that \"lok\u0101yata\" in ca. the 5th century BC came to mean \"skepticism\" in general without yet being organised as a philosophical school. This proves that it had already existed for centuries and had become a generic term by 600 BCE. Its methodology of skepticism is included in the \"Ramayana\", Ayodhya kanda, chapter 108, where Jab\u0101li tries to persuade R\u0101ma to accept the kingdom by using n\u0101stika arguments (R\u0101ma refutes him in chapter 109):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;O, the highly wise! Arrive at a conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing beyond this Universe. Give precedence to that which meets the eye and turn your back on what is beyond our knowledge. (2.108.17)\nThere are alternate theories behind the origins of Charvaka. B\u1e5bhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lok\u0101yata philosophy, although other scholars dispute this. states that a philosopher named Charvaka lived in or about the 6th century BCE, who developed the premises of this Indian philosophy in the form of \"Brhaspati Sutra\". These sutras predate 150 BCE, because they are mentioned in the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya\" (7.3.45).\nArthur Llewellyn Basham, citing the Buddhist \"Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta\", suggests six schools of heterodox, pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, atheistic Indian traditions in 6th century BCE, that included Charvakas and Ajivikas. Charvaka was a living philosophy up to the 12th century in India's historical timeline, after which this system seems to have disappeared without leaving any trace.\nPhilosophy.\nThe Charvaka school of philosophy had a variety of atheistic and materialistic beliefs. They held perception and direct experiences to be the only valid and reliable source of knowledge.\nEpistemology.\nThe Charvaka epistemology holds perception as the primary and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid. Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt. Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect \u2013 sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable means by which the efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.\nCharvaka's epistemological argument can be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states that when there is smoke (middle term), one's tendency may be to leap to the conclusion that it must be caused by fire (major term in logic). While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. In this Indian philosophy such a method of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw. Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe. They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error. Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.\nThis epistemological proposition of Charvakas was influential among various schools of Indian philosophies, by demonstrating a new way of thinking and re-evaluation of past doctrines. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain scholars extensively deployed Charvaka insights on inference in rational re-examination of their own theories.\nComparison with other schools of Hinduism.\nCharvaka epistemology represents minimalist \"pram\u0101\u1e47as\" (epistemological methods) in Hindu philosophy. The other schools of Hinduism developed and accepted multiple valid forms of epistemology. To Charvakas, \"Pratyak\u1e63a\" (perception) was the one valid way to knowledge and other means of knowledge were either always conditional or invalid. While the Charvaka school accepted just one valid means for knowledge, in other schools of Hinduism they ranged between 2 and 6. Advaita Vedanta scholars considered six means of valid knowledge and to truths: \"Pratyak\u1e63a\" (perception), \"Anum\u0101na\" (inference), \"Upam\u0101na\" (comparison and analogy), \"Arth\u0101patti\" (postulation), \"Anupalabdhi\" (non-perception, cognitive proof) and \"\u015aabda\" (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).\nMetaphysics.\nSince none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.\nTherefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like reincarnation, an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of religious rites, other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of merit or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena. To them all natural phenomena was produced spontaneously from the inherent nature of things.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fire is hot, the water cold, refreshing cool the breeze of morn;By whom came this variety ? from their own nature was it born.\nEthics.\nThe Charvaka school is commonly associated with egoism, emphasizing the individual's ends over others. It rejects ethical systems based on supernatural beliefs, advocating pleasure as the only intrinsic good, and promoting hedonism. It also opposes utilitarianism, which seeks collective pleasure, maintaining that individuals should prioritize their own interests and only benefit society if it serves them. Some scholars argue that the Charvaka school is nihilistic, focusing solely on rejecting concepts like \"The Good\" and divinity, rather than actively promoting hedonism.\nConsciousness and afterlife.\nThe Charvaka did not believe in karma, rebirth or an afterlife. To them, all attributes that represented a person, such as thinness, fatness, etc., resided in the body. The \"Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha\" states the Charvaka position as follows,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is no world other than this;\nThere is no heaven and no hell;\nThe realm of Shiva and like regions,\nare fabricated by stupid imposters.\u2014\u200a\nPleasure.\nCharvaka believed that there was nothing wrong with sensual pleasure. Since it is impossible to have pleasure without pain, Charvaka thought that wisdom lay in enjoying pleasure and avoiding pain as far as possible. Unlike many of the Indian philosophies of the time, Charvaka did not believe in austerities or rejecting pleasure out of fear of pain and held such reasoning to be foolish.\nThe \"Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha\" states the Charvaka position on pleasure and hedonism as follows,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe enjoyment of heaven lies in eating delicious food, keeping company of young women, using fine clothes, perfumes, garlands, sandal paste... while moksha is death which is cessation of life-breath... the wise therefore ought not to take pains on account of \"moksha\".\nA fool wears himself out by penances and fasts. Chastity and other such ordinances are laid down by clever weaklings.\n\u2014\u200aThe scholar Bhattacharya argues that the common belief that \"all materialists are nothing but sensualists\" is a misconception, as no authentic Charvaka aphorism have been cited by the movement's opponents to support this view.\nReligion.\nCharvakas rejected many of the standard religious conceptions of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Ajivikas, such as an afterlife, reincarnation, samsara, karma and religious rites. They were critical of the Vedas, as well as Buddhist scriptures. The \"Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e43graha\" with commentaries by Madhavacharya describes the Charvakas as critical of the Vedas, materialists without morals and ethics. To Charvakas, the text states, the Vedas suffered from several faults \u2013 errors in transmission across generations, untruth, self-contradiction and tautology.\nThe Charvakas pointed out the disagreements, debates and mutual rejection by \"karmakanda\" Vedic priests and \"j\u00f1\u0101nakanda\" Vedic priests, as proof that either one of them is wrong or both are wrong, as both cannot be right. Charvakas, according to \"Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e43graha\" verses 10 and 11, declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies whose only usefulness was to provide livelihood to priests. They also held the belief that Vedas were invented by man, and had no divine authority. Charvakas rejected the need for ethics or morals, and suggested that \"while life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on ghee even though he runs in debt\".\nThe Jain scholar Haribhadra, in the last section of his text \"Saddarsanasamuccaya\", includes Charvaka in his list of six \"dar\u015banas\" of Indian traditions, along with Buddhism, Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Jainism and Jaiminiya. Haribhadra notes that Charvakas assert that there is nothing beyond the senses, consciousness is an emergent property, and that it is foolish to seek what cannot be seen. The accuracy of these views, attributed to Charvakas, has been contested by scholars.\nPublic administration.\nAn extract from \"Aaine-Akbari\" (vol.III, tr. by H. S. Barrett, pp217\u2013218) written by Abul Fazl, the famous historian of Akbar's court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar's insistence. The account is given by the historian Vincent Smith, in his article titled \"The Jain Teachers of Akbar\". Some Carvaka thinkers are said to have participated in the symposium. Under the heading \"Nastika\" Abul Fazl has referred to the good work, judicious administration and welfare schemes that were emphasised by the Charvaka law-makers. Somadeva has also mentioned the Charvaka method of defeating the enemies of the nation.\nMention in \"Mahabharata\".\nIn the epic Mahabharata, Book 12 Chapter 39, a rakshasa who dresses up like a Brahmin and appoints himself as spokesperson for all Brahmins is named \"Charvaka\". Charvaka criticizes Yudhishthira for killing his kinsmen, superiors, and teacher, and claims that all the Brahmins are uttering maledictions to him. Yudhishthira is ashamed of this, but the Brahmin Vaishampayana reassures him. The Brahmins, now filled with rage, destroy Charvaka with the power of their mantras.\nMention in other works.\nNo independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found except for a few s\u016btras attributed to Brihaspati. The 8th century \"Tattvopaplavasimha\" of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da with Madhyamaka influence is a significant source of Charvaka philosophy. Shatdarshan Samuchay and Sarvadar\u015banasa\u1e45\u0307graha of Vidyaranya are a few other works which elucidate Charvaka thought.\nOne of the widely studied references to the Charvaka philosophy is the \"Sarva-dar\u015bana-sa\u1e45graha\" (etymologically all-philosophy-collection), a famous work of 14th century Advaita Vedanta philosopher M\u0101dhava Vidy\u0101ra\u1e47ya from South India, which starts with a chapter on the Charvaka system. After invoking, in the Prologue of the book, the Hindu gods Shiva and Vishnu (\"by whom the earth and rest were produced\"), Vidy\u0101ra\u1e47ya asks, in the first chapter:\nSanskrit poems and plays like the Nai\u1e63adha-carita, Prabodha-candrodaya, \u0100gama-dambara, Vidvanmoda-tara\u1e45gi\u1e47\u012b and K\u0101dambar\u012b contain representations of the Charvaka thought. However, the authors of these works were thoroughly opposed to materialism and tried to portray the Charvaka in an unfavourable light. Therefore, their works should only be accepted critically.\nLoss of original works.\nThere was no continuity in the Charvaka tradition after the 12th century. Whatever is written on Charvaka post this is based on second-hand knowledge, learned from preceptors to disciples and no independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found. Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Charvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of its ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:\n\"Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organised school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.\"\nMughal era.\nAin-i-Akbari, a record of the Mughal Emperor Akbar's court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar's insistence (also see ). In the text, the Mughal historian Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak summarizes the Charvaka philosophy as \"unenlightened\" and characterizes their works of literature as \"lasting memorials to their ignorance\". He notes that Charvakas considered paradise as \"the state in which man lives as he chooses, without control of another\", while hell as \"the state in which he lives subject to another's rule\". On state craft, Charvakas believe, states Mubarak, that it is best when \"knowledge of just administration and benevolent government\" is practiced.\nControversy on reliability of sources.\n states that the claims against Charvaka of hedonism, lack of any morality and ethics and disregard for spirituality is from texts of competing religious philosophies (Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism). Its primary sources, along with commentaries by Charvaka scholars, are missing or lost. This reliance on indirect sources raises the question of reliability and whether there was a bias and exaggeration in representing the views of Charvakas. Bhattacharya points out that multiple manuscripts are inconsistent, with key passages alleging hedonism and immorality missing in many manuscripts of the same text.\nThe \"Skhalitapramathana Yuktihetusiddhi\" by \u0100ryadevap\u0101da, in a manuscript found in Tibet, discusses the Charvaka philosophy, but attributes a theistic claim to Charvakas - that happiness in this life, and the only life, can be attained by worshiping gods and defeating demons. Toso posits that as Charvaka philosophy's views spread and were widely discussed, non-Charvakas such as \u0100ryadevap\u0101da added certain points of view that may not be of the Charvakas'.\nBuddhists, Jains, Advaita Vedantins and Ny\u0101ya philosophers considered the Charvakas as one of their opponents and tried to refute their views. These refutations are indirect sources of Charvaka philosophy. The arguments and reasoning approaches Charvakas deployed were so significant that they continued to be referred to, even after all the authentic Charvaka/Lok\u0101yata texts had been lost. However, the representation of the Charvaka thought in these works is not always firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of Charvaka texts and should be viewed critically.\nLikewise, states Bhattacharya, the charge of hedonism against Charvaka might have been exaggerated. Countering the argument that the Charvakas opposed all that was good in the Vedic tradition, states, \"It may be said from the available material that C\u0101rv\u0101kas hold truth, integrity, consistency, and freedom of thought in the highest esteem.\"\nInfluence on Europe and China.\nAccording to reports, the Europeans were surprised by the openness and rational doubts of the Mughal emperor Akbar and the Indians. In Pierre De Jarric's \"Histoire\" (1610), based on the Jesuit reports, the Mughal emperor is compared to an atheist himself: \"Thus we see in this Prince the common fault of the atheist, who refuses to make reason subservient to faith (...)\"\nHannah Chapelle Wojciehowski writes this concerning the Jesuit descriptions in the paper \"East-West Swerves: C\u0101rv\u0101ka Materialism and Akbar's Religious Debates at Fatehpur Sikri\" (2015):\"...The information they sent back to Europe was disseminated widely in both Catholic and Protestant countries (...) A more detailed understanding of Indian philosophies, including C\u0101rv\u0101ka, began to emerge in Jesuit missionary writings by the early to mid-seventeenth century.\"The Jesuit Roberto De Nobili wrote in 1613 that the \"Logaidas\" (Lokayatas) \"hold the view that the elements themselves are god\". Some decades later, Heinrich Roth, who studied Sanskrit in Agra ca. 1654\u201360, translated the \"Vedantasara\" by the influential Vedantic commentator Sadananda (14th). This text depicts four different schools of the Carvaka philosophies.\nWojciehowski notes: \"Rather than proclaiming a C\u0101rv\u0101ka renaissance in Akbar's court, it would be safer to suggest that the ancient school of materialism never really went away.\"\nIn \"Classical Indian Philosophy\" (2020), by Peter Adamson and Jonardon Ganeri, they mention a lecture by Henry T. Coolebrooke in 1827 on the schools of the Carvaka/Lokayata materialists. Adamson and Ganeri compare the Carvakas to the \"emergentism in the philosophy of mind,\" which is traced back to John Stuart Mill.\nThey write that Mill \"sounds like a follower of Brhaspati, founder of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka system, when he writes in his \"System of Logic\" that 'All organised bodies are composed of parts, similar to those composing inorganic nature (...)'\"\nThe historian of ideas Dag Herbj\u00f8rnsrud has pointed out that the Charvaka schools influenced China: \"This Indian-Chinese materialist connection is documented in a little-known but groundbreaking paper by professor Huang Xinchuan, \"Lokayata and Its Influence in China,\" published in Chinese in 1978 (English version in the quarterly journal \"Social Sciences\" in March 1981). Xinchuan, a senior researcher at the China Academy of Social Science, demonstrates how the Indian Lok\u0101yata schools exercised an influence on ancient Chinese over the centuries. He lists 62 classical texts in China that refer to these Indian material-atheistic schools, from the \"Brahmajala Sutra\" translated by Zhi Qian (Chih Chien, 223\u2013253), of the Kingdom of Wu, to \"An Explanation for Brahmajala Sutra\" written by Ji Guang (Chi-kuang, 1528\u20131588) of the Ming Dynasty. In addition, Xinchuan mentions four texts on Lokayata in Chinese by Japanese Buddhist writers.\"\nXinchuan's paper explains how the Buddhists regarded the Lokayatikas as fellow-travellers of the Confucian and the Taoist Schools, and how they launched an attack on them because of their materialistic views. Xinchuan cites, as also Rasik Vihari Joshi noted in 1987, dozens of texts where Chinese classical works describe Lokayata either as \"Shi-Jian-Xing\" (\"doctrine prevailing in the world\"), \"Wu-Hou-Shi-Lun\" (\"doctrine of denying after-life\"), or refers to \"Lu-Ka-Ye-Jin\" (the \"Lok\u0101yata Sutra\").\nCommentators.\nAviddhakar\u1e47a, Bhavivikta, Kambalasvatara, Purandara and Udbhatabhatta are the five commentators who developed the Carvaka/Lokayata system in various ways.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sayers\nMurder Must Advertise is a 1933 mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers, the eighth in her series featuring Lord Peter Wimsey. Most of the action of the novel takes place in an advertising agency, a setting with which Sayers was familiar as she had herself worked as an advertising copywriter until 1931.\nPlot.\nDeath Bredon arrives at Pym's Publicity Ltd, an advertising agency, to take up the post of junior copywriter. He is assigned the room of his predecessor Victor Dean, who has died in a fall down the office's iron spiral staircase. The doctor states that death was caused either by a broken neck, due to his landing on his head at the bottom of the stair, or by a wound of the right temple. The death appears suspicious, as the victim apparently made no attempt to save himself as he fell. Looking through Dean's desk, Bredon discovers a partially-completed letter to the firm's proprietor, Mr Pym, telling him that something 'undesirable' is going on in the office.\nBredon befriends Pamela Dean, Victor's sister, so that she can get him into a cocaine-fuelled fancy-dress party hosted by Dian de Momerie, a socialite with whom Dean had been associating. Disguised as Harlequin, Bredon attracts the attention of de Momerie and later meets her several times, always in disguise. His presence annoys de Momerie's companion Major Tod Milligan, who is supplying her with drugs.\nIt is revealed that Death Bredon is in fact Lord Peter Wimsey, who has been brought in by Pym to investigate Dean's death. Various clues turn up: a catapult belonging to 'Ginger' Joe, the office boy; a carved stone scarab belonging to Dean; and \u00a350 in banknotes found in the desk of Mr Tallboy, group manager.\nAfter having a drink in a Covent Garden pub, newspaper reporter Hector Puncheon discovers that someone has slipped cocaine into his coat pocket. Chief Inspector Charles Parker, Wimsey's brother-in-law, suspects that Puncheon has stumbled on Milligan's drugs gang, but finds no further suspicious activity there. It appears that the cocaine is being distributed from a different pub each week.\nPuncheon spots a man from the pub who is behaving suspiciously, and who almost immediately falls in front of a train and is killed. Searching the man's flat, Wimsey and Parker discover a phone book with the names of many pubs ticked off, including the one in Covent Garden. Wimsey realises what has been happening. One of Pym's major clients runs a newspaper advertisement every Friday, the headline for which is approved a few days earlier. The first letter of the headline is being used to indicate the pub for that week, with Tallboy covertly supplying the letter to the gang in advance.\nMilligan is killed in an 'accident', and Wimsey \u2013 in his identity as Bredon \u2013 is nearly jailed for the murder of Dian de Momerie (also the gang's work). The police want to catch the ringleaders during their next weekly drug distribution. Using the phone book, all they need to find the next pub is the letter for the week, as provided by Tallboy.\nWimsey is sure that Tallboy killed Victor Dean, but he does not want to act until the gang has been rounded up. On the night of the next drug distribution, Tallboy comes to Wimsey's flat to confess. He says that, when he was in financial difficulty, he was lured into the scheme with an innocent-sounding story and the offer of money but soon became trapped. Dean had found out and was blackmailing him, so Tallboy killed Dean, using Ginger Joe's catapult and the scarab, making it look like an accidental fall on the staircase. Wanting to spare his wife and child, Tallboy proposes suicide. Wimsey, seeing a gang member watching in the street below his window, suggests Tallboy leave on foot, without looking behind him. Both know that the gang's killers are waiting, and Tallboy is knocked down and killed as he walks home.\nLiterary significance and criticism.\nIn their review of Crime novels (revised edition 1989), the US writers Barzun and Taylor called the novel \"A superb example of Sayers' ability to set a group of people going. The advertising agency is inimitable, and hence better than the De Momerie crowd that goes with it. The murder is ingenious and Wimsey is just right\".\nWriting in 1993, the biographer Barbara Reynolds noted that \"Sayers herself disliked the novel, which she wrote quickly in order to fulfil her publisher's contract, and was unsure whether it would ring true with the reading public\". Reynolds quotes a letter that Sayers wrote to her publisher Victor Gollancz on 14 September 1932:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The new book is nearly done. I hate it because it isn't the one I wanted to write, but I had to shove it in because I couldn't get the technical dope on \"The Nine Tailors\" in time. Still, you never know what people will fancy, do you? It...deals with the dope-traffic, which is fashionable at the moment, but I don't feel that this part is very convincing, as I can't say \"I know dope\". Not one of my best efforts.\nIn her 1941 book \"The Mind of the Maker\" Sayers wrote: \"I undertook (not very successfully) to present a contrast of two 'cardboard' worlds, equally fictitious\u2014the world of advertising and the world of the post-war 'Bright Young People'. (It was not very successful, because I knew and cared much more about advertising than about Bright Youth)\". But she went on to quote a reader who pointed out that \"Peter Wimsey, who represents reality, never appears in either world except in disguise\". She commented, \"It was perfectly true; and I had never noticed it. With all its defects of realism, there had been some measure of integral truth about the book's Idea, since it issued, without my conscious connivance, in a true symbolism\".\nBackground.\nMost of the action of the novel takes place in an advertising agency, a setting with which Sayers was very familiar as she had herself been employed as a copywriter at S. H. Benson's agency, located at Kingsway from 1922 to 1931. In chapter 12 of the novel she quotes the slogan \"Guinness is good for you\", from her own jingle \"If he can say as you can. / Guinness is good for you / How grand to be a Toucan / Just think what Toucan do\". Lord Peter, as Death Bredon, comes up with a brilliant advertising campaign for a cigarette, \"Whiffling around Britain,\" which recalls the Colman's Mustard Club campaign on which Sayers herself worked extensively. Her colleague Bobby Bevan was the inspiration for one of the characters in the novel, Mr Ingleby.\nAdaptations.\n\"Murder Must Advertise\" was adapted by Bill Craig for television in 1973 as a BBC TV mini-series starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey. A six-part radio adaptation by Alistair Beaton was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 1979, again with Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72094", "revid": "42407475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72094", "title": "Martin Frobisher", "text": "English sea captain and privateer (1535\u20131594)\nSir Martin Frobisher (; c.\u20091535/1539 \u2013 22 November 1594) was an English sea captain and privateer who made three voyages to the New World looking for the North-west Passage. He probably sighted Resolution Island near Labrador in eastern Canada, before entering Frobisher Bay and landing on present-day Baffin Island.\nOn his second voyage, Frobisher found what he thought was gold ore and carried of it home on three ships, where initial assaying determined it to be worth a profit of \u00a35.20 per ton (equivalent to \u00a3 per ton in 2023). Encouraged, Frobisher returned to Canada with an even larger fleet and dug several mines around Frobisher Bay. He carried 1,350 tons of the ore back to England, where, after years of smelting, it was realized that the ore was a worthless rock containing the mineral hornblende. As an English privateer, he plundered riches from French ships. He was later knighted for his service in repelling the Spanish Armada in 1588.\nEarly life.\nMartin Frobisher was probably born in 1535 or 1536, the son of merchant Bernard Frobisher of Altofts, Yorkshire, and Margaret York of Gouthwaite. He was the third of five children when his father died prematurely in 1542. The family was left in the care of his uncle, Francis Frobisher. Little else is known of his early life in Yorkshire; his education appears to have been rudimentary. In hopes of better opportunity, young Frobisher was sent to London in 1549 to live with a maternal relative, Sir John York. York was a wealthy and influential member of the Merchant Taylors and had important connections in the royal government.\nIn 1553, Thomas Wyndham led the first English expedition to West Africa, comprising three ships and 140 men. York was an investor in the enterprise and Frobisher accompanied the fleet in an unknown capacity. After plundering Portuguese ships in the vicinity of Madeira, they made their most successful transactions on the Gold Coast, trading English cloth for 150 pounds of gold. Pushing further south they reached Benin and negotiated directly with Oba Orhogbua for 80 tons of melegueta pepper. After some initial reluctance, Orhogbua agreed to trade but while the pepper was being gathered, disease swept through the English crew killing many of them including the expedition leader, Wyndham. Lacking sufficient sailors to crew the entire fleet, they abandoned one ship and, in their panic to leave, even left behind some members of the expedition. The return voyage was extremely difficult for the sick and short-handed crew. Another ship was lost and when the one remaining ship returned to England only 40 of the original 140 crewmen were still alive. Frobisher was one of the survivors, perhaps a confirmation of York's assessment that Frobisher had \"great spirit and bould courage, and natural hardnes of body [\"sic\"].\"\nDespite the loss of two ships and 100 lives, the 1553 voyage was considered a financial success and investors, including York, funded another trading expedition to Portuguese Guinea in 1554. Undaunted by his first experience, Frobisher joined the new expedition and served as an apprentice merchant working for York's trading representative, John Beryn. Three ships left Dartmouth in November 1554 under the command of John Lok. This may have been Frobisher's first acquaintance with the Lok family, a relationship that would play an important role in his future.\nAfter seven weeks' sailing, they made their first landfall near the Cestos River in present-day Liberia. They traded for a quantity of pepper and then proceeded to the Gold Coast, the West African gold trade centre. The local government refused to deal with the English until they provided a hostage to ensure negotiations in good faith. Frobisher volunteered to serve as the hostage and discussions were allowed to proceed. However, before they could conclude a deal, a Portuguese ship appeared offshore and fired on the English fleet. The expedition abandoned Frobisher and went elsewhere to trade, eventually returning to England with a valuable cargo of gold, pepper, and ivory. His African captors then handed Frobisher over to the Portuguese at their trading post of Mina, where he was imprisoned in the castle of S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina. After nine months or so, the Portuguese authorities sent him to Portugal, whence he eventually made his way back to England about 1558.\nPrivateer and pirate.\nThe circumstances and timing of Frobisher's return from Portugal are unclear. There is no indication of any diplomatic or financial effort to secure his release; perhaps the Portuguese simply saw no advantage to holding a low-ranking political prisoner any longer. Frobisher must have returned to the sea soon after his release. There is some evidence that by 1559, he led a voyage to the Barbary Coast to secure the release of an English hostage, Anthony Hammond. In September of the same year the well-known pirate, Henry Strangways, testified in court that Frobisher had been part of an aborted plot to attack and plunder the Portuguese fortress of Mina where Frobisher had been held captive in 1555.\nOn 30 September 1559, Frobisher married a Yorkshire widow, Isobel Richard, who had two young children and a substantial settlement from her previous marriage to Thomas Rigatt of Snaith. Little is known of their domestic life, but having spent all her inheritance to finance his ventures, Frobisher seems to have left her and her children by the mid-1570s; Isobel's death in a poorhouse in 1588 went unremarked by the ambitious captain.\nIn 1563, Frobisher became involved in a privateering venture with his brother, John Frobisher, and a fellow Yorkshireman, John Appleyard. Appleyard was licensed to seize ships of the French Catholic party and financed a fleet of three vessels. Martin Frobisher captained one vessel and may have been fleet commander. By May 1563, they had seized five French ships and brought them to Plymouth harbour. Frobisher was promptly arrested by officers of the Privy Council because his ship had also participated in the seizure of a Spanish ship which resulted in the death of 40 Englishmen. The leader of this attack was the pirate Thomas Cobham, who gave Frobisher the Spanish cargo of tapestries and wine. Possession of these goods was sufficient evidence to land Frobisher in prison.\nIn 1564, Frobisher was released from prison. In 1565, he purchased two ships, the \"Mary Flower\" and \"William Baxter\". His stated intention was to outfit the ships for a trading expedition to the Guinea coast. Based on previous experience, officials were skeptical of his motives and when a storm drove him into Scarborough, he was seized along with the \"William Baxter\". His brother, John Frobisher, was captain of the \"Mary Flower\" and escaped arrest. Martin Frobisher was once again imprisoned briefly by the admiralty court.\nOn 31 October 1566, Frobisher was again set free on the condition that he refrain from going to sea without a license. In 1568, he commanded the \"Robert\" in service to the exiled Cardinal of Chatillon who licensed at least six vessels to prey on French shipping. For a brief time Frobisher associated with other notable privateers including John Hawkins and William Winter. However, Frobisher refused to limit his depredations to French Catholic vessels and also seized Protestant ships carrying English goods. In 1569, he was again arrested by admiralty officers and imprisoned first at Fleet prison and then at Marshalsea. He might have remained there for some time if not for the intervention of the lord admiral, Edward Fiennes de Clinton and the secretary of state, William Cecil. With their help, Frobisher was free again in March 1570.\nThe terms of his release are unknown but it appears that Frobisher was required to undertake certain assignments at the direction of the Privy Council. In October 1571, he was commissioned to command four ships in the search for pirates and smugglers along the English coast. There is no indication that he had any success in this effort. In 1572, he was directed to the Irish coast to provide logistical support for the English campaign against the Desmond Rebellions.\nStarting in 1571, Frobisher was involved in various plots that ran counter to government interest. He possibly had the tacit approval of the Privy Council, suggesting that he may have been working as a double agent. He was briefly associated with a plan to help the Earl of Desmond flee England; then a proposal to lead a group of disaffected English mercenaries to seize Flushing for the Spanish king; and finally, in 1573, a plot to capture the English rebel, Thomas Stukley.\nAccording to the \"Dictionary of National Biography\", the first direct notice of Frobisher apparently is an account in the state papers of two interrogations in 1566, \"on suspicion of his having fitted out a vessel as a pirate\". On 21 August 1571, Captain E. Horsey wrote to Lord Burghley from Portsmouth that he \"has expedited the fitting out of a hulk for M. Frobisher\"; this is the earliest mention of Frobisher being in the Crown's employ. Burghley, then chief minister of the Queen, became Lord High Treasurer in 1572. From the latter part of 1571 to 1572, Frobisher was in the public service at sea off the coast of Ireland.\nNorth-west passage.\nThroughout much of the sixteenth century, the feasibility of a northern route to Cathay and the East Indies was debated and tested by England. In 1508, Sebastian Cabot led one of the first expeditions to search for a North-west Passage. In the 1530s, Robert Thorne and Roger Barlow tried unsuccessfully to interest Henry VIII in a plan to sail directly over the North Pole to China. In 1551 a company of English merchants (later known as the Muscovy Company) was formed to search for a northeast passage to Cathay. The initiative failed to find a route but did establish a long-lasting trade relationship with Russia. In the 1560s Humphrey Gilbert was an influential advocate for seeking a North-west Passage and penned a detailed treatise in support of the idea.\nAlthough Frobisher may have expressed interest in a search for the North-west Passage as early as 1560, it was only much later that he actively pursued the idea. In 1574, Frobisher petitioned the Privy Council for permission and financial support to lead an expedition to find a north-west passage to \"the Southern Sea\" (the Pacific Ocean) and thence to Cathay. Some of its members were intrigued by his proposal, but cautiously referred him to the Muscovy Company, an English merchant consortium which had previously sent out several parties searching for the Northeast Passage around the Arctic coasts of Norway and Russia, and held exclusive rights to any northern sea routes to the East.\nFirst voyage.\nIn 1576, Frobisher persuaded the Muscovy Company to license his expedition. With the help of the company's director, Michael Lok (whose well-connected father William Lok had held an exclusive mercers' licence to provide Henry VIII with fine cloths), Frobisher was able to raise enough capital for three barques: \"Gabriel\" and \"Michael\" of about 20\u201325 tons each, and an unnamed pinnace of 10 tons, with a total crew of 35. Queen Elizabeth I sent word that she had \"good liking of their doings\", and the ships weighed anchor at Blackwall on 7 June 1576. As they headed downstream on the Thames, Elizabeth waved to the departing ships from a window of Greenwich Palace, while cannons fired salutes and a large assembly of the people cheered.\nOn 26 June 1576, the little fleet reached the Shetland Islands, where it stopped to repair a leak in \"Michael\"'s hull and repair the barques' water casks. The ships hoisted sail the same evening and set course westwards, sailing west by north for three days until a violent storm arose and pounded them continuously through 8 July. On 11 July 1576, they sighted the mountains of the southeastern tip of Greenland, which they mistook for the non-existent island called 'Friesland'. Crossing the Davis Strait, they encountered another violent storm in which the pinnace was sunk and \"Michael\" turned back to England, but \"Gabriel\" sailed on for four days until her crew sighted what they believed was the coast of Labrador. The landmass was actually the southernmost tip of Baffin Island; Frobisher named it \"Queen Elizabeth's Foreland\".\nThe ship reached the mouth of Frobisher Bay a few days later, and because ice and wind prevented further travel north, Frobisher determined to sail westwards up the bay, which he believed to be the entrance to the North-west Passage, naming it Frobisher's Strait, to see \"whether he might carry himself through the same into some open sea on the backside\". \"Gabriel\" sailed northwestwards, keeping in sight of the bay's north shore. On 18 August 1576, Burch's Island was sighted and named after the ship's carpenter who first spied it; there the expedition met some local Inuit. Having made arrangements with one of the Inuit to guide them through the region, Frobisher sent five of his men in a ship's boat to return him to shore, instructing them to avoid getting too close to any of the others. The boat's crew disobeyed, however, and five of Frobisher's men were taken captive.\nAfter days of searching, Frobisher could not recover the insubordinate sailors, and eventually took hostage a native man to see if an exchange for the missing boat's crew could be arranged. The captive refused to communicate with his fellow Inuit and Frobisher's men were never seen again by their fellows, but Inuit oral tradition tells that the men lived among them for a few years of their own free will until they died attempting to leave Baffin Island in a self-made boat.\nMeanwhile, the local man, \"Wherupon, when he founde himself in captivitie, for very choler and disdain, he bit his tong in twayne within his mouth: notwithstanding, he died not therof, but lived untill he came in Englande, and then he died of colde which he had taken at sea.\"\nFrobisher turned homewards, and was well received by the Queen when he docked in London on 9 October. Among the things which had been hastily brought away by the men was a black stone \"as great as a half-penny loaf\" which had been found loose on the surface of Hall's Island of Baffin Island by the shipmaster, Robert Garrard, who took it to be sea-coal, of which they had to need. Frobisher took no account of the black rock but kept it as a token of possession of the new territory.\nMichael Lok said that Frobisher, upon his return to London from the Arctic, had given him the black stone as the first object taken from the new land. Lok brought samples of the stone to the royal assayer in the Tower of London and two other expert assayers, all of whom declared that it was worthless, saying that it was marcasite and contained no gold. Lok then took the \"ore\" to an Italian alchemist living in London, Giovanni Battista Agnello, who claimed it was gold-bearing. Agnello assayed the ore three times and showed Lok small amounts of gold dust; when he was challenged as to why the other assayers failed to find gold in their specimens, Agnello replied, \"Bisogna sapere adulare la natura\" (\"One must know how to flatter nature\"). Ignoring the negative reports, Lok secretly wrote to the Queen to inform her of the encouraging result, and used this assessment to lobby investors to finance another voyage. Subsequently the stone became the focus of intense attention by the Cathay enterprise's venturers, who saw in it the possibility of vast profits to be derived from mining the rocky islands of \"Meta Incognita\"; gossip spread in the court and from there throughout London about the gold powder Agnello was supposedly deriving from the rock.\nSecond voyage.\nIn 1577, a much bigger expedition than the former was fitted out. The Queen lent the 200-ton ship or \"Ayde\" to the Company of Cathay (Frobisher's biographer James McDermott says she sold it) and invested \u00a31000 () in the expedition. Prior to 30 March 1577, Frobisher petitioned the Queen to be confirmed as High Admiral of the north-western seas and governor of all lands discovered, and to receive five per cent of profits from trade. It is unknown whether or not his request was ever granted. Michael Lok, meanwhile, was petitioning the queen for his own charter, by the terms of which the Company of Cathay would have sole rights to exploit the resources of all seas, islands and lands to the west and north of England, as well as any goods produced by the peoples occupying them; Frobisher would be apportioned a much smaller share of the profits. Lok's request was ignored and a charter was never issued, nor was a royal license granted, creating corporate ambiguity that redounded to the Queen's benefit.\nBesides \"Ayde\", the expedition included the ships \"Gabriel\" and \"Michael\"; Frobisher's second-in-command aboard \"Ayde\" was Lieutenant George Best (who later wrote the most informative account of the three voyages) with Christopher Hall as master, while the navigator Edward Fenton was in command of \"Gabriel\". The learned John Dee, one of the preeminent scholars of England, acquired shares in the Cathay Company's venture, and instructed Frobisher and Hall in the use of navigational instruments and the mathematics of navigation, as well as advising them which books, charts, and instruments the expedition should purchase. The fleet left Blackwall on 27 May 1577 and headed down the Thames, ostensibly having, per the instructions of the Privy Council, a maximum complement of 120 men, including 90 mariners, gunners and carpenters to crew the ship, as well as refiners, merchants, and thirty Cornish miners; this figure included a group of convicts to be expatriated and put to use as miners in the new lands. Frobisher had exceeded the assigned quota of crewmen by at least twenty men, and perhaps by as many as forty. Letters from the Privy Council were waiting for him at Harwich, however, commanding him to trim the excess; consequently, he sent the convicts and several seamen ashore at the harbour on 31 May and set sail northwards to Scotland. The fleet anchored at St Magnus Sound in the Orkney Islands on 7 June 1577 to take on water, and weighed anchor that evening. It enjoyed fair weather and favourable winds on its passage across the Atlantic, and \"Friesland\" (southern Greenland) was first sighted on 4 July. Hall and Frobisher each attempted landing in the ship's boat but were driven back by fog and the certain knowledge of unseen ice in the water before them.\nOn 8 July 1577, presented with no opportunity to land, Frobisher set his course westwards. The ships were caught almost immediately in severe storms and separated, each of them lowering their sails for long intervals. They continued this way for several days, tracking before the wind until the weather cleared on 17 July and the fleet was able to regroup, a testament to the skill of the masters. A sailor aboard \"Ayde\" spied Hall's Island at the mouth of Frobisher Bay the same evening. The next day, Frobisher and a small party landed at Little Hall's Island in \"Ayde's\" pinnace to search for more samples of the black ore acquired originally by Robert Garrard, but found none. On 19 July, Frobisher and forty of his best men landed at Hall's Island and made their way to its highest point, which he dubbed Mount Warwick in honour of the Earl of Warwick, one of the principal investors in the expedition. There they piled a cairn of stones to mark possession of the new land and prayed solemnly for the success of their venture.\nSeveral weeks were now spent in collecting ore, but very little was done in the way of discovery, Frobisher being specially directed by his orders from the Company of Cathay to \"defer the further discovery of the passage until another time\". There was much parleying and some skirmishing with the Inuit, and earnest but futile attempts were made to recover the five men captured the previous year. The expedition's return to England commenced on 23 August 1577, and \"Ayde\" reached Milford Haven in Wales on 23 September. \"Gabriel\" and \"Michael\" later arrived separately at Bristol and Yarmouth.\nFrobisher brought with him three Inuit who had been forcibly taken from Baffin Island: a man called Calichough or Kalicho, a woman, Egnock or Arnaq, and her child, Nutioc or Nuttaaq. All three died soon after their arrival in England, Calichough dying from a wound suffered when a rib was broken unintentionally during his capture and eventually punctured his lung.\nFrobisher was received and thanked by the queen at Windsor. Great preparations were made and considerable expense incurred for the assaying of the great quantity of \"ore\" (about 200 tons) brought home. This took much time and led to disputes among the various interested parties.\nThird voyage.\nMeanwhile, the Queen and others in her retinue maintained a strong faith in the potential productivity of the newly discovered territory, which she herself named \"Meta Incognita\" (Latin: Unknown Shore). It was resolved to send out the largest expedition yet, with everything necessary to establish a colony of 100 men. Frobisher was again received by the queen, whereupon she threw a chain of fine gold around his neck.\nThe expedition consisted of fifteen vessels: the flagship \"Ayde\", \"Michael\", and \"Gabriel\", as well as \"Judith\", \"Dennis\" or \"Dionyse\", \"Anne Francis\", \"Francis of Foy\" and \"Moon of Foy\", \"Bear of Leycester\", \"Thomas of Ipswich\", \"Thomas Allen\", \"Armenall\", \"Soloman of Weymouth\", \"Hopewell\", and \"Emanuel of Bridgwater\". There were over 400 men aboard the ships, with 147 miners, 4 blacksmiths, and 5 assayers in the crew.\nOn 3 June 1578, the expedition left Plymouth and, sailing through the Channel, on 20 June reached the south of Greenland, where Frobisher and some of his men managed to land. On 2 July 1578, the foreland of Frobisher Bay was sighted. Stormy weather and dangerous ice prevented the rendezvous, and, besides causing the wreck on an iceberg of the 100-ton barque \"Dennis\", drove the fleet unwittingly up a waterway that Frobisher named \"Mistaken Strait\". He believed that the strait, now known as Hudson Strait, was less likely to be an entrance to the North-west Passage than Frobisher Bay (\"Frobisher's Strait\" to him). After proceeding about sixty miles up the new strait, Frobisher with apparent reluctance turned back, and after many buffetings and separations, the fleet at last came to anchor in Frobisher Bay. During this voyage, the vessel \"Emanuel\" claimed to have found the phantom Buss Island.\nSome attempt was made at founding a settlement, and a large quantity of ore was shipped, but dissension and discontent prevented the establishment of a successful colony. On the last day of August 1578, the fleet set out on its return and reached England at the beginning of October, although the vessel \"Emanuel\" was wrecked en route at Ard na Caithne on the west coast of Ireland. The ore was taken to a specially constructed smelting plant at Powder Mill Lane in Dartford; assiduous efforts to extract gold and further assays were made over five years, but the ore proved to be a valueless rock containing hornblende and was eventually salvaged for road metalling and wall construction. The Cathay Company went bankrupt and Michael Lok was ruined, being sent to debtors' prison several times.\nAnglo-Spanish War.\nFinding his reputation as an adventurer-explorer damaged following the disastrous outcome of the Cathay Company venture, and that his services in that line were no longer required, Frobisher sought other employment. He applied to a major shareholder in the Arctic enterprise, Sir William Wynter, one of the Queen's most trusted naval commanders, who was leading a fleet of four heavily armed vessels to Ireland under orders to put down the Desmond rebellion against the English Crown. Frobisher secured an appointment as captain of \"Foresight\" and sailed in early March 1580; in November, he participated in the Siege of Smerwick at the Dingle Peninsula, a rocky promontory on the southwestern shore of County Kerry, where \"Emanuel\" had wrecked two years previously.\nFrobisher joined Francis Drake on his 1585 raids of Spanish ports and shipping in the West Indies as vice-admiral of Drake's fleet, appointed to that position by the Queen; his flagship was the \"Primrose\". Shortly after the voyage began, Frobisher was admitted to a select group of advisors to Drake (together with Christopher Carleill, Nichols, and Fenner). On 20 July 1588, the Spanish Armada set sail from Corunna in Galicia to escort the Army of Flanders, led by the Duke of Parma, to invade England. Sir Francis Walsingham sent a dispatch to Whitehall stating that the Armada had been sighted in the chops (entrance) of the Channel that day. When the two navies first engaged, Frobisher was in command of \"Triumph\", the Royal Navy's largest ship, leading a consort of the ships \"Merchant Royal\", \"Margaret and John\", \"Centurion\", \"Golden Lion\" and \"Mary Rose\".\nSpanish Armada.\nFollowing a council of war, Lord Howard, the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet, reorganized the English fleet into four squadrons. Frobisher was made commander of one of these and assigned \"Triumph\", as well as Lord Sheffield's \"White Bear\", Lord Thomas Howard's \"Golden Lion\", and Sir Robert Southwell's \"Elizabeth Jonas\", all heavily armed vessels. On the morning of 21 July 1588, Frobisher in \"Triumph\", Drake in \"Revenge\", and Hawkins in \"Victory\" attacked the seaward wing of the Spanish defensive formation, damaging \"San Juan de Portugal\", the ship of the Armada's vice-admiral, Juan Mart\u00ednez de Recalde, and forcing his rescue by galleasses from the Bizcayan squadron. Later that day Frobisher and Hawkins engaged Pedro de Valdez, commander of the Andalusian squadron, who did not yield his ship, \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario\" (Our Lady of the Rosary) until Drake came to their assistance the next morning, much to his rival Frobisher's consternation. Three days later, the English fleet was reinforced by Lord Seymour's channel patrol of thirty-five or forty sail, and Frobisher assumed command of his newly formed squadron.\nFrobisher's squadron was close inshore at dawn on 25 July 1588, the only one landwards of the Armada that morning; the sea was dead calm when he engaged the Duke of Medina Sidonia's flagship \"San Mart\u00edn\" and gave her another pummeling like that of a few days past. However, a breeze rose from the southwest, allowing several Spanish galleons to move in and save their flagship. The other English ships withdrew in time, but \"Triumph\" was caught on the lee shore off Dunnose cape on the Isle of Wight, and more than thirty Armada ships bore down upon him. Frobisher used his boats to manoeuvre \"Triumph\" with good effect and managed to escape when the wind shifted again, allowing him the weather gage.\nFrobisher was knighted for valour on 26 July 1588 by Lord Howard aboard Howard's flagship \"Ark Royal\", alongside Sheffield, Thomas Howard, and Hawkins. Two days later the English launched eight fire ships into the midst of the Armada at its moorings, forcing its captains to cut their anchors; the decisive action was fought 29 July 1588 on the shoals off Gravelines, where Frobisher, Drake, and Hawkins pounded the Spanish ships with their guns. Drake in \"Revenge\" gave Medina Sidonia's flagship, \"San Martin\", a full broadside while Thomas Fenner in \"Nonpareil\" followed his example and the rest of Drake's squadron did the same. Even so, \"San Martin\" sustained no major damage although her men suffered heavy casualties. Drake withdrew to the north-east, with his squadron in line astern of \"Revenge\", and engaged the other Spanish ships nearby as he passed. Frobisher, directly behind him in the English line, stayed with the \"San Martin\" at close range and poured cannon shot into her oaken flanks, but failed to take her. Five Spanish ships were lost.\nFollowing this defeat of the Spanish fleet, \"Revenge\" was engaged in harassing Spanish shipping and it was Frobisher's flagship in 1590 when he commanded the efforts to intercept Spanish treasure galleons.\nLater life.\nIn 1590, Frobisher visited his native Altofts and found himself welcomed in the homes of the peers and landed gentry of Yorkshire county as an honoured guest. He paid particular attention to a daughter of Thomas, 1st Baron Wentworth, Dorothy Wentworth, (1543 \u2013 3 January 1601), recently widowed by the death of her husband, Paul Withypool of Ipswich; sometime before October she became Frobisher's second wife. In November 1591, he purchased from the Queen the leasehold of the manor of Whitwood in Yorkshire for an unstated sum, and of Finningley Grange in Nottinghamshire, which had belonged to the Mattersey Priory, for \u00a3949 (). Frobisher made Whitwood his chief residence, befitting his new status as a landed proprietor, but found little leisure for country life.\nThe following year Frobisher took charge of an English fleet sent out to blockade the Spanish coast and rendezvous with the Spanish treasure fleet; it was fitted out by investors including the Queen, the Earl of Cumberland, Sir Walter Raleigh and his brother, and John Hawkins. Raleigh and Cumberland were the principal organizers of the expedition, and on 28 February Raleigh was commissioned to lead it; the Queen, however, was not eager to send her current favourite off to sea, and he, no great lover of sea life and with no experience in the command of fleets, recommended Frobisher take his place. The fleet was divided into two divisions, with Frobisher's squadron patrolling the waters off the coast of Portugal near the Burlings, while Sir John Burgh (Borough) and John Norton's squadrons sailed for the Azores where they captured a rich prize, the \"Madre de Deus\", much to the discomfiture of Frobisher when he learned the news.\nIn September 1594, Frobisher led a squadron of ships that besieged Morlaix and forced its surrender. The following month he was engaged with the squadron in the siege and relief of Brest, where he received a gunshot wound to his thigh during the Siege of Fort Crozon, a Spanish-held fortress. The surgeon who extracted the ball left the wadding behind and an ensuing infection resulted in his death days later at Plymouth on 22 November. His heart was buried at St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, and his body was then taken to London and buried at St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Fore Street.\nLegacy.\nBritain.\nA destroyer was named HMS \"Frobisher\" during construction but was named when launched in 1915.

The premier is Quebec's head of government, while the king of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the lieutenant governor of Quebec. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Quebec, and presides over that body.\nMembers are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election, but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the legislative assembly. An election may also happen if the Governing party loses the confidence of the legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.\nThis article only covers the time since the Canadian Confederation was created in 1867.

He was one of the twelve official candidates in the 2007 French presidential election. He served in the European Parliament as a member of the European Green Party in 2009\u20132014 and 2014\u20132019.\nEarly life.\nJos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 was born in Talence, near Bordeaux, but was raised in many different places. As a child he lived both inside and outside France, including the United States. Bov\u00e9 speaks English fluently, as his parents moved with him to Berkeley, California when he was three. They were invited to be researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.\nAfter they returned to France, they lived in Paris. Bov\u00e9 attended a Jesuit secondary school near Paris (from which he was expelled for being \"faithless\"). While at university, he associated with anarchists and pacifists. When asked to serve in the army, he refused as a conscientious objector. While waiting for his court appeal, he went into hiding and worked as a shepherd in the mountains.\nAnti-military activist.\nIn 1976, Bov\u00e9 joined the Fight for the Larzac, a movement protesting the proposed expansion of a military camp on the Larzac plateau. It would have displaced regional sheep farmers and changed the ecology of the area. He joined a band of peasants occupying the threatened territory and illegally building a sheep barn. The protest eventually succeeded, and the government cancelled the military plan. As a result of that experience, Bov\u00e9 became a sheep farmer there, producing Roquefort cheese.\nAgricultural unionist.\nBov\u00e9 continued both as a farmer and an activist. In 1987, he formed the \"Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne,\" an agricultural union. It promotes the quality of life for humans and the environment, promoting organic farming. In opposition to many companies in the profit-oriented agro-industry, Bov\u00e9 is a prominent opponent of genetically modified organisms (GMO). In 1995 he joined Greenpeace on their ship, the \"Rainbow Warrior,\" in a voyage to protest nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Ocean. He has also been part of the anarchist organization \"Alternative Libertaire.\"\nBov\u00e9 and the \"Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration\" gained national and international attention in 1999 by dismantling a McDonald's franchise that was under construction in Millau (Aveyron). Considered by his supporters to be non-violent, Bov\u00e9 designed this protest against new US restrictions on importing Roquefort cheese and other products, which were harming the farmers who live from these products, and to raise awareness about McDonald's' use of hormone-treated beef. Bov\u00e9 was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for his role; he was imprisoned for 44 days and released early on 1 August 2002.\nLater, the European Union imposed restrictions on importing hormone-treated beef (see Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement). However, the World Trade Organization, of which both the US and France are members, disallowed this restriction. After the EU refused to comply and remove the restrictions, the United States placed punitive tariffs on the importation of certain European goods, including Roquefort cheese, in retaliation.\nAlter-globalization activist.\nDuring an interview by Lynn Jeffress for \"Z\" magazine in June 2001, Bov\u00e9 explained why he destroyed the McDonald's, saying: \"This is a fight against free trade global capitalism. It's about the logic of a certain economic system, not an American system. It can be a struggle against any country, this one or that one.\"\nBov\u00e9 has participated in numerous anti-globalization movements. In June 1997 he took part in the first anti-GM mowing. The same year that he took part in destruction of the McDonald's, he attended the protests in Seattle against the World Trade Organization meeting. Bov\u00e9 became a figure of anti-globalization.\nSince then, he has redoubled his efforts in the world peasant and anti-globalization movements. He has said that he does not oppose the WTO and global rules, and agrees there is a need for such forms. But his resistance, as stated by his followers, is directed against the lack of democracy in how these rules are developed, approved and implemented. Bov\u00e9 is a founding member of ATTAC.\nIn 2001 Bov\u00e9 took part in a major action destroying genetically modified crops in Brazil. In 2005 he campaigned for a \"No\" vote in the French referendum on the EU Constitution; the proposal was defeated.\nControversies.\nIn April 2002 Bov\u00e9 was at the head of an activist group arriving in the West Bank to protest the massive Israeli Army operation, Operation Defensive Shield, conducted at that time, which had caused many Palestinian casualties. The group entered Yassir Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah, at the time besieged by Israeli forces. Bov\u00e9 joined with members of the newly established International Solidarity Movement (ISM), who were acting as \"human shields\" at the Palestinian Presidential Compound so as to deter the army from breaking in.\nAfter spending a day in the besieged headquarters, Bov\u00e9 came out and was promptly arrested and deported by Israeli police. Upon his return to France, he was met by dozens of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrators, who scuffled briefly at Paris' Orly Airport.\nIn an interview in 2002 with TV channel Canal Plus, Bov\u00e9 said he believed that the wave of attacks against French synagogues was being either arranged or fabricated by Mossad (the Israeli secret service). \"Who profits from the crime?\" Bov\u00e9 asked. \"The Israeli government and its secret services have an interest in creating a certain psychosis, in making believe that there is a climate of antisemitism in France, in order to distract attention from what they are doing.\" Considerable outrage was expressed after his remarks, and he later apologized for the statement. His visit to Arafat was denounced in a speech by the head of France's CRIF, an umbrella group for Jewish organisations.\nBov\u00e9 has intervened to support the movements of the Tahitians and the Kanaks, the indigenous Melanesian people of New Caledonia. On 23 April 2004 he announced that he would join the People's Congress of Kurdistan (\"Kongra-Gel\"). This group has been classified as terrorist by both the European Union and the United States State Department.\nCivil disobedience.\nIn 1976, Bov\u00e9 was sentenced and served three weeks of imprisonment for having destroyed documents belonging to the military, when opposing extension of Larzac military camp.\nIn 2002, Bov\u00e9 was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for his role in the 1999 destruction (he and his party dismantled the building during one night) of a McDonald's franchise in Millau, Aveyron. He served 44 days and was released on 1 August 2002.\nOn 22 June 2003 Bov\u00e9 began serving a sentence of ten months for the destruction of transgenic crops. ATTAC protested and called for him to be freed. A general pardon of prisoners issued for Bastille Day, together with an individual action in his case by President Jacques Chirac, reduced the sentence to seven months. Both supporters and opponents expressed dissatisfaction with the Presidential pardon, saying that it was entirely inadequate and wholly unjustified, respectively. On 15 November 2005, the Toulouse court of appeals sentenced Bov\u00e9 to 4 months in jail for having destroyed genetically engineered corn from a field. Other defendants, such as No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re, got suspended sentences.\nIn February 2006, Bov\u00e9 was stopped at entry by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at New York's JFK Airport. He was traveling to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations for events sponsored by Cornell's Global Labor Institute. According to Bov\u00e9, the Customs agents told him he was \"ineligible\" to enter the U.S. due to his past prosecutions for \"moral crimes.\" After being detained for several hours, Bov\u00e9 was placed on an Air France flight to Paris.\nOn 11 October 2016, Bov\u00e9 was denied entry to Canada because of his convictions related to protests, notably against McDonald's. He was subsequently allowed to stay in the country for seven days.\nPolitical life.\nFollowing an appeal from his supporters, who gathered 40,000 signatures, in January 2007 Bov\u00e9 announced he would run as a candidate that year in the 2007 French presidential election. He formally declared on 1 February and in six weeks gained the required 500 signatures from elected officials necessary to be a candidate. He declared he was fighting for \"the people that have no voice.\" He was trying to promote unity on the radical left and aiming to defeat the right and the far right, which had recently gained popularity. He was endorsed by actress Juliette Binoche, who has international renown. On 19 March Bov\u00e9 announced that he had secured the support necessary to reach the second stage, to be listed on the published ballot, alongside 11 other contenders. On the first round of the presidential election, Bov\u00e9 scored 1.32% of the popular vote (483,008 votes).\nFollowing the French presidential elections, Bov\u00e9 became more closely associated with Europe \u00c9cologie, a coalition of French environmentalist political parties including the Green Party. In the 2009 European Parliament election, he headed the list of candidates for the South-West constituency. On 7 June 2009, he was elected to the European Parliament, as Europe Ecologie garnered more than 16% of the vote in a proportional electoral system. He was re-elected at the 2014 European Parliament election.\nPublications.\nIn English translation\nIn French\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The city is approximately from Southampton and from Bath.\nSalisbury is in the southeast of Wiltshire, near the edge of Salisbury Plain. An ancient cathedral was north of the present city at Old Sarum. A new cathedral was built near the meeting of the rivers and a settlement grew up around it, which received a city charter in 1227 as New Sarum. This continued to be its official name until 2009, when Salisbury City Council was established. Salisbury railway station is an interchange between the West of England Line and the Wessex Main Line.\nStonehenge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is northwest of Salisbury.\nToponymy.\n\"Cair-Caratauc\", one of 28 cities of the Ancient Britons listed in the \"History of the Britons\" (9th century), has been identified with Salisbury. Alternative names for the city, in the Welsh \"Chronicle of the Britons\" (12th century) were \"Caer-Caradog\", \"Caer-Gradawc\", and \"Caer-Wallawg.\" \nBy the Roman era, the name had become \"Sorbiod\u016bnum\"; the first part was of unknown origin, although the Brittonic suffix \"-d\u016bnon\" meant \"fortress\". The name first recorded during the Anglo-Saxon era was \"Searoburg\" (dative \"Searobyrig\"), around the end of the 9th century. This was a partial calque of the Roman name, with \"burg\" being the Old English word for \"fort\". Middle English \"Sarisberie\" was abbreviated as \"Sar\", which in turn gave rise to the latinization \"Sarum\".\nHistory.\nOld Sarum.\nThe hilltop at Old Sarum lies near the Neolithic sites of Stonehenge and Avebury and shows some signs of early settlement. It commanded a salient between the River Bourne and the Hampshire Avon, near a crossroads of several early trade routes. During the Iron Age, sometime between 600 and 300\u00a0BC, a hillfort (oppidum) was constructed around it. The Romans may have occupied the site or left it in the hands of an allied tribe. At the time of the Saxon invasions, Old Sarum fell to King Cynric of Wessex in 552. Preferring settlements in bottomland, such as nearby Wilton, the Saxons largely ignored Old Sarum until the Viking invasions led King Alfred (King of Wessex from 871 to 899) to restore its fortifications. Along with Wilton, however, it was abandoned by its residents to be sacked and burned by the Dano-Norwegian king Sweyn Forkbeard in 1003. It subsequently became the site of Wilton's mint. Following the Norman invasion of 1066, a motte-and-bailey castle was constructed by 1070. The castle was held directly by the Norman kings; its castellan was generally also the sheriff of Wiltshire.\nIn 1075 the Council of London established Herman as the first bishop of Salisbury, uniting his former sees of Sherborne and Ramsbury into a single diocese which covered the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, and Berkshire. In 1055, Herman had planned to move his seat to Malmesbury, but its monks and Earl Godwin objected. Herman and his successor, Saint Osmund, began the construction of the first Salisbury cathedral, though neither lived to see its completion in 1092. Osmund served as Lord Chancellor of England (in office c. 1070\u20131078); he was responsible for the codification of the Sarum Rite, the compilation of the Domesday Book, which was probably presented to William at Old Sarum, and, after centuries of advocacy from Salisbury's bishops, was finally canonised by Pope Callixtus III in 1457. The cathedral was consecrated on 5 April 1092 but suffered extensive damage in a storm, traditionally said to have occurred only five days later. Bishop Roger was a close ally of Henry I (reigned 1100\u20131135): he served as viceroy during the king's absence in Normandy and directed, along with his extended family, the royal administration and exchequer. He refurbished and expanded Old Sarum's cathedral in the 1110s and began work on a royal palace during the 1130s, prior to his arrest by Henry's successor, Stephen. After this arrest, the castle at Old Sarum was allowed to fall into disrepair, but the sheriff and castellan continued to administer the area under the king's authority.\nNew Sarum.\nBishop of Salisbury Hubert Walter was instrumental in the negotiations with Saladin during the Third Crusade, but he spent little time in his diocese prior to his elevation to archbishop of Canterbury. The brothers Herbert and Richard Poore succeeded him and began planning the relocation of the cathedral into the valley almost immediately. Their plans were approved by King Richard I but repeatedly delayed: Herbert was first forced into exile in Normandy in the 1190s by the hostility of his archbishop Walter and then again to Scotland in the 1210s owing to royal hostility following the papal interdiction against King John. The secular authorities were particularly incensed, according to tradition, owing to some of the clerics debauching the castellan's female relations. In the end, the clerics were refused permission to reenter the city walls following their rogations and processions. This caused Peter of Blois to describe the church as \"a captive within the walls of the citadel like the ark of God in the profane house of Baal\". He advocated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHerbert Poore's successor and brother, Richard Poore, eventually moved the cathedral to a new town on his estate at Veteres Sarisberias (\"Old Salisburies\") in 1220. The site was at \"Myrifield\" (\"Merryfield\"), a meadow near the confluence of the River Nadder and the Hampshire Avon. It was first known as \"New Sarum\" or New Saresbyri. The town was laid out on a grid.\nWork on the new cathedral building, the present Salisbury Cathedral, began in 1221. The site was supposedly established by shooting an arrow from Old Sarum, although this is certainly a legend: the distance is over . The legend is sometimes amended to claim that the arrow struck a white deer, which continued to run and died on the spot where the cathedral now rests. The structure was built upon wooden faggots on a gravel bed with unusually shallow foundations of and the main body was completed in only 38 years. The tall spire, the tallest in the UK, was built later. With royal approval, many of the stones for the new cathedral were taken from the old one; others came from Chilmark. They were probably transported by ox-cart, owing to the obstruction to boats on the River Nadder caused by its many weirs and watermills. The cathedral is considered a masterpiece of Early English architecture. The spire's large clock was installed in 1386, and is one of the oldest surviving mechanical clocks in the world. The cathedral also contains the best-preserved of the four surviving copies of Magna Carta.\nNew Sarum was made a city by a charter from King Henry III in 1227 and, by the 14th century, was the largest settlement in Wiltshire. The city wall surrounds the Close and was built in the 14th century, again with stones removed from the former cathedral at Old Sarum. The wall now has five gates: the High Street Gate, St Ann's Gate, the Queen's Gate, and St Nicholas's Gate were original, while a fifth was constructed in the 19th century to allow access to Bishop Wordsworth's School, in the Cathedral Close. During his time in the city, the composer Handel stayed in a room above St Ann's gate. The original site of the city at Old Sarum, meanwhile, fell into disuse. It continued as a rotten borough: at the time of its abolition during the reforms of 1832, its Member of Parliament (MP) represented three households.\nIn May 1289, there was uncertainty about the future of Margaret, Maid of Norway, and her father sent ambassadors to Edward I. Edward met Robert the Bruce and others at Salisbury in October 1289, which resulted in the Treaty of Salisbury, under which Margaret would be sent to Scotland before 1 November 1290 and any agreement on her future marriage would be delayed until she was in Scotland.\nThe Parliament of England met at New Sarum in the years 1324, 1328, and 1384.\nIn 1450, a number of riots broke out in Salisbury at roughly the same time as Jack Cade led a famous rebellion through London. The riots occurred for related reasons, although the declining fortunes of Salisbury's cloth trade may also have been influential. The violence peaked with the murder of the bishop, William Ayscough, who had been involved with the government. In 1483, a large-scale rebellion against Richard III broke out, led by his own 'kingmaker', Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. After the revolt collapsed, Buckingham was executed at Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn. An act of Parliament, the River Avon Navigation (Christchurch to New Sarum) Act 1664 (16 &amp; 17 Cha. 2. c. 12) was passed on 2 March 1665 for making the River Avon navigable from Christchurch to the city of New Sarum. and the work completed, only for the project to be ruined shortly thereafter by a major flood. Soon after, during the Great Plague of London, Charles II held court in Salisbury's cathedral close.\nSalisbury was the site chosen to assemble James II's forces to resist the Glorious Revolution. He arrived to lead his approximately 19\u2009000 men on 19 November 1688. His troops were not keen to fight Mary or her husband William, and the loyalty of many of James's commanders was in doubt. The first blood was shed at the Wincanton Skirmish, in Somerset. In Salisbury, James heard that some of his officers had deserted, such as Edward Hyde, and he broke out in a nosebleed, which he took as an omen that he should retreat. His commander in chief, the Earl of Feversham, advised retreat on 23 November, and the next day John Churchill defected to William. On 26 November, James's own daughter, Princess Anne, did the same, and James returned to London the same day, never again to be at the head of a serious military force in England.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nFollowing the destruction by the Luftwaffe of the Southampton factories building Supermarine Spitfires in 1940, production was dispersed to shadow factories elsewhere in the south of England. Salisbury was the major centre of production, supplemented by Trowbridge and Reading. Several factories were set up in the centre of Salisbury and staffed by predominantly young women who had no previous mechanical experience but were trained for specific tasks in the aircraft construction process. Supporting the factories were many workers producing small components in home-based workshops and garden sheds. Sub-assemblies were built in the city centre factories and then transported to High Post airfield (north of the city, in Durnford parish) and Chattis Hill (northeast, near Stockbridge), where the aircraft were assembled, test flown and then distributed to RAF airfields across England. A total of over 2000 Spitfires were produced. The whole process was carried out in secret without the knowledge of even the local people and only emerged into public knowledge after the production of a film describing the whole process. In July 2021 a memorial to the workers, in the form of a life-size fibreglass model Mk IX Spitfire, was unveiled in Castle Road, Salisbury (near the rugby club) on the site of one of the factories.\nAt the time of the 1948 Summer Olympics, held in London, a relay of runners carried the Olympic Flame from Wembley Stadium, where the Games were based, to the sailing centre at Torbay via Slough, Basingstoke, Salisbury, and Exeter.\nThe Local Government Act 1972 eliminated the administration of the City of New Sarum under its former charters, but its successor, Wiltshire County's Salisbury District, continued to be accorded its former city status. The name was finally formally amended from \"New Sarum\" to \"Salisbury\" during the 2009 changes occasioned by the Local Government Act 1992, which established the Salisbury City Council.\nOn 4 March 2018, former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, were poisoned in Salisbury with a Novichok nerve agent.\nGovernance.\nSalisbury is within the county of Wiltshire, and the administrative district of the same name. For local government purposes, it is administered by the Wiltshire Council unitary authority. Salisbury forms a civil parish with a parish council known as the Salisbury City Council.\nSince the local boundary review of 2020, two electoral wards \u2013 St Edmund and Harnham East \u2013 cover the city centre within the A36 ring road, and the rest of the unitary and city council areas are covered by six further wards. Laverstock and Ford parish council has the same boundary as the Laverstock ward, as well as part of the Old Sarum and Upper Bourne Valley ward, at unitary level. The Bishopdown Farm estate on the outskirts of Salisbury is now part of Laverstock and Ford, joining Hampton Park and Riverdown Park.\nPrior to 2009, Salisbury was part of the now-abolished non-metropolitan county of Wiltshire. It was governed by Wiltshire County Council at the county level and Salisbury District Council, which oversaw most of south Wiltshire as well as the city. Salisbury (previously officially New Sarum) has had city status since time immemorial.\nThe Member of Parliament for the Salisbury constituency, which includes the city, Wilton, Old Sarum, Laverstock and surrounding rural areas, is John Glen (Conservative), who was first elected in 2010.\nGeography.\nSalisbury is approximately halfway between Exeter and London being 80 miles (128\u00a0km) east-northeast of Exeter, 78 miles (126\u00a0km) west-southwest of London and also south of Swindon, northwest of Southampton and southeast of Bath.\nThe geology of the area, as with much of South Wiltshire and Hampshire, is largely chalk. The rivers which flow through the city have been redirected, and along with landscaping, have been used to feed into public gardens. They are popular in the summer, particularly in Queen Elizabeth Gardens, as the water there is shallow and slow-flowing enough to enter safely. Because of the low-lying land, the rivers are prone to flooding, particularly during the winter months. The Town Path, a walkway that links Harnham with the rest of the city, is at times impassable.\nWater-meadows at Harnham, fed by two branches of the River Nadder, are first documented in the 17th century. East Harnham Meadows, in the floodplain of the Avon, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\nThere are civil airfields at Old Sarum (where the experimental aircraft the Edgley Optica was developed and tested) and at Thruxton near Andover.\nAreas and suburbs.\nSalisbury has many areas and suburbs, most of them being former villages that were absorbed by the growth of the city. The boundaries of these areas are for the most part unofficial and not fixed. All of these suburbs are within Salisbury's ONS Urban Area, which had a population of 44,748 in 2011. However, not all of these suburbs are administered by the city council, and are therefore not within the eight wards that had a combined population of 40,302 in 2011. Two parishes are part of the urban area but outside Salisbury parish.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSurrounding parishes, villages and towns rely on Salisbury for some services. The following are within a 4-mile radius of the city centre and are listed in approximately clockwise order:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemography.\nThe civil parish of Salisbury, which does not include some of the city's suburbs such as Laverstock, Ford, Britford and Netherhampton, had a population of 40,302 at the 2011 census.\nThe urban zone, which contains the wards immediately surrounding the city, had a population of 62,216 at the 2011 Census. The wards included in this figure are Laverstock, Britford, Downton, Alderbury, Odstock and the neighbouring town of Wilton, among others, however it does not include the towns of Amesbury or Romsey, as these support their own local populations and are further afield.\nAt the 2011 census the population of the civil parish was 95.73% white (91.00% White British), 2.48% Asian (0.74% Indian, 0.41% Bangladeshi, 0.40% Chinese), 0.45% black and 1.15% mixed race. Within the parish, the largest ethnic minority group was 'other white' comprising 3.6% of the population as of 2011. There is not much contrast between areas when it comes to ethnic diversity. The ward of St Edmund and Milford is the most multiethnic, with 86.0% of the population being White British. The least multiethnic is the ward of St Francis and Stratford, which contains suburbs in the north of the city, with 94.8% of the population being White British. The city is represented by six other wards.\nWithin the parish, the largest ethnic minority group was 'other white' comprising 3.6% of the population as of 2011.\n86.43% of the civil parish's population were born in England, 3.94% were born elsewhere in the UK. 4.94% were born elsewhere in the EU (including the Republic of Ireland), while 4.70% of the population were born outside the EU.\n62.49% of the civil parish's population declared their religion to be Christianity, while 27.09% stated \"no religion\" and 8.02% declined to state their religion. 0.79% of the population declared their religion to be Islam, 0.41% Buddhism, 0.40% Hinduism and 0.80% as another religion.\n95.89% of the civil parish's population considered their \"main language\" to be English, while 1.12% considered it to be Polish, 0.28% considered it to be Bengali and 0.24% considered it to be Tagalog. 99.43% of the population claimed to be able to speak English well or very well.\nIn 2001, 22.33% of Salisbury's population were aged between 30 and 44, 42.76% were over 45, and 13.3% were between 18 and 29.\nEconomy.\nSalisbury holds a charter market on Tuesdays and Saturdays and has held markets regularly since 1227. In the 15th century the Market Place had four crosses: the Poultry Cross, whose name describes its market; the 'cheese and milk cross', which indicated that market and was in the triangle between the HSBC bank and the Salisbury Library; a third cross near the site of the present war memorial, which marked a woollen and yarn market; and a fourth, called Barnwell or Barnard's Cross, in the Culver Street and Barnard Street area, which marked a cattle and livestock market. Today, only the Poultry Cross remains, to which flying buttresses were added in the 19th century. The Market Hall, later known as the Corn Exchange, was completed in 1859.\nIn 1226, Henry III granted the Bishop of Salisbury a charter to hold a fair lasting eight days from the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (15 August). Over the centuries the dates of the fair have moved around, but in its modern guise, a funfair is now held in the Market Place for three days from the third Monday in October.\nFrom 1833 to the mid-1980s, the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Salisbury Gas Light and Coke Company, which ran the city's gasworks, was one of the major employers in the area. The company was formed in 1832 with a share capital of \u00a38,000, and its first chairman was the 3rd Earl of Radnor. The company was incorporated by a local act of Parliament, the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Salisbury Gas Act 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. xxiii), and the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Salisbury Gas Order 1882 confirmed by the Gas Orders Confirmation Act 1882 (45 &amp; 46 Vict. c. xcix) empowered it to raise capital of up to \u00a340,000. At its peak, the gasworks were producing not only coal gas but also coke, which was sold off as the by-product of gas-making. Ammoniacal liquor, another by-product, was mixed with sulphuric acid, dried and ground to make a powder which was sold as an agricultural fertiliser. The clinker from the retort house was sold to a firm in London to be used as purifier beds in the construction of sewage works.\nSalisbury power station supplied electricity to Salisbury and the surrounding area from 1898 to 1970. The power station was at Town Mill and was owned and operated by Salisbury Electric Light and Supply Company Limited prior to the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948. The coal-fired power station was redeveloped several times to incorporate new plant including a water-driven turbine.\nFrom the Middle Ages to the start of the 20th century, Salisbury was noted for its cutlery industry. Early motor cars were manufactured in the city from 1902 by Dean and Burden Brothers, using the Scout Motors brand. In 1907, the company moved to a larger factory at Churchfields; each car took six to eight weeks to build, mostly using bodies made elsewhere by coachbuilders. By 1912, 150 men were employed and the company was also making small commercial vehicles and 20-seater buses, some of which were later used by the newly established Wilts &amp; Dorset operator. The Scout company failed in 1921 after wartime disruption and competition from larger makers.\nShopping centres include The Old George Mall, The Maltings, Winchester Street, and the Crosskeys precinct. Major employers include Salisbury District Hospital. The closure of the Friends Life office, the second largest employer, was announced in 2015.\nCulture.\nSalisbury was an important centre for music in the 18th century. The grammarian James Harris, a friend of Handel, directed concerts at the Assembly Rooms for almost 50 years up to his death in 1780. Many of the most famous musicians and singers of the day performed there.\nSalisbury holds an annual St George's Day pageant, the origins of which are claimed to go back to the 13th century.\nSalisbury has a strong artistic community, with galleries situated in the city centre, including the Young Gallery (incorporating the John Creasey Museum), located in Salisbury Library. In the 18th century, John Constable made a number of celebrated landscape paintings featuring the cathedral's spire and the surrounding countryside. Salisbury's annual International Arts Festival, started in 1973, and held in late May to early June, provides a programme of theatre, live music, dance, public sculpture, street performance and art exhibitions. Salisbury also houses a producing theatre, Salisbury Playhouse, which produces between eight and ten plays a year, as well as welcoming touring productions.\nThe Salisbury Museum.\nThe Salisbury Museum is housed in the King's House, a Grade I listed building whose history dates back to the 13th century, opposite the west front of the cathedral.\nThe permanent Stonehenge exhibition gallery has interactive displays about Stonehenge and the archaeology of south Wiltshire, and its collections include the skeleton of the Amesbury Archer, which is on display.\nThe Pitt Rivers display holds a collection from General Augustus Pitt Rivers.\nThe costume gallery showcases costumes and textiles from the area, with costumes for children to try on while imagining themselves as characters from Salisbury's past.\nThe former home of Sir Edward Heath, Arundells in the Cathedral Close, is open as a museum.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nSalisbury has been twinned with Saintes, France, since 1990, and with Xanten, Germany, since 2005. Salisbury is also a sister city of Salisbury, North Carolina and Salisbury, Maryland, both of which are in the United States.\nEducation.\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, Salisbury was a seat of learning, with students of theology and the liberal arts taught at the College of the Valley Scholars, founded by Bishop Giles of Bridport in 1262. This has some claim to be seen as the first university college in England, as it was founded three years before Merton College, Oxford. Most of the scholars transferred to Salisbury Hall, Oxford, in 1325. \nThere are several schools in and around Salisbury. The city has the only grammar schools in Wiltshire, South Wilts Grammar School for girls and Bishop Wordsworth's School for boys; since September 2020, both have mixed sixth forms. Other schools in or near the city include Salisbury Cathedral School, Chafyn Grove School, Leehurst Swan School, the Godolphin senior and prep schools, Sarum Academy, St Joseph's Catholic School, and Wyvern St Edmund's.\nSixth-form education is offered by Salisbury Sixth Form College, while the Salisbury campus of Wiltshire College offers a range of further education courses, as well as some higher education courses in association with Bournemouth University. Sarum College is a Christian theological college, within the Cathedral close.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nSalisbury lies at the intersection of the A30, the A36, and the A338, and is at the end of the A343, A345, A354, and A360. Car parks around the periphery of the city are linked to the city centre by a park-and-ride scheme. The A36 forms an almost complete ring road around the city centre, and the A3094 comprises the southwestern quadrant of the ring road, passing through the city's outer suburbs.\nBus.\nThere are bus links to Southampton, Bournemouth, Andover, Devizes, and Swindon, with limited services on Sundays. Salisbury Reds, a brand of Go South Coast, is the main local operator. Wheelers Travel provide services to Shaftesbury and Andover, as well as intermediate-distance services. Other operators include Stagecoach (Amesbury, Tidworth, Andover) and Beeline (Warminster).\nSalisbury has a park and ride bus scheme with five sites around the city.\nSalisbury bus station, which opened in 1939, closed in January 2014 due to high operating costs and low usage. Situated in Endless Street, on the northeastern edge of the city centre, the site was later developed into retirement homes, which opened in February 2018.\nRailways.\nSalisbury station is the crossing point of the West of England line, from London Waterloo to Exeter St Davids, and the Wessex Main Line from Bristol Temple Meads to Southampton Central. The station is operated by South Western Railway. Great Western Railway services run to/from Cardiff Central, Bristol Temple Meads, Bath Spa, Southampton Central and Portsmouth Harbour.\nChurches.\nBesides the cathedral church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Salisbury has several churches of various denominations. Three of them \u2013 St Martin, St Thomas and St Lawrence (Stratford-sub-Castle) \u2013 are Grade I listed.\nMedieval.\nSt Martin's Church predates the establishment of the cathedral at New Sarum. The church is on the south side of Milford Hill, beyond the eastern edge of the medieval town. The chancel is from c.1230, the tower (with spire) is 14th-century and the nave and aisles are from the late 15th century, but there is evidence of an earlier church and of Saxon burials. The parish has a long-standing Anglo-Catholic tradition.\nSt Edmund's was founded as a collegiate church in 1269, in the north of the city. It was originally a larger building which was damaged when the central tower fell in 1653; the nave was demolished and a new tower was built at the west end. A chancel was added in 1766 and then rebuilt in 1865\u20131867 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The church was declared redundant in 1974 and reopened as Salisbury Arts Centre in 1975. A two-storey addition was built on the north side in 2003\u20132005.\nSt Thomas' church has a central position, just west of the market square. It was founded in the early 13th century and rebuilt in the 15th at the expense of the city's prosperous merchants. Above the chancel arch is a large 15th-century doom painting, \"one of the best surviving\" according to Orbach.\nThe churches of three rural parishes are in areas now absorbed into Salisbury. St George's at West Harnham was begun in the 12th century and altered in the early 14th century. St Lawrence, Stratford-sub-Castle, was built in the 13th century for the settlement near Old Sarum, at first as a chapelry of St Martin's. The small church of St Andrew at Bemerton was built in the 14th century on the site of an earlier church. It is associated with the poet and priest George Herbert, rector from 1630 until his death in 1633.\nEarly modern period.\nThe first Baptist congregation in Salisbury was founded in 1690, as a breakaway from the Porton chapel. In 1719, a Baptist chapel was built in Brown Street, named the Brown Street Particular Baptist Church. It was rebuilt in 1750 and again in the 19th century.\nThe Methodist chapel on St. Edmund's Church Street was built in 1759, and hosted John Wesley in 1769.\nA Presbyterian chapel was present on Salt Lane in the early 18th century, possibly on the site of the present day Salvation Army church.\n19th century.\nSt Osmund's (Catholic) is on Exeter Street in the city centre, a short distance east of the cathedral. It was designed by Augustus Pugin, who also designed some of the stained glass, and was consecrated in 1848.\nSt Paul's church, serving part of the northern suburbs, was built near the start of the Devizes road in 1853. It was a replacement for St Clement's at Fisherton village, which had stood near the Nadder since at least the 14th century. The style of worship has been evangelical since the 1860s.\nThe small All Saints' church was built at East Harnham in 1854, to designs of T.H. Wyatt.\nIn 1861, St John's church was built at Bemerton to supplement St Andrew's. The building was declared redundant in 2010 and reopened in 2016 as a community centre and events venue.\nSt Mark's was dedicated in 1894 to serve the expanding northern suburbs. The church is described as \"ambitious\" by Historic England and \"expensively detailed\" by Orbach. Construction was in stages, finishing in 1915, and the upper part of the tower was never built.\nThe Methodist Church on St Edmund's Church Street was extended in 1811 and redesigned in 1835 in neo-classical style. It is a Grade II listed building.\nThe Baptist Church on Brown Street was rebuilt in 1829 to accommodate a growing congregation and modified further in 1882.\nThere were Congregational churches on Scots Lane and Endless Street, replaced by the current United Reformed church on Fisherton Street in 1897. \n19th-century buildings for other denominations include, in the city centre, the Elim Pentecostal Church (originally Primitive Methodist, 1896, now a nightclub); and on Wilton Road, Emmanuel Church (1860).\n20th century.\nThe Roman Catholic St. Gregory's Church was built in the city's western suburbs in 1938.\nAs the city's suburbs extended further north, St Francis's church was consecrated in 1940 to serve an area which had been part of Stratford-sub-Castle parish. Worship is evangelical in style, and services are designed to appeal to families and young people.\nSport and leisure.\nThe city has a football team, Salisbury F.C., who play in the National League South and are based at the Raymond McEnhill Stadium, on the northern edge of the city. Other non-league clubs are Bemerton Heath Harlequins F.C. and Laverstock &amp; Ford F.C.\nSalisbury Rugby Club, which is based at Castle Road, plays in Southern Counties South. South Wilts Cricket Club is based at the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Sports Club and play in the Southern Premier Cricket League. Salisbury Hockey Club is also based at the Salisbury and South Wilts Sports Club.\nThe Five Rivers Leisure Centre and Swimming Pool, which was opened in 2002, is just outside the ring road. Salisbury Racecourse is a flat racing course to the south-west of the city. Five Rivers Indoor Bowls Club and Salisbury Snooker Club share a building on Tollgate Road, behind the college.\nOld Sarum Airfield, north of the city centre, is home to a variety of aviation-based businesses, including flying schools and the APT Charitable Trust for disabled flyers.\nThe city's theatre is the Salisbury Playhouse. The City Hall is an entertainment venue and hosts comedy, musical performances (including those by the resident Musical Theatre Salisbury), as well as seminars and conventions. Salisbury Arts Centre, housed in a redundant church, has exhibitions and workshops.\nSalisbury is well-supplied with pubs. The \"Haunch of Venison\", overlooking the Poultry Cross, operates from a 14th-century building; one of its attractions is a cast of a mummified hand, supposedly severed during a game of cards. The \"Rai d'Or\" has original deeds dating from 1292. It was the home of Agnes Bottenham, who used the profits of the tavern to found Trinity Hospital next door in c. 1380.\nMedia.\nBBC Radio Wiltshire is the BBC Local Radio public service station for the county, which sometimes broadcasts from or about the city. Salisbury used to have its own local radio station, Spire FM, which was purchased by Bauer Radio in 2019. Its frequency now transmits Greatest Hits Radio Salisbury, which broadcasts national and regional music programmes with local news bulletins.\nRegional television services are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian, and a local television channel \"That's Salisbury\" is provided by That's TV.\nThe \"Salisbury Journal\" is the local paid-for weekly newspaper, which is available in shops every Thursday. The local free weekly newspaper from the same publisher is the \"Avon Advertiser\", which is delivered to houses in Salisbury and the surrounding area.\nIn popular culture.\nThe two names for the city, \"Salisbury\" and \"Sarum\", are humorously alluded to in a 1928 limerick from \"Punch\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe ambiguous pronunciation was also used in the following limerick, which also alludes to 'Hants', the shortened form of Hampshire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nThere was a young curate of Salisbury,\nWhose manners were quite Halisbury-Scalisbury.\nHe wandered round Hampshire,\nWithout any pampshire,\nTill the Vicar compelled him to Walisbury.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nClimate.\nSalisbury experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfb\") similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. The nearest Met Office weather station to Salisbury is Boscombe Down, about 6 miles to the north of the city centre. In terms of the local climate, Salisbury is among the sunniest of inland areas in the UK, averaging over 1650 hours of sunshine in a typical year. Temperature extremes since 1960 have ranged from in January 1963 to during July 2006. The lowest temperature to be recorded in recent years was during December 2010.\nFreedom of the City.\nThe following people and military units have received the Freedom of the City of Salisbury.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He directed the large-scale epics \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965), \"Ryan's Daughter\" (1970), and \"A Passage to India\" (1984). He also directed the film adaptations of Charles Dickens novels \"Great Expectations\" (1946) and \"Oliver Twist\" (1948), as well as the romantic drama \"Brief Encounter\" (1945).\nOriginally a film editor in the early 1930s, Lean made his directorial debut with 1942's \"In Which We Serve\", which was the first of four collaborations with No\u00ebl Coward. Lean began to make internationally co-produced films financed by the big Hollywood studios, beginning with \"Summertime\" in 1955. The critical failure of his film \"Ryan's Daughter\" in 1970 led him to take a fourteen-year break from filmmaking, during which he planned a number of film projects which never came to fruition. In 1984, he had a career revival with \"A Passage to India\", adapted from E. M. Forster's novel. This was a hit with critics, but it proved to be the last film that Lean directed.\nLean is described by film critic Michael Sragow as \"a director's director, whose total mastery of filmcraft commands nothing less than awe among his peers\". He has been lauded by directors such as Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott. He was voted 9th greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute \"Sight &amp; Sound\" \"Directors' Top Directors\" poll in 2002. He was nominated seven times for the Academy Award for Best Director, which he won twice for \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\", and he has seven films in the British Film Institute's Top 100 British Films (with three of them being in the top five) and was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990.\nEarly life and education.\nDavid Lean was born on 25 March 1908 at 38 Blenheim Crescent, South Croydon, Surrey (now part of Greater London), to Francis William le Blount Lean and the former Helena Tangye (niece of Sir Richard Trevithick Tangye). His parents were Quakers and he was a pupil at the Quaker-founded Leighton Park School in Reading. His younger brother, Edward Tangye Lean (1911\u20131974), founded the original Inklings literary club when a student at Oxford University. Lean was a half-hearted schoolboy with a dreamy nature who was labelled a \"dud\" of a student; he left school in the Christmas Term of 1926, at the age of 18, and entered his father's chartered accountancy firm as an apprentice.\nA more formative event for his career than his formal education was an uncle's gift, when Lean was aged ten, of a Brownie box camera. \"You usually didn't give a boy a camera until he was 16 or 17 in those days. It was a huge compliment and I succeeded at it.\" Lean printed and developed his films, and it was his \"great hobby\". In 1923, his father deserted the family. Lean later followed a similar path after his own first marriage and child.\nCareer.\nPeriod as film editor.\nBored by his work, Lean spent every evening in the cinema, and in 1927, after an aunt had advised him to find a job he enjoyed, he visited Gaumont Studios where his obvious enthusiasm earned him a month's trial without pay. He was taken on as a teaboy, promoted to clapperboy, and soon rose to the position of third assistant director. By 1930 he was working as an editor on newsreels, including those of Gaumont Pictures and Movietone, while his move to feature films began with \"Freedom of the Seas\" (1934) and \"Escape Me Never\" (1935).\nHe edited Gabriel Pascal's film productions of two George Bernard Shaw plays, \"Pygmalion\" (1938) and \"Major Barbara\" (1941). He edited Powell &amp; Pressburger's \"49th Parallel\" (1941) and \"One of Our Aircraft Is Missing\" (1942). After this last film, Lean began his directing career, after editing more than two dozen features by 1942. As Tony Sloman wrote in 1999, \"As the varied likes of David Lean, Robert Wise, Terence Fisher and Dorothy Arzner have proved, the cutting rooms are easily the finest grounding for film direction.\" David Lean was given honorary membership of the Guild of British Film Editors in 1968.\nBritish films.\nHis first work as a director was in collaboration with No\u00ebl Coward on \"In Which We Serve\" (1942), and he later adapted several of Coward's plays into successful films. These films are \"This Happy Breed\" (1944), \"Blithe Spirit\" (1945) and \"Brief Encounter\" (1945) with Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard as quietly understated clandestine lovers, torn between their unpredictable passion and their respective orderly middle-class marriages in suburban England. The film shared Grand Prix honors at the 1946 Cannes film festival and garnered Lean his first Academy nominations for directing and screen adaptation, and Celia Johnson a nomination for Best Actress. It has since become a classic, one of the most highly regarded British films.\nTwo celebrated Charles Dickens adaptations followed \u2013 \"Great Expectations\" (1946) and \"Oliver Twist\" (1948). David Shipman wrote in \"The Story of Cinema: Volume Two\" (1984): \"Of the other Dickens films, only Cukor's \"David Copperfield\" approaches the excellence of this pair, partly because his casting, too, was near perfect\". These two films were the first directed by Lean to star Alec Guinness, whom Lean considered his \"good luck charm\". The actor's portrayal of Fagin was controversial at the time. The first screening in Berlin during February 1949 offended the surviving Jewish community and led to a riot. It caused problems too in New York, and after private screenings, was condemned by the Anti-Defamation League and the American Board of Rabbis. \"To our surprise it was accused of being anti-Semitic\", Lean wrote. \"We made Fagin an outsize and, we hoped, an amusing Jewish villain.\" The terms of the production code meant that the film's release in the United States was delayed until July 1951 after cuts amounting to eight minutes.\nThe next film directed by Lean was \"The Passionate Friends\" (1949), an atypical Lean film, but one which marked his first occasion to work with Claude Rains, who played the husband of a woman (Ann Todd) torn between him and an old flame (Howard). \"The Passionate Friends\" was the first of three films to feature the actress Ann Todd, who became his third wife. \"Madeleine\" (1950), set in Victorian-era Glasgow is about an 1857 \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\" with Todd's lead character accused of murdering a former lover. \"Once more\", writes film critic David Thomson \"Lean settles on the pressing need for propriety, but not before the film has put its characters and the audience through a wringer of contradictory feelings.\" The last of the films with Todd, \"The Sound Barrier\" (1952), has a screenplay by the playwright Terence Rattigan and was the first of his three films for Sir Alexander Korda's London Films. \"Hobson's Choice\" (1954), with Charles Laughton in the lead, was based on the play by Harold Brighouse.\nInternational films.\n\"Summertime\" (1955) marked a new departure for Lean. It was partly American financed, although again made for Korda's London Films. The film features Katharine Hepburn in the lead role as a middle-aged American woman who has a romance while on holiday in Venice. It was shot entirely on location there. Although best known for his epics, Lean's personal favourite of all his films was \"Summertime\", and Hepburn his favourite actress.\nHe developed \"The Wind Cannot Read\" but could not come to terms with Alex Korda and the Rank Organisation.\nFor Columbia and Sam Spiegel.\nLean's films now began to become infrequent but much larger in scale and more extensively released internationally. \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957) was based on a novel by Pierre Boulle recounting the story of British and American prisoners of war trying to survive in a Japanese prison camp during the Second World War. The film stars William Holden and Alec Guinness and became the highest-grossing film of 1957 in the United States. It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Alec Guinness, who had battled with Lean to give more depth to his role as an obsessively correct British commander who is determined to build the best possible bridge for his Japanese captors in Burma.\nAfter extensive location work in the Middle East, North Africa, Spain, and elsewhere, Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" was released in 1962. This was the first project of Lean's with a screenplay by playwright Robert Bolt, rewriting an original script by Michael Wilson (one of the two blacklisted writers of \"Bridge on the River Kwai\"). It recounts the life of T. E. Lawrence, the British officer who is depicted in the film as uniting the squabbling Bedouin peoples of the Arab peninsula to fight in World War I and then push on for independence.\nAfter some hesitation, Alec Guinness appeared here in his fourth David Lean film as the Arab leader Prince Faisal, despite his misgivings from their conflicts on \"Bridge on the River Kwai\". French composer Maurice Jarre, on his first Lean film, created a soaring film score with a famous theme and won his first Oscar for Best Original Score. The film turned actor Peter O'Toole, playing Lawrence, into an international star. Lean was nominated for ten Oscars, winning seven, including two for Best Director. Lean remains the only British director to win more than one Oscar for directing.\nFor MGM.\nLean had his greatest box-office success with \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965), a romance set during the Russian Revolution. The film, based on the Soviet suppressed novel by Nobel Prize-winning Russian poet Boris Pasternak, tells the story of a brilliant and warm-hearted physician and poet (Omar Sharif) who, while seemingly happily married into the Russian aristocracy, and a father, falls in love with a beautiful abandoned young mother named Lara (Julie Christie) and struggles to be with her in the chaos of the Bolshevik revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War.\nInitially, reviews for \"Doctor Zhivago\" were lukewarm, but critics have since come to see it as one of Lean's best films, with film director Paul Greengrass calling it \"one of the great masterpieces of cinema\". As of 2020[ [update]], it is the 9th highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. Producer Carlo Ponti used Maurice Jarre's lush romantic score to create a pop tune called \"Lara's Theme\", which became an international hit song with lyrics under the title \"Somewhere My Love\", one of cinema's most successful theme songs. The British director of photography, Freddie Young, won an Academy Award for his colour cinematography. Around the same time, Lean also directed some scenes of \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965) while George Stevens was committed to location work in Nevada.\nLean's \"Ryan's Daughter\" (1970) was released after an extended period on location in Ireland. A doomed romance set against the backdrop of 1916 Ireland's struggles against the British, it is loosely based on Gustave Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary\". Starring the aging Hollywood 'bad boy' Robert Mitchum in an uncharacteristic role as a long-suffering Irish husband and British actress Sarah Miles as his faithless young wife, the film received far fewer positive reviews than the director's previous work, being particularly savaged by the New York critics. Some critics felt the film's massive visual scale on gorgeous Irish beaches and extended running time did not suit its small-scale romantic narrative. Nonetheless, the film was a box office success, earning $31 million and making it the 8th highest-grossing film of that year. It won two Academy Awards the following year, another for cinematographer Freddie Young and for supporting actor John Mills in his role as a village halfwit.\nThe poor critical reception of the film prompted Lean to meet with the National Society of Film Critics, gathered at the Algonquin Hotel in New York, including \"The New Yorker\"'s Pauline Kael, and ask them why they objected to the movie. \"I sensed trouble from the moment I sat down\", Lean says of the now famous luncheon. \"Time\" critic Richard Schickel asked Lean point blank how he, the director of \"Brief Encounter\", could have made \"a piece of bullshit\" like \"Ryan's Daughter\". These critics so lacerated the film for two hours to David Lean's face that the devastated Lean was put off from making films for a long time. \"They just took the film to bits\", said Lean in a later television interview. \"It really had such an awful effect on me for several years\u00a0... you begin to think that maybe they're right. Why on earth am I making films if I don't have to? It shakes one's confidence terribly.\"\nLast years and unfulfilled projects.\n\"The Lawbreakers\" and \"The Long Arm\".\nFrom 1977 until 1980, Lean and Robert Bolt worked on a film adaptation of \"Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian\", a dramatized account by Richard Hough of the Mutiny on the \"Bounty\". It was originally to be released as a two-part film, one named \"The Lawbreakers\" that dealt with the voyage out to Tahiti and the subsequent mutiny, and the second named \"The Long Arm\" that studied the journey of the mutineers after the mutiny as well as the admiralty's response in sending out the frigate HMS \"Pandora\", in which some of the mutineers were imprisoned. Lean could not find financial backing for both films after Warner Bros. withdrew from the project; he decided to combine it into one and looked at a seven-part TV series before getting backing from Italian mogul Dino De Laurentiis. The project then suffered a further setback when Bolt suffered a serious stroke and was unable to continue writing; the director felt that Bolt's involvement would be crucial to the film's success. Melvyn Bragg ended up writing a considerable portion of the script.\nLean was forced to abandon the project after overseeing casting and the construction of the $4 million \"Bounty\" replica; at the last possible moment, actor Mel Gibson brought in his friend Roger Donaldson to direct the film, as producer De Laurentiis did not want to lose the millions he had already put into the project over what he thought was as insignificant a person as the director dropping out. The film was eventually released as \"The Bounty\".\n\"A Passage to India\".\nLean then embarked on a project he had pursued since 1960, a film adaptation of \"A Passage to India\" (1984), from E. M. Forster's 1924 novel of colonial conflicts in British-occupied India. Entirely shot on location in the sub-continent, this became his last completed film. He rejected a draft by Santha Rama Rau, responsible for the stage adaptation and Forster's preferred screenwriter, and wrote the script himself. In addition, Lean also edited the film with the result that his three roles in the production (writer, editor, director) were given equal status in the credits.\nLean recruited long-time collaborators for the cast and crew, including Maurice Jarre (who won another Academy Award for the score), Alec Guinness in his sixth and final role for Lean, as an eccentric Hindu Brahmin, and John Box, the production designer for \"Dr. Zhivago\". Reversing the critical response to \"Ryan's Daughter\", the film opened to universally enthusiastic reviews; the film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and Lean himself nominated for three Academy Awards in directing, editing, and writing. His female star, in the complex role of a confused young British woman who falsely accuses an Indian man of attempted rape, gained Australian actress Judy Davis her first Academy nomination. Peggy Ashcroft, as the sensitive Mrs. Moore, won the Oscar for best supporting actress, making her, at 77, the oldest actress to win that award. According to Roger Ebert, it is \"one of the greatest screen adaptations I have ever seen\".\n\"Empire of the Sun\".\nHe was signed on to direct a Warner Bros.\u2013backed adaptation of J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel \"Empire of the Sun\" after director Harold Becker left the project. Steven Spielberg was brought on board as a producer for Lean, but later assumed the role of director when Lean dropped out of the project; Spielberg was drawn to the idea of making the film due to his long-time admiration for Lean and his films. \"Empire of the Sun\" was released in 1987.\n\"Nostromo\".\nDuring the last years of his life, Lean was in pre-production of a film version of Joseph Conrad's \"Nostromo\". He assembled an all-star cast, including Marlon Brando, Paul Scofield, Anthony Quinn, Peter O'Toole, Christopher Lambert, Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Quaid, with Georges Corraface as the title character. Lean also wanted Alec Guinness to play Dr. Monygham, but the aged actor turned him down in a letter from 1989: \"I believe I would be disastrous casting. The only thing in the part I might have done well is the crippled crab-like walk.\" As with \"Empire of the Sun\", Steven Spielberg came on board as producer with the backing of Warner Bros., but after several rewrites and disagreements on the script, he left the project and was replaced by Serge Silberman, a respected producer at Greenwich Film Productions.\nThe \"Nostromo\" project involved several writers, including Christopher Hampton and Robert Bolt, but their work was abandoned. In the end, Lean decided to write the film himself with the assistance of Maggie Unsworth (wife of cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth), with whom he had worked on the scripts for \"Brief Encounter\", \"Great Expectations\", \"Oliver Twist\", and \"The Passionate Friends\". Originally Lean considered filming in Mexico but later decided to film in London and Madrid, partly to secure O'Toole, who had insisted he would take part only if the film was shot close to home. \"Nostromo\" had a total budget of $46 million and was six weeks away from filming at the time of Lean's death from throat cancer. It was rumoured that fellow film director John Boorman would take over direction, but the production collapsed. \"Nostromo\" was finally adapted for the small screen with an unrelated BBC television mini-series in 1997.\nPersonal life.\nLean was a long-term resident of Limehouse, East London. \nHis co-writer and producer, Norman Spencer, has said Lean was a \"huge womaniser\", and that \"to my knowledge, he had almost 1,000 women\". He was married six times, had one son, and at least two grandchildren\u2014from all of whom he was completely estranged\u2014and was divorced five times. He was survived by his last wife Sandra Cooke, art dealer and co-author (with Barry Chattington) of \"David Lean: An Intimate Portrait\" (2001), and by Peter Lean, his son from his first marriage.\nHis six wives were:\nLean died in Limehouse, London, on 16 April 1991, at the age of 83. He was interred at Putney Vale Cemetery.\nHonours.\nLean was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1953, and was knighted for his contributions and services to the arts in 1984. Lean received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990. In 2012, Lean was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork\u2014the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover\u2014celebrating the British cultural figures of his lifetime that he most admires.\nIn 1999, the British Film Institute compiled its list of the Top 100 British films. Seven of Lean's films appeared on the list:\nIn addition, on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of 100 Years...100 Movies, \"Lawrence of Arabia\" placed 5th, \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" 13th, and \"Doctor Zhivago\" 39th. In the 2007 revised edition, \"Lawrence of Arabia\" placed 7th and \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" placed 36th.\nWith five wins out of six nominations, Lean directed more films that won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the Oscars than any other director for: \"Great Expectations\", \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"Doctor Zhivago\" and \"Ryan's Daughter\"\u2014the last nomination being for \"A Passage to India\".\nStyle.\nAs Lean himself pointed out, his films are often admired by fellow directors as a showcase of the filmmaker's art. According to Katharyn Crabbe, \"[t]he rewards of watching a David Lean film are most often described in terms of his skillful use of cinematic conventions, his editing, his alertness to the ability of film to create effects.\" In his introduction to \"David Lean: Interviews\", Steven Organ claims that Lean \"often straddl[ed] that fine line between commercialism and artistry. To view one of Lean's films is to see the complete spectrum of tools available to the filmmaker \u2013 and used to their fullest potential.\"\nAccording to David Ehrenstein, \"What all [his] brilliant, seemingly disparate works have in common is the clarity and precision of Lean's filmmaking technique, as well as his steely resolve in using it to attain poetic grandeur.\" Michael Sragow calls Lean \"a superb romantic moviemaker and one of the slow but steady innovators of the cinema \u2026 Though Lean is usually praised for his 'film sense', as though it were divorced from his other faculties, he's done as much as men of the theater like Visconti to merge the illusions and grand passions of the stage with the verisimilitude and immediacy of the screen. His ability to combine factual filigree and larger-than-life characters in a sometimes hallucinatory atmosphere has inspired generations of filmmakers to try to fuse the most ruthless documentation with the most elaborate myth-making.\" He further highlights Lean's use of \"highly charged staging and editing and a lucid, fluid realism to depict the contrast between ongoing life and life at its extremes.\"\nOn the occasion of Lean's centenary in 2008, writer and broadcaster Andrew Collins praised him as \"more than just cinema's great choreographer of scale\":\nAlain Silver analyses Lean's technique as \"one that elucidates story and characters through pictures.\" He states that Lean is able to subjectify a film's perspective through visuals regardless of whether the film has a \"third-person\" or \"first-person\" narrative:\nLean was notorious for his perfectionist approach to filmmaking; director Claude Chabrol stated that he and Lean were the only directors working at the time who were prepared to wait \"forever\" for the perfect sunset, but whereas Chabrol measured \"forever\" in terms of days, Lean did so in terms of months. Similarly, Hugh Hudson, writing shortly after Lean's death in 1991, called him \"[a] man driven to achieve the perfect realisation of his ideas and ruthless in that pursuit.\" He goes on to describe the filmmaker's method of working with actors:\nThemes.\nSteven Ross has written that Lean's films \"reveal a consistently tragic vision of the romantic sensibility attempting to reach beyond the constraints and restrictions of everyday life\", and that they tend to feature \"intimate stories of a closely-knit group of characters [whose] fates are indirectly but powerfully shaped by history-shaking events going on around them.\" He further observes that, in his work, \"setting [is used] as a presence with as much dramatic and thematic form as any character in the film.\" Similarly, Lean biographer Gene D. Phillips writes that the director \"saw in his style an attraction to characters who refuse to accept defeat, even when their most cherished hopes go unfulfilled. His protagonists seek to transform their lives, but often fail to do so. Pip in \"Great Expectations\", Colonel Nicholson in \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", and T. E. Lawrence in \"Lawrence of Arabia\", among others, struggle against the limitations of their own personalities to achieve a level of existence that they deem higher or nobler.\"\nAccording to Silver, \"Lean's signature characters are ordinary dreamers and epic visionaries, people who want to transform the world according to their expectations... The tragic flaw in Lean's characters is a self-centeredness which can lead to misimpression, which can prevent them from seeing what is so clear to everyone else.\" In Sragow's view, Lean has \"depicted the need for constricted modern men and women either to act out their dreams \"or\" preserve the life they have by making a scene or putting on a show\u2015indulging in the histrionic to renew their sense of self and purpose.\"\nMichael Newton of \"The Guardian\", analysing \"Brief Encounter\" and \"Doctor Zhivago\", says:\nHudson considers the director an important chronicler of the British character in the 20th century:\nSeveral critics have found a close relationship between style and theme in Lean's work. John Orr, author of \"Romantics and Modernists in British Cinema\", examines Lean in terms of \"the stylised oscillation of romance and restraint that shapes so much of his work\", as well as of \"the intersection of culture and nature, where a story's momentous events are not only framed against landscape settings but also integrated into the very texture of the image that his camera produces.\" He argues that \"Lean could have given us kitsch, syrupy imitations of landscape photography, but his staging and cutting blend so fluently that his evocation of the romantic sublime is linked, inextricably, to his \"d\u00e9coupage\" and sense of place.\" In \"The Rough Guide to Film\", Tom Charity argues: \"It's in the cutting that you feel both the romantic ardour and the repression that create the central tension in [Lean's] work.\"\nLegacy.\nSteven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese in particular are fans of Lean's epic films and claim him as one of their primary influences. Spielberg and Scorsese also helped in the 1989 restoration of \"Lawrence of Arabia\", which had been substantially altered both by the studio in theatrical release and in particular in its televised versions; the theatrical re-release greatly revived Lean's reputation.\nSeveral of the many other later directors who have acknowledged significant influence by Lean include Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Spike Lee, Sergio Leone, Sir John Boorman, Paul Thomas Anderson, Lawrence Kasdan and Guillermo del Toro.\nJohn Woo once named \"Lawrence of Arabia\" among his top three films. More recently, Joe Wright (\"Pride &amp; Prejudice\", \"Atonement\") has cited Lean's works, particularly \"Doctor Zhivago\", as an important influence on his work, as has director Christopher Nolan (\"The Dark Knight Rises\").\nThe critical verdict was not unanimous, however. For example, David Thomson, writing about Lean in his \"New Biographical Dictionary of Film\", comments:{ \"The New York Times\" film critic Bosley Crowther dismissed \"Lawrence of Arabia\" as \"a huge, thundering camel-opera that tends to run down rather badly as it rolls on into its third hour and gets involved with sullen disillusion and political deceit\". Writing in \"The Village Voice\", Andrew Sarris remarked that \"Lawrence\" was \"simply another expensive mirage, dull, overlong, and coldly impersonal\u00a0... on the whole I find it hatefully calculating and condescending\".\nAward and nominations.\nAwards and nominations received by Lean's films\nDirected Academy Award Performances\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the father of the author and biographer James Boswell, and grandfather of songwriter Sir Alexander Boswell.\nAlexander Boswell was the eldest son of James Boswell (ca. 1672\u20131749), 7th Laird of Auchinleck. He attended the University of Edinburgh, read Civil Law at the University of Leyden and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1727.\nHe was appointed Sheriff of Wigtown in 1748 but resigned the position in 1750 after inheriting the Auchinleck estate in Ayrshire on the death of his father. There he built the present Adam-style Auchinleck House.\nIn 1754, he built a new aisle in Auchinleck church for Rev. John Dun who was also the family tutor.\nAlexander was nominated to the Court of Session in 1754, receiving the additional appointment to the High Court of Justiciary in the following year. As a judge he took the courtesy title \"Lord Auchinleck\" from the name of his estate, of which he was the 8th Laird. He is noted for rescuing the Auchinleck manuscript in 1740 from a professor of the University of Aberdeen who was in the process of destroying it. He donated the manuscript to the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh.\nHe is known for frequently arguing with his son, James Boswell, upon matters such as Boswell's career choice, life style, his publishing methods and routes of travel, his friends and even his choice of wife.\nFamily.\nHe married Euphemia Erskine (1718\u20131766) in 1738; their children included James, John (1743\u20131798) and (Thomas) David (1748\u20131826). John joined the Army but was obliged to resign on the grounds of insanity. Thomas David was a merchant trading with Spain before becoming head of the Prize Department of the Navy. After Euphemia's death in 1766 he married his cousin Elizabeth Boswell on the same day as his son James's marriage in 1769.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "72132", "revid": "37664675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72132", "title": "Psychologist", "text": "Professional who practices psychology\nA psychologist is a professional who practices psychology and studies mental states, perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and social processes and behavior. Their work often involves the experimentation, observation, and interpretation of how individuals relate to each other and to their environments.\nPsychologists usually acquire a bachelor's degree in psychology, followed by a master's degree or doctorate in psychology. Unlike psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse-practitioners, psychologists usually cannot prescribe medication, but depending on the jurisdiction, some psychologists with additional training can be licensed to prescribe medications; qualification requirements may be different from a bachelor's degree and master's degree.\nPsychologists receive extensive training in psychological testing, communication techniques, scoring, interpretation, and reporting, while psychiatrists are not usually trained in psychological testing. Psychologists are also trained in, and often specialize in, one or more psychotherapies to improve symptoms of many mental disorders, including but not limited to treatment for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorders and eating disorders. Treatment from psychologists can be individual or in groups. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a commonly used, well studied and high efficacy psychotherapy practiced by psychologists. Psychologists can work with a range of institutions and people, such as schools, prisons, in a private clinic, in a workplace, or with a sports team.\nApplied psychology applies theory to solve problems in human and animal behavior. Applied fields include clinical psychology, counseling psychology, sport psychology, forensic psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, health psychology and school psychology. Licensing and regulations can vary by state and profession.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the psychology profession, and the use of the title \"psychologist\", is regulated by an Act of Parliament, the Health Practitioner Regulation (Administrative Arrangements) National Law Act 2008, following an agreement between state and territorial governments. Under this national law, registration of psychologists is administered by the Psychology Board of Australia (PsyBA). Before July 2010, the professional registration of psychologists was governed by various state and territorial Psychology Registration Boards. The Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) oversees education standards for the profession.\nThe minimum requirements for general registration in psychology, including the right to use the title \"psychologist\", are an APAC approved four-year degree in psychology followed by either a two-year master's program or two years of practice supervised by a registered psychologist. However, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) is currently in the process of phasing out the 4 + 2 internship pathway. Once the 4 + 2 pathway is phased out, a master's degree or PhD will be required to become a psychologist in Australia. This is because of concerns about public safety, and to reduce the burden of training on employers. There is also a '5 + 1' registration pathway, including a four-year APAC approved degree followed by one year of postgraduate study and one year of supervised practice. Endorsement within a specific area of practice requires additional qualifications. These notations are not \"specialist\" titles (Western Australian psychologists could use \"specialist\" in their titles during a three-year transitional period from 17 October 2010 to 17 October 2013).\nMembership with the Australian Psychological Society (APS) differs from registration as a psychologist. The standard route to full membership (MAPS) of the APS usually requires four years of APAC-accredited undergraduate study, plus a master's or doctorate in psychology from an accredited institution. An alternate route is available for academics and practitioners who have gained appropriate experience and made a substantial contribution to the field of psychology.\nRestrictions apply to all individuals using the title \"psychologist\" in all states and territories of Australia. However, the terms \"psychotherapist\", \"social worker\", and \"counselor\" are currently self-regulated, with several organizations campaigning for government regulation.\nBelgium.\nSince 1933, the title \"psychologist\" has been protected by law in Belgium. It can only be used by people who are on the National Government Commission list. The minimum requirement is the completion of five years of university training in psychology (master's degree or equivalent). The title of \"psychotherapist\" is not legally protected. As of 2016, Belgian law recognizes the clinical psychologist as an autonomous health profession. It reserves the practice of psychotherapy to medical doctors, clinical psychologists and clinical orthopedagogists.\nCanada.\nA professional in the U.S. or Canada must hold a graduate degree in psychology (MA, Psy.D., Ed.D., or Ph.D.), or have a provincial license to use the title \"psychologist\".\nProvincial regulators include:\nDominican Republic.\nA professional psychologist in the Dominican Republic must have a suitable qualification and be a member of the Dominican College of Psychologists.\nFinland.\nIn Finland, the title \"psychologist\" is protected by law. The restriction for psychologists (licensed professionals) is governed by National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Finland) (Valvira). It takes 330 ECTS-credits (about six years) to complete the university studies (master's degree). There are about 6,200 licensed psychologists in Finland.\nGermany.\nIn Germany, the use of the title (Dipl.-Psych.) is restricted by law, and a practitioner is legally required to hold the corresponding academic title, which is comparable to a M.Sc. degree and requires at least five years of training at a university. Originally, a diploma degree in psychology awarded in Germany included the subject of clinical psychology. With the Bologna-reform, this degree was replaced by a master's degree. The academic degree of or M.Sc. (Psychologie) does not include a psychotherapeutic qualification, which requires three to five years of additional training. The psychotherapeutic training combines in-depth theoretical knowledge with supervised patient care and self-reflection units. After having completed the training requirements, psychologists take a state-run exam, which, upon successful completion (Approbation), confers the official title of \"psychological psychotherapist\" (). After many years of inter-professional political controversy, non-physician psychotherapy was given an adequate legal foundation through the creation of two new academic healthcare professions.\nGreece.\nSince 1979, the title \"psychologist\" has been protected by law in Greece. It can only be used by people who hold a relevant license or certificate, which is issued by the Greek authorities, to practice as a psychologist. The minimum requirement is the completion of university training in psychology at a Greek university, or at a university recognized by the Greek authorities. Psychologists in Greece are legally required to abide by the Code of Conduct of Psychologists (2019). Psychologists in Greece are not required to register with any psychology body in the country in order to legally practice the profession. Titles such as \"psychotherapist\" or \"counselor\" are not protected by law in Greece and anyone may call themselves a \"psychotherapist\" or \"counselor\" without having earned a graduate degree in psychology.\nIndia.\nIn India, \"clinical psychologist\" is specifically defined in the Mental Health Act, 2017. An MPhil in Clinical Psychology degree of two years duration recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India is required to apply for registration as a clinical psychologist. PsyD and Professional diploma in Clinical Psychology is also a less popular way to get license of Clinical Psychologist in India. This procedure has been criticized by some stakeholders since clinical psychology is not limited to the area of rehabilitation. Titles such as \"counselor\", \"psychoanalyst\", \"psychoeducator\" or \"psychotherapist\" are not protected at present. In other words, an individual may call themselves a \"psychotherapist\" or \"counselor\" without having any recognized degree from Rehabilitation council of India and without having to register with the Rehabilitation Council of India. Rehabilitation psychologists also require a license from RCI to practice. Psychologs magazine is the major media, working on mental health awareness. Tele-MANAS is a nationwide governmental program launched by Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare in October 2021.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, the use of the title \"psychologist\" is restricted by law. Prior to 2004, only the title \"registered psychologist\" was restricted to people qualified and registered as such. However, with the proclamation of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act, in 2003, the use of the title \"psychologist\" was limited to practitioners registered with the New Zealand Psychologists Board. The titles \"clinical psychologist\", \"counseling psychologist\", \"educational psychologist\", \"intern psychologist\", and \"trainee psychologist\" are similarly protected. This is to protect the public by providing assurance that the title-holder is registered and therefore qualified and competent to practice, and can be held accountable. The legislation does not include an exemption clause for any class of practitioner (e.g., academics, or government employees).\nNorway.\nIn Norway, the title \"psychologist\" is restricted by law and can only be obtained by completing a six-year integrated program, leading to the Candidate of Psychology degree. Psychologists are considered health personnel, and their work is regulated through the \"health personnel act\".\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa, psychologists are qualified in either clinical, counseling, educational, organizational, or research psychology.\nAs below, qualification requires at least five years of study, and at least one of internship.\nTo become qualified, one must complete a recognized master's degree in Psychology, an appropriate practicum at a recognized training institution, and take an examination set by the Professional Board for Psychology. Registration with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) is required and includes a Continuing Professional Development component.\nThe practicum usually involves a full year internship, and in some specializations, the HPCSA requires completion of an additional year of community service. The master's program consists of seminars, coursework-based theoretical and practical training, and a dissertation of limited scope, and is (in most cases) two years in duration. \nPrior to enrolling in the master's program, the student studies psychology for three years as an undergraduate (B.A. or B.Sc., and, for organizational psychology, also B.Com.), followed by an additional postgraduate honours degree in psychology; see List of universities in South Africa. \nThe undergraduate B.Psyc. is a four-year program integrating theory and practical training, and\u2014with the required examination set by the Professional Board for Psychology\u2014is sufficient for practice as a psychometrist or counselor.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, \"registered psychologist\" and \"practitioner psychologist\" are protected titles. The title of \"neuropsychologist\" is not protected. In addition, the following specialist titles are also protected by law: \"clinical psychologist\", \"counselling psychologist\", \"educational psychologist\", \"forensic psychologist\", \"health psychologist\", \"occupational psychologist\" and \"sport and exercise psychologist\". The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. In the UK, the use of the title \"chartered psychologist\" is also protected by statutory regulation, but that title simply means that the psychologist is a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, but is not necessarily registered with the HCPC. However, it is illegal for someone who is not in the appropriate section of the HCPC register to provide psychological services. The requirement to register as a clinical, counselling, or educational psychologist is a professional doctorate (and in the case of the latter two the British Psychological Society's Professional Qualification, which meets the standards of a professional doctorate). The title of \"psychologist\", by itself, is not protected. The British Psychological Society is working with the HCPC to ensure that the title of \"neuropsychologist\" is regulated as a specialist title for practitioner psychologists.\nEmployment.\nAs of \u00a02012[ [update]], in the United Kingdom, there are 19,000 practitioner psychologists registered across seven categories: clinical psychologist, counselling psychologist, educational psychologist, forensic psychologist, health psychologist, occupational psychologist, sport and exercise psychologist. At least 9,500 of these are clinical psychologists, which is the largest group of psychologists in clinical settings such as the NHS. Around 2,000 are educational psychologists.\nUnited States and Canada.\nEducation and training.\nIn the United States and Canada, full membership in each country's professional association\u2014American Psychological Association (APA) and Canadian Psychological Association (CPA), respectively\u2014requires doctoral training (except in some Canadian provinces, such as Alberta, where a master's degree is sufficient). The minimal requirement for full membership can be waived in circumstances where there is evidence that significant contribution or performance in the field of psychology has been made. Associate membership requires at least two years of postgraduate studies in psychology or an approved related discipline.\nSome U.S. schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a master's degree. Such programs can range from forty-eight to eighty-four units, most often taking two to three years to complete after the undergraduate degree. Training usually emphasizes theory and treatment over research, quite often with a focus on school or couples and family counseling. Similar to doctoral programs, master's level students usually must complete a clinical practicum under supervision; some programs also require a minimum amount of personal psychotherapy. While many graduates from master's level training go on to doctoral psychology programs, a large number also go directly into practice\u2014often as a licensed professional counselor (LPC), marriage and family therapist (MFT), or other similar licensed practice, which varies by state.\nThere is stiff competition to gain acceptance into clinical psychology doctoral programs (acceptance rates of 2\u20135% are not uncommon). Clinical psychologists in the U.S. undergo many years of graduate training\u2014usually five to seven years after the bachelor's degree\u2014to gain demonstrable competence and experience. Licensure as a psychologist may take an additional one to two years post-PhD/PsyD. Some states require a 1-year postdoctoral residency, while others do not require postdoctoral supervised experience and allow psychology graduates to sit for the licensure exam immediately. Some psychology specialties, such as clinical neuropsychology, require a 2-year postdoctoral experience regardless of the state, as set forth in the Houston Conference Guidelines. Today in America, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in PhD programs that emphasize melding research with practice and are conducted by universities\u2014with the other half in PsyD programs, which less focus on research (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law). Both types of doctoral programs (PhD and PsyD) envision practicing clinical psychology in a research-based, scientifically valid manner, and most are accredited by the APA.\nAPA accreditation is very important for U.S. clinical, counseling, and school psychology programs because graduating from a non-accredited doctoral program may adversely affect employment prospects and present a hurdle for becoming licensed in some jurisdictions.\nDoctorate (PhD and PsyD) programs usually involve some variation on the following 5 to 7 year, 90\u2013120 unit curriculum:\n*Bases of behavior\u2014biological, cognitive-affective, and cultural-social\n*Individual differences\u2014personality, lifespan development, psychopathology\n*History and systems\u2014development of psychological theories, practices and scientific knowledge\n*Clinical practice\u2014diagnostics, psychological assessment, psychotherapeutic interventions, psychopharmacology, ethical and legal issues\n*Coursework in statistics and research design\n* Clinical experience\n**Practicum\u2014usually three or four years of working with clients under supervision in a clinical setting. Most practicum placements begin in either the first or second year of doctoral training.\n**Doctoral internship\u2014usually an intensive one or two-year placement in a clinical setting\n* Dissertation\u2014PhD programs usually require original quantitative empirical research, while PsyD dissertations involve original quantitative or qualitative research, theoretical scholarship, program evaluation or development, critical literature analysis or clinical application and analysis. The dissertation typically takes 2\u20133 years to complete.\n*Specialized electives\u2014many programs offer sets of elective courses for specializations, such as health, child/adolescent, family, community, or neuropsychology.\n* Personal psychotherapy\u2014many programs require students to undertake a certain number of hours of personal psychotherapy (with a non-faculty therapist) although in recent years this requirement has become less frequent.\n* Comprehensive exams or master's thesis: a thesis can involve original data collection and is distinct from a dissertation.\nPsychologists can be seen as practicing within two general categories of psychology: health service psychology, which includes \"practitioners\" or \"professionals\" and research-oriented psychology which includes \"scientists\" or \"scholars\". The training models (Boulder and Vail models) endorsed by the APA require that health service psychologists be trained as both researchers and practitioners, and that they possess advanced degrees.\nPsychologists typically have one of two degrees: PsyD or PhD. The PsyD program prepares the student primarily as a practitioner for clinical practice (e.g., testing, psychotherapy), but also as a scholar that consumes research. Depending on the specialty (industrial/organizational, social, clinical, school, etc.), a PhD may be trained in clinical practice as well as in scientific methodology, to prepare for a career in academia or research. Both the PsyD and PhD programs prepare students to take the national psychology licensing exam, the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP).\nWithin the two main categories are many further types of psychologists as reflected by APA's 54 Divisions, which are specialty or subspecialty or topical areas, including clinical, counseling, and school psychologists. Such professionals work with persons in a variety of therapeutic contexts. People often think of the discipline as involving only such clinical or counseling psychologists. While counseling and psychotherapy are common activities for psychologists, these health service psychology fields are just two branches in the larger domain of psychology. There are other classifications such as industrial and organizational and community psychologists, whose professionals mainly apply psychological research, theories, and techniques to \"real-world\" problems of business, industry, social benefit organizations, government, and academia.\nAPA-recognized specialties.\nClinical psychologists receive training in a number of psychological therapies, including behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, existential, psychodynamic, and systemic approaches, as well as in-depth training in psychological testing, and to some extent, neuropsychological testing.\nServices.\nClinical psychologists can offer a range of professional services, including:\nIn practice, clinical psychologists might work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, community mental health centers, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies.\nMost clinical psychologists who engage in research and teaching do so within a college or university setting. Clinical psychologists may also choose to specialize in a particular field.\nPrescriptive Authority for Psychologists (RxP).\nPsychologists in the United States campaigned for legislative changes to enable specially-trained psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medications. Legislation in Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, New Mexico, Illinois, and Colorado has granted those who complete an additional master's degree program in clinical psychopharmacology authority to prescribe medications for mental and emotional disorders. As of 2019[ [update]], Louisiana is the only state where the licensing and regulation of the practice of medical psychology by medical psychologists (MPs) is regulated by a medical board (the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners) rather than a board of psychologists. While other states have pursued prescriptive authority, they have not succeeded. Similar legislation in the states of Hawaii and Oregon passed through their respective legislative bodies, but in each case the legislation was vetoed by the state's governor.\nIn 1989, the U.S Department of Defense was directed to create the Psychopharmacology Demonstration Project (PDP). By 1997, ten psychologists were trained in psychopharmacology and granted the ability to prescribe psychiatric medications.\nLicensure.\nThe practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States and Canada. Although each of the U.S. states is different in terms of requirements and licenses (see and for examples), there are three common requirements:\nAll U.S. state and Canada provincial licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e., mental health law) examination or an oral examination. Nearly all states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license. Licensees can obtain this through various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops.\nThere are professions whose scope of practice overlaps with the practice of psychology (particularly with respect to providing psychotherapy) and for which a license is required.\nAmbiguity of title.\nTo practice with the title of \"psychologist\", in almost all cases a doctoral degree is required (PhD, PsyD, or EdD in the U.S.). Normally, after the degree, the practitioner must fulfill a certain number of supervised postdoctoral hours ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 (usually taking one to two years), and pass the EPPP and any other state or provincial exams. By and large, a professional in the U.S. must hold a doctoral degree in psychology (PsyD, EdD, or PhD), and/or have a state license to use the title \"psychologist\". However, regulations vary from state to state. For example, in the states of Michigan, West Virginia, and Vermont, there are psychologists licensed at the master's level.\nDifferences with psychiatrists.\nAlthough clinical psychologists and psychiatrists share the same fundamental aim\u2014the alleviation of mental distress\u2014their training, outlook, and methodologies are often different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians, and, as such, psychiatrists are apt to use the medical model to assess mental health problems and to also employ psychotropic medications as a method of addressing mental health problems.\nPsychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although in some jurisdictions they do have prescription privileges. In five U.S. states (New Mexico, Louisiana, Illinois, Iowa, Idaho, and Colorado), psychologists with clinical psychopharmacology training have been granted prescriptive authority for mental health disorders.\nPsychologists receive extensive training in psychological test administration, scoring, interpretation, and reporting, while psychiatrists are not trained in psychological testing. In addition, psychologists (particularly those from PhD programs) spend several years in graduate school being trained to conduct behavioral research; their training includes research design and advanced statistical analysis. While this training is available for physicians via dual MD/PhD programs, it is not typically included in standard medical education, although psychiatrists may develop research skills during their residency or a psychiatry fellowship (post-residency).\nPsychiatrists, as licensed physicians, have been trained more intensively in other areas, such as internal medicine and neurology, and may bring this knowledge to bear in identifying and treating medical or neurological conditions that present with primarily psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or paranoia (e.g., hypothyroidism presenting with depressive symptoms, or pulmonary embolism with significant apprehension and anxiety).\nMental health professions.\nSources: \nLicensed behavior analysts are licensed in five states to provide services for clients with substance abuse, developmental disabilities, and mental illness. This profession draws on the evidence base of applied behavior analysis and the philosophy of behaviorism. Behavior analysts have at least a master's degree in behavior analysis or in a mental health related discipline, as well as having taken at least five core courses in applied behavior analysis. Many behavior analysts have a doctorate. Most programs have a formalized internship program, and several programs are offered online. Most practitioners have passed the examination offered by the http:// The model licensing act for behavior analysts can be found at the Association for Behavior Analysis International's website.\nEmployment.\nIn the United States, of 181,600 jobs for psychologists in 2021, 123,300 are employed in clinical, counseling, and school positions; 2,900 are employed in industrial-organizational positions, and 55,400 are in \"all other\" positions.\nThe median salary in the U.S. for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists in May 2021 was US$82,510 and the median salary for industrial-organizational psychologists was US$105,310.\nPsychologists can work in applied or academic settings. Academic psychologists educate higher education students, as well as conduct research, with graduate-level research being an important part of academic psychology. Academic positions can be tenured or non-tenured, with tenured positions being highly desirable.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72147", "revid": "1309344459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72147", "title": "Cinema of New Zealand", "text": " \nThe cinema of New Zealand refers to films made by New Zealand\u2013based production companies in New Zealand or films made about New Zealand by filmmakers from other countries. New Zealand produces many films that are co-financed by overseas companies.\nThe history of cinema in New Zealand is almost as long as the medium itself. The first public screening of a motion picture took place in 1896. A documentary made in 1900 is the oldest surviving New Zealand film, while the first feature film made in New Zealand premiered in 1914. A small-scale industry developed between the 1920s and the 1960s, but it was not until the 1970s that locally made films began to attract significant audiences.\nFrom the 1990s onward, New Zealand-made films have increasingly achieved international success, including both those with local funding and themes, and those with additional foreign cooperation, such as \"Avatar\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.\nFor a list of the 328 feature films and 117 documentaries made in New Zealand, see List of New Zealand Films.\nDefining New Zealand film.\nIn October 1978, the New Zealand Film Commission was formalised by Parliament under the Third National Government.\nUnder Section 17 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978, the functions of the commission are to:\nWith this Act, the New Zealand film industry became more stabilised. Section 18 of the Act, entitled \"Content of Films\", defines what makes \"a New Zealand film\". To qualify, a film must have \"significant New Zealand content\", judged by taking into account the following:\nThese defining aspects have in recent years caused debate on whether films like \"The Frighteners\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" qualify as New Zealand films. The impact of the New Zealand Film Commission upon the industry was significant in getting films made, coming to a definition of \"New Zealand Film\", and helped to establish a screen industry in New Zealand.\nMost New Zealand films are made by independent filmmakers, often on a low budget and with sponsorship from public funding sources. Few New Zealand-made films have been specifically commissioned for the international market by international film distributors.\nRecently, international film companies have become more aware of the skills of New Zealand filmmakers, and have increasingly used the country as a shooting location and also somewhere to finish production of their feature films.\nPrivate funding for New Zealand films has often been in short supply, although for a period in the early 1980s, tax breaks resulted in a short term production boom. Some New Zealand directors and actors have been ignored in large part by their own country, despite success overseas, and often had to work in the US, Australia, and the UK as a result.\nHistory.\nEarly film: 1890s\u20131920s.\nThe first public screening of a motion picture in New Zealand took place on 13 October 1896 at the Opera House in Auckland. The screening\u2014which was in fact a demonstration of Thomas Edison's kinetograph\u2014was part of a show presented by Charles Godfrey's Vaudeville Company. The first screening of a colour film\u2014one using a colour process, not just a colourised black-and-white film\u2014was on 24 December 1911 in Auckland. The film was shown simultaneously at the Globe Picture Theatre in Queen Street and the Kings Theatre on Upper Pitt Street (now the Mercury Theatre).\nThe first filmmaker in New Zealand was Alfred Henry Whitehouse, who made ten films between 1898 and mid-1900. The oldest surviving New Zealand film is Whitehouse's \"The Departure of the Second Contingent for the Boer War\" (1900).\nThe first feature film made in New Zealand is arguably \"Hinemoa\". It premiered on 17 August 1914 at the Lyric Theatre, Auckland. \nNew Zealand's oldest surviving cinema is in Roxburgh in Central Otago, which opened in the town's Athen\u00e6um Hall on 11 December 1897. The editors of the local newspaper, the \"Mount Benger Mail\", wrote in the issue of 10 December: \"\"We would draw the attention of the public to the Salon Cin\u00e9matographe entertainment in the Athen\u00e6um Hall to-morrow evening. This is an opportunity which should not be missed of witnessing life scenes\".\" \nPurpose-built cinemas were built from 1910 onwards, with the first being Wellington's The Kings, built in 1910. Another example is the Mayfair Theatre in Dunedin, built in 1913. The oldest surviving purpose-built cinema in New Zealand \u2014 and in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 is the Victoria Theatre in Devonport, Auckland, built in 1912.\nThe classical era: 1920s\u20131960s.\nNew Zealand's was a small-scale film industry between the 1920s and 1960s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Rudall Hayward made a number of feature films on New Zealand themes. \"Rewi's Last Stand\" was probably his best, but little of this 1925 film survives. The film was remade with sound in 1940. Independent filmmaker John O'Shea was active from 1940 to 1970 making New Zealand cinema; his company Pacific Films produced numerous short films as well as the three New Zealand feature films made in that period: \"Broken Barrier\" (1952) with Roger Mirams; \"Runaway\" (1964); and \"Don't Let It Get You\" (1966).\nHowever, most New Zealand-made films of the period were documentaries. The National Film Unit was a government-funded producer of short films, documentaries, and publicity material. \"This is New Zealand\", a short film made for the World Expo in 1970, was extremely popular there and subsequently screened in New Zealand cinemas, garnering considerable acclaim. It used three separate projectors to create a wide-screen image. The film was restored in 2006 and shown at the 2007 New Zealand International Film Festivals.\nEstablishment of the New Zealand Film Commission: 1970s\u20131980s.\nIn 1978, the New Zealand Film Commission was established. Its aim was to encourage and promote the national film industry, and a number of film projects have been funded by the commission.\nOne of the first New Zealand films to attract large-scale audiences at home was \"Sleeping Dogs\", directed by Roger Donaldson in 1977. The film, a dark, political action thriller that portrays the reaction of one man to the formation of a totalitarian government and the ensuing guerrilla war, introduced Sam Neill as a leading actor. The imagery of large-scale civil conflict and government repression would be realised only a few years later when the 1981 Springbok Tour caused nationwide protests and clashes with police.\n\"Sleeping Dogs\" is also notable as the first full-length 35mm feature film made entirely by a New Zealand production crew. Before then, films such as 1973's \"Rangi's Catch\" had been shot in New Zealand, where they were set, but were produced and directed by foreign crews.\n1981 saw the release of the road film \"Goodbye Pork Pie\", which made NZ$1.5 million. Director Geoff Murphy was lured away by Hollywood, but he made two other key New Zealand films: \"Utu\" (1983), about the land wars of the 1860s, and a nuclear-apocalypse science-fiction story, \"The Quiet Earth\" (1985). Bruno Lawrence, who appeared in both films, became a star.\nMelanie Read was the first woman to write and direct a New Zealand feature film with the 1984 thriller \"Trial Run\". In 1987 Barry Barclay's film \"Ngati\", screenplay by Tama Poata and starring veteran actor Wi Kuki Kaa, was released to critical acclaim and some box-office success. \"Ngati\" is recognised as the first feature film to be written and directed by a person of M\u0101ori descent.\nMerata Mita was the first M\u0101ori woman to write and direct a dramatic feature film, when she directed \"Mauri\" in 1988. An accomplished documentary film-maker, Mita made landmark documentaries including \"\" (1980), about the occupation of land there, and \"Patu!\" (1983), a film about the controversial and violent anti-apartheid protests during the 1981 Springboks rugby tour from South Africa.\nThe late 1980s saw the reinvention of the New Zealand short film, beginning with Alison Maclean's \"Kitchen Sink\". Instead of trying to be short features focused on dialogue and character, the new shorts tried instead to \"push the envelope\" in terms of visual design and cinematic grammar. An explosion of visually rich and compelling works emerged that seemed to have more in common with European art-house cinema than Hollywood.\nKey examples of these are: \"The Lounge Bar\" (The Front Lawn), \"Kitchen Sink\" (Alison Maclean), \"A Little Death\" (Simon Perkins; Paul Swadel), \"Stroke\" (Christine Jeffs), \"La Vie en Rose\" (Anna Reeves), \"A Game With No Rules\" (Scott Reynolds), \"Eau de la vie\" (Simon Bar\u00e9), \"O Tamaiti (The Children)\" (Sima Urale) which won the Silver Lion Best Short Film at the Venice Film Festival, and \"Two Cars, One Night\" (Taika Waititi), which was nominated for the Best Short Film Oscar.\nInternational breakthrough: 1990\u20132000.\nThe early 1990s saw New Zealand film gain international recognition, most obviously with Jane Campion's \"The Piano\" (1993), which won three Academy Awards. Peter Jackson's \"Heavenly Creatures\" (1994) and Lee Tamahori's \"Once Were Warriors\" also received international acclaim and high grosses in a number of countries. \"The Piano\" and \"Heavenly Creatures\" showed an increasing tendency for New Zealand films to be partially or completely funded by overseas production companies, and star non-local actors (for example, Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel in \"The Piano\", and Kate Winslet in \"Heavenly Creatures\"). This did not stop the migration of New Zealanders to the United States: Tamahori, Melanie Lynskey of \"Heavenly Creatures\" and Canadian-born \"Piano\" star Anna Paquin are now all primarily based in America.\nA notable exception to the migration tendency is Peter Jackson, who continued to make films in New Zealand. Jackson's career began with low-budget comedies such as \"Bad Taste\" (1987) and \"Meet the Feebles\" (1989). He was eventually noticed by Hollywood, and in the 2000s directed \"The Lord of the Rings\" series. Although made with mainly foreign funding (helped by a tax break from the New Zealand government) and featuring a primarily international cast, Jackson filmed the films in New Zealand, using a largely local production crew, helping create an enormous skill base in the New Zealand film industry.\nThis has led to a number of prominent Hollywood films being made in New Zealand, with major international productions not only filming there but also using the country's various post-production facilities and special effects companies. Among these films are \"The Last Samurai\" and \"\". While the funding for these movies has come largely from the United States, the trend has helped New Zealand film studios and filmmakers develop skills and improve facilities.\nHowever, some industry figures claim that having large international productions employ New Zealand crews has its downside. One New Zealand filmmaker recently complained that it has become difficult to employ cameramen on a low-budget New Zealand film, as cameramen are now used to large wages. Other filmmakers find that the opposite is true, and argue that the greater number of local professionals may have driven wages down from the relative heights of the 1980s. \nSince 2001.\nIn early 21st century, the amount of local content has significantly increased, with \"Whale Rider\" (2002) becoming the second-highest-grossing North American independent film of 2003 and third-highest worldwide, earning $40.1 million. Other notable films include \"In My Father's Den\" (2004) and \"The World's Fastest Indian\" (2005). Both films did well at the New Zealand box office, with the latter beating \"Once Were Warriors\" to become the highest-grossing New Zealand film at the domestic box office, earning over NZ$6.5 million; a record beaten by \"Boy\" in 2010\".\"\nSam Neill and Judy Rymer's documentary \"Cinema of Unease\" was made in 1995. \nThe latter part of the first decade of the new century saw the expansion of Peter Jackson's filmmaking empire, with the producer-director optioning the rights to \"The Lovely Bones\", \"Halo\", \"The Dam Busters\" and the fantasy series \"Temeraire\". Major productions such as \"Avatar\" and the 2007 blockbuster \"\" used Jackson's Wellington studios and the services of the special-effects company Weta Digital. US-based video game company Unity Software bought Weta Digital for $1.63bn in 2021.\n\"Eagle vs Shark\" (2007) was director Taika Waititi's first feature film, starring Jemaine Clement and Loren Horsley. The film earned over US$ at the box office. Waititi's film \"Boy\", released in 2010, topped the box office receipts for the opening week, earning more on its opening day than any previous locally made film, becoming the highest-grossing New Zealand film of all time. In 2014 the mockumentary \"What We Do in the Shadows\", directed by Waititi and Clement, was released to substantial critical acclaim. Two years later, Waititi released \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople,\" starring Sam Neill and Julian Dennison, a film that became the new highest-grossing opening weekend box office New Zealand film on home soil, beating the record set by \"Boy\" six years prior.\nNew Zealand is grappling with the effect of international streaming platforms in the New Zealand market. In 2023 the New Zealand's screen producers' guild, SPADA pointed out international streamers currently 'pay no tax in New Zealand, face no regulation, and use broadband infrastructure partially funded by our Government while at the same time impact local broadcasting viewership and advertising revenue'. Regulating this would be in-line with many other countries.\nNew Zealand Film Archive.\nThe New Zealand Film Archive was founded and incorporated on 9 March 1981. Film enthusiast, critic and historian Jonathan Dennis (1953\u20132002) was a driving force behind the archive, and became its first director. The archive was set up to preserve and restore significant New Zealand film and television images. It now holds a collection of much of early New Zealand cinema film and holds public screenings of its collection.\nMuch of the early cinema film made in New Zealand has been lost, as it was printed on nitrate, which is unstable. In 1992, when film enthusiasts and the New Zealand Film Archive realised how much of New Zealand's film heritage was being lost, they mounted the \"Last Film Search\" and found 7,000 significant films, both in New Zealand and around the world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The poem presents flyting between the gods and Loki. It is written in the lj\u00f3\u00f0ah\u00e1ttr metre, typical for wisdom verse. \"Lokasenna\" is believed to be a 10th-century poem.\nLoki, amongst other things, accuses the gods of moralistic sexual impropriety, the practice of \"sei\u00f0r\" (sorcery), and bias. Not ostensibly the most serious of allegations, these elements are, however, said ultimately to lead to the onset of Ragnar\u00f6k in the Eddic poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\". However, \"Lokasenna\" does not \"directly\" state that Loki's binding is as a consequence of the killing of Baldr. This is explicitly stated only in Snorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\".\nLee M. Hollander, in his introduction to his translation of the poem, claims that it was in no sense a popular lay and suggests we should not necessarily believe that the accusations of the \"sly god\" were an accepted part of the lore.\nPlot.\nThe setting is a feast given by the sea god \u00c6gir. In continuity, the prose introduction says: \"\u00c6gir, also named Gymir, had made ale for the \u00c6sir, when he had received the great kettle of which was told\" (see \"Hymiskvi\u00f0a\"). Thor did not attend, but his wife Sif came in his stead as did Bragi and his wife I\u00f0unn. Tyr, by this time one-handed as a consequence of his sacrifice of his hand in the shackling of Loki's son, the wolf Fenrisulfr, attended, as did Niord and his wife Ska\u00f0i, Freyr and Freyja, as well as Vidar, the son of Odin. Many other Vanir, \u00c6sir, and also elves were there.\nThe servants of \u00c6gir, Fimafeng and Eldir, did a thorough job of welcoming the guests; Loki was jealous of the praise being heaped upon them and slew Fimafeng. The gods were angry with Loki and drove him out of the hall, before returning to their carousing. On returning Loki encountered Eldir.\nHe threatened him and bade him reveal what the gods were talking about in their cups. Eldir's response was that they were discussing their might at arms, and that Loki was not welcomed.\nLoki then enters the hall of \u00c6gir after trading insults and threats with Eldir. A hush falls. Loki calls upon the rules of hospitality, demanding a seat and ale. Bragi then responds that he is unwelcome. Loki demands fulfillment of an ancient oath sworn with Odin that they should drink together. Odin asked his son Vidar to make a space for Loki.\nVidar rises and pours a drink for Loki. Before Loki drains his draught, he utters a toast to the gods but pointedly excludes Bragi from it. Bragi offers Loki a horse, a ring and a sword to placate him; Loki, however, is spoiling for a fight, and insults Bragi by questioning his courage. Bragi's response is that it would be contrary to the rules of correct behaviour to fight within his hosts' hall, but were they back in Asgard then things would be different. I\u00f0unn, Bragi's wife, holds him back. Loki then insults I\u00f0unn, calling her sexually loose. Gefjon is the next to speak and then Loki turns his spite on her. Odin then attempts to take a grip, as do (in turn), Freyja, Njord, Tyr, Freyr and Byggvir. The exchanges between Odin and Loki are particularly vitriolic.\nEventually Thor turns up at the party, and he is not to be placated, nor withheld. Alternating with Loki's insults to him, he says four times that he will use his hammer to knock Loki's head off if he continues. Loki replies that for Thor alone he will leave the hall, because his threats are the only ones he fears. He then leaves.\nFinally there is a short piece of prose summarizing the tale of Loki's binding, which is told in fuller form in the \"Gylfaginning\" section of Snorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\". Loki is chased by the gods, and caught after an unsuccessful attempt at disguising himself as a salmon. The entrails of his son Nari are used to bind him to three rocks above which Ska\u00f0i places a serpent to drip venom on him. Loki's wife Sigyn remains by his side with a bowl to catch the venom; however, whenever she leaves to empty the bowl, venom falls on Loki, causing him to writhe in agony; this writhing was said to be the cause of earthquakes. The text says that Loki's other son, Narfi, was turned into a wolf, but does not make clear that he tears his brother apart; also in the \"Gylfaginning\" version it is a son of Loki named V\u00e1li whom the \u00c6sir transform into a wolf and who kills Narfi. Some editors have therefore chosen to read the names \"Nari\" and \"Narvi\" as a mistake in the manuscript, and transcribe \"Nari\" as \"V\u00e1li\". \"Nari\" and \"Narfi\" are otherwise considered to be variations of the same name.\nExcerpts.\nThorpe's Translation.\n\"Hail, \u00c6sir!\nHail, Asyniur!\nAnd ye, all-holy gods!\nall, save that one man,\nwho sits within there,\nBragi, on yonder bench.\"\n\"I know that were I without,\nas I am now within,\nthe hall of \u00c6gir,\nI thy head would\nbear in my hand,\nand so for lying punish thee.\"\n\"Valiant on thy seat art thou, Bragi!\nbut so thou shouldst not be,\nBragi, the bench's pride!\nGo and fight,\nif thou art angry;\na brave man sits not considering.\"\nIdunn stepped in to protect her husband.\n\"I pray thee, Bragi!\nlet avail the bond of children,\nand of all adopted sons,\nand to Loki speak not\nin reproachful words,\nin \u00c6gir's hall.\"\n\"Be silent, Idunn!\nof all women I declare thee\nmost fond of men,\nsince thou thy arms,\ncarefully washed, didst twine\nround thy brother's murderer.\"\n\"Loki I address not\nwith opprobrious words,\nin \u00c6gir's hall.\nBragi I soothe,\nby beer excited.\nI desire not that angry ye fight.\"\n\"Why will ye, \u00c6sir twain,\nhere within,\nstrive with reproachful words?\nLopt perceives not\nthat he is deluded,\nand is urged on by fate.\"\n\"Be silent, Gefjun!\nI will now just mention,\nhow that fair youth\nthy mind corrupted,\nwho thee a necklace gave,\nand around whom thou thy limbs didst twine?\"\nOdin interfered, but Loki called him \"unmanly\" as well.\n\"Knowest thou that I gave\nto those I ought not \u2013\nvictory to cowards?\nThou was eight winters\non the earth below,\nmilked cow as a woman,\nand didst there bear children.\nNow that, methinks, betokens a base nature.\"\n\"But, it is said, thou wentest\nwith tottering steps in Sams\u00f6,\nand knocked at houses as a Vala. \nIn likeness of a fortune teller,\nthou wentest among people;\nNow that, methinks, betokens a base nature.\"\nFrigg tried to defend her husband.\n\"Your doings\nye should never\npublish among men,\nwhat ye, \u00c6sir twain,\ndid in days of yore.\nEver forgotten be men's former deeds!\"\n\"Be thou silent, Frigg!\nThou art Fjorgynn's daughter,\nand ever hast been lustful,\nsince Ve and Vili, it is said,\nthou, Vidrir's wife, didst \nboth to thy bosom take.\"\n\"Mad art thou, Loki!\nin recounting\nthy foul misdeeds.\nFrigg, I believe,\nknows all that happens,\nalthough she says it not.\"\n\"Be thou silent, Freyja!\nI know thee full well;\nthou art not free from vices:\nof the \u00c6sir and the Alfar,\nthat are herein,\neach has been thy paramour.\"\n\"False is thy tongue.\nHenceforth it will, I think,\nprate no good to thee.\nWroth with thee are the \u00c6sir,\nand the Asyniur.\nSad shalt thou home depart.\"\n\"Be silent, Freyja!\nThou art a sorceress,\nand with much evil blended;\nsince against thy brother thou\nthe gentle powers excited.\nAnd then, Freyja!

The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units, eventually reaching 2.5 million. It was described as \"one of the first anti-spectatorial, non-esoteric computers by design...no longer relegated to hobbyist/enthusiasts or those with money, the computer Commodore developed was the computer of the future.\"\nHistory.\nAs the Apple II gained momentum with the advent of VisiCalc in 1979, Jack Tramiel wanted a product that would compete in the same segment, to be presented at the January 1980 CES. For this reason Chuck Peddle and Bill Seiler started to design a computer named \"TOI\" (The Other Intellect). The TOI computer failed to materialize, mostly because it required an 80-column character display which in turn required the MOS Technology 6564 chip. However, the chip could not be used in the TOI since it required very expensive static RAM to operate fast enough.\nAs the new decade began, the price of computer hardware was dropping and Tramiel saw an emerging market for low-price computers, that could be sold at retail stores to relative novices rather than professionals or people with an electronics or programming background. Radio Shack had been achieving considerable success with the TRS-80 Model I, a relatively low-cost machine that was widely sold to novices and in 1980 released the Color Computer, which was aimed at the home and educational markets, used ROM cartridges for software, and connected to a TV set. Atari also released in 1979 the low-end 400, aimed at the home and educational markets, in addition to the high-end 800, and both could also use cartridges and connected to TV sets.\nDevelopment.\nIn the meantime, new engineer Robert Yannes at MOS Technology (then a part of Commodore) designed a computer in his home dubbed the \"MicroPET\" and finished a prototype with help from Al Charpentier and Charles Winterble. With the TOI unfinished, when Jack Tramiel was shown the MicroPET prototype, he immediately said he wanted it to be finished and ordered it to be mass-produced following a limited demonstration at CES.\nThe prototype produced by Yannes had few of the features required for a real computer, so Robert Russell at Commodore headquarters had to coordinate and finish large parts of the design under the codename \"Vixen\". The parts contributed by Russell included a port of the operating system (kernel and BASIC interpreter) taken from John Feagans' design for the Commodore PET, a character set with the characteristic PETSCII, an Atari CX40 joystick-compatible interface, and a ROM cartridge port. The serial IEEE-488-derivative CBM-488 interface was designed by Glenn Stark. It served several purposes, including costing substantially less than the IEEE-488 interface on the PET, using smaller cables and connectors that allowed for a more compact case design, and also complying with newly imposed FCC regulations on RFI emissions by home electronics (the PET was certified as Class B office equipment which had less stringent RFI requirements). Some features, like the memory add-in board, were designed by Bill Seiler.\nAltogether, the VIC 20 development team consisted of five people led by Michael Tomczyk, the product manager who recruited the group and dubbed them the VIC Commandos. Commodore founder Jack Tramiel initially gave Tomczyk the title VIC Czar and later appointed him product manager. Tomczyk insisted on several features including full-size typewriter keys, programmable function keys, and a built-in RS-232 interface. Michael later contracted and co-designed a $100 modem, the VICModem, which became the first modem to sell 1 million units. According to one of the development team, Neil Harris, \"[W]e couldn't get any cooperation from the rest of the company who thought we were jokers because we were working late, about an hour after everyone else had left the building. We'd swipe whatever equipment we needed to get our jobs done. There was no other way to get the work done! [...] they'd discover it was missing and they would just order more stuff from the warehouse, so everybody had what they needed to do their work.\"\nAt the time, Commodore had a glut of 1 Kbit\u00d74 SRAM chips, so Tramiel decided these should be used in the new computer. The result was arguably closer to the \"PET\" or \"TOI\" computers than to Yannes' prototype, albeit with a 22-column VIC chip instead of the custom chips designed for the more ambitious computers. As the amount of memory on the VIC-20's system board was very small even for 1981 standards, the design team could get away with using more expensive SRAM due to its lower power consumption, heat output, and less supporting circuitry. The original Revision A system board found in all silver-label VIC-20s used 2114 SRAMs and due to their tiny capacity (only 512 bytes per chip), ten of them were required to reach 5\u00a0KB of system RAM. The Revision B system board, found in rainbow logo VIC-20s switched to larger 2048-byte SRAMs which reduced the memory count to five chips: 2\u00d7 2048-byte chips + 3\u00d7 2114 (the 1024 \u00d7 4 bits) chips.\nIn April 1980, at a meeting of general managers outside London, Jack Tramiel declared he wanted a low-cost color computer. When most of the GMs argued against it, preferring Peddle's more sophisticated design, he said: \"The Japanese are coming, so we must become the Japanese!\" (in reference to the threats of low-cost systems from Japan). This was in keeping with Tramiel's philosophy which was to make \"computers for the masses, not the classes\". The concept was supported at the meeting by Tomczyk, newly hired marketing strategist and assistant to the president; Tony Tokai, General Manager of Commodore Japan; and Kit Spencer, the UK's top marketing executive. Peddle disagreed with the decision and left the company with other engineers, so an engineering team in Commodore Japan led by Yash Terakura helped finish the design. The VIC-20 was marketed in Japan as VIC-1001 before VIC-20 was introduced to the US.\nWhen they returned to California from that meeting, Tomczyk wrote a 30-page memo detailing recommendations for the new computer and presented it to Tramiel. Recommendations included programmable function keys (inspired by competing Japanese computers), full-size typewriter-style keys, and built-in RS-232. Tomczyk insisted on \"user-friendliness\" as the prime directive for the new computer, to engineer Terakura, and proposed a retail price of US$299.95. He recruited a marketing team and a small group of computer enthusiasts and worked closely with colleagues in the UK and Japan to create colorful packaging, user manuals, and the first wave of games and home applications.\nScott Adams was contracted to provide a series of text adventure games. With help from a Commodore engineer who came to Longwood, Florida, to assist in the effort, five of Adams's Adventure International game series were ported to the VIC. They got around the limited memory of VIC-20 by having the 16 KB games reside in a ROM cartridge instead of being loaded into main memory via cassette as they were on the TRS-80 and other machines. The first production run of the five cartridges generated over $1,500,000 in sales for Commodore.\nEvolution.\nThe VIC-20 went through several variations in its three-and-a-half years of production. First-year models (1980) had a PET-style keyboard with a blocky typeface while most VIC-20s made during 1981 had a slightly different keyboard also shared with early C64s. The rainbow logo VIC-20 was introduced in early 1983 and has the newer C64 keyboard with gray function keys and the Revision B motherboard. It has a similar power supply to the C64 PSU, although the amperage is slightly lower. A C64 \"black brick\" PSU is compatible with Revision B VIC-20s; however, the VIC's PSU is not recommended on a C64 if any external devices, such as cartridges or user port accessories, are installed, as it will overdraw the available power. Older Revision A VIC-20s cannot use a C64 PSU or vice versa as a different connector was used.\nDecline.\nThe VIC-20 was a bestseller, becoming the first computer to sell over a million. In total, 2.5 million computers were sold. In summer 1982, Commodore unveiled the Commodore 64, a more advanced machine with 64 KB of RAM and considerably improved sound and graphics. Initial sales of the C64 were slow but took off in mid-1983. The VIC-20 was widely available for under $90 by that time. Commodore discontinued the VIC-20 in January 1985.\nPerhaps the last new commercially available VIC-20 peripheral was the VIC-Talker, a speech synthesizer. \"Ahoy!\" wrote in January 1986, \"Believe it or not, a new VIC accessory... We were as surprised as you.\"\nDesign.\nThe VIC-20 was intended to be more economical than the PET computer. It was equipped with 5\u00a0KB of static RAM and used the same MOS 6502 CPU as the PET. The VIC-20's video chip, the MOS Technology VIC, was a general-purpose color video chip designed by Al Charpentier in 1977 and intended for use in inexpensive display terminals and game consoles, but Commodore could not find a market for the chip.\nWhile newer PETs had the upgraded BASIC 4.0, with disk commands and improved garbage collection, the VIC-20 reverted to the 8\u00a0KB BASIC 2.0 used on earlier PETs as part of another of the design team's goals: 20\u00a0KB system ROMs. There are no dedicated sound or graphics features.\nThe VIC-20 has a composite output, which provides a sharper, cleaner picture if a dedicated monitor is used. The TRS-80 Color Computer and Atari 400 have only RF video output. An external RF modulator was necessary to use the computer with a TV set.\nThe \"20\" in the computer's name was widely assumed to refer to the text width of the screen (although in fact, the VIC-20 has 22-column text, not 20) or that it referred to the combined size of the system ROMs (8\u00a0KB BASIC+8\u00a0KB KERNAL+4\u00a0KB character ROM). Bob Yannes claimed that \"20\" meant nothing in particular and said \"We simply picked '20' because it seemed like a friendly number and the computer's marketing slogan was 'The Friendly Computer'. I felt it balanced things out a bit since 'Vic' sounded like the name of a truck driver.\"\nGraphics.\nThe graphics capabilities of the VIC chip (6560/6561) are limited but flexible. At startup, the screen shows 176\u00d7184 pixels, with a fixed-color border to the edges of the screen. Since a PAL or NTSC screen has a width-to-height ratio, each VIC pixel is much wider than it is high. The screen normally shows 22 columns and 23 rows of 8-by-8-pixel characters; it is possible to increase these dimensions up to 27 columns, but the characters would soon run out the sides of the monitor at about 25 columns. Just as on the PET, two different 256-character sets are included, the uppercase/graphics character set and the upper/lowercase set, and reverse video versions of both. Normally, the VIC-20 operates in a mode whereby each character is 8\u00d78 pixels in size and uses one color. A lower-resolution multicolor mode can also be used with 4\u00d78 characters and three colors each, but it is not used as often due to its extreme blockiness, because pixels in this mode are twice as wide as otherwise. Additionally, there is a \"high-resolution\" mode, in which the characters are 8x16 pixels in size.\nThe VIC chip does not support a true bitmap mode, but programmers can define their own custom character sets. It is possible to get a fully addressable screen, although slightly smaller than normal, by filling the screen with a sequence of different double-height characters, then turning on the pixels selectively inside the RAM-based character definitions. The Super Expander cartridge adds BASIC commands supporting such a graphics mode using a resolution of 160\u00d7160 pixels. It is also possible to fill a larger area of the screen with addressable graphics using a more dynamic allocation scheme if the contents are sparse or repetitive enough. This is used by the port of \"Omega Race\".\nThe VIC chip has readable scan-line counters but cannot generate interrupts based on the scan position. The two VIA timer chips can serve this purpose through an elaborate programming technique, allowing graphics to be mixed with text above or below it, two different backgrounds and border colors, or more than 200 characters for the pseudo-high-resolution mode.\nThe VIC chip can process a light pen signal via the joystick port, but few appeared on the market.\nThe VIC chip outputs Luma+Sync and Chroma video signals, which are combined to create the VIC-20's composite video output. Commodore did not include an RF modulator inside the computer's case because of FCC regulations. It can either be attached to a dedicated monitor or a TV set using the external modulator included with the computer.\nSound.\nThe VIC chip has three pulse wave generators and a white noise generator with overall volume control and mono output. Each pulse wave generator has a range of three octaves located on the scale about an octave apart, giving a total range of about five octaves.\nMemory.\nThe VIC-20 shipped with 5 KB RAM, but 1.5 KB of this is used for the video display and dynamic aspects of the ROM-resident Commodore BASIC and KERNAL (a low-level operating system). Only 3,583 bytes of BASIC program memory for code and variables are actually available on an unexpanded machine.\nUnlike the PET, the VIC-20 does not include a machine language monitor, but Commodore offered them on disk, tape, or cartridge, with several different executables to load into various memory locations. The monitor programs were the same as the PET monitor but added a mini-assembler instead of requiring the user to enter hexadecimal opcodes.\nThe VIC-20's RAM is expandable through the cartridge port via a RAM cartridge. RAM cartridges were available from Commodore in several sizes: (with or without an included \"Super Expander\" BASIC extension ROM), , and . The internal memory map is reorganized if you plug in and cartridges, leading to a situation where some programs only work if the right amount of memory is present (the most significant divide being between a machine with no or extra memory on one hand, and a machine with or more extra memory on the other).\nMost expansion cartridges featured hardware DIP switches, allowing the RAM to be enabled in user-selectable memory blocks. Since the VIC-20 was designed to use SRAM rather than DRAM, the system board has no provisions for DRAM refresh. RAM expansion cartridges ultimately allowed adding up to to the BASIC user memory; together with the built-in user memory, this gave a maximum of for BASIC programs and variables. Memory not visible to BASIC could still be used by machine code programs.\nPeripherals and expansion.\nThe VIC-20 has card edge connectors for program/expansion cartridges and a PET-standard Datassette tape drive. The VIC-20 did not originally have a disk drive; the VIC-1540 disk drive was released in 1981.\nThere is one Atari joystick port, compatible with the digital joysticks and paddles used with Atari VCS and Atari 8-bit computers; a serial CBM-488 bus (a serial version of the PET's IEEE-488 bus) for daisy chaining disk drives and printers; a TTL-level \"user port\" with both RS-232 and Centronics signals (most frequently used as RS-232, for connecting a modem).\nThe VIC has a ROM cartridge port for games and other software as well as for adding memory to the machine. Port expander boxes from Commodore and other vendors allow more than one cartridge to be attached at a time. Cartridge size ranges from 4\u201316 KB in size, although the latter was uncommon due to its cost.\nThe VIC-20 can be hooked into external electronic circuitry via the joystick port, the \"user port,\" or the memory expansion cartridge port, which exposes various analog to digital, memory bus, and other internal I/O circuits to the experimenter. PEEK and POKE commands from BASIC can be used to perform data acquisition from temperature sensors, control robotic stepper motors, etc.\nIn 1981, Tomczyk contracted with an outside engineering group to develop a direct-connect modem-on-a-cartridge (the VICModem), which at US$99 became the first modem priced under US$100. The VICModem was also the first modem to sell over 1 million units. VICModem was packaged with US$197.50 worth of free telecomputing services from The Source, CompuServe, and Dow Jones. Tomczyk also created a SIG called the Commodore Information Network to enable users to exchange information and take some of the pressure off of Customer Support inquiries, which were straining Commodore's lean organization. In 1982, this network accounted for the largest traffic on CompuServe.\nCommodore's VIC-1010 Expansion allows the user to connect multiple devices to the VIC-20's cartridge port. It has its own power supply and six slots that can be used to connect memory extensions, game cartridges or other peripherals.\nApplications.\nThe VIC-20's BASIC is compatible with the PET's, and the Datasette format is the same. Before the computer's release, a Commodore executive promised it would have \"enough additional documentation to enable an experienced programmer/hobbyist to get inside and let his imagination work\". \"Compute!\" favorably contrasted the company's encouragement of \"cottage industry software developers\" to Texas Instruments discouraging third-party software. Because of its small memory and low-resolution display compared to some other computers of the time, the VIC-20 was primarily used for educational software and games. However, productivity applications such as home finance programs, spreadsheets, and communication terminal programs were also made for the machine.\nThe VIC had a sizable library of public domain and freeware software. This software was distributed via online services such as CompuServe, BBSs, as well as offline by mail order and by user groups. Several computer magazines sold on newsstands, such as \"Compute!\", \"Family Computing\", \"RUN\", \"Ahoy!\", and the CBM-produced \"Commodore Power/Play\", offered programming tips and type-in programs for the VIC-20.\nAn estimated 300 commercial titles were available on cartridge and another 500+ were available on tape. A handful of disk applications were released.\nThe VIC's low cost led to it being used by the Fort Pierce, Florida, Utilities Authority to measure the input and output of two of their generators and display the results on monitors throughout the plant. The utility was able to purchase multiple VIC and C64 systems for the cost of one IBM PC compatible.\nMarketing and retail.\nWhile the PET was sold through authorized dealers the VIC-20 primarily sold at retail, especially discount and toy stores, where it could compete directly with game consoles. It was the first computer to be sold in K-Mart. Commodore took out advertisements featuring actor William Shatner (of \"\" fame) as its spokesman, asking: \"Why buy just a video game?\" and describing it as \"The Wonder Computer of the 1980s\". Television personality Henry Morgan (best known as a panelist on the TV game show \"I've Got a Secret\") became the commentator in a series of Commodore product ads.\nThe VIC-20 was called \"VC-20\" in Germany and was marketed as though it were an abbreviation of \"VolksComputer\" (\"people's computer,\" similar to Volkswagen and Volksempf\u00e4nger).\nReception.\nDescribing it as \"an astounding machine for the price\", \"Compute!\" in 1981 expected the VIC-20 would be popular in classrooms and homes with small children, with \"excellent graphic and sound capabilities\". While predicting the 22-column screen was \"too small to support any but the most rudimentary business applications\" the magazine observed that \"at a price of $, that is hardly the point\", stating that \"the VIC will provide very stiff competition to the TRS-80 Color Computer\" and \"is a much more valuable computer literacy tool than\" other products like the TRS-80 Pocket Computer. \"Compute!\" concluded \"VIC will create its own market, and it will be a big one\". While also noting the small screen size and RAM, \"BYTE\" stated that the VIC-20 was \"unexcelled as low-cost, consumer-oriented computer. Even with some of its limitations...it makes an impressive showing against...the Apple II, the Radio Shack TRS-80, and the Atari 800\". The magazine praised the price (\"Looking at a picture...might cause you to think $ would be a fair price...But it does not cost $\u2014the VIC 20 retails for $\"), keyboard (\"the equal of any personal-computer keyboard in both appearance and performance. This is a remarkable achievement, almost unbelievable considering the price of the entire unit\"), graphics, documentation, and ease of software development with the KERNAL.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72156", "revid": "9023670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72156", "title": "Human population planning", "text": "Practice of controlling rate of growth\nHuman population planning is the practice of managing the growth rate of a human population. The practice, traditionally referred to as population control, had historically been implemented mainly with the goal of increasing population growth, though from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about overpopulation and its effects on poverty, the environment and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates in many countries. More recently, however, several countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Iran, Italy, Spain, Finland, Hungary and Estonia have begun efforts to boost birth rates once again, generally as a response to looming demographic crises.\nWhile population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, such as the Chinese government's \"one-child policy and two-child policy\", have employed coercive measures.\nTypes.\nThree types of population planning policies pursued by governments can be identified:\nHistory.\nAncient times through Middle Ages.\nA number of ancient writers have reflected on the issue of population. At about 300 BC, the Indian political philosopher Chanakya (c. 350-283 BC) considered population a source of political, economic, and military strength. Though a given region can house too many or too few people, he considered the latter possibility to be the greater evil. Chanakya favored the remarriage of widows (which at the time was forbidden in India), opposed taxes encouraging emigration, and believed in restricting asceticism to the aged.\nIn ancient Greece, Plato (427-347 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC) discussed the best population size for Greek city-states such as Sparta, and concluded that cities should be small enough for efficient administration and direct citizen participation in public affairs, but at the same time needed to be large enough to defend themselves against hostile neighbors. In order to maintain a desired population size, the philosophers advised that procreation, and if necessary, immigration, should be encouraged if the population size was too small. Emigration to colonies would be encouraged should the population become too large. Aristotle concluded that a large increase in population would bring, \"certain poverty on the citizenry and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil.\" To halt rapid population increase, Aristotle advocated the use of abortion and the exposure of newborns (that is, infanticide).\nConfucius (551-478 BC) and other Chinese writers cautioned that, \"excessive growth may reduce output per worker, repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife.\" Some Chinese writers may also have observed that \"mortality increases when food supply is insufficient; that premature marriage makes for high infantile mortality rates, that war checks population growth.\" It is particularly noteworthy that Han Fei (281-233 BC), long before Malthus, had already noted the conflict between a population growing at the exponential rate and a food supply growing at the arithmetic rate. Not only did he conclude that overpopulation was the root cause of the intensification of political and social conflict, but he also reduced traditional morality to an evolutionary product of material surplus rather than having any objective value. Nevertheless, during the Han Dynasty, the emperors enacted a large number of laws to encourage early marriage and childbirth.\nAncient Rome, especially in the time of Augustus (63 BC-AD 14), needed manpower to acquire and administer the vast Roman Empire. A series of laws were instituted to encourage early marriage and frequent childbirth. Lex Julia (18 BC) and the Lex Papia Poppaea (AD 9) are two well-known examples of such laws, which among others, provided tax breaks and preferential treatment when applying for public office for those who complied with the laws. Severe limitations were imposed on those who did not. For example, the surviving spouse of a childless couple could only inherit one-tenth of the deceased fortune, while the rest was taken by the state. These laws encountered resistance from the population which led to the disregard of their provisions and to their eventual abolition.\nTertullian, an early Christian author (ca. AD 160-220), was one of the first to describe famine and war as factors that can prevent overpopulation. He wrote: \"The strongest witness is the vast population of the earth to which we are a burden and she scarcely can provide for our needs; as our demands grow greater, our complaints against Nature's inadequacy are heard by all. The scourges of pestilence, famine, wars, and earthquakes have come to be regarded as a blessing to overcrowded nations since they serve to prune away the luxuriant growth of the human race.\"\nIbn Khaldun, a North African polymath (1332\u20131406), considered population changes to be connected to economic development, linking high birth rates and low death rates to times of economic upswing, and low birth rates and high death rates to economic downswing. Khaldoun concluded that high population density rather than high absolute population numbers were desirable to achieve more efficient division of labour and cheap administration.\nDuring the Middle Ages in Christian Europe, population issues were rarely discussed in isolation. Attitudes were generally pro-natalist in line with the Biblical command, \"Be ye fruitful and multiply.\"\nWhen Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue visited the Marshall Islands in Micronesia in 1817, he noted that Marshallese families practiced infanticide after the birth of a third child as a form of population planning due to frequent famines.\n16th and 17th centuries.\nEuropean cities grew more rapidly than before, and throughout the 16th century and early 17th century discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of population growth were frequent. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, an Italian Renaissance political philosopher, wrote, \"When every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that they can neither subsist where they are nor remove themselves elsewhere... the world will purge itself in one or another of these three ways,\" listing floods, plague and famine. Martin Luther concluded, \"God makes children. He is also going to feed them.\"\nJean Bodin, a French jurist and political philosopher (1530\u20131596), argued that larger populations meant more production and more exports, increasing the wealth of a country. Giovanni Botero, an Italian priest and diplomat (1540\u20131617), emphasized that, \"the greatness of a city rests on the multitude of its inhabitants and their power,\" but pointed out that a population cannot increase beyond its food supply. If this limit was approached, late marriage, emigration, and the war would serve to restore the balance.\nRichard Hakluyt, an English writer (1527\u20131616), observed that, \"Through our longe peace and seldom sickness... we are grown more populous than ever heretofore;... many thousands of idle persons are within this realme, which, having no way to be sett on work, be either mutinous and seek alteration in the state, or at least very burdensome to the commonwealth.\" Hakluyt believed that this led to crime and full jails and in \"A Discourse on Western Planting\" (1584), Hakluyt advocated for the emigration of the surplus population. With the onset of the Thirty Years' War (1618\u201348), characterized by widespread devastation and deaths brought on by hunger and disease in Europe, concerns about depopulation returned.\nPopulation planning movement.\nIn the 20th century, population planning proponents have drawn from the insights of Thomas Malthus, a British clergyman and economist who published \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" in 1798. Malthus argued that, \"Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence only increases in an arithmetical ratio.\" He also outlined the idea of \"positive checks\" and \"preventative checks.\" \"Positive checks\", such as diseases, wars, disasters, famines, and genocides are factors which Malthus believed could increase the death rate.\n\"Preventative checks\" were factors which Malthus believed could affect the birth rate such as moral restraint, abstinence and birth control. He predicted that \"positive checks\" on exponential population growth would ultimately save humanity from itself and he also believed that human misery was an \"absolute necessary consequence\". Malthus went on to explain why he believed that this misery affected the poor in a disproportionate manner.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is a constant effort towards an increase in population which tends to subject the lower classes of society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition\u2026. The way in which these effects are produced seems to be this. We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population... increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food, therefore which before supplied seven million must now be divided among seven million and a half or eight million. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them are reduced to severe distress.\nFinally, Malthus advocated for the education of the lower class about the use of \"moral restraint\" or voluntary abstinence, which he believed would slow the growth rate.\nPaul R. Ehrlich, a US biologist and environmentalist, published \"The Population Bomb\" in 1968, advocating stringent population planning policies. His central argument on population is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells; the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people. Treating only the symptoms of cancer may make the victim more comfortable at first, but eventually, he dies - often horribly. A similar fate awaits a world with a population explosion if only the symptoms are treated. We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of cancer. The operation will demand many apparently brutal and heartless decisions. The pain may be intense. But the disease is so far advanced that only with radical surgery does the patient have a chance to survive.\nIn his concluding chapter, Ehrlich offered a partial solution to the \"population problem\",\n\"[We need] compulsory birth regulation... [through] the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired family size\".\nEhrlich's views came to be accepted by many population planning advocates in the United States and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. Since Ehrlich introduced his idea of the \"population bomb\", overpopulation has been blamed for a variety of issues, including increasing poverty, high unemployment rates, environmental degradation, famine and genocide. In a 2004 interview, Ehrlich reviewed the predictions in his book and found that while the specific dates within his predictions may have been wrong, his predictions about climate change and disease were valid. Ehrlich continued to advocate for population planning and co-authored the book \"The Population Explosion\", released in 1990 with his wife Anne Ehrlich.\nHowever, it is controversial as to whether human population stabilization will avert environmental risks. A 2014 study published in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\" found that given the \"inexorable demographic momentum of the global human population\", even mass mortality events and draconian one-child policies implemented on a global scale would still likely result in a population of 5 to 10 billion by 2100. Therefore, while reduced fertility rates are positive for society and the environment, the short term focus should be on mitigating the human impact on the environment through technological and social innovations, along with reducing overconsumption, with population planning being a long-term goal. A letter in response, published in the same journal, argued that a reduction in population by 1 billion people in 2100 could help reduce the risk of catastrophic climate disruption. A 2021 article published in \"Sustainability Science\" said that sensible population policies could advance social justice (such as by abolishing child marriage, expanding family planning services and reforms that improve education for women and girls) and avoid the abusive and coercive population control schemes of the past while at the same time mitigating the human impact on the climate, biodiversity and ecosystems by slowing fertility rates.\nPaige Whaley Eager argues that the shift in perception that occurred in the 1960s must be understood in the context of the demographic changes that took place at the time. It was only in the first decade of the 19th century that the world's population reached one billion. The second billion was added in the 1930s, and the next billion in the 1960s. 90 percent of this net increase occurred in developing countries. Eager also argues that, at the time, the United States recognised that these demographic changes could significantly affect global geopolitics. Large increases occurred in China, Mexico and Nigeria, and demographers warned of a \"population explosion\", particularly in developing countries from the mid-1950s onwards.\nIn the 1980s, tension grew between population planning advocates and women's health activists who advanced women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach. Growing opposition to the narrow population planning focus led to a significant change in population planning policies in the early 1990s.\nPopulation planning and economics.\nOpinions vary among economists about the effects of population change on a nation's economic health. US scientific research in 2009 concluded that the raising of a child cost about $16,000 yearly ($291,570 total for raising the child to its 18th birthday). In the US, the multiplication of this number with the yearly population growth will yield the overall cost of the population growth. Costs for other developed countries are usually of a similar order of magnitude.\nSome economists, such as Thomas Sowell and Walter E. Williams, have argued that poverty and famine are caused by bad government and bad economic policies, not by overpopulation.\nIn his book \"The Ultimate Resource\", economist Julian Simon argued that higher population density leads to more specialization and technological innovation, which in turn leads to a higher standard of living. He claimed that human beings are the ultimate resource since we possess \"productive and inventive minds that help find creative solutions to man's problems, thus leaving us better off over the long run\".\nSimon also claimed that when considering a list of countries ranked in order by population density, there is no correlation between population density and poverty and starvation. Instead, if a list of countries is considered according to corruption within their respective governments, there is a significant correlation between government corruption, poverty and famine.\nViews on population planning.\nBirth rate reductions.\nSupport.\nAs early as 1798, Thomas Malthus argued in his \"Essay on the Principle of Population\" for implementation of population planning. Around the year 1900, Sir Francis Galton said in his publication \"Hereditary Improvement\": \"The unfit could become enemies to the State if they continue to propagate.\" In 1968, Paul Ehrlich noted in \"The Population Bomb\", \"We must cut the cancer of population growth\", and \"if this was not done, there would be only one other solution, namely the 'death rate solution' in which we raise the death rate through war-famine-pestilence, etc.\"\nIn the same year, another prominent modern advocate for mandatory population planning was Garrett Hardin, who proposed in his landmark 1968 essay \"Tragedy of the commons\", society must relinquish the \"freedom to breed\" through \"mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.\" Later on, in 1972, he reaffirmed his support in his new essay \"Exploring New Ethics for Survival\", by stating, \"We are breeding ourselves into oblivion.\" Many prominent personalities, such as Bertrand Russell, Margaret Sanger (1939), John D. Rockefeller, Frederick Osborn (1952), Isaac Asimov, Arne N\u00e6ss and Jacques Cousteau have also advocated for population planning.\nToday, a number of influential people advocate population planning such as these:\nThe head of the UN Millennium Project Jeffrey Sachs is also a strong proponent of decreasing the effects of overpopulation. In 2007, Jeffrey Sachs gave a number of lectures (2007 Reith Lectures) about population planning and overpopulation. In his lectures, called \"Bursting at the Seams\", he featured an integrated approach that would deal with a number of problems associated with overpopulation and poverty reduction. For example, when criticized for advocating mosquito nets he argued that child survival was, \"by far one of the most powerful ways\", to achieve fertility reduction, as this would assure poor families that the smaller number of children they had would survive.\nOpposition.\nCritics of human population planning point out that attempts to curb human population growth have resulted in violations of human rights such as forced sterilization, particularly in China and India. In the latter half of the twentieth century, India's population reduction program received substantial funds and powerful incentives from Western countries and international population planning organizations to reduce India's growing population. This culminated in \"the Emergency,\" a period in the mid-1970's where millions of people were forcibly sterilized. Violent resistance to forced sterilization led to police brutality and some instances of mass shootings of civilians by police. Critics also argue that supposedly voluntary population planning is often coerced. Some also believe that the environmental problems caused by supposed overpopulation are better explained by other factors, and that the goal of human population reduction does not justify the threat to human rights posed by population planning policies.\nOther causes for opposition emerge from the feasibility of substantially impacting human population. According to some researchers, even rapid global adoption of a one-child policy would result in a world population exceeding 8 billion in 2050, and in a scenario involving catastrophic mass death of 2 billion people, world population would exceed 8 billion by 2100.\nThe Catholic Church has opposed abortion, sterilization, and artificial contraception as a general practice but especially in regard to population planning policies. Pope Benedict XVI has stated, \"The extermination of millions of unborn children, in the name of the fight against poverty, actually constitutes the destruction of the poorest of all human beings.\" The reformed Theology pastor Dr. Stephen Tong also opposes the planning of human population.\nPro-natalist policies.\nIn 1946, Poland introduced a , discontinued in the 1970s, as part of natalist policies in the Communist government. From 1941 to the 1990s, the Soviet Union had a similar tax to replenish the population losses incurred during the Second World War.\nThe Socialist Republic of Romania under Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu severely repressed abortion, (the most common birth control method at the time) in 1966, and forced gynecological revisions and penalties for unmarried women and childless couples.\nThe surge of the birth rate taxed the public services received by the \"decre\u021bei 770\" (\"Scions of the Decree 770\") generation. A consequence of Ceau\u0219escu's natalist policy is that large numbers of children ended up living in orphanages, because their parents could not cope. The vast majority of children who lived in the communist orphanages were not actually orphans, but were simply children whose parents could not afford to raise them. The Romanian Revolution of 1989 preceded a fall in population growth.\nBalanced birth policies.\nNativity in the Western world dropped during the interwar period. Swedish sociologists Alva and Gunnar Myrdal published \"Crisis in the Population Question\" in 1934, suggesting an extensive welfare state with universal healthcare and childcare, to increase overall Swedish birth rates, and level the number of children at a reproductive level for all social classes in Sweden. Swedish fertility rose throughout World War II (as Sweden was largely unharmed by the war) and peaked in 1946.\nModern practice by country.\nAustralia.\nAustralia currently offers fortnightly Family Tax Benefit payments plus a free immunization scheme, and recently proposed to pay all child care costs for women who want to work.\nChina.\nOne-child era (1979\u20132015).\nThe most significant population planning system in the world was China's one-child policy, in which, with various exceptions, having more than one child was discouraged. Unauthorized births were punished by fines, although there were also allegations of illegal forced abortions and forced sterilization. As part of China's planned birth policy, (work) unit supervisors monitored the fertility of married women and may decide whose turn it is to have a baby.\nThe Chinese government introduced the policy in 1978 to alleviate the social and environmental problems of China. According to government officials, the policy has helped prevent 400 million births. The success of the policy has been questioned, and reduction in fertility has also been attributed to the modernization of China. The policy is controversial both within and outside of China because of its manner of implementation and because of concerns about negative economic and social consequences e.g. female infanticide. In Asian cultures, the oldest male child has responsibility of caring for the parents in their old age. Therefore, it is common for Asian families to invest most heavily in the oldest male child, such as providing college, steering them into the most lucrative careers, and so on. To these families, having an oldest male child is paramount, so in a one-child policy, daughters have no economic benefit, so daughters, especially as a first child, are often targeted for abortion or infanticide. China introduced several government reforms to increase retirement payments to coincide with the one-child policy. During that time, couples could request permission to have more than one child.\nAccording to Tibetologist Melvyn Goldstein, natalist feelings run high in China's Tibet Autonomous Region, among both ordinary people and government officials. Seeing population control \"as a matter of power and ethnic survival\" rather than in terms of ecological sustainability, Tibetans successfully argued for an exemption of Tibetan people from the usual family planning policies in China such as the one-child policy.\nTwo-child era (2016\u20132021).\nIn November 2014, the Chinese government allowed its people to conceive a second child under the supervision of government regulation.\nOn 29 October 2015, the ruling Chinese Communist Party announced that all one-child policies would be scrapped, allowing all couples to have two children. The change was needed to allow a better balance of male and female children, and to grow the young population to ease the problem of paying for the aging population. The law enacting the two-child policy took effect on 1 January 2016, and replaced the previous one-child policy.\nThree-child era (2021\u2013).\nIn May 2021, the Chinese government allowed its people to conceive a third child, in a move accompanied by \"supportive measures\" it regarded \"conducive\" to improving its \"population structure, fulfilling the country's strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources\" after declining birth rates recorded in the 2020 Chinese census.\nHungary.\nDuring the Second Orb\u00e1n Government, Hungary increased its family benefits spending from one of the lowest rates in the OECD to one of the highest. In 2015, it amounted to nearly 4% of GDP.\nIndia.\nOnly those with two or fewer children are eligible for election to a local government.\n\"Us two, our two\" (\"Hum do, hamare do\" in Hindi) is a slogan meaning \"one family, two children\" and is intended to reinforce the message of family planning thereby aiding population planning.\nFacilities offered by government to its employees are limited to two children. The government offers incentives for families accepted for sterilization. Moreover, India was the first country to take measures for family planning back in 1952.\nIn 2019, the Population Control Bill, 2019 bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in July 2019 by Rakesh Sinha. The purpose of the bill is to control the population growth of India.\nIran.\nAfter the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Iran encouraged married couples to produce as many children as possible to replace population lost to the war.\nIran succeeded in sharply reducing its birth rate from the late 1980s to 2010. Mandatory contraceptive courses are required for both males and females before a marriage license can be obtained, and the government emphasized the benefits of smaller families and the use of contraception. This changed in 2012, when a major policy shift back towards increasing birth rates was announced. In 2014, permanent contraception and advertising of birth control were to be outlawed.\nIsrael.\nIn Israel, Haredi families with many children receive economic support through generous governmental child allowances, government assistance in housing young religious couples, as well as specific funds by their own community institutions. Haredi women have an average of 6.7 children while the average Jewish Israeli woman has 3 children.\nJapan.\nJapan has experienced a shrinking population for many years. The government is trying to encourage women to have children or to have more children \u2013 many Japanese women do not have children, or even remain single. The population is culturally opposed to immigration. \nSome Japanese localities, facing significant population loss, are offering economic incentives. Yamatsuri, a town of 7,000 just north of Tokyo, offers parents $4,600 for the birth of a child and $460 a year for 10 years.\nMyanmar.\nIn Myanmar, the Population planning Health Care Bill requires some parents to space each child three years apart. The Economist, in 2015, stated that the measure was expected to be used against the persecuted Muslim Rohingyas minority.\nRussia.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin directed Parliament in 2006 to adopt a 10-year program to stop the sharp decline in Russia's population, principally by offering financial incentives and subsidies to encourage women to have children.\nIn August 2022, Russia revived the Soviet-era Mother Heroine award for women with 10 children.\nIn November 2024, Putin signed a bill into law that bans 'Childfree Propaganda' to boost birthrates in Russia.\nSingapore.\nSingapore has undergone two major phases in its population planning: first to slow and reverse the baby boom in the Post-World War II era; then from the 1980s onwards to encourage couples to have more children as the birth rate had fallen below the replacement-level fertility. In addition, during the interim period, eugenics policies were adopted.\nThe anti-natalist policies flourished in the 1960s and 1970s: initiatives advocating small families were launched and developed into the \"Stop at Two\" programme, pushing for two-children families and promoting sterilisation. In 1984, the government announced the \"Graduate Mothers' Scheme\", which favoured children of more well-educated mothers; the policy was however soon abandoned due to the outcry in the general election of the same year.\nEventually, the government became pro-natalist in the late 1980s, marked by its \"Have Three or More\" plan in 1987. Singapore pays $3,000 for the first child, $9,000 in cash and savings for the second; and up to $18,000 each for the third and fourth.\nSpain.\nIn 2017, the government of Spain appointed Edelmira Barreira, as \"Government Commissioner facing the Demographic Challenge\", in a pro-natalist attempt to reverse a negative population growth rate.\nTurkey.\nIn May 2012, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan argued that abortion is murder and announced that legislative preparations to severely limit the practice are underway. Erdogan also argued that abortion and C-section deliveries are plots to stall Turkey's economic growth. Prior to this move, Erdogan had repeatedly demanded that each couple have at least three children.\nUnited States.\nEnacted in 1970, Title X of the Public Health Service Act provides access to contraceptive services, supplies and information to those in need. Priority for services is given to people with low incomes. The Title X Family Planning program is administered through the Office of Population Affairs under the Office of Public Health and Science.\nIt is directed by the Office of Family Planning. In 2007, Congress appropriated roughly $283 million for family planning under Title X, at least 90 percent of which was used for services in family planning clinics. Title X is a vital source of funding for family planning clinics throughout the nation, which provide reproductive health care, including abortion.\nThe education and services supplied by the Title X-funded clinics support young individuals and low-income families. The goals of developing healthy families are accomplished by helping individuals and couples decide whether to have children and when the appropriate time to do so would be.\nTitle X has made the prevention of unintended pregnancies possible. It has allowed millions of American women to receive necessary reproductive health care, plan their pregnancies and prevent abortions. Title X is dedicated exclusively to funding family planning and reproductive health care services.\nTitle X as a percentage of total public funding to family planning client services has steadily declined from 44% of total expenditures in 1980 to 12% in 2006. Medicaid has increased from 20% to 71% in the same time. In 2006, Medicaid contributed $1.3 billion to public family planning.\nIn the early 1970s, the United States Congress established the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future (Chairman John D. Rockefeller III), which was created to provide recommendations regarding population growth and its social consequences. The Commission submitted its final recommendations in 1972, which included promoting contraceptives and liberalizing abortion regulations, for example.\nNatalism in the United States.\nIn a 2004 editorial in \"The New York Times\", David Brooks expressed the opinion that the relatively high birth rate of the United States in comparison to Europe could be attributed to social groups with \"natalist\" attitudes. The article is referred to in an analysis of the Quiverfull movement. However, the figures identified for the demographic are extremely low.\nFormer US Senator Rick Santorum made natalism part of his platform for his 2012 presidential campaign. Many of those categorized in the General Social Survey as \"Fundamentalist Protestant\" are more or less natalist, and have a higher birth rate than \"Moderate\" and \"Liberal\" Protestants. However, Rick Santorum is not a Protestant but a practicing Catholic.\nUzbekistan.\nIt is reported that Uzbekistan has been pursuing a policy of forced sterilizations, hysterectomies and IUD insertions since the late 1990s in order to impose population planning.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, access to contraception has been expanded through NHS-commissioned services, including the Pharmacy Contraception Service (PCS) launched in 2023 to initiate and continue oral contraception in community pharmacies, thereby increasing choice and relieving pressure on GP and specialist services. \nA 2023 study of a free online contraception service operating in the UK found the service was accessible to ethnically and socioeconomically diverse users, but that users obtaining emergency contraception did not commonly transition to ongoing oral methods, indicating that access initiatives may need to be paired with proactive counselling to support method continuation. \nMore evidence shows that pharmacy-based delivery of contraception is acceptable to adolescents in high-income settings, supporting UK policy efforts to diversify access points beyond traditional clinics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are administered as part of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The chain lies in the sub-Antarctic region, about southeast of South Georgia and northeast from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.\nThe archipelago comprises 11 main islands forming an island arc running north\u2013south, the largest being Montagu at . It is divided into four groups, from north to south: The Traversay, Candlemas and Central Islands (Saunders, Montagu, and Bristol), and Southern Thule.\nThe archipelago is prone to violent earthquakes. Over the previous century, nine M\u00a07+ earthquakes have occurred here, the most recent being the M\u00a08.1 in August 2021. None of these earthquakes are known to have caused fatalities due to their remote location.\nHistory.\nThe southern eight islands of the South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain James Cook in 1775 during his second voyage aboard HMS \"Resolution\". On 31 January, Cook described sighting \"three rocky islots of considerable height,\" naming the outermost \"Freezland Peak\" after the sailor who first spotted it. He named the area \"Sandwich Land\" in honor of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, then First Lord of the Admiralty. The designation \"South\" was later added to distinguish these islands from the \"Sandwich Islands,\" now known as Hawaii.\nThe northern three islands (Zavodovski, Leskov, and Visokoi), collectively known as the Traversay Islands\u2014were discovered in November 1819 by a Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen aboard the sloop \"Vostok\", with Mikhail Lazarev commanding the \"Mirny\". The group was named in honor of Jean-Baptiste Prevost de Sansac, Marquis de Traversay, the Russian Minister of Naval Affairs.\nThe United Kingdom formally annexed the South Sandwich Islands through letters patent in 1908, grouping them into the Falkland Islands Dependencies alongside South Georgia, the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands, and Graham Land.\nArgentina claimed the South Sandwich Islands in 1938 and challenged British sovereignty in the islands on several occasions. From 25 January 1955 through the summer of 1956 Argentina maintained the summer station Teniente Esquivel at Ferguson Bay on the southeastern coast of Thule Island. From 1976 to 1982, Argentina maintained a naval base named Corbeta Uruguay in the lee (southern east coast) of the same island. Although the British discovered the presence of the Argentine base in 1976, protested, and tried to resolve the issue by diplomatic means, no effort was made to remove them by force until after the Falklands War. The base was eventually removed on 20 June 1982 and the installations were demolished in December of that year.\nThe territory of \"South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\" was formed in 1985; previously, both archipelagos had been governed as part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies.\nOn 10 February 2008, an earthquake of magnitude 6.5 on the Richter Scale had its epicenter south-southeast of Bristol Island. On 30 June 2008, an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 struck the region. Its epicentre was at away from Bristol Island, at a depth of .\nGeography.\nThe northernmost of the South Sandwich Islands form the Traversay Islands and Candlemas Islands groups, while the southernmost make up Southern Thule. The three largest islands\u00a0\u2013 Saunders, Montagu, and Bristol\u00a0\u2013 lie between the two. The islands\u2019 highest point is Mount Belinda () on Montagu Island. The fourth highest peak, Mount Michael () on Saunders Island has a persistent lava lake, known to occur at only eight volcanoes in the world.\nThe South Sandwich Islands are uninhabited, although an illegal permanently staffed Argentine research station was located on Thule Island from 1976 to 1982 (for details, see above). Automatic weather stations are on Thule Island and Zavodovski. To the northwest of Zavodovski Island is the Protector Shoal, a submarine volcano.\nThe South Sandwich Islands from north to south are:\nSeveral straits and passages separate the South Sandwich Islands. Forsters Passage separates Bristol Island and Southern Thule. Nelson Channel is the passage between Candlemas and Vindication Island. Douglas Strait separates Thule Island and Cook Island.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72161", "revid": "12793781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72161", "title": "Environmental determinism", "text": "Theory that a society's development is predetermined by its physical environment\nEnvironmental determinism (also known as climatic determinism or geographical determinism) is the study of how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular economic or social developmental (or even more generally, cultural) trajectories. Jared Diamond, Jeffrey Herbst, Ian Morris, and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This \"neo-environmental determinism\" school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence state-building, economic development, and institutions. While archaic versions of the geographic interpretation were used to encourage colonialism and eurocentrism, modern figures like Diamond use this approach to reject the racism in these explanations. Diamond argues that European powers were able to colonize, due to unique advantages bestowed by their environment, as opposed to any kind of inherent superiority.\nHistory.\nClassical and medieval periods.\nEarly theories of environmental determinism in Ancient China, Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome suggested that environmental features completely determined the physical and intellectual qualities of whole societies. Guan Zhong (720\u2013645 BC), an early chancellor in China, held that the qualities of major rivers shaped the character of surrounding peoples. Swift and twisting rivers made people \"greedy, uncouth, and warlike\". The ancient Greek philosopher Hippocrates wrote a similar account in his treatise \"Airs, Waters, Places\".\nIn this text, Hippocrates explained how the ethnicities of people were connected to their environment. He argued that there existed a connection between the geography surrounding people and their ethnicity. Hippocrates described the effects of different climates, customs, and diets on people and how this affected their behaviors, attitudes, as well as their susceptibility to diseases and illnesses.\nFor example, he explains the Asian race were less warlike compared to other civilizations due to their climate. He attributes this to the fact that there are \u201cno great shifts in the weather, which is neither hot nor cold but temperate\u201d and how the climate conditions allow Asians to live without shock or mental anxieties. According to Hippocrates, anxieties and shocks promote passion and recklessness in humans, but since Asians lack this, they remain feeble. This connects to the manner in which Asians are ruled, stating they do not \u201crule themselves nor are autonomous but subjects to a despot, there is no self-interest in appearing warlike.\u201d In the later chapters of his work, he contrasts this attitude to that of Europeans. He claims that laziness can be attributed as an effect of uniform climate and that \u201cEndurance of both the body and soul comes from change. Also cowardice increases softness and laziness, while courage engenders endurance and a work ethic.\u201d Since Europeans experience more fluctuations in their climate, they do not remain accustomed to their climate and are forced to endure constant change. Hippocrates claims that this is reflected in a person's character and ties that to the character of Europeans, explaining that \u201cFor this reason, those dwelling in Europe are more effective fighters.\u201d\nAccording to Hippocrates, there are also physical manifestations of environmental determinism in people. He presents the connection between the nature of the land and its people, arguing that the physique and nature of a man are formed and influenced by it. He explains one of the ways this connection is exhibited by stating, \u201cWhere the land is rich, soft, and well watered, and the waters are near the surface so that they become hot in the summer and cold in the winter, and where the climate is nice, there the men are flabby and jointless, bloated and lazy and mostly cowards.\u201d He notes the nomadic Scythians as examples of a civilization that possesses these traits. In a previous section of his text, he notes how the Scythians are flabby and bloated and that they possess the most bloated bellies of all peoples. He also comments that all males are identical and all females are identical in appearance, males with males and females with females. He attributes this to the climate conditions they live in and the fact that they experience identical summer and winter seasons. The lack of change leads them to wear the same clothes, eat the same fare, breathe the same damp air, and refrain from labor. This continuity and the lack of strong shifts in climate is what Hippocrates identifies as the cause for their appearance. Since the Scythians are not accustomed to experiencing sudden changes, they cannot develop the body or soul to endure physical activity.\u00a0 In comparison, locations \u201cwhere the land is barren, dry, harsh, and harried by storms in the winter or scorched by the sun in the summers, there one would find strong, lean, well-defined. muscular, and hairy men.\u201d These characteristics would also reflect on their character, as they would possess hard-working, intelligent, and independent natures as well as being more skilled and warlike than others.\nHippocrates also argues that the physical appearance caused by people's environments affect the reproduction and fertility of civilizations, which affects future generations. He presents the appearance and bodies of the Scythians as having a negative impact on the fertility of their civilization. Hippocrates argues that due to their bloated stomachs and \u201cextremely soft and cold lower bellies\u201d Scythian men are not eager for intercourse and due to this condition, \u201chighly unlikely to be able to satisfy his lusts.\u201d He further argues that the behavior of the Scythian men and their horseback riding customs also affected their fertility because the \u201cconstant bouncing on horseback has rendered Scythian men unfit for sex\u201d and made them infertile. Women, according to Hippocrates are also infertile because of their physical condition and because they are fat and bloated. Hippocrates claims that due to their physique, women have wombs that are too wet and \u201cincapable of absorbing a man's seed.\u201d This he explains, affects their fertility and their reproduction as well as causes other problems in the function of their reproductive system, for example \u201ctheir monthly purge is also not as it should be, but is infrequent as scanty.\u201d Due to their fat, their wombs are clogged which blocks male seed. All of these conditions and traits are evidence that supports his claim that the Scythian race is infertile and acts as an example of how the concept of environmental determinism manifests.\nWriters in the medieval Middle East also produced theories of environmental determinism. The Afro-Arab writer al-Jahiz argued that the skin color of people and livestock were determined by the water, soil, and heat of their environments. He compared the color of black basalt in the northern Najd to the skin color of the peoples living there to support his theory.\nIbn Khaldun, the Arab sociologist and polymath, similarly linked skin color to environmental factors. In his \"Muqaddimah\" (1377), he wrote that black skin was due to the hot climate of sub-Saharan Africa and not due to African lineage. He thereby challenged Hamitic theories of race that held that the sons of Ham (son of Noah) were cursed with black skin. Many writings of Ibn Khaldun were translated during the colonial era in order to advance the colonial propaganda machine.\nIbn Khaldun believed that the physical environment influenced non-physical factors in addition to skin color. He argued that soil, climate, and food determined whether people were nomadic or sedentary, and what customs and ceremonies they held. His writings may have influenced the later writings of Montesquieu during the 18th century through the traveller Jean Chardin, who travelled to Persia and described theories resembling those of Ibn Khaldun.\nWestern colonial period.\nEnvironmental determinism has been widely criticized as a tool to legitimize colonialism, racism, and imperialism in Africa, The Americas, and Asia. Environmental determinism enabled geographers to scientifically justify the supremacy of white European races and the naturalness of imperialism. The scholarship bolstered religious justifications and in some cases superseded them during the late 19th century.\nMany writers, including Thomas Jefferson, supported and legitimized African colonization by arguing that tropical climates made the people uncivilized. Jefferson argued that tropical climates encouraged laziness, relaxed attitudes, promiscuity and generally degenerative societies, while the frequent variability in the weather of the middle and northern latitudes led to stronger work ethics and civilized societies. Adolf Hitler also made use of this theory to extol the supremacy of the Nordic race.\nDefects of character supposedly generated by tropical climates were believed to be inheritable under the Lamarckian theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, a discredited precursor to the Darwinian theory of natural selection. The theory begins with the observation that an organism faced with environmental pressures may undergo physiological changes during its lifetime through the process of acclimatization. Lamarckianism suggested that those physiological changes may be passed directly to offspring, without the need for offspring to develop the trait in the same manner.\nGeographical societies like the Royal Geographical Society and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de g\u00e9ographie supported imperialism by funding explorers and other colonial proponents. Scientific societies acted similarly. Acclimatization societies directly supported colonial enterprises and enjoyed their benefits. The writings of Lamarck provided theoretical backing for the acclimatization doctrines. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique d'Acclimatation was largely founded by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\u2014son of \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a close colleague and supporter of Lamarck.\nEllen Churchill Semple, a prominent environmental determinism scholar, applied her theories in a case study which focused on the Philippines, where she mapped civilization and wildness onto the topography of the islands. Other scholars argued that climate and topography caused specific character traits to appear in a given populations. Scholars thereby imposed racial stereotypes on whole societies. Imperial powers rationalized labor exploitation by claiming that tropical peoples were morally inferior.\nThe role of environmental determinism in rationalizing and legitimizing racism, ethnocentrism and economic inequality has consequently drawn strong criticism.\nDavid Landes similarly condemns of what he terms the unscientific moral geography of Ellsworth Huntington. He argues that Huntington undermined geography as a science by attributing all human activity to physical influences so that he might classify civilizations hierarchically \u2013 favoring those civilizations he considered best.\nLate-20th-century growth of neo-environmental determinism.\nEnvironmental determinism was revived in the late-twentieth century as neo-environmental determinism, a new term coined by the social scientist and critic Andrew Sluyter. Sluyter argues that neo-environmental determinism does not sufficiently break with its classical and imperial precursors. Others have argued that in a certain sense a Darwinian approach to determinism is useful in shedding light on human nature.\nNeo-environmental determinism examines how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular trajectories of economic and political development. It explores how geographic and ecological forces influence state-building, economic development, and institutions. It also addresses fears surrounding the effects of modern climate change. Jared Diamond was influential in the resurgence of environmental determinism due to the popularity of his book \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\", which addresses the geographic origins of state formation prior to 1500 A.D.\nNeo-environmental determinism scholars debate how much the physical environment shapes economic and political institutions. Economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff argue that factor endowments greatly affected \"institutional\" development in the Americas, by which they mean the tendency to more free (democratic, free market) or unfree (dictatorial, economically restrictive) regimes.\nIn contrast, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson underscore that the geographic factors most influenced institutional development during early state formation and colonialism. They argue that geographic differences cannot explain economic growth disparities after 1500 A.D. directly, except through their effects on economic and political institutions.\nEconomists Jeffrey Sachs and John Luke Gallup have examined the direct impacts of geographic and climatic factors on economic development, especially the role of geography on the cost of trade and access to markets, the disease environment, and agricultural productivity.\nThe contemporary global warming crisis has also impacted environmental determinism scholarship. Jared Diamond draws similarities between the changing climate conditions that brought down the Easter Island civilization and modern global warming in his book \"\". Alan Kolata, Charles Ortloff, and Gerald Huag similarly describe the Tiwanaku empire and Maya civilization collapses as caused by climate events such as drought. Peter deMenocal, Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience. A scientist at the Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, writes that societal collapse due to climate change is possible today.\nEcological and geographic impacts on early state formation.\nEffects of species endowments, climate, and continental axes prior to 1500.\nIn the Pulitzer Prize winning \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" (1999), author Jared Diamond points to geography as the answer to why certain states were able to grow and develop faster and stronger than others. His theory cited the natural environment and raw materials a civilization had as factors for success, instead of popular century-old claims of racial and cultural superiority. Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.\nDiamond argues that early states located along the same latitude lines were uniquely suited to take advantage of similar climates, making it easier for crops, livestock, and farming techniques to spread. Crops such as wheat and barley were simple to grow and easy to harvest, and regions suitable for their cultivation saw high population densities and the growth of early cities. The ability to domesticate herd animals, which had no natural fear of humans, high birth rates, and an innate hierarchy, gave some civilizations the advantages of free labor, fertilizers, and war animals. The east\u2013west orientation of Eurasia allowed for knowledge capital to spread quickly, and writing systems to keep track of advanced farming techniques gave people the ability to store and build upon a knowledge base across generations. Craftsmanship flourished as a surplus of food from farming allowed some groups the freedom to explore and create, which led to the development of metallurgy and advances in technology. While the advantageous geography helped to develop early societies, the close proximity in which humans and their animals lived led to the spread of disease across Eurasia. Over several centuries, rampant disease decimated populations, but ultimately led to disease resistant communities. Diamond suggests that these chains of causation led to European and Asian civilizations holding a dominant place in the world today.\nDiamond uses the Spanish conquistadors' conquering of the Americas as a case study for his theory. He argues that the Europeans took advantage of their environment to build large and complex states complete with advanced technology and weapons. The Incans and other native groups were not as fortunate, suffering from a north\u2013south orientation that prevented the flow of goods and knowledge across the continent. The Americas also lacked the animals, metals, and complex writing systems of Eurasia which prevented them from achieving the military or biological protections needed to fight off the European threat.\nDiamond's theory has not gone without criticism.\nGeography and pre-colonial African state-building.\nThe effects of climate and land abundance on the development of state systems.\nIn his book \"States and Power in Africa\", political scientist Jeffrey Herbst argues that environmental conditions help explain why, in contrast to other parts of the world such as Europe, many pre-colonial societies in Africa did not develop into dense, settled, hierarchical societies with strong state control that competed with neighboring states for people and territory.\nHerbst argues that the European state-building experience was highly idiosyncratic because it occurred under systemic geographic pressures that favored wars of conquest \u2013 namely, passable terrain, land scarcity, and high-population densities. Faced with the constant threat of war, political elites sent administrators and armed forces from the urban centers into rural hinterlands to raise taxes, recruit soldiers, and fortify buffer zones. European states consequently developed strong institutions and capital-periphery linkages.\nBy contrast, geographic and climatic factors in pre-colonial Africa made establishing absolute control over particular pieces of land prohibitively costly. For example, because African farmers relied on rain-fed agriculture and consequently invested little in particular pieces of land, they could easily flee rulers rather than fight.\nSome early African empires, like the Ashanti Empire, successfully projected power over large distances by building roads. The largest pre-colonial polities arose in the Sudanian Savanna belt of West Africa because the horses and camels could transport armies over the terrain. In other areas, no centralized political organizations existed above the village level.\nAfrican states did not develop more responsive institutions under colonial rule or post-independence. Colonial powers had little incentive to develop state institutions to protect their colonies against invasion, having divided up Africa at the Berlin Conference. The colonizers instead focused on exploiting natural resources and exploitation colonialism.\nThe effect of disease environments.\nDr. Marcella Alsan argues the prevalence of the tsetse fly hampered early state formation in Africa. Because the tsetse virus was lethal to cows and horses, communities afflicted by the insect could not rely on the agricultural benefits provided by livestock. African communities were prevented from stockpiling agricultural surplus, working the land, or eating meat. Because the disease environment hindered the formation of farming communities, early African societies resembled small hunter-gatherer groups and not centralized states.\nThe relative availability of livestock animals enabled European societies to form centralized institutions, develop advanced technologies, and create an agricultural network. They could rely on their livestock to reduce the need for manual labor. Livestock also diminished the comparative advantage of owning slaves. African societies relied on the use of rival tribesman as slave labor where the fly was prevalent, which impeded long-term societal cooperation.\nAlsan argues that her findings support the view of Kenneth Sokoloff and Stanley Engerman that factor endowments shape state institutions.\nLlamas, chu\u00f1o and the Inca Empire.\nCarl Troll has argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allow for the elaboration of the staple food chu\u00f1o. Chu\u00f1o, which can be stored for long times, is made of potato dried at freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern Peruvian highlands. Contradicting the link between the Inca state and dried potato is that other crops such as maize can also be preserved with only sun. Troll also argued that llamas, the Incas' pack animal, can be found in their largest numbers in this very same region. It is worth considering that the maximum extent of the Inca Empire coincided with the greatest distribution of alpacas and llamas. As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building. While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire, he opposed environmental determinism, arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.\nEffects of geography on political regimes.\nNumerous scholars have argued that geographic and environmental factors affect the types of political regime that societies develop, and shape paths towards democracy versus dictatorship.\nThe disease environment.\nDaron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson have achieved notoriety for demonstrating that diseases and terrain have helped shape tendencies towards democracy versus dictatorship, and through these economic growth and development. In their book \"Why Nations Fail\", as well as a paper titled \"The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation\", the authors show that the colonial disease environment shaped the tendency for Europeans to settle the territory or not, and whether they developed systems of agriculture and labor markets that were free and egalitarian versus exploitative and unequal. These choices of political and economic institutions, they argue, shaped tendencies to democracy or dictatorship over the following centuries.\nFactor endowments.\nIn order to understand the impact and creation of institutions during early state formation, economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization. They found that the beginnings of the success or failure of American colonies were based on the specific factor endowments available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to take advantage of these factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as plantations, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development.\nFactor endowments also influenced political institutions. This is demonstrated by the plantation owning elite using their power to secure long lasting government institutions and pass legislation that leads to the persistence of inequality in society. Engerman and Sokoloff found smallholder economies to be more equitable since they discouraged an elite class from forming, and distributed political power democratically to most land-owning males. These differences in political institutions were also highly influential in the development of schools, as more equitable societies demanded an educated population to make political decisions. Over time these institutional advantages had exponential effects, as colonies with educated and free populations were better suited to take advantage of technological change during the industrial revolution, granting country wide participation into the booming free-market economy.\nEngerman and Sokoloff conclude that while institutions heavily influenced the success of each colony, no individual type of institution is the source of economic and state growth. Other variables such as factor endowments, technologies, and the creation of property rights are just as crucial in societal development. To encourage state success an institution must be adaptable and suited to find the most economical source of growth. The authors also argue that while not the only means for success, institutional development has long lasting-economic and social effects on the state.\nOther prominent scholars contest the extent to which factor endowments determine economic and political institutions.\nAmerican economists William Easterly and Ross Levine argue that economic development does not solely depend on geographic endowments\u2014like temperate climates, disease-resistant climates, or soil favorable to cash crops. They stress that there is no evidence that geographic endowments influence country incomes other than through institutions. They observe that states like Burundi are poor\u2014despite favorable environmental conditions like abundant rainfall and fertile soil\u2014because of the damage wrought by colonialism. Other states like Canada with fewer endowments are more stable and have higher per capita incomes.\nEasterly and Levine further observe that studies of how the environment directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of underdevelopment, but that does not mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly stresses the importance of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development. They find that regression results support the findings of Jared Diamond and David Landes that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.\nJeffrey B. Nugent and James A. Robinson similarly challenge scholars like Barrington Moore who hold that certain factor endowments and agricultural preconditions necessarily lead to particular political and economic organizations. Nugent and Robinson show that coffee economies in South America pursued radically different paths of political and economic development during the nineteenth century.\nSome coffee states, like Costa Rica and Colombia, passed laws like the Homestead Act of 1862. They favored smallholders, held elections, maintained small militaries, and fought fewer wars. Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like El Salvador and Guatemala produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under colonialism\u2014namely, legal statutes determining access to land, the background of the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition. Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions.\nDirect effects of geography on economic development.\nEffects of terrain on trade and productivity.\nHistorians have also noted population densities seem to concentrate on coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source. Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, technological advances, and people. They also have to rely on costly and time-consuming over-land trade, which usually results in lack of access to regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and ecological systems suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations.\nNathan Nunn and Diego Puga note that though rugged terrain usually makes farming difficult, prevents travel, and limits societal growth, early African states used harsh terrain to their advantage. The authors used a terrain ruggedness index to quantify topographic heterogeneity across several regions of Africa, while simultaneously controlling for variables such as diamond availability and soil fertility. The results suggest that historically, ruggedness is strongly correlated with decreased income levels across the globe and has negatively impacted state growth over time. They note that harsh terrain limited the flow of trade goods and decreased crop availability, while isolating communities from developing knowledge capital. However, the study also demonstrated that the terrain had positive effects on some African communities by protecting them from the slave trade. Communities that were located in areas with rugged features could successfully hide from slave traders and protect their homes from being destroyed. The study found that in these areas rugged topography produced long-term economic benefits and aided post-colonial state formation.\nEffects of climate on productivity.\nThe impact that climate and water navigability have on economic growth and GDP per capita was studied by notable scholars including Paul Krugman, Jared Diamond, and Jeffrey Sachs. By using variables to measure environmental determinism, such as climate, land composition, latitude, and the presence of infectious disease, they account for trends in worldwide economic development on local, regional and global scales. To do so, they measure economic growth with GDP per capita adjusted to purchasing power parity (PPP), while also taking into consideration population density and labor productivity.\nEconomic historians have found that societies in the Northern Hemisphere experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant transpiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones. Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital to invest in a sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of those diseases.\nClimatic determinism and colonization.\nClimatic determinism, otherwise referred to as the \"equatorial paradox,\" is an aspect of economic geography. According to this theory, about 70% of a country's economic development can be predicted by the distance between that country and the equator, and that the further from the equator a country is located, the more developed it tends to be. The theory is the central argument of Philip M. Parker's \"Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth\", in which he argues that since humans originated as tropical mammals, those who relocated to colder climates attempt to restore their physiological homeostasis through wealth-creation. This act includes producing more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, humans that remained in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase their comfort levels. Therefore, according to Parker GDP is a direct product of the natural compensation of humans to their climate.\nPolitical geographers have used climatic determinism ideology to attempt to predict and rationalize the history of civilization, as well as to explain existing or perceived social and cultural divides between peoples. Some argue that one of the first attempts geographers made to define the development of human geography across the globe was to relate a country's climate to human development. Using this ideology, many geographers believed they were able \"to explain and predict the progress of human societies\". This led to warmer climate zones being \"seen as producing less civilized, more degenerate peoples, in need of salvation by western colonial powers.\"\nEllsworth Huntington also travelled continental Europe in hopes of better understanding the connection between climate and state success, publishing his findings in \"The Pulse of Asia\", and further elaborating in \"Civilization and Climate\". Like the political geographers, a crucial component of his work was the belief that the climate of North-western Europe was ideal, with areas further north being too cold, and areas further south being too hot, resulting in lazy, laid-back populations. These ideas were powerful connections to colonialism, and may have played a role in the creation of the 'other' and the literature that many used to justify taking advantage of less advanced nations. Huntington also argued that climate can lead to the demise of even advanced civilizations through drought, food insecurity, and damages to economic production.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The upstart ABA operated in direct competition with the more established National Basketball Association throughout its existence. The second of two leagues established in the 1960s after the American Basketball League, the ABA was the more successful rival to the NBA.\nThe league started with eleven teams; the Indiana Pacers, Kentucky Colonels, Minnesota Muskies, New Jersey Americans, and Pittsburgh Pipers were placed in the Eastern Division and the Anaheim Amigos, Dallas Chaparrals, Denver Rockets, Houston Mavericks, New Orleans Buccaneers, and Oakland Oaks in the Western Division. George Mikan served as the first league commissioner and came up with the idea for the three-point shot to go along with a 30-second shot clock. Echoing the NHL, the league named a Most Valuable Player for the entire postseason rather than for just the Finals. Select investors believed they could play their way into getting an NBA franchise by way of a merger, while Mikan did not initially want to get into a bidding war with the NBA for select players.\nWhile the first years of the ABA saw uneven team management (the first two champions immediately relocated after winning the championship), the offense-oriented league managed to attract select talent from players that were either ignored by the NBA, due to perceived talent issues, or because they were not eligible to play in the league. Stars that arose from these circumstances included Roger Brown, Connie Hawkins, and Doug Moe, who each had been blackballed from the NBA due to unfounded allegations of point-shaving; Spencer Haywood, who entered the league as a \"hardship exemption\" after wanting to turn pro following his sophomore season in college; and Larry Brown, who was thought to be too small to play in the NBA.\nThe league never had a consistent national television contract, but attracted loyal followings in select markets, most notably in Indianapolis, Denver, San Antonio, Long Island, and Kentucky. The Pacers would win the most championships in league history, winning three with stars such as Mel Daniels, the first player with multiple MVP awards.\nThe ABA and NBA engaged in talks for a merger as early as 1970, but an antitrust lawsuit filed by the NBA Players Association curtailed the plans for several years. The league went after select NBA stars such as Rick Barry and Billy Cunningham to go along with luring players with a select payment plan by annuity to go along with luring respected NBA referees to the league. In the later years of the league, other stars would arise such as Dan Issel, Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, and Julius Erving. By the end of the 1975\u201376 season, the league was down to seven teams, with only six surviving long enough to be involved in merger talks. The ABA merged with the NBA in 1976, resulting in four teams (Pacers, Nuggets, Spurs, and Nets) joining the NBA. The final game was played on May 13, 1976, as the New York Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets for the final ABA championship. In 1979, adopting the practice of the ABA, the NBA introduced the three-point shot.\nAs of 2025, despite the merger of the two leagues, the NBA considers the ABA to be a separate league and its history and statistics are not included in the NBA record books. However, the Basketball Hall of Fame does recognize ABA history and statistics for inductions and honors.\nHistory.\nThe league was created as a result of numerous groups coming together in the interest of promotion in sports. Constantine \"Connie\" Seredin of Professional Sports Management (a company specializing in bringing athletes and advertisers together) had wanted to expand sports marketing and the firm came across the idea of a second pro sports league; noting that basketball had no other professional competition in the 1960s besides the NBA. Seredin called up famed basketball star George Mikan about potentially being an advisor in this theoretical league. While Mikan made no commitment, Seredin left him his phone number just in case. Not long thereafter, Seredin was called by Dennis Murphy, a marketing executive and sports fan that also happened to have called Mikan as well about a sports league. Murphy had initially come up with wanting to secure a football team in Anaheim, California, which led to a group sponsoring a doubleheader game in the city with the American Football League (AFL). But the war that the AFL had with the National Football League would soon come to a close with a merger with no chance of expansion to Anaheim. Not wanting to waste the effort of people who had money and liked sports, Murphy came up with the idea of starting a second basketball league, as it happened to be his favorite sport.\nMurphy soon talked with Bill Sharman, who had coached in the last \"second basketball league\" with the American Basketball League (ABL) (1961\u201362) and they came up with the name of the league. While Sharman could not get involved with the ABA at the time due to coaching matters, he suggested talking to Mikan along with suggesting the use of the three-point play (an ABL staple). The eventual meeting with Mikan led to his interest along with mentioning other names interested in business. Murphy initially was just interested in having a league devoted to Western cities to cut into the pro market that had only recently put NBA teams in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Seredin and Murphy later met in a meeting with potential investors that only made Murphy have doubts. But John McShane, a public relations man of McShane Associates, found common ground with Seredin to serve as a go-between for Murphy to forge an actual meeting in organizational form in Beverly Hills under the prospective name of the \"United Basketball League\". The first meeting, at the Beverly Hills Hilton, was held on December 20, 1966 (with the organization going as the \"American Basketball Association\") that had seen McShane and Seredin leak the meeting to the press to attract attention while Murphy had a few of his associates pose as potential investors. The meeting resulted in a few legitimate investors and later scheduling. It was later that Gary Davidson (an attorney in Orange County) expressed interest in joining the league, while Mark Binstein served as acting president. Don Regan, a law school associate of Davidson, also joined in. On January 31, 1967, two days prior to a potential press conference, Mikan expressed interest in potentially being league commissioner if the terms were correct. On the day of the intended press conference, the \"roll call\" of franchises were not all filled with actual buyers, as was the case with Dallas, but merely wishes. Kansas City (as envisioned by Murphy), Honolulu (as desired by McShane), and Cleveland were floated as having interest, but none would play in the league (the Kansas City team instead played for different owners in Denver). It was at this time that Seredin and McShane's proposal to be listed in publicity as founders and organizers of the league was denied despite their clear efforts in developing the league.\nEventually, an array of investors were lined up in several cities: James Ackerman &amp; Art Kim in Anaheim, Arthur J. Brown in New York (plans fell through to play in the area), the DeVoe family in Indiana, Gabe Rubin in Pittsburgh, T. C. Morrow in Houston, Mamie and Joe Gregory in Kentucky (after the franchise was first founded by Regan), Ken Davidson in Oakland, Charlie Smither (among others) in New Orleans, Robert Folsom in Dallas, Bill Ringsby in Denver, and Larry Shields in Minnesota. Another investor, in Milwaukee, was initially setup to join the original eleven cities, but that team never materialized for some unknown reason (most likely due to the later creation of the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA). Mikan agreed to be commissioner and spearheaded the use of a red-white-blue ball to go along with the three-point play. In the press conference on February 2, he stated that while they did not plan to raid the NBA for players, they would invite anyone with no contractual obligations to join and aspired to be a competitor to the league akin to General Motors competing with Ford. It was Mikan who elected to let players such as Brown, Hawkins, Moe, Tony Jackson, and Charlie Williams play in the league, stating years later in \"Loose Balls\" that having investigated their situation of being falsely implicated in gambling, each deserved a second chance in his eyes, a decision that Mikan never regretted.\nThe ABA was conceived at a time stretching from 1960 through the mid-1970s when numerous upstart leagues were challenging, with varying degrees of success, the established major professional sports leagues in the United States. Basketball was seen as particularly vulnerable to a challenge; its major league, the NBA, was the youngest of the Big Four major leagues, having only played 21 seasons to that point, and was still fending off contemporary challenging leagues (it had been less than five years since the ABL shut down); the league, often considered third or fourth in coverage when compared to baseball or football, had just 12 teams at the time the ABA was founded. According to one of the owners of the Indiana Pacers, its goal was to force a merger with the more established league. Potential investors were told that they could get an ABA franchise for half of what it cost to get an NBA expansion franchise at the time. When the merger occurred, ABA officials said their investment would more than double.\nThe ABA distinguished itself from its older counterpart with a more wide-open, flashy style of offensive play, as well as differences in rules \u2014 a 30-second shot clock (as opposed to the NBA's 24-second clock, though the ABA did switch to the 24 second shot clock for the 1975\u201376 season) and use of a three-point field goal, pioneered in the earlier ABL. Also, the ABA used a colorful red, white, and blue ball, instead of the NBA's traditional orange ball. The ABA also had several \"regional\" franchises, such as the Virginia Squires and Carolina Cougars, that played \"home\" games in several cities. The league began with the 1967\u201368 season on October 13, 1967, with Willie Porter contributing the first points scored on a tip-in for the Oakland Oaks as they defeated the Anaheim Amigos 134\u2013129.\nThe league's practice of luring players with money would spur a war with the NBA. Under the \"Dolgoff Plan\" (as first used by the Indiana Pacers), teams would pay a player a certain amount of money over a certain number of years as an annuity (for example, Jim Ard signed a $1.4 million contract with the Nets that saw him paid $250,000 in total from 1970 to 1974 while the team would put $8,000 a year for ten years where Ard would receive $1.15 million paid to him over the course of 24 years, starting in 1989). Various players, such as Dan Issel and Rick Mount, would be paid in this manner, much to the consternation of jilted executives in the NBA, who even believed the league was paying off agents to help players agree to these contracts, which in select cases was correct. Both leagues went as far as spying to keep tabs on signings. Talks of a merger were floated by 1970, with the two leagues even coming to an agreement that would've had ten ABA teams (all except Virginia) merge with the NBA while making payments to the league for ten years. However, the players association sued in the courts (with Oscar Robertson himself suing the NBA in 1970), stating that actions such as the reserve clause (as strongly defended by NBA owners like Ned Irish) were illegal. The United States Senate Antitrust Subcommittee approved the merger on September 8, 1972, but stated that the reserve clause was illegal. The two leagues soon went back to suing each other and bidding for players.\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the ABA also adopted the no-disqualification foul rule: instead of fouling out after six infractions, when a player is charged with his seventh or succeeding fouls, the opposing team attempts a free throw and retains possession.\nThe ABA also went after four of the best referees in the NBA: Earl Strom, John Vanak, Norm Drucker, and Joe Gushue, getting them to \"jump\" leagues by offering them far more in money and benefits. In Earl Strom's memoir \"Calling the Shots\", Strom conveys both the heady sense of being courted by a rival league with money to burn \u2014 and also the depression that set in the next year when he began refereeing in the ABA, with less prominent players performing in inadequate arenas, in front of very small crowds. Nevertheless, the emergence of the ABA boosted the salaries of referees just as it did the salaries of players.\nHowever, ABA teams like the Nets, Colonels, Pacers, Spurs, Nuggets, and Stars, especially in later seasons, registered higher attendance on average than most NBA teams at that time (excluding the Lakers, Knicks, Celtics, SuperSonics, and Bucks).\nThe freewheeling style of the ABA eventually caught on with fans, but the lack of a national television contract and protracted financial losses would spell doom for the ABA as an independent circuit. Before the 1975\u201376 season, the Nuggets and Nets filed applications to join the NBA, but their overtures were rejected. The Robertson suit was finally settled in February 1976 that removed a stumbling block for a merger talk. In 1976, its last year of existence, the ABA pioneered the now-popular slam dunk contest at its all-star game in Denver.\nThe league succeeded in forcing a merger with the NBA in the 1976 offseason, albeit at a high price. Four ABA teams were absorbed into the older league: the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs. As part of the merger agreement, the four teams were not permitted to participate in the 1976 NBA draft. The merger was particularly hard on the Nets; the New York Knicks were firmly established in their arena, Madison Square Garden, and would not permit the Nets to share dates there. For drawing audience away from the Knicks, the Nets were forced to pay $4.8 million to the Knicks organization. The Nets offered league superstar Julius Erving instead, but the Knicks declined. The Nets had to settle for an arena in Piscataway, New Jersey, and to meet expenses were forced to sell the contract of Erving to the Philadelphia 76ers. The four teams were also denied national television contract money for the next three seasons.\nTwo other clubs, the Kentucky Colonels and the Spirits of St. Louis, were disbanded upon the merger, with each getting a buyout: the Colonels received a one-time buyout that owner John Y. Brown, Jr. used to purchase the NBA's Buffalo Braves, while the Spirits owners (most significantly lawyer Donald Schupak) negotiated a cut of the other ABA teams' television revenues in perpetuity. This deal netted the ownership group of the Spirits over $300 million over nearly four decades due to a large increase in television revenues. In 2014, the NBA and the Spirits ownership agreed to phase out future payments in exchange for a one-time payment of $500 million, making the total value for the deal over $800 million. The seventh remaining team, the Virginia Squires, received nothing, as they had ceased operations shortly before the merger. The players from the Colonels, Spirits, and Squires were made available to NBA teams through a dispersal draft; the four teams absorbed by the NBA were allowed to choose players from this draft, albeit with all NBA teams picking by the inverse order of their win-loss percentages.\nOne of the more significant long-term contributions of the ABA to professional basketball was to tap into markets in the southeast that had been collegiate basketball hotbeds (including North Carolina, Virginia, and Kentucky). The NBA was focused on the urban areas of the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast. At the time, it showed no interest in placing a team south of Washington, D.C., other than the Atlanta metropolitan area, where the NBA's Hawks franchise relocated from St. Louis in 1968.\nCommissioners.\nNBA great Mikan was the first commissioner of the ABA, where he introduced both the 3-point line and the league's trademark red, white, and blue basketball. Mikan resigned in 1969. DeBusschere, one of the stars of the New York Knicks championship teams, moved from his job as vice president and GM of the ABA's New York Nets in 1975 to become the last commissioner of the ABA and facilitate the ABA\u2013NBA merger in 1976.\nSpencer Haywood Hardship Rule.\nOne of the primary contributions of the ABA to modern NBA was the introduction of the Spencer Haywood Hardship Rule, which would later become the framework for the current NBA draft eligibility system that allows players to declare for the NBA after being one year removed from their high school graduation. The origin of the Hardship Rule was a result of the NBA prohibiting players from joining the league until they had completed their four years of college eligibility.\nIn 1969, Spencer Haywood left the University of Detroit as a sophomore and signed with the Denver Rockets. The ABA believed that in extenuating circumstances, such as a financial situation or familial needs, players should be able to leave for professional leagues early. While the NBA and NCAA initially contested the rule, after the courts ruled in favor of Haywood playing in the ABA, the NBA followed suit and relaxed the four year rule to allow players to enter the league if they qualified as a hardship on the basis of \"financial condition...family, [or] academic record.\" Haywood paved the way for other players to enter the ABA before they had completed their collegiate careers, such as George McGinnis and Julius Erving. Today, the \"one-and-done\" rule in the NBA can be traced back to the ABA's decision to allow players to leave college early and pursue a professional career before they had completed their collegiate careers.\nSlam Dunk Contest.\nThe ABA pioneered the advent of the now popular NBA slam dunk contest at the final ABA All-Star Game in 1976. The game was held in Denver, and the owners of the ABA teams wanted to ensure that the event would be entertaining for the sellout crowd of 15,021 people. The ABA and NBA had begun to discuss a possible merger, and the ABA owners wanted to establish the viability and success of their league. The Dunk Contest operated as a means of unique entertainment that displayed the style and excitement that the ABA players brought to the game. The dunk contest was held at halftime of the All-Star game and the contestants were Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, David Thompson, Larry Kenon, and Julius Erving. The winner of the contest received $1,000 and a stereo system. Julius Erving went on to win the competition by completing the now famous free throw line dunk. The Slam Dunk Contest would make its way to the NBA in 1976\u201377 as a season-long competition for that season only, and on a permanent basis as a standalone event as part of the NBA All-Star Weekend in 1984.\nTeams.\nOf the original 11 teams, only the Kentucky Colonels and Indiana Pacers remained for all nine seasons without relocating, changing team names, or folding. However, the Denver Larks/Rockets/Nuggets, a team that had been planned for Kansas City, Missouri, moved to Denver without playing a game in Kansas City due to the lack of a suitable arena. In addition to the four surviving ABA teams, eight current NBA markets have ABA heritage: Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Memphis, Miami, Minnesota, New Orleans, and Utah all had an ABA team before their current NBA teams.\nAll-Time Team.\nIn 1997, an All-Time Team was selected by a panel of 50 ABA sportswriters, radio announcers, referees, executives, owners, and fans. The top 10 players are shown below, seven being unanimous selections with 50 votes.\nOther prominent players.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProminent coaches.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSuccession.\nIn 1999, a new league calling itself the ABA 2000 was established. The new league uses a similar red, white, and blue basketball as the old ABA, but unlike the original ABA, it does not feature players of similar caliber to the NBA, nor does it play games in major arenas or on television as the original ABA did.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72164", "revid": "10689882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72164", "title": "Cook Strait", "text": "Strait between the North and South Islands of New Zealand\nCook Strait () is a strait that separates the North and South Islands of New Zealand. The strait connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast. It is wide at its narrowest point, and has been described as \"one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world\". Regular ferry services run across the strait between Picton in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington.\nThe strait is named after James Cook, the first European commander to sail through it, in 1770. The waters of Cook Strait are dominated by strong tidal flows. The tidal flow through Cook Strait is unusual in that the tidal elevation at the ends of the strait are almost exactly out of phase with one another, so high water on one side meets low water on the other. A number of ships have been wrecked in Cook Strait with significant loss of life, such as the \"Maria\" in 1851, the \"City of Dunedin\" in 1865, the \"St Vincent\" in 1869, the \"Lastingham\" in 1884, in 1909 and in 1968.\nHistory.\nIn M\u0101ori legend, Cook Strait was discovered by Kupe the navigator. Kupe followed in his canoe a monstrous octopus called Te Wheke-a-Muturangi across Cook Strait and destroyed it in Tory Channel or at P\u0101tea.\nWhen Dutch explorer Abel Tasman first saw New Zealand in 1642, he thought Cook Strait was a bight closed to the east. He named it \"Zeehaen's Bight\", after the \"Zeehaen\", one of the two ships in his expedition. In 1769 James Cook established that it was a strait, which formed a navigable waterway.\nCook Strait attracted European settlers in the early 19th century. Because of its use as a whale migration route, whalers established bases in the Marlborough Sounds, based out of Tory Channel and Port Underwood, and also in the K\u0101piti area. From the late 1820s until the mid-1960s Arapaoa Island was a base for whaling in the Sounds. Perano Head on the east coast of the island was the principal whaling station for the area from 1911. The houses built by the Perano family are now operated as tourist accommodation.\nDuring the 1820s Te Rauparaha led a M\u0101ori migration to, and the conquest and settlement of, the Cook Strait region. In 1822 Ng\u0101ti Toa migrated to Cook Strait region, led by Te Rauparaha.\nFrom 1840 more permanent settlements sprang up, first at Wellington, then at Nelson and at Whanganui (Petre). At this period the settlers saw Cook Strait in a broader sense than today's ferry-oriented New Zealanders: for them the strait stretched from Taranaki to Cape Campbell, so these early towns all clustered around \"Cook Strait\" (or \"Cook's Strait\", in the pre-Geographic Board usage of the times) as the central feature and central waterway of the new colony.\nBetween 1888 and 1912 a Risso's dolphin named Pelorus Jack became famous for meeting and escorting ships around Cook Strait. Pelorus Jack was usually spotted in Admiralty Bay between Cape Francis and Collinet Point, near French Pass, a channel used by ships travelling between Wellington and Nelson. Pelorus Jack is also remembered after he was the subject of a failed assassination attempt. He was later protected by a 1904 New Zealand law.\nAt times when New Zealand feared invasion, various coastal fortifications were constructed to defend Cook Strait. During the Second World War, two gun installations were constructed on Wrights Hill behind Wellington. These guns could range across Cook Strait. In addition thirteen gun installations were constructed around Wellington, along the M\u0101kara coast, and at entrances to the Marlborough Sounds. The remains of most of these fortifications can still be seen.\nThe Pencarrow Head Lighthouse at the entrance from Cook Strait to Wellington Harbour was the first permanent lighthouse built in New Zealand. Its first keeper, Mary Jane Bennett, was the only female lighthouse keeper in New Zealand's history. The light was decommissioned in 1935 when it was replaced by the Baring Head Lighthouse.\nGeography.\nApproximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over lower than present day levels, Cook Strait was a deep harbour of the Pacific Ocean, disconnected from the Tasman Sea by the vast coastal plains which formed at the South Taranaki Bight which connected the North and South islands. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, eventually separating the islands and linking Cook Strait to the Tasman Sea.\nThe strait runs in a general NW-SE direction, with the South Island on the west side and North Island on the east. At its narrowest point, separate Cape Terawhiti in the North Island from Perano Head on Arapaoa Island in the Marlborough Sounds. Perano Head is actually further north than Cape Terawhiti. In good weather one can see clearly across the strait.\nThe west (South Island) coast runs along Cloudy Bay and past the islands and entrances to the Marlborough Sounds. The east (North Island) coast runs along Palliser Bay, crosses the entrance to Wellington Harbour, past some Wellington suburbs and continues another to M\u0101kara Beach.\nThe Brothers is a group of tiny islands in Cook Strait off the east coast of Arapaoa Island. North Brother island in this small chain is a sanctuary for the rare Brothers Island tuatara, while the largest of the islands is the site of the Brothers Island Lighthouse.The shores of Cook Strait on both sides are mostly composed of steep cliffs. The beaches of Cloudy Bay, Clifford Bay, and Palliser Bay shoal gently down to , where there is a more or less extensive submarine plateau. The rest of the bottom topography is complex. To the east is the Cook Strait Canyon with steep walls descending eastwards into the bathyal depths of the Hikurangi Trough. To the north-west lies the Narrows Basin, where water is deep. Fisherman's Rock in the north end of the Narrows Basin rises to within a few metres of low tide, and is marked by waves breaking in rough weather. A relatively shallow submarine valley lies across the northern end of the Marlborough Sounds. The bottom topography is particularly irregular around the coast of the South Island where the presence of islands, underwater rocks, and the entrances to the sounds, create violent eddies. The strait has an average depth of .\nIn 1855 a severe earthquake occurred on both sides of Cook Strait. In 2013 two large earthquakes measuring 6.5 and 6.6 on the Richter Scale struck Cook Strait, causing significant damage in the town of Seddon, with minor to moderate damage in Wellington.\nOceanography.\nThe waters of Cook Strait are dominated by strong tidal flows. The tidal flow through Cook Strait is unusual in that the tidal elevation at the ends of the strait are almost exactly out of phase with one another, so high water on one side meets low water on the other. This is because the main M2 lunar tide component that happens about twice per day (actually 12.42 hours) circulates anti-clockwise around New Zealand, and is out of phase at each end of the strait (see animation on the right). On the Pacific Ocean side the high tide occurs five hours before it occurs at the Tasman Sea side. On one side is high tide and on the other is low tide. The difference in sea level can drive tidal currents up to 2.5 metres per second (5 knots) across Cook Strait.\nThere are numerous computer models of the tidal flow through Cook Strait. While the tidal components are readily realisable, the residual flow is more difficult to model. Probably the most prolific oceanographer to research the strait was Ron Heath based at the N.Z. Oceanographic Institute. He produced a number of studies including analysis of tides which identified the presence of a \"virtual amphidrome\" in the region. Heath also quantified a best estimate for the time of the \"residual current\" (i.e. net current after averaging out the tidal influence) in the strait. This continues to be a topic of research with computer simulations combining with large datasets to refine the estimate.\nDespite the strong currents, there is almost zero tidal height change in the centre of the strait. Instead of the tidal surge flowing in one direction for six hours and then in the reverse direction for six hours, a particular surge might last eight or ten hours with the reverse surge enfeebled. In especially boisterous weather conditions the reverse surge can be negated, and the flow can remain in the same direction through three surge periods and longer. This is indicated on marine charts for the region. Furthermore, the submarine ridges running off from the coast complicate the ocean flow and turbulence. The substantial levels of turbulence have been compared to that observed in the Straits of Gibraltar and Seymour Narrows in British Columbia.\nMarine life.\nCook Strait is an important habitat for many cetacean species. Several dolphins (bottlenose, common, dusky) frequent the area along with killer whales and the endemic Hector's dolphins. Long-finned pilot whales often strand en masse at Golden Bay. The famous Pelorus Jack was a Risso's dolphin being observed escorting the ships between 1888 and 1912, though this species is not a common visitor to the New Zealand's waters. Large migratory whales attracted many whalers to the area in the winter. Currently, an annual survey of counting humpback whales is taken by Department of Conservation and former whalers help DOC to spot animals by using several vantage points along the strait such as on Stephens Island. Other occasional visitors include southern right whales, blue whales, sei whales and sperm whales. Giant squid specimens have been washed ashore around Cook Strait or found in the stomachs of sperm whales off Kaik\u014dura.\nA colony of male fur seals has long been established near Pariwhero / Red Rocks on the south Wellington coast. Cook Strait offers good game fishing. Albacore tuna can be caught from January to May. Broadbill swordfish, bluenose, mako sharks and the occasional marlin and white shark can also be caught.\nTransport.\nFerry services.\nRegular ferry services run between Picton in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington, operated by KiwiRail (the Interislander) and StraitNZ (Bluebridge). Both companies run services multiple times a day. Roughly two thirds of the crossing is in the strait, and the remainder mainly within the Sounds. The journey covers and takes about three and a half hours. The strait often experiences rough water and heavy swells from strong winds, especially from the south. New Zealand's position directly athwart the roaring forties means that the strait funnels westerly winds and deflects them into northerlies. As a result, ferry sailings are often disrupted and Cook Strait is regarded as one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. In 1962 the first ferry service to allow railway carriages, cars and trucks began with GMV \"Aramoana\". In 1994 the first fast-ferry service began operation across Cook Strait.\nShipwrecks and major events.\nIn 1851 the barque \"Maria\" wrecked on rocks at Cape Terawhiti, killing 28 people. In 1865 the paddle steamer \"City of Dunedin\" sank, killing 50 to 60 people. In 1869 \"St Vincent\" wrecked in Palliser Bay, killing 20 people. In 1884 \"Lastingham\" was wrecked at Cape Jackson, killing 18 people. In 1909 wrecked in Cook Strait, killing 75 people. In 1968, the , a Wellington\u2013Lyttelton ferry of the Union Company, foundered at the entrance to Wellington Harbour and capsized. Of the 610 passengers and 123 crew on board, 53 died. On 16 February 1986 the cruise ship \"Mikhail Lermontov\" struck rocks at Cape Jackson at the northern tip of the Marlborough Sounds and sank in Port Gore, with one person killed.\nIn 2006, waves resulted in the Interislander ferry DEV Aratere slewing violently and heeling to 50 degrees, the sailing took 7 hours. Three passengers and a crew member were injured, five rail wagons were toppled and many trucks and cars were heavily damaged. The journey is often regarded as one of the worst trips across the strait. Maritime NZ's expert witness Gordon Wood claimed that if the ferry had capsized most passengers and crew would have been trapped inside and would have had no warning or time to put on lifejackets.\nIn 1990 Stephen Preest made the first crossing and double crossing by hovercraft.\nIn 2005, the retired frigate was sunk in Cook Strait off the south coast of Wellington as an artificial reef.\nAir services.\nThe first aeroplane flight across Cook Strait occurred in 1920, jet aeroplane in 1946, helicopter crossing in 1956, glider crossing in 1957, balloon crossing (by Roland Parsons and Rex Brereton) in 1975, microlight aircraft in 1982, autogyros in 1999, paraglider (by Matt Standford) in 2013. In 2021 the first electric aircraft flight across Cook Strait, from Omaka Aerodrome to Wellington Airport, by Gary Freedman in a Pipistrel Alpha Electro.\nAir services began across Cook Strait in 1935. Air lines which operate or have operated flights across Cook Strait include Air New Zealand, Originair, Straits Air Freight Express, Air2there, CityJet and Sounds Air.\nProposals for a bridge or tunnel.\nProposals have been made for a bridge or tunnel across Cook Strait. As of \u00a02025[ [update]], a tunnel is estimated to cost NZ$, equivalent to 20 years of New Zealand's transport infrastructure development budget. Other obstacles include the large amount of seismic activity in Cook Strait.\nCables.\nIn 1866, the first telegraph cable was laid in Cook Strait from Lyall Bay on Wellington\u2019s south coast to Whites Bay, north of Blenheim, connecting the South Island telegraph system to Wellington. In 1879 the vessel \"Kangaroo\" laid a further telegraph cable across Cook Strait from Whanganui to Wakapuaka, near Nelson.\nIn 1964, three submarine power cables were installed across Cook Strait between Oteranga Bay in the North Island and Fighting Bay in the South Island as part of the HVDC Inter-Island link, to enable transmission of electricity between Benmore in the South island and Haywards in the North Island.\nIn 1991 three new power and two communication cables were laid to replace the original cables. Each of the replacement HVDC power cable operates at 350\u00a0kV, and can carry up to 500\u00a0MW, with Pole 2 of the link using one cable and Pole 3 using two cables. The link's total capacity was increased to 1200\u00a0MW (500\u00a0MW for Pole 2 and 700\u00a0MW for Pole 3). The cables are laid on the seabed within a legally defined zone called the cable protection zone (CPZ). The CPZ is about wide for most of its length, narrowing where it nears the terminals on each shore. Fishing activities and anchoring boats are prohibited within the CPZ. From 1994, the HVDC link across Cook Strait has been operated by Transpower.\nFibre optic cables carry telecommunications across Cook Strait, used by New Zealand's main telecommunication companies for domestic and commercial traffic and by Transpower for control of the HVDC link. In 2002 two further communications cables were laid.\nIn May 2025, Transpower announced that it was planning for replacement of all three existing Cook Strait HVDC cables laid in 1991. The forecast cost of replacement was $NZD 1.4 billion and the project was scheduled for completion by 2031. The replacement plan included adding a fourth cable to increase inter-island transmission capacity and resilience, together with enhancements to the cable terminal stations on either side of Cook Strait.\nTidal power.\nCook Strait has been identified as a potentially excellent source of tidal energy.\nIn April 2008, Neptune Power was granted a resource consent to install a $10\u00a0million experimental underwater tidal stream turbine capable of producing one megawatt. The turbine was designed in Britain, and was to be built in New Zealand and placed in of water, due south of Sinclair Head, in waters known as the \"Karori rip\". The company claimed there is enough tidal movement in Cook Strait to generate 12 GW of power, more than one-and-a-half times New Zealand's current requirements. In practice, only some of this energy could be harnessed. As of October 2016, this turbine had not been built and the Neptune Power website is a placeholder with no further announcements.\nOn the other side of the strait, Energy Pacifica applied for resource consent to install up to 10 marine turbines, each able to produce up to 1.2 MW, near the Cook Strait entrance to Tory Channel. The company claimed that Tory Channel was an optimal site with a tidal current speed of and the best combination of bathymetry and accessibility to the electricity network. However, despite being validated by computer modelling, no project was forthcoming.\nSwimming.\nAccording to oral tradition, the first woman to swim Cook Strait was Hine Poupou. She swam from Kapiti Island to d'Urville Island with the help of a dolphin. Other M\u0101ori accounts tell of at least one swimmer who crossed the strait in 1831. In modern times, the strait was swum by Barrie Devenport in 1962. Lynne Cox was the first woman to swim it, in 1975. The most prolific swimmer of the strait is Philip Rush, who has crossed eight times, including two double crossings. Aditya Raut was the youngest swimmer at 11 years. Caitlin O'Reilly was the youngest female swimmer and youngest New Zealander at 12 years. Pam Dickson was the oldest swimmer at 55 years. John Coutts was the first person to swim the strait in both directions. By 2010, 74 single crossings had been made by 65 individuals, and three double crossings had been made by two individuals (Philip Rush and Meda McKenzie). In March 2016, Marilyn Korzekwa became the first Canadian and oldest woman, at 58 years old, to swim the strait.\nCrossing times by swimmers are largely determined by the strong and sometimes unpredictable currents that operate in the strait. In 1980 the oceanographer Ron Heath published an analysis of currents in Cook Strait using the tracks of swimmers. This was from a time when detailed measurement of ocean currents was technologically difficult.\nIn 1984 Philip Rush swam the strait both ways. In 1984 Meda McKenzie became the first woman to swim the strait both ways.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the father of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII, and was thus the maternal grandfather of Queen Elizabeth I. By Henry VIII, he was made a Knight of the Garter in 1523 and was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Rochford in 1525, and in 1529, he was further ennobled as Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond.\nOrigins.\nHe was born in about 1477 at Hever Castle in Kent, the son of Sir William Boleyn (1451\u20131505) of Blickling in Norfolk (purchased by Sir William's father Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, a wealthy mercer who served as Lord Mayor of London) by his wife Margaret Butler (1454\u20131539), a daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond.\nMarriage and issue.\nHe married Elizabeth Howard, eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey by his wife Elizabeth Tilney. Five children are attested, only three of whom survived childhood: \nDiplomatic career.\nIn his youth, Thomas Boleyn was active in the court of Henry VII. He attended the wedding of Prince Arthur with Catherine of Aragon. In 1503, he was part of Princess Margaret Tudor\u2019s escort, to Scotland, to marry King James IV. He was created a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Henry VIII in 1509. In February 1511, Boleyn took part in the Westminster Tournament, held to celebrate the birth of Henry, Duke of Cornwall. He was paired with Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset in costumes featuring emblems of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.\nHis appointment in 1512 as ambassador to the Low Countries brought him into contact with the regent Archduchess Margaret of Austria. Like Thomas, Margaret of Austria spoke French and Latin and they got along well enough for her to accept his daughter Anne as a maid of honour.\nThrough his ability and the connections of his extended family, Thomas Boleyn became one of Henry VIII's leading diplomats. Known appointments and missions included:\nTitles obtained.\nBoleyn was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1523.\nBoleyn's claim to his other titles derived from his mother, Margaret Butler who was the younger daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond. Thomas Butler, as an Irish peer, should only have sat in the Parliament of Ireland. However, as a personal friend of Henry VII he was summoned to the English parliament in November 1488 as \"Thomas Ormond de Rochford, \"chevaler\"\". At this time, he was already 8th Earl of Carrick and 7th Earl of Ormond.\nIn English law, matrilineal descent is not considered valid for earldoms, and in Brehon law, then largely still in use in Ireland, new leaders were chosen by election. These customs were, in Boleyn's case, outweighed by a more important consideration \u2013 he was the father of two daughters. Henry VIII had affairs first with Boleyn's elder daughter Mary, then with his younger daughter, Anne. Boleyn's ambition was so considerable that unsubstantiated rumours had it that he allowed his wife to have an affair with the king, but those rumours were intended to steer the king away from marrying Anne, and even suggested that she was his own daughter. When it was claimed that Henry had had an affair with both Anne's sister and mother, the king replied to the rumours, \"Never with the mother.\"\nIn 1525, Henry VIII became enamoured of Anne and began pursuing her. Her father was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Rochford on 18 June 1525. The title referred to the \"barony\" of Rochford supposedly created in 1488 for his grandfather. The title had fallen into abeyance as Ormond had died without any male heir in 1515. Boleyn is often thought of as a power hungry, ambitious and scheming man who sacrificed his daughters for personal gain, but his biographer, Lauren Mackay, has argued that he enjoyed a highly successful career as an ambassador and courtier years before his daughters caught the King's eye. As Henry's passion for Anne intensified, so did her father's titles, though these rewards were not solely due to Anne but also Boleyn's own merit. Henry pressured the main claimant to the earldom of Ormond, Piers Butler, to renounce all his claims to the titles in 1529. Piers Butler was rewarded by being created Earl of Ossory five days later.\nBoleyn's claims to the Earldom of Wiltshire also depended upon his Irish relatives. This time, he had to go back to his maternal great-grandfather, James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, to establish a claim. While James Butler was indeed the 1st Earl of Wiltshire (of the third creation), on 1 May 1461 he lost his titles and his life when he was executed by the victorious Yorkists. The title was subsequently revived (in fourth and fifth creations) and bestowed on people unrelated to the Butlers of Ormond. This did not prevent the creation of the earldom for the 6th time. On 8 December 1529 Thomas Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, was created Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond.\nAlso on 8 December 1529, the Earl of Wiltshire's only surviving son, George, was granted the courtesy title of Viscount Rochford. His title of Viscount, although initially a courtesy title, ceased to be a mere courtesy title sometime before 13 July 1530. On 17 May 1536, Lord Rochford was executed for treason, and all his titles were forfeited. His widow, Jane, Viscountess Rochford, however, continued to use the title after her husband's death. Lady Rochford was herself attainted for treason and beheaded at Tower Green (not Tower Hill) within the Tower of London on 13 February 1542 with Henry VIII's fifth wife, Queen Catherine Howard.\nBoleyn was appointed Lord Privy Seal in 1530. In 1532, his daughter Anne was granted a peerage, being created Marquess of Pembroke in her own right, before marrying Henry the following year and becoming queen consort. During his daughter's reign, Boleyn held immense power in the court, but Anne failed to give Henry a son, and instead had a daughter called Elizabeth and two miscarriages. Boleyn's other daughter Mary married a soldier called William Stafford in 1534, that created a family scandal leading to her banishment from court.\nBoleyn acquiesced in Anne's judicial execution and that of her brother Lord Rochford when Henry discarded her in favour of his third wife, Queen Jane Seymour. He served on the jury of four of the men that were accused of having adultery with his daughter, but was spared of judging his children at their trials.\nAt this point Boleyn was replaced as Lord Privy Seal and left in disgrace until his death a few years later. He suffered a final indignity when the claims of Piers Butler to the Earldom of Ormond were recognized and he again became Earl of Ormond from 22 January 1538. There were two earls of Ormond in the Kingdom until his death on 12 March 1539, less than a year after his wife Elizabeth Boleyn.\nDeath and burial.\nHe died at Hever Castle on 12 March 1539 and was buried in St. Peter's Church, Hever, where survives his elaborate monumental brass. He is depicted dressed in full robes wearing the insignia of a Knight of the Garter, with the Badge on his left breast and the Garter around his left knee. His head rests on a helm surmounted by a crest of \"a falcon displayed\" (his daughter's heraldic badge) and his feet rest on a griffin. The inscription reads: \"Here lieth Sir Thomas Bullen, Knight of the Order of the Garter, Erle of Wilscher and Erle or Ormunde, which decessed the 12th dai of Marche in the iere of our Lorde 1538\".\nIn popular culture.\nThomas Boleyn has been portrayed by Sir Michael Hordern in \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" (1969), by Benjamin Whitrow in \"Henry VIII\", and by Jack Shepherd and Mark Rylance in the 2003 and 2008 film versions of \"The Other Boleyn Girl\", respectively. The 2007 Showtime series \"The Tudors\" has Nick Dunning in the role depicting him as ambitious, cunning and devious, constantly working to curry favour for his family against everyone else and always willing to \"motivate\" his daughter, Anne, lest Henry lose interest in her. David Robb played Boleyn as a constantly furious, irascible schemer in \"Wolf Hall\".\nStyles and honours.\nNote: on 22 February 1538, the earldom of Ormond was restored to Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an exception to the general rule that the person who actually creates a work is the legally-recognized author of that work.\nIn the United States, United Kingdom, and several other jurisdictions, if a work is created by an employee as part of their job duties, the employer is considered the legal author or first owner of copyright. In some countries, this is known as corporate authorship. The entity serving as an employer may be a corporation or other legal entity, an organization, or an individual.\nThe work for hire doctrine originated in United States copyright law, but other countries have adopted similar legal principles. In the jurisprudence of the United Kingdom and India, the hiring party is referred to as the first owner of copyright.\nIn the United States.\nDefinition.\nSince the passage of the Copyright Act of 1976, a \"work made for hire\" has been defined in the copyright statute as either:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n(1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or\n(2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.\nThe United States Copyright Office refers to the person or entity for whom the work is created as the \"hiring party\". On copyright registrations, the hiring party may be referred to as an \"employer for hire.\"\nHistory.\nEarly doctrine and the Copyright Act of 1909.\nThe work for hire doctrine was first recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.\" (1903), a case regarding the copyrightability of advertisements created by employees of a lithography company. The Court upheld the employer's ownership of the works, implicitly recognizing that works created by employees in the course of their duties could be owned by the employer.\nThe doctrine was later codified in the Copyright Act of 1909: \"...the word 'author' shall include an employer in the case of works made for hire.\" Although the 1909 Act did not explicitly define the term \"work made for hire\", courts began to apply what became known as the \"instance and expense\" test. According to this standard, if a work was created at the request and cost of the hiring party, that party was presumed to own the copyright. In addition, the Act did not expressly address commissioned works, which left a broad scope for interpretation. Courts extended the doctrine to cover not only employees but also independent contractors, particularly in industries like illustration and music publishing.\nThe \"teacher exception\", an exception to the work-for-hire doctrine for faculty members at colleges and universities, was articulated in a series of court cases under the 1909 Act. For example, in \"Williams v. Weisser\" (1969), UCLA anthropology professor B.J. Williams successfully asserted common-law copyright in the content of his lectures against a company that was selling lecture notes to his students. In justifying Williams' copyright ownership of the lecture contents, the court explained: \"No reason has been suggested why a university would want to retain ownership in a professor's expression. Such retention would be useless except possibly... for making it difficult for the teacher to give the same lectures, should he change jobs.\" It also cited precedent from the English court system, including the cases \"Abernethy v. Hutchinson\" and \"Caird v. Sime\", establishing that professors and lecturers held common-law copyright to their lecture materials.\nUnder the 1909 Act, copyrights lasted for an initial term of 28 years, but could be renewed for another 28 years. For most works, even if an author had assigned all of their rights to another entity, such as a publisher or record company, during the first term, the copyright would automatically revert to the author at the beginning of the renewal term. In the case of works made for hire, there was no automatic reversion, and the renewal copyright vested in the current owner of the copyright, whether the original hiring party or someone who had obtained the copyright from them.\n1960s\u201370s copyright law revision.\n Films and collective works such as periodicals were among the kinds of works proposed to be eligible under the specially-commissioned prong of the revised work-for-hire definition, owing to the large numbers of people involved in their creation.\nThe work-for-hire doctrine was revamped during the copyright law revision efforts of the 1960s, which culminated in the Copyright Act of 1976. After extensive negotiations supervised by Congress and the Copyright Office, representatives of authors, composers, book and music publishers, and motion picture studios settled on the two-pronged approach now enshrined in the 1976 Act, which encompasses both works made by employees and certain types of specially ordered and commissioned works:\nThe question of whether each type of work should be eligible to be commissioned as a work made for hire hinged on the benefits and drawbacks of making them subject to the author's right to terminate a transfer of copyright. Introduced in the 1976 Act as a spiritual successor to the automatic reversion of renewal copyright, the termination right allows authors to reclaim copyrights to their works if they originally owned the copyrights. This provision does not apply to works originally created under work-for-hire arrangements.\nDuring these negotiations, each of the nine categories was proposed by a particular copyright-based industry. Works in these categories tended to be done by freelance authors at the instance, direction, and risk of a publisher or producer, and it was argued that it would be unfair to allow such authors to terminate assignments of rights. Additionally, motion pictures and collective works were customarily created by large groups of people, and companies argued that allowing rights in these works to revert to individual contributors would risk fragmenting ownership and jeopardizing the companies' long-term ability to commercialize the works.\nSound recording debate.\nAlthough copyright protection for sound recordings was being contemplated contemporaneously with the mid-1960's debate over works made for hire, they were never proposed or considered for inclusion as a category in the specially ordered or commissioned work made for hire provision. Former Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters speculated that \"record companies did not seek to include sound recordings\" among these categories because they were typically produced in recording studios where record companies exercised considerable control over the production process. This allowed record companies to assert that featured artists were \"employees\" creating the sound recordings in the course of an employment relationship, satisfying the first prong of the 1976 work-for-hire definition.\nIn November 1999, a work for hire\u2013related amendment was inserted into the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999, adding sound recordings to the list of categories that could qualify as specially commissioned works made for hire. This resulted in backlash from recording artists, who voiced concern that the amendment would strip them of their termination rights in sound recordings transferred to record labels. Record companies argued that it was a technical amendment that merely clarified how existing law applied to industry practice, since the majority of sound recordings would have already qualified as contributions to collective works (i.e. albums). However, in a 2000 testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Peters predicted that the amendment might \"prove to be anything but technical\" if the music industry shifted to newer distribution models in which individual tracks could be unbundled from albums and downloaded separately.\nIn August 2000, the Recording Industry Association of America, representing record labels, and the Recording Artists' Coalition and other groups representing recording artists jointly agreed to recommend the repeal and retroactive cancellation of the work-for-hire amendment. Congress passed the Work Made for Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000, which repealed the prior amendment and directed the courts and the Copyright Office to interpret the law as if neither the amendment nor its repeal had ever happened.\nWorks created by employees.\nIf a work is created by an employee, the first prong of the work-for-hire definition applies. The determination of whether an individual is an employee for the purposes of the work made for hire doctrine is determined under the common law of agency, in which a court looks to a multitude of factors to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists. To help determine who is an employee, the Supreme Court in \"Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid\" identified certain factors that characterize an employer\u2013employee relationship as defined by agency law:\nTeacher exception.\nThe application of the law to materials such as lectures, textbooks, and academic articles produced by teachers is somewhat unclear. The near-universal practice in education has traditionally been to act on the assumption that they were \"not\" work for hire.\nA number of court cases under the 1909 Copyright Act established the \"teacher exception\", providing that works created by university faculty were not considered works made for hire, even though they were created within the scope of their employment. Whether the teacher exception has been preserved under the 1976 Act has been highly debated, however. According to Dave Hansen, \"Despite the massive number of copyrighted works authored by university faculty after the 1976 Act (well over a hundred million scholarly articles alone, not to mention books and other creative works), we have seen very few cases addressing this particular issue.\"\nProfessor Elizabeth Townsend-Gard argues that the teacher exception has been \"subsumed by a work-for-hire doctrine that the Supreme Court's definition of employment in \"CCNV v. Reid\" places teachers' materials under the scope of employment.\" However, many universities continue to treat works created by faculty as the intellectual property of their individual creators as a matter of academic tradition. Some universities, such as Yale, acknowledge that federal law makes these scholarly writings works for hire by default, but disclaim ownership of them with some exceptions.\nSeparated rights in film and television.\nThe Writers Guild of America, East and West have negotiated for a system of \"separated rights\" for screenwriters employed under WGA contracts. Even though screenplays and teleplays created under union contracts are legally works made for hire, certain rights may be transferred to the screenwriter under certain conditions.\nBusiness owners and startups.\nIn \"Woods v. Resnick\" (2010), the Western District of Wisconsin found that a business owner is neither an employee nor an independent contractor for copyright purposes. Since \"an owner has an inherent right to control the business\", the owner cannot be considered an agent, let alone an employee, so the work for hire doctrine does not apply to them. By contrast, the \"Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices\" states that \"senior officers or owners of organizations may be considered employees if they prepared a work while acting within the scope of their duties,\" so such works could be considered works made for hire.\nWhere startup technology companies are concerned, some courts have considered that the traditional factors for finding that an author is an \"employee\" can be less important than in more-established companies, for example if the employee works remotely and is not directly supervised, or if the employee is paid entirely in equity without benefits or tax withholding.\nVolunteers and unpaid interns.\nAccording to the \"Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices\", \"a work created by an individual volunteer(s) may or may not be considered a work made for hire, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case.\" The law firm Telios Law cautions that works created by unpaid volunteers and interns are generally \"not\" works made for hire, citing the case \"Hubay v. Mendez\" (2020). The case centered on the ownership of photographs taken by an unpaid volunteer during a trip organized by a nonprofit. In a judgment, the district court wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...the inescapable fact is that the \"work made for hire\" doctrine does not apply here. Instead, that doctrine applies only to works produced by employees or, if a written contract exists, independent contractors. An unpaid volunteer for a nonprofit organization is neither. Alternatively, applying the familiar Reid factors, the Court finds that Mr. Losieniecki was not operating as the equivalent of an employee under the \"work made for hire\" doctrine, and so owns the photographs on that basis, as well.\nAnalogy to works of the United States government.\nWorks created by officers and employees of the United States federal government as part of their official duties are not subject to copyright protection in the United States. House Report 94-1476, published in connection with the Copyright Act of 1976, explains that \"although the wording of the definition of 'work of the United States Government' differs somewhat from that of the definition of 'work made for hire,' the concepts are intended to be construed in the same way.\" Cases regarding the status of works prepared by employees of the U.S. government have been cited in work-for-hire cases: for example, in \"Williams v. Weisser\", a case establishing the teacher exception, the court discussed \"Sherrill v. Grieves\", in which a book written by a professor at a U.S. Army officers' school for a course he was teaching was held not to be a \"publication of the United States Government\" under the Copyright Act of 1909.\nCommissioned works by non-employees.\nIf a work is created by an independent contractor or freelancer, the work may be considered a work for hire \"only\" if all of the following conditions are met:\nIn other words, mutual agreement that a work is a work for hire is not enough. Any agreement not meeting all of the above criteria is not a valid work for hire agreement and all rights to the work will remain with the creator. Further, courts have held that the agreement must be negotiated, though not signed, before the work begins. \nAccording to case law, retroactive contractual designation as a work for hire is not permitted. Furthermore, a valid work-made-for-hire agreement must be signed by \"both\" parties (the creator of the work and the commissioning party who is to be considered the author).\nWhen relying on agreements in which creators transfer rights to a hiring party (copyright transfer agreement), a hiring party often finds that it has only limited scope to alter, update, or transform the work. For example, a motion picture may hire dozens of creators of copyrightable works (e.g., music scores, scripts, sets, sound effects, costumes) any one of which would require repeated agreements with the creators if conditions for showing the film or creating derivatives of it changed. Failing to reach agreement with any one creator could prevent the showing of the film entirely. To avoid this scenario, producers of motion pictures and similar works require that all contributions by non-employees be works made for hire.\nOn the other hand, a work for hire agreement is less desirable for creators than a copyright transfer agreement. Under work for hire, the commissioning party owns all rights from the very start even if the contract is breached, whereas under a transfer of rights, the creator can hold back the rights until all terms of the contract are fulfilled. Holding back the rights can be a forceful tool when it is necessary to compel a commissioning party to fulfill its obligations.\nCommissioned works created by companies.\nEven works created on commission by one business entity for another can be recognized as works made for hire. In \"Brattleboro Publishing Co. v. Winmill Publishing Corp.\" (1966), the Second Circuit ruled that an advertisement created by a newspaper for its client was a work made for hire. The \"Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices\" provides a modern example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lighthouse Books Inc. is the author of a textbook. The company hired Nous Traduisons Inc. to translate this work from English into French. Before Nous Traduisons began working on this project, the parties signed a written agreement stating that Nous Traduisons would translate the textbook for Lighthouse Books as a work made for hire. The work satisfies the second part of the statutory definition, because a translation is one of the nine categories of works that may be specially ordered or commissioned and because the parties signed a written agreement specifying that the work would be created for Lighthouse Books as a work made for hire. In the application to register this work, Lighthouse Books, Inc. should be named as the author of the translation and the work made for hire box should be checked \u201cyes.\u201d\nTermination of copyright transfers.\nAn author has the inalienable right to terminate a copyright transfer 35 years after agreeing to permanently relinquish the copyright. However, according to the US Copyright Office, Circular 9 \"the termination provisions of the law do not apply to works made for hire.\" These restrictions, in both the work for hire doctrine and the right of termination, exist out of recognition that artists frequently face unequal bargaining power in their business dealings. Nonetheless, failure to secure a work-for-hire agreement by commissioning organizations can create difficult situations. One such example is the artist Raymond Kaskey's 1985 statue \"Portlandia\", an iconic symbol of the city of Portland, Oregon. Unlike most works of public art, Kaskey has put strong prohibitions on the use of images of the statue, located atop the main entrance to the famous Portland Building. He sued Paramount Pictures for including shots of the statue in the Madonna motion picture \"Body of Evidence\". As a result, it is nearly impossible to film portions of one of downtown Portland's most vibrant neighborhoods, and the city has lost out on the potential to create merchandise and souvenirs from one of its most iconic landmarks.\nAn author can grant his or her copyright (if any) to the hiring party. However, if not a work made for hire, the author or the author's heirs may exercise their right to terminate the grant. Termination of a grant cannot be effective until 35 years after the execution of the grant or, if the grant covers the right of publication, no earlier than 40 years after the execution of the grant or 35 years after publication under the grant (whichever comes first).\nRelationship to author accreditation.\nAccreditation has no impact on work for hire in the US. The actual creator may or may not be publicly credited for the work, and this credit does not affect its legal status. States that are party to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works recognize separately copyrights and moral rights, with moral rights including the right of the actual creators to publicly identify themselves as such, and to maintain the integrity of their work.\nFor example, Microsoft hired many programmers to develop the Windows operating system, which is credited simply to Microsoft Corporation. By contrast, Adobe Systems lists many of the developers of Photoshop in its credits. In both cases, the software is the property of the employing company. In both cases, the actual creators have moral rights. Similarly, newspapers routinely credit news articles written by their staff, and publishers credit the writers and illustrators who produce comic books featuring characters such as Batman or Spider-Man, but the publishers hold copyrights to the work. However, articles published in academic journals, or work produced by freelancers for magazines, are not generally works created as a work for hire, which is why it is common for the publisher to require the copyright owner, the author, to sign a \"copyright transfer\", a short legal document transferring specific author copyrights to the publisher. In this case the authors retain those copyrights in their work not granted to the publisher.\nIn other countries.\nSome other countries have laws governing the initial copyright ownership of commissioned works or of works created within the scope of an employee's duties:\nCommonwealth countries.\nUnited Kingdom.\nUnder the copyright law of the United Kingdom, the first owner of copyright in a work may be the employer of the person who created it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Where a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, or a film, is made by an employee in the course of his employment, his employer is the first owner of any copyright in the work subject to any agreement to the contrary.\u2014\u200a\nThe expression \"in the course of employment\" is not defined in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, but in settling disputes, UK courts usually evaluate whether the employee created the work under a \"contract of service\" (e.g. as an employee) or a \"contract for services\" (e.g. as a freelancer or independent contractor). This statute has been compared to the work for hire doctrine in the United States.\nThere is currently no provision for initial ownership of copyright in commissioned works to vest in the hiring party; however, prior to 1 August 1989, \"the copyright in photographs, portraits and engravings (and only those types of work) which were created as a result of a commission were owned by the commissioner.\" Under current law, the first owner of copyright in any commissioned work is the person or organization that created it, but there may be an implied non-exclusive license for the hiring party to use the work for the purpose for which it was commissioned.\nCanada.\nSection 13 of the Canadian \"Copyright Act\" provides that the first owner of the copyright in a work is typically the author, except that the copyright for a work made in the course of employment initially vests in the author's employer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Where the author of a work was in the employment of some other person under a contract of service or apprenticeship and the work was made in the course of his employment by that person, the person by whom the author was employed shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, be the first owner of the copyright, but where the work is an article or other contribution to a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical, there shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, be deemed to be reserved to the author a right to restrain the publication of the work, otherwise than as part of a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical.\u2014\u200a\nPrior to June 29, 2012, Section 13(2) provided that the first owner of the copyright in commissioned engravings, photographs, and portraits was the person who paid for the works to be made:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Where, in the case of an engraving, photograph or portrait, the plate or other original was ordered by some other person and was made for valuable consideration, and the consideration was paid, in pursuance of that order, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the person by whom the plate or other original was ordered shall be the first owner of the copyright.\u2014\u200a\nThis provision was repealed by the \"Copyright Modernization Act\", which received royal assent on June 29, 2012.\nIndia.\nAs in the UK, the work for hire doctrine in India is based on the concept of the \"first owner of copyright\". Under section 17 of the Copyright Act, 1957, the first owner of the copyright in a work is the author, except in the following cases:\nEthiopia.\nUnder the \"Proclamation No. 410/2004 on Copyright and Neighboring Rights Protection\", Article 21/4 (Federal Negarit Gazeta):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Where the work is a work created by an author employed or Commissioned by a person in the course of his employment or contract of service, unless agreed otherwise, the original owner of the rights shall be the employer or the person who commissioned the work.\nJapan.\nArticle 15 of the Japanese Copyright Act (Act No. 48 of May 6, 1970) provides that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf a corporation (or other employer) is deemed the author of a work, the copyright, as well as the moral rights of the author, are vested in the corporation. For a work other than a computer program to be deemed a \"work made for hire\", it must be published in the name of the corporation, with the corporation identified as the author. This requirement does not apply to computer programs because many programs are created without the intention of being published.\nPhilippines.\nThe copyright law of the Philippines provides for allocation of copyright ownership between employees and employers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the case of work created by an author during and in the course of his employment, the copyright shall belong to:\n(a) The employee, if the creation of the object of copyright is not a part of his regular duties even if the employee uses the time, facilities and materials of the employer.\n(b) The employer, if the work is the result of the performance of his regularly-assigned duties, unless there is an agreement, express or implied, to the contrary.\u2014\u200a\nHowever, when a work is \"commissioned by a person other than an employer of the author\", the law provides the client with ownership of the physical copy of the work, but the copyright to the work remains with the creator unless there is a written agreement to the contrary. (8293/2015 Section 178.4)\nSouth Korea.\nThe official English translation of the copyright law of South Korea uses the term \"work made for hire\" for works prepared by employees in the course of their employment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The authorship of a work made for hire which is made by an employee of a legal person, etc. during the course of his duties and is made public under the name of such a legal person, etc. as the author shall be attributed to that legal person, etc., unless otherwise stipulated in the contract or work regulation, etc.: Provided, That in cases of a computer program work (hereinafter referred to as \"program\"), being made public is not required.\u2014\u200a\nArticle 41 provides that the copyright term of a work made for hire lasts for 70 years after it has been made public, or for 70 years after its creation if it was not made public within the first 50 years since its creation.\nCopyright duration.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States a \"work for hire\" (published after 1978) receives copyright protection until 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever comes first. This differs from the standard U.S. copyright term, life of the author plus 70 years, because the \"author\" of a work for hire is often not an actual person, in which case the standard term would be unlimited, which is unconstitutional. Works published prior to 1978 have no differentiation in copyright term between works made for hire and works with recognized individual creators.\nEuropean Union.\nIn the European Union, even if a Member State provides for the possibility of a legal person to be the original rightholder, then the duration of protection is in general the same as the copyright term for a personal copyright: i.e., for a literary or artistic work, 70 years from the death of the human author, or in the case of works of joint authorship, 70 years from the death of the last surviving author. If the natural author or authors are not identified, nor become known subsequently, then the copyright term is the same as that for an anonymous or pseudonymous work, i.e. 70 years from publication for a literary or artistic work; or, if the work has not been published in that time, 70 years from creation. (Copyright durations for works created before 1993 may be subject to transitional arrangements.)\nAn exception is for scientific or critical editions of works in the public domain. Per article 70 of the German copyright law, editions as the result of scholarly or scientific analysis have a copyright length of 25 years. Therefore, the editor of an urtext score of an opera by Beethoven would only receive 25 years of protection, \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nCopyright codes of various countries pertaining to Work For Hire:"}

A player that spends more time than the time control allows is penalized, usually by the loss of the game. Time pressure (or time trouble or \"Zeitnot\") is the situation where one player has very little time on their clock to complete their remaining moves.\nClassification.\nThe amount of time given to each player to complete their moves will vary from game to game. However, most games tend to change the classification of tournaments according to the length of time given to the players.\nIn chess, various classification schemes are used. FIDE defines time controls based on the sum of the amount of time allotted to each player, plus the increment per move times 60. Any time control in which this sum is at least 60 minutes (120 minutes at the master level) is classical; any time control in which the sum is less than 60 but more than 10 minutes is rapid; any time control with a sum at or less than 10 minutes is blitz. However, both Lichess and Chess.com consider 10 minute games to be rapid rather than blitz. In addition, both sites have a separate bullet category for games in which less than 3 minutes are given to each player; Lichess additionally has hyperbullet (\u226430s) and ultrabullet (\u226415s) categories.\nIn Go, anything under twenty minutes could be considered \"blitz\".\nMethodology.\nThe exact approach to using a game clock to regulate games varies considerably.\nSudden death.\nThis is the simplest methodology. Each player is assigned a fixed amount of time for the whole game. If a player's main time expires, they generally lose the game.\nOvertime formats.\nHere the game time is separated into two basic domains: the main time and the overtime. To switch between the two requires some trigger event, often the expiration of the main time. In chess, reaching a fixed number of moves can trigger the gain of a fixed amount of extra time. This usually occurs in long games after the 40th move: e.g. 120 minutes to complete the first 40 moves, and another 30 minutes added to the leftover 120 minutes to complete the rest of the game.\nPenalty formats.\nSuch methods exact a points penalty, or fine, on the player who breaches their time limit. One example occurs in Go, where the Ing Rules enforce fines on breaches of main time and overtime periods. The rules may also provide for a sudden death time control in addition to the penalty. In tournament Scrabble, the time control is standardized to 25 minutes per side with a 10-point penalty for each minute or part thereof that is used in excess, so that overstepping the allotted time by 61 seconds carries a 20-point penalty; a player who oversteps by 10 minutes automatically loses; in this case, their opponent is given enough additional points to win by one point, if they were not already in the lead at that time.\nHourglass.\nEach player's clock starts with a specified time (such as one minute or ten minutes). While one player is deciding a move, their clock time decreases and their opponent's clock time increases. This is analogous to an hourglass: sand empties from one container and fills the other. The sum of both clocks always remains the same, and slow moves give extra time to the opponent. There is no maximum amount of time allotted for a game with this timing method; if both players play quickly enough, the game will continue until its natural end.\nUse of this time control is uncommon.\nGame formats.\nGo.\nByo-yomi.\nThis timing method is also used in shogi. The word is borrowed from Japanese; the term literally means \"counting the seconds\", or more generally, \"countdown\".\nAfter the main time is depleted, a player has a certain number of periods (for example five periods, each of thirty seconds). If a move is completed before the time expires, the time period resets and restarts the next turn. If a move is not completed within a time period, the time period will expire, and the next time period begins. This is written as maintime + number of byo-yomi time periods of byo-yomi time period. Using up the last period means that the player has \"lost on time\". In some systems, such as certain Go title matches, there is no main time; instead, the time used is rounded \"up\" to the nearest whole increment, such as one minute, and the actual counting of time occurs toward the end of one player's time.\nA typical time control is \"60 minutes + 30 seconds byo-yomi\", which means that each player may make as many or as few moves as they choose during their first 60 minutes of thinking time, but after the hour is exhausted, they must make each move in thirty seconds or less. To enforce byo-yomi, a third person or a game clock with a byo-yomi option is necessary.\nIn professional Go games and many amateur tournaments, a player has several byo-yomi periods, for example five periods of one minute each. If a player makes their move within a one-minute period, they retain all five periods for their future moves. If a player oversteps one minute, they start the following move in the second rather than the first byo-yomi period. In effect, the player has one minute per move plus four extra one-minute packets which may be used as needed, e.g. four moves of two minutes each, or one move of five minutes, or any other combination.\nIn higher-level tournaments, such as the Kisei tournament, the player's time is often composed entirely of byo-yomi periods (for example, in an eight-hour game, the player may have 480 periods of one minute each), rather than having a main block of thinking time. In this case, the actual counting of time (verbally) begins once the player falls below a certain threshold of time, such as 10 minutes; when the time is being counted, the player is informed at intervals how much time they have used in their current period, and how many extra periods they have left. (For example, the time may be called at 10-second intervals, and when 55 and 58 seconds have been used; during a player's final minute, the last 10 seconds are counted one by one.) Similarly, in the televised NHK Cup tournament, the player has 30 seconds per move plus 10 extra one-minute periods which may be used as needed.\nWhen analog game clocks are used to enforce byo-yomi, it is more convenient to assign additional time for a block of moves, rather than for each move. In \"Canadian byo-yomi\", a player typically gets 5 minutes for 10 to 20 moves. The IGS Go server uses a similar system, but the byo-yomi time is variable and always covers 25 moves. Thus the time control \"20 minutes + 15 minutes byoyomi\" on IGS means that after the initial 20 minutes of thinking time are over, a player is granted 15 additional minutes, which may be spent however they choose. If these minutes expire before they have made 25 more moves, they lose. If they make 25 more moves in less than 15 minutes, they are granted another 15 minutes of byo-yomi, and so on indefinitely.\nCanadian byo-yomi imposes a certain average speed of play, but allows the player to spend more time to ponder on difficult moves. Several byo-yomi periods in one move per period variant (also known as \"Japanese byo-yomi\") serve essentially the same purpose, albeit to a lesser extent.\nUnused time during one byo-yomi period does not carry forward to future moves. This is in contrast to the Fischer clock often used in chess, with designations such as \"5 minutes + 12 seconds per move\". Under this time control each player has twelve seconds added to their clock after every move, starting from the first move, regardless of how much time they spend on each move. Thus if a player thinks for eight seconds before making their first move, they will have five minutes and four seconds on their clock after making it.\nCanadian overtime.\nAfter using all of their main time, a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time \u2014 for example, twenty moves within five minutes. In Go, players stop the clock, and the player in overtime counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach so as not to become confused, whilst the opponent sets the clock to the overtime period. If all the moves are made in time, then another period of overtime starts \u2014 another set of stones and the timer again reset to the overtime period. If all the moves are not made in time, the player has \"lost on time\". This is written as main time + number of moves to be completed in each time period in time period. In Progressive Canadian Overtime the required rate of play alters in additional overtime periods \u2014 e.g. 1 hour + 10 in 5, 20 in 5, 30 in 5, 40 in 5 etc.\nChess.\nIncrement and delay methods.\nThese are the timing methods most often used in chess.\nIn increment (also known as bonus and Fischer, after Bobby Fischer's patent on it), a specified amount of time is added to the player's main time after each move, unless the player's main time ran out before they completed their move. For example, if the time control is \"G/90;inc30\" (90 minutes of main time per player, with a 30-second increment each move), each player gets an additional 30 seconds added to their main time after each move, unless the player's main time ran out first. This is often notated as a \"90+30\" time control, with the first number indicating the minutes on the clock at the start of the game, followed by the number of seconds added to the clock per move.\nUnder FIDE and US Chess rules, each player gets the increment for the first move as well. For example, with \"G/3;inc2\", each player starts with three minutes and two seconds on the first move. Not all digital chess clocks automatically give the increment for the first move; for those that don't, the increment time has to be added manually.\nSimple delay.\nIn the simple delay (also known as the US delay), the clock waits for a fixed delay period during each move before the player's main time starts counting down. For example, if the delay is ten seconds, the clock waits for ten seconds each move before the main time starts counting down.\nBronstein delay.\nThe Bronstein delay (named after David Bronstein, its inventor), like increment, adds a fixed amount of time after each move, but no more than the amount of time spent to make the move. For example, if the delay is ten seconds and a player uses ten or more seconds for a move, ten seconds are added after they complete their move. If the player uses five seconds, only those five seconds are returned to the clock. This ensures that the main time left on the clock can never increase even if a player makes fast moves. As with increment, under FIDE and US Chess rules, the delay time is applied to the first move.\nBronstein delay and Simple delay are very similar, but not equal. In Bronstein delay the amount of time is added \"after\" the move has been made; this distinction may be crucial when a player is running out of time. The advantage of the Bronstein delay is that the player can easily see how much time is remaining without mentally adding the delay to the main clock. The advantage of the simple delay is that the player can always tell whether the delay time or the main time is counting down. The simple delay is the form of delay most often used in the United States, while the Bronstein delay is more often used in most other countries.\nOther uses.\nTime control has also been utilised in some game shows:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born at Allington Castle near Maidstone in Kent, though his family was originally from Yorkshire. His family adopted the Lancastrian side in the Wars of the Roses. His mother was Anne Skinner, and his father Henry, who had earlier been imprisoned and tortured by Richard III, had been a Privy Councillor of Henry VII and remained a trusted adviser when Henry VIII ascended the throne in 1509.\nThomas followed his father to court after his education at St John's College, Cambridge. Entering the King's service, he was entrusted with many important diplomatic missions. In public life, his principal patron was Thomas Cromwell, after whose death he was recalled from abroad and imprisoned (1541). Though subsequently acquitted and released, shortly thereafter he died. His poems were circulated at court and may have been published anonymously in the anthology \"The Court of Venus\" (earliest edition c.\u00a01537) during his lifetime, but were not published under his name until after his death; the first major book to feature and attribute his verse was \"Tottel's Miscellany\" (1557), printed 15 years after his death.\nEarly life.\nThomas Wyatt was born at Allington, Kent, in 1503, the son of Sir Henry Wyatt and Anne Skinner, the daughter of John Skinner of Reigate, Surrey. He had a brother Henry, assumed to have died an infant, and a sister, Margaret who married Sir Anthony Lee\n(died 1549) and was the mother of Queen Elizabeth's champion, Sir Henry Lee.\nEducation and diplomatic career.\nWyatt was over six feet tall, reportedly both handsome and physically strong. In 1515, Wyatt entered Henry's service as 'Sewer Extraordinary' and the same year he began studying at St John's College, Cambridge. His father had been associated with Sir Thomas Boleyn as constable of Norwich Castle, and Wyatt was thus acquainted with Anne Boleyn.\nFollowing a diplomatic mission to Spain, in 1526, he accompanied Sir John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, to Rome to help petition Pope Clement VII to annul Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, in hopes of freeing him to marry Anne Boleyn. Russell being incapacitated, Wyatt was also sent to negotiate with the Republic of Venice. According to some, Wyatt was captured by the armies of Emperor Charles V when they captured Rome and imprisoned the pope in 1527, but he managed to escape and make it back to England.\nFrom 1528 to 1530, Wyatt acted as high marshal at Calais. In the years following he continued in Henry's service; he was, however, imprisoned in the Tower of London for a month in 1536, perhaps because Henry hoped he would incriminate the queen. He was knighted in 1535 and appointed High Sheriff of Kent for 1536. At this time, he was sent to Spain as ambassador to Charles V, who was offended by the declaration of Princess Mary's illegitimacy; he was her cousin and they had once been briefly betrothed. Although Wyatt was unsuccessful in his endeavours, and was accused of disloyalty by some of his colleagues, he was protected by his relationship with Cromwell, at least during the latter's lifetime.\nWyatt was elected knight of the shire (MP) for Kent in December 1541.\nMarriage and issue.\nIn 1520, Wyatt married Elizabeth Brooke (1503\u20131560). A year later, they had a son Thomas (1521\u20131554) who led Wyatt's rebellion some 12 years after his father's death. In 1524, Henry VIII assigned Wyatt to be an ambassador at home and abroad, and he separated from his wife soon after on grounds of adultery.\nWyatt's poetry and influence.\nWyatt's professed object was to experiment with the English language, to civilise it, to raise its powers to equal those of other European languages. His poetry may be considered as a part of the Petrarchism movement within Renaissance literature. A significant amount of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by Italian poet Petrarch; he also wrote sonnets of his own. He took subject matter from Petrarch's sonnets, but his rhyme schemes are significantly different. Petrarch's sonnets consist of an \"octave\" rhyming \"abba abba\", followed by a \"sestet\" with various rhyme schemes. Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet scheme is \"cddc ee\". Wyatt experimented in stanza forms including the rondeau, epigrams, terza rima, ottava rima songs, and satires, as well as with monorime, triplets with refrains, quatrains with different length of line and rhyme schemes, quatrains with codas, and the French forms of douzaine and treizaine. He introduced the \"poulter's measure\" form, rhyming couplets composed of a 12-syllable iambic line (Alexandrine) followed by a 14-syllable iambic line (fourteener), and he is considered a master of the iambic tetrameter.\nWyatt's poetry reflects classical and Italian models, but he also admired the work of Geoffrey Chaucer, and his vocabulary reflects that of Chaucer; for example, he uses Chaucer's word \"newfangleness\", meaning fickleness, in \"They Flee from Me\". Many of his poems deal with the trials of romantic love and the devotion of the suitor to an unavailable or cruel mistress. C. S. Lewis described Wyatt's poetry as \"full of resentment [\u2026] He never goes out of himself: how badly his mistress has treated him, how well he deserves to be treated, and how much more fortunate he has been with other women, how sorry she will be some day\u2014such are his recurrent themes.\" Other poems are scathing, satirical indictments of the hypocrisies and pandering required of courtiers who are ambitious to advance at the Tudor court.\nWyatt's poems are short but fairly numerous. His 96 love poems appeared posthumously (1557) in a compendium called \"Tottel's Miscellany\". Most noteworthy are 31 sonnets, the first in English. Ten of them were translations from Petrarch, while all were written in the Petrarchan form, apart from the couplet ending which Wyatt introduced. Serious and reflective in tone, the sonnets show some stiffness of construction and a metrical uncertainty indicative of the difficulty Wyatt found in the new form. Yet their conciseness represents a great advance on the prolixity and uncouthness of much earlier poetry. Wyatt was also responsible for the important introduction of the personal note into English poetry, for although he followed his models closely, he wrote of his own experiences. His epigrams, songs, and rondeaux are lighter than the sonnets, and they reveal the care and the elegance typical of the new romanticism. His satires are composed in the Italian terza rima, again showing the direction of the innovating tendencies.\nAttribution.\nThe Egerton Manuscript is an album containing Wyatt's personal selection of his poems and translations which preserves 123 texts, partly in his handwriting. Tottel's Miscellany (1557) is the Elizabethan anthology which created Wyatt's posthumous reputation; it ascribes 96 poems to him, 33 not in the Egerton Manuscript. These 156 poems can be ascribed to Wyatt with certainty on the basis of objective evidence. Another 129 poems have been ascribed to him purely on the basis of subjective editorial judgment. They are mostly derived from the Devonshire Manuscript Collection and the Blage manuscript. Rebholz comments in his preface to \"Sir Thomas Wyatt, The Complete Poems\", \"The problem of determining which poems Wyatt wrote is as yet unsolved\". However, a solution was already at hand and is now in place. Rebholz adopted the canon of 285 poems ascribed to Wyatt in his edition wholesale from the 1969 edition by Kenneth Muir and Patricia Thomson. This was the third edition of Wyatt issued by Muir (the first in 1949, the second in 1963), to each of which he added scores of poems derived principally from the several hundred anonymous poems included in the Devonshire Manuscript and then the newly discovered Blage Manuscript \u2013 poems ascribed to Wyatt on no other basis than Muir\u2019s own judgment or whim. Already in the early 1970s Joost Daalder produced an edition (Oxford 1975) which attempts and partly succeeds in renovating the Wyatt canon to accord with documentary facts, and also in that year Richard Harrier published his magisterial philological study of the manuscript evidence, \"The Canon of Sir Thomas Wyatt\u2019s Poetry\" (Harvard University Press 1975). On the basis of a meticulous scientific study of the documentary evidence Harrier establishes a fact-based canon of Wyatt\u2019s poems. Later studies by other scholars (Helen Baron, 1989 and 1994, and Jason Powell, 2009) confirm the outlines and tenor of Harrier\u2019s analysis. On the basis of Harrier\u2019s analysis, 101 of the 285 poems included in Rebholz\u2019s edition are demonstrated to be not Wyatt\u2019s work. Harrier's researches establish that another 33 poems from other sources (besides The Egerton Manuscript and Tottel's) can be ascribed to Wyatt on the basis of solid documentary evidence and plausible editorial judgment. A new edition of Wyatt\u2019s poetry reflecting these established facts is needed.\nAssessment.\nCritical opinions have varied widely regarding Wyatt's work. Eighteenth-century critic Thomas Warton considered Wyatt \"confessedly an inferior\" to his contemporary Henry Howard, and felt that Wyatt's \"genius was of the moral and didactic species\" but deemed him \"the first polished English satirist\". The 20th century saw an awakening in his popularity and a surge in critical attention. His poems were found praiseworthy by numerous poets, including Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, John Berryman, Yvor Winters, Basil Bunting, Louis Zukofsky and George Oppen. C. S. Lewis called him \"the father of the Drab Age\" (i.e. the inornate, in contrast to what he calls the \"golden\" age of the 16th century). Patricia Thomson describes Wyatt as \"the Father of English Poetry\".\nRumoured affair with Anne Boleyn.\nMany have conjectured that Wyatt fell in love with Anne Boleyn in the early- to mid-1520s. Their acquaintance is certain, but it is not certain whether the two shared a romantic relationship. George Gilfillan implies that Wyatt and Boleyn were romantically involved. In his verse, Wyatt calls his mistress Anna and might allude to events in her life:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nSometime I fled the fire that me brent [burnt], \nBy hills, by dales, by water and by wind, \nAnd now I follow the coals that be quent [quenched],\nFrom Dover to Calais against my mind.&lt;/poem&gt;\nGilfillan argues that these lines could refer to Anne's trip to France in 1532 prior to her marriage to Henry VIII and could imply that Wyatt was present, although his name is not included among those who accompanied the royal party to France. Wyatt's sonnet \"Whoso List To Hunt\" may also allude to Anne's relationship with the King:\n&lt;poem&gt;Graven in diamonds with letters plain,\nThere is written her fair neck round about,\n\"Noli me tangere [Do not touch me], for Caesar's I am\".&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn still plainer terms, Wyatt's late sonnet \"If waker care\" describes his first \"love\" for \"Brunette that set our country in a roar\"\u2014presumably Boleyn.\nWyatt's grandson George Wyatt included in his \"Life of Queen Anne Boleigne\" a story that Thomas Wyatt obtained a jewel belonging to Anne, and that Henry VIII heard of this. The jewel was loose \"hanging by a lace out of her pocket\", a \"tablet\" (a kind of locket) which Wyatt took to wear at his neck. Henry VIII recognised the jewel when he played bowls with Wyatt. Anne said that Wyatt had obtained the jewel without her permission. However, the details of the story seem incompatible with courtly behaviour and are unconvincing.\nImprisonment on charges of adultery.\nIn May 1536, Wyatt was imprisoned in the Tower of London for allegedly committing adultery with Anne Boleyn. He was released later that year thanks to his friendship or his father's friendship with Thomas Cromwell, and he returned to his duties. During his stay in the Tower, he may have witnessed Anne Boleyn's execution (which took place on 19 May 1536) from his cell window, as well as the executions of the five men with whom she was accused of adultery; he wrote a poem which might have been inspired by that experience.\nAround 1537, Thomas had an affair with Elizabeth Darrell, a former maid of honour to Catherine of Aragon. She bore Wyatt three sons. \nBy 1540, he was again in the king's favour, as he was granted the site and many of the manorial estates of the dissolved Boxley Abbey. However, he was charged once more with treason in 1541; the charges were again lifted, but only thanks to the intervention of Queen Catherine Howard and on the condition of reconciling with his wife. He was granted a full pardon and restored once again to his duties as ambassador. After the execution of Catherine Howard, there were rumours that Wyatt's wife Elizabeth was a possibility to become Henry VIII's next wife despite the fact that she was still married to Wyatt. He became ill not long after and died on 11 October 1542 around age 39. He is buried in Sherborne Abbey.\nDescendants and relatives.\nLong after Wyatt's death, his only legitimate son Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger led a thwarted rebellion against Henry's daughter Mary I, for which he was executed. The rebellion's aim was to set on the throne the Protestant-minded Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne Boleyn. Wyatt was an ancestor of Wallis Simpson, wife of the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII. Thomas Wyatt's great-grandson was Virginia Colony governor Sir Francis Wyatt.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72180", "revid": "19634598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72180", "title": "Locative case", "text": "Grammatical case indicating a location\nIn grammar, the locative case ( ; abbreviated LOC) is a grammatical case which indicates a location. In languages using it, the locative case may perform a function which in English would be expressed with such prepositions as \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", and \"by\". The locative case belongs to the general local cases, together with the lative and ablative case.\nThe locative case exists in many language groups.\nIndo-European languages.\nThe Proto-Indo-European language had a locative case expressing \"place where\", an adverbial function. The endings are reconstructed as follows:\nIn most later Indo-European languages, the locative case merged into other cases (often genitive or dative) in form and/or function, but some daughter languages retained it as a distinct case. It is found in:\nLatin.\nOld Latin still had a functioning locative singular, which descended from the Proto-Indo-European form. The locative plural was already identical to the dative and ablative plural. In Classical Latin, changes to the Old Latin diphthongs caused the originally-distinctive ending of the locative singular to become indistinguishable from the endings of some other cases.\nBecause the locative was already identical to the ablative (which had a \"location\" meaning as well) in the plural, the loss of distinction between the endings eventually caused the functions of the locative case to be absorbed by the ablative case in Classical Latin. The original locative singular ending, descended from the Old Latin form, remained in use for a few words. For first and second declension, it was identical to the genitive singular form. In archaic times, the locative singular of third declension nouns was still interchangeable between ablative and dative forms, but in the Augustan Period the use of the ablative form became fixed. Therefore, both forms and may be encountered.\nThe locative ending of the fifth declension was (singular only), identical to the ablative singular, as in ('today').\nThe Latin locative case was only used for the names of cities, \"small\" islands and a few other isolated words. The Romans considered all Mediterranean islands to be small except for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, and Cyprus. Britannia was also considered to be a \"large island\". There are a few nouns that use the locative instead of a preposition:\n and are particularly used in contrast to , \"at home\" to convey that someone is away on military service, and are used interchangeably. \nThe first declension locative is by far the most common, because so many Roman place names were first declension, such as , Rome, and therefore use the same form as the genitive and dative: , at Rome, and , in Ireland. A few place-names were inherently plural, even though they are a single city, e.g. , Athens and , Cuma. These plural names also use the form similar to the dative and ablative: , at Athens, and , at Cumae. There are also a number of second declension names that could have locatives, e.g. , Brindisi; , York; with locatives , at Brindisi; , at York. The locative cannot express being located at multiple locations; plural forms only exist because certain proper names such as happen to be plural. \"He is at home\" can be expressed by \"\" using the locative, but \"They are at their (individual and separate) homes\" cannot be expressed by the locative.\nGreek.\nIn Ancient Greek, the locative merged with the Proto-Indo-European dative, so that the Greek dative represents the Proto-Indo-European dative, instrumental, and locative. The dative with the preposition \"in\" and the dative of time (e.g., , , which means \"on the third day\") are examples of locative datives. Some early texts, in particular Homer, retain the locative in some words (for example , \u2013 at dawn, \"Iliad\" 24.401).\nGermanic languages.\nThe locative case had merged with the dative in early Germanic times and was no longer distinct in Proto-Germanic or in any of its descendants. The dative, however, contrasts with the accusative case, which is used to indicate motion toward a place (it has an allative meaning). The difference in meaning between dative and accusative exists in all of the old Germanic languages and survives in all Germanic languages that retain a distinction between the two cases.\nSanskrit.\nThe locative case in Sanskrit is usually known as the \"seventh case\" (). It is the last out of the main seven cases () in the language. Along with \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"or\", and \"by\", the locative case is also generally used with \"among\" in Sanskrit.\nSlavic languages.\nAmong Slavic languages, the locative is mostly used after a fixed set of commonly used prepositions. Besides location, Slavic languages also employ locative as a way of expressing the method of doing an action, time when the action is to take place, as well as the topic or theme that something describes in more detail; as such it is subordinate to other cases. The locative is kept in all Slavic languages (except for Bulgarian and Macedonian), although Russian split it (in the singular of a group of masculine nouns) into locative and prepositional, and Serbo-Croatian uses almost the same set of endings (sometimes with different intonation) as for the dative. The ending depends on whether the word is a noun or an adjective (among other factors).\nOld Slavic.\nIn Old Church Slavonic, the locative is mostly used with a preposition. Some uses of independent locatives remain, mostly in expressions of time, such as \"in winter\", \"at midnight\". The locative also occurs as the complement of a handful of verbs, such as \"who touched my garments?\". In Old East Slavic, moreover, place names are regularly used in the locative without a preposition.\nCzech.\nThe Czech language uses the locative case to denote location (, 'in the Czech Republic'), but as in the Russian language, the locative case may be used after certain prepositions with meanings other than location (, 'about Prague', , 'after the revolution'). Cases other than the locative may be used to denote location in Czech as well (, 'at Robert's house' -genitive, or , 'above the table' -instrumental).\nThe locative case (commonly called the 6th case) is the only one of the 7 Czech cases which cannot be used without a preposition. It is used with these prepositions:\nIf the preposition uses both accusative and locative case, the accusative is used for direction (where to) while locative for pure location (where). In case of the preposition (about), this distinction can be very subtle and untranslatable, or depending on the controlling verb.\nThe locative form of substantives in the singular is mostly identical with the dative case (3rd case). Possible endings for locative case:\nFor adjectives and adjectival substantives:\nThe locative form in the plural typically has the ending (), the dual has ending ().\nSee Czech declension for declension patterns for all Czech grammatical cases, including the locative.\nSlovak.\nThe Slovak language uses the locative case to denote location (, 'in Slovakia'), but as in the Russian language, the locative case may be used after certain prepositions with meanings other than location (, 'about Bratislava', , 'after the revolution'). Cases other than the locative may be used to denote location in Slovak as well (, 'at Milan's house' -genitive, or , 'above the table' -instrumental). A preposition must always be used with this case.\nThere are several different locative endings in Slovak:\nSee also Slovak declension for declension patterns for all Slovak grammatical cases, including locative.\nPolish.\nThere are several different locative endings in Polish:\nFor a complete list, see .\nIn plural:\nRussian.\nIn the Russian language, the locative case has largely lost its use as an independent case and become the prepositional case, which is used only after a preposition. The latter is not always used to indicate location, while other cases may also be used to specify location (e.g. the genitive case, as in , (\"by the window\")). Statements such as , (\"in the library\") or , (\"in Alaska\"), demonstrate the use of the prepositional case to indicate location. However, this case is also used after the preposition \"\u043e\" (\"about\") as in , (\"about the student\").\nNevertheless, approximately 150 masculine nouns retain a distinct form for the locative case, used only after \"\u0432\" and \"\u043d\u0430\". These forms end in \"-\u0443\u0301\" or \"-\u044e\u0301\": , (to lie in the snow), but , (to think about snow). Other examples are , (paradise); \"\u0432 \u0440\u0430\u044e\u0301\", , (smoke); and , . As indicated by the accent marks, the stress is always on the last syllable, which is unlike the dative-case forms with the same spelling. A few feminine nouns that end with the soft sign, such as \u0434\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044c and \u043f\u044b\u043b\u044c, also have a locative form that differs from the prepositional in that the stress shifts to the final syllable: , (\"on the door\"), but , (\"by the door\"). These distinct feminine forms are sometimes referenced as \"second locative\" or \"new locative\", because they developed independently from the true locative case, which existed in Old Russian.\nWith some words, such as , (house), the second locative form is used only in certain idiomatic expressions, while the prepositional is used elsewhere. For example, , (\"at the house\" or \"at home\") would be used to describe activity that is performed at home, while (\"on the house\") would be used to specify the location of the roof.\nUkrainian.\nThe Ukrainian language uses the locative case to denote locations. For example, \"A pen is on a book\" would be written as \"\" in the locative. Ukrainian locative and instrumental cases usually go with a preposition, unlike the other four cases in Ukrainian grammar, that may generally be employed without prepositions. The most common locative prepositions are , and ; usage of these four different variations of \"in\" depends on whether the next word starts with a consonant or vowel.\nThe locative is used to indicate static spatial relationships and to talk about thoughts, discussions and nuanced ideas. It is distinguished from dynamic spatial relationships, which indicate action or motion, and are expressed in the accusative case in Ukrainian and most other East Slavic languages. The adlative \"goal function\", which in most East Slavic grammars is prescribed to be expressed in accusative (for example, ), may in Ukrainian sometimes be expressed in locative instead (; the difference in meaning cannot be translated into English), but it is only considered acceptable under certain circumstances.\nUkrainian, unlike Russian, still retains a fully functional locative case. However, during the Russification of Soviet Ukraine between the 1930s and the 1980s, several expressions in the Ukrainian language using the locative case, such as \", were changed by Soviet linguistic policies, in this instance to a genitive case to \", in order to conform to standard Russian \"\". On the other hand, post-Soviet users of Surzhyk may mistakenly be employing the locative Russian form, instead of the instrumental Ukrainian form, in a sentence like \"The book is written in English\":\nArmenian.\nIn the Eastern standard of the Armenian language non-animate nouns take () for the locative. Animate nouns (referring to persons especially) do not take the locative.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTurkic languages.\nThe Proto-Turkic language had a locative case, and most Turkic languages have retained it.\nTurkish.\nThe locative case exists in Turkish, as the suffix generally specified by \"-DA\". For instance, in Turkish, means 'the school', and means 'in the school'. The morpheme may exist in four different forms, depending on the preceding consonant and vowel. The first phoneme of the locative, \"D\", changes according to the previous consonant: it is \"t\" after voiceless consonants, but \"d\" elsewhere. The vowel changes depending on the phonetic characteristics of the previous vowel: it is \"a\" after a preceding back vowel, and \"e\" after a preceding front vowel, congruent with the vowel harmony of the language. This gives four different versions of the morpheme:\nAzerbaijani.\nThe locative case also exists in Azerbaijani. Similarly to Turkish, Azerbaijani employs a system of vowel harmony throughout the language. There are two simple Locative case endings:\nKazakh.\nThe locative case also exists in Kazakh. Similarly to Turkish, Kazakh employs a system of vowel harmony throughout the language. There are four simple locative case endings:\nFurthermore, Kazakh nouns frequently utilize a possessive affix to indicate a relationship between the object and its owner. When forming the locative case of a noun in the presence of a possessive affix, there are two possible endings:\nUyghur.\nThe locative case exists in Uyghur, similarly to Turkish. This gives four different versions of the morpheme:\nUzbek.\nThe locative case exists also in Uzbek. For example, in Uzbek, means 'city', and means 'in the city', so using suffix, the locative case is marked.\nUralic languages.\nProto-Uralic has been reconstructed with a single \"state\" or \"stationary\" locative case, with the ending or in accordance with vowel harmony. In many of its descendants, additional locative cases were created by combining these endings with others.\nInari Sami.\nIn Inari Sami, the locative suffix is -st.\nHungarian.\nIn the Hungarian language, nine such cases exist, yet the name 'locative case' refers to a form () used only in a few city/town names along with the inessive case or superessive case. It can also be observed in a few local adverbs and postpositions. It is no longer productive.\nExamples:\nThe town/city name suffixes are the inessive ones, and the are the superessive ones.\nFinnic languages.\nIn the Finnic languages, the original Proto-Uralic locative became the essive case, but is still found with a locative meaning in some fossilised expressions such as Finnish \"at home\". Two new locative cases were created from the old locative:\nThese endings still survive as such in several Finnic languages including Finnish, but have been reduced to and in Estonian and some others.\nThe Finnic languages, like some Indo-European languages (Latin, Russian, Irish), do not normally use the verb 'to have' to show possession. The adessive case and the verb 'to be' is used instead, so that the combination literally means \"on/at me is...\". For example, 'I have a house' in Estonian would be in which is in the adessive case, is the third singular of 'to be' (\"is\"), and is in nominative, not accusative. So is the subject, is the verb and is the indirect object. This could be translated to English as 'At me is a house' or 'A house is at me' or 'There is a house at me'.\nEtruscan.\nThe Etruscan language has a locative ending in -thi. E.g. , \"at Velznani\", with reference to Volsinii.\nAlgonquian languages.\nAlgonquian languages have a locative.\nCree.\nIn Cree, the locative suffix is .\nInnu-aimun.\nIn Innu-aimun, the locative suffix is -(i)t.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Turner", "text": "English painter (1775\u20131851)\nJoseph Mallord William Turner (23 April 1775\u00a0\u2013 19 December 1851), known in his time as William Turner, was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and watercolourist. He is known for his expressive colouring, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings. His artistic style developed over his lifetime, moving away from Romanticism\u2014bypassing the following rising style of Realism\u2014and, instead, with his later works being a significant precursor of and presaging the later Impressionist and Abstract Art movements that arose in the decades after his death. He left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 works on paper. He was championed by the leading English art critic John Ruskin from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting. In 1969 art historian Kenneth Clark wrote of Turner: \"He was a genius of the first order\u2014far the greatest painter that England has ever produced...\"\nTurner was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London, to a modest lower-middle-class family and retained his lower-class accent, while assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame. A child prodigy, Turner studied at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1789, enrolling when he was 14, and exhibited his first work there at 15. During this period, he also served as an architectural draftsman. He earned a steady income from commissions and sales, which he often only begrudgingly accepted owing to his troubled and contrary nature. He opened his own gallery in 1804 and became professor of perspective at the academy in 1807, where he lectured until 1828. He travelled around Europe from 1802, typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks.\nIntensely private, eccentric, and reclusive, Turner was a controversial figure throughout his career. He did not marry, but fathered two daughters, Evelina (1801\u20131874) and Georgiana (1811\u20131843), by the widow Sarah Danby. He became more pessimistic and morose as he got older, especially after the death of his father in 1829; when his outlook deteriorated, his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect, and his art intensified. In 1841, Turner rowed a boat into the Thames so he could not be counted as present at any property in that year's census. He lived in squalor and poor health from 1845, and died in London in 1851 aged 76. Turner is buried in St Paul's Cathedral, London.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nTurner's father William Turner (1745\u20131829) moved to London around 1770 from South Molton, Devon. Joseph Mallord William Turner was born on 23 April 1775 and baptised on 14 May. He was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, in London. His father was a barber and wig maker. His mother, Mary Marshall, came from a family of butchers. A younger sister, Mary Ann, was born in September 1778 but died in August 1783.\nThere are reasons to question the accepted location and birth date for Turner:\n\"He sometimes talked of being born in the same year as Napolean and the Duke of Wellington\" This would put Turner's birth date as 1769. His age at death in the General Register Office death index is 81 which may support his being born in 1769. However, in the first codicil to his will dated 20 August 1832, he states that his birthday was 23 April.\n\"As the birth place of Turner has recently appeared to some persons a matter of doubt, I may here observe that he was born at Barnstaple, and neither in Maiden-lane nor at South Molton, if his own words go for anything.\" Cyrus Redding, \"Fraser's Magazine\", February 1852.\nTurner's mother showed signs of mental disturbance from 1785 and was admitted to St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics in Old Street in 1799. She was moved in 1800 to Bethlem Hospital, a mental asylum, where she died in 1804. Turner was sent to his maternal uncle, Joseph Mallord William Marshall, a butcher in Brentford, then a small town on the banks of the River Thames west of London, where Turner attended school. The earliest known artistic exercise by Turner is from this period\u2014a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from Henry Boswell's \"Picturesque View of the Antiquities of England and Wales\".\nAround 1786, Turner was sent to Margate on the north-east Kent coast. There, he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area that foreshadowed his later work. By this time, Turner's drawings were being exhibited in his father's shop window and sold for a few shillings. His father boasted to the artist Thomas Stothard that: \"My son, sir, is going to be a painter\". In 1789, Turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to Sunningwell (then in Berkshire, now part of Oxfordshire). A whole sketchbook of work from this time survives, as well as a watercolour of Oxford. The use of pencil sketches on location, as the foundation for later finished paintings, formed the basis of Turner's essential working style for his whole career.\nMany early sketches by Turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective, and it is known that, as a young man, he worked for several architects, including Thomas Hardwick, James Wyatt and Joseph Bonomi the Elder. By the end of 1789, he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman Thomas Malton, who specialised in London views. Turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade, copying and colouring outline prints of British castles and abbeys. He would later call Malton \"My real master\". Topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies.\nCareer.\nTurner entered the Royal Academy of Art in 1789, aged 14, and was accepted into the academy a year later by Sir Joshua Reynolds. He showed an early interest in architecture but was advised by Hardwick to focus on painting. His first watercolour, \"A View of the Archbishop's Palace, Lambeth\", was accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1790 when Turner was 15.\nAs an academy probationer, Turner was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures. From July 1790 to October 1793, his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times. In June 1792, he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from naked models. Turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout Britain, particularly to Wales, where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours. These were particularly focused on architectural work, which used his skills as a draughtsman. In 1793, he showed the oil titled \"The Rising Squall, Hot Wells\" (lost until 2024), which foreshadowed his later climatical effects. The British writer Peter Cunningham, in his obituary of Turner, wrote that it was: \"recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipidities\u00a0... [and] evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated\".\nIn 1796, Turner exhibited \"Fishermen at Sea\", a nocturnal moonlit scene of the Needles off the Isle of Wight, an image of boats in peril. Wilton said that the image was \"a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century\" and shows strong influence by artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter Monamy and Francis Swaine, who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes.\nTurner travelled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802 and studying in the Louvre in Paris in the same year. He made many visits to Venice. Important support for his work came from Walter Ramsden Fawkes of Farnley Hall, near Otley in Yorkshire, who became a close friend of the artist. Turner first visited Otley in 1797, aged\u00a022, when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area. He was so attracted to Otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career. The stormy backdrop of \"\" is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the Chevin in Otley while he was staying at Farnley Hall.\nTurner was a frequent guest of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, at Petworth House in West Sussex, and painted scenes that Egremont funded, taken from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal. Petworth House still displays 20 paintings, the largest collection of his work outside the Tate.\nLater life.\nAs Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His father's death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter, he was subject to bouts of depression. He never married but had a relationship with an older widow, his housekeeper, Sarah Danby. He is believed to have been the father of her two daughters Evelina Dupuis and Georgiana Thompson. Evelina married Joseph Dupuis on 31 October 1817. It was recorded that her mother, Sarah Danby, was a witness along with Charles Thompson.\nTurner formed a relationship with Sophia Caroline Booth after her second husband died, and from 1846 he lived with her as \"Mr Booth\" or \"Admiral Booth\" in her house at 6 Davis's Place (now Cheyne Walk) in Chelsea, until his death in December 1851.\nTurner was a habitual user of snuff; in 1838, Louis Philippe I, King of the French, presented a gold snuff box to him. Of two other snuffboxes, an agate and silver example bears Turner's name, and another, made of wood, was collected along with his spectacles, magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper.\nTurner formed a short but intense friendship with the artist Edward Thomas Daniell. The painter David Roberts wrote of him that, \"He adored Turner, when I and others doubted, and taught me to see &amp; to distinguish his beauties over that of others ... the old man really had a fond &amp; personal regard for this young clergyman, which I doubt he ever evinced for the other\". Daniell may have supplied Turner with the spiritual comfort he needed after the deaths of his father and friends, and to \"ease the fears of a naturally reflective man approaching old age\". After Daniell's death in Lycia at the age of 38, he told Roberts he would never form such a friendship again.\nBefore leaving for the Middle East, Daniell commissioned Turner\u2019s portrait from John Linnell. Turner had previously refused to sit for the artist, and it was difficult to get his agreement to be portrayed. Daniell positioned the two men opposite each other at dinner, so that Linnell could observe his subject carefully and portray his likeness from memory.His death certificate shows that he died of natural decay at the age of 81. His place of death was recorded as Davis Place, Cremorne Road which was the residence of Sophia Booth, the woman believed to be his common law wife. He is buried in St Paul's Cathedral, where he lies near the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. Apparently his last words were \"The Sun (or Son?) is God\", though this may be apocryphal.\nTurner's friend, the architect Philip Hardwick, the son of his old tutor, was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew Turner to tell them at the time of his death that, \"I must inform you, we have lost him.\" Other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral, Henry Harpur\u00a0IV (benefactor of Westminster\u00a0\u2013 now Chelsea &amp; Westminster\u00a0\u2013 Hospital), Revd. Henry Scott Trimmer, George Jones\u00a0RA and Charles Turner\u00a0ARA.\nArt.\nStyle.\nTurner's talent was recognised early in his life. Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Piper's \"The Illustrated History of Art\", his later pictures were called \"fantastic puzzles\". Turner was recognised as an artistic genius; the English art critic John Ruskin described him as the artist who could most \"stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature\".\nTurner's imagination was sparked by shipwrecks, fires (including the burning of Parliament in 1834, an event which Turner witnessed first-hand, and transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches), and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen at the 1840 Royal Academy of Arts exhibition, where \"The Slave Ship\" (1840), and \"Rockets and Blue Lights (Close at Hand) to Warn Steamboats of Shoal Water\" (1840) were first shown. A 2003 exhibition at the Clark Art Institute suggested these two paintings were pendants, due in part to their similar content and size.\nTurner's work drew criticism from contemporaries. An anonymous reviewer of the 1840 Royal Academy exhibition, later identified as John Eagles, called the displayed paintings \u201cabsurd extravagances [that] disgrace the Exhibition\u201d. Sir George Beaumont, a landscape painter and fellow member of the Royal Academy, described his paintings as \"blots\".\nTurner's major venture into printmaking was the \"Liber Studiorum\" (Book of Studies), seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The \"Liber Studiorum\" was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on Claude Lorrain's \"Liber Veritatis\" (Book of Truth), where Claude had recorded his completed paintings; a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at Devonshire House, had been a huge publishing success. Turner's plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types: Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral. His printmaking was a major part of his output, and a museum is devoted to it, the Turner Museum in Sarasota, Florida, founded in 1974 by Douglass Montrose-Graem to house his collection of Turner prints.\nHis early works, such as ' (1795), stay true to the traditions of English landscape. In ' (1812), an emphasis on the destructive power of nature has already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects.\nIn Turner's later years, he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in \"Rain, Steam and Speed \u2013 The Great Western Railway\", where the objects are barely recognisable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turner's work in the vanguard of English painting but exerted an influence on art in France; the Impressionists, particularly Claude Monet, carefully studied his techniques. He is also generally regarded as a precursor of abstract painting.\nHigh levels of volcanic ash in the atmosphere (from the eruption of Mount Tambora) during 1816, the \"Year Without a Summer\", led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, and were an inspiration for some of Turner's work.\nJohn Ruskin said that an early patron, Thomas Monro, Principal Physician of Bedlam, and a collector and amateur artist, was a significant influence on Turner's style:\nHis true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend Girtin, the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.\nTogether with some young artists, Turner was able, in Monro's London house, to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing. But the curious atmospheric effects and illusions of John Robert Cozens's watercolours, some of which were present in Monro's house, went far further than the neat renderings of topography. The solemn grandeur of his Alpine views was an early revelation to the young Turner and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium, conveying mood instead of information.\nMaterials.\nTurner experimented with a wide variety of pigments. He used formulations like carmine, despite knowing that they were not long-lasting, and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments. As a result, many of his colours have now faded. Ruskin complained at how quickly his work decayed; Turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied. By 1930, there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading.\nLegacy.\nTurner left a small fortune, which he hoped would be used to support what he called \"decayed artists\". He planned an almshouse at Twickenham in west London with a gallery for some of his works. His will was contested, and in 1856, after a court battle, his first cousins, including Thomas Price Turner, received part of his fortune. Another portion went to the Royal Academy of Arts, which occasionally awards students the Turner Medal. His finished paintings were bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not happen because there was disagreement over the final site. Twenty-two years after his death, the British Parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, beginning a process of dispersing the pictures that Turner had wished to be kept together.\nOne of the greatest collectors of his work was Henry Vaughan, who, when he died in 1899, owned more than one hundred watercolours and drawings by Turner and as many prints. His collection included examples of almost every type of work on paper the artist produced, from early topographical drawings and atmospheric landscape watercolours, to brilliant colour studies, literary vignette illustrations and spectacular exhibition pieces. It included nearly a hundred proofs of \"Liber Studiorum\" and twenty-three drawings connected with it. It was an unparalleled collection that comprehensively represented the diversity, imagination and technical inventiveness of Turner's work throughout his sixty-year career. Vaughan bequeathed most of his Turner collection to British and Irish public galleries and museums, stipulating that the collections of Turner's watercolours should be 'exhibited to the public all at one time, free of charge and only in January', demonstrating an awareness of conservation which was unusual at the time.\nIn 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the National Gallery of British Art (now Tate Britain). In 1987, a new wing at the Tate, the Clore Gallery, was opened to house the Turner bequest although some of the most important paintings remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turner's condition that they be kept and shown together. Increasingly, paintings are lent abroad, ignoring Turner's provision that they remain constantly and permanently in Turner's Gallery.\nSt.\u00a0Mary's Church, Battersea, added a commemorative stained glass window for Turner, between 1976 and 1982. St Paul's Cathedral, Royal Academy of Arts and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum all hold statues representing him. A portrait by Cornelius Varley with his patent graphic telescope (Sheffield Museums &amp; Galleries) was compared with his death mask (National Portrait Gallery, London) by Kelly Freeman at Dundee University 2009\u201310 to ascertain whether it really depicts Turner. The City of Westminster unveiled a memorial plaque at the site of his birthplace at 21 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, on 2 June 1999.\nSelby Whittingham founded The Turner Society at London and Manchester in 1975. After the society endorsed the Tate Gallery's Clore Gallery wing (on the lines of the Duveen wing of 1910), as the solution to the controversy of what should be done with the Turner Bequest, Selby Whittingham resigned and founded the Independent Turner Society. The Tate created the prestigious annual Turner Prize art award in 1984, named in Turner's honour, and 20 years later, the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours founded the Winsor &amp; Newton Turner Watercolour Award. A major exhibition, \"Turner's Britain\", with material (including \"The Fighting Temeraire\") on loan from around the globe, was held at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery from 7 November 2003 to 8 February 2004. In 2005, Turner's \"The Fighting Temeraire\" was voted Britain's \"greatest painting\" in a public poll organised by the BBC.\nPortrayal.\nLeo McKern played Turner in \"The Sun Is God\", a 1974 Thames Television production directed by Michael Darlow. The programme aired on 17 December 1974, during the Turner Bicentenary Exhibition in London.\nBritish filmmaker Mike Leigh wrote and directed \"Mr. Turner\", a biopic of Turner's later years, released in 2014. The film stars Timothy Spall as Turner, Dorothy Atkinson, Marion Bailey and Paul Jesson, and premiered in competition for the at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, with Spall taking the award for Best Actor.\nThe Bank of England announced that a portrait of Turner, with a backdrop of \"The Fighting Temeraire\", would appear on the \u00a320 note beginning in 2020. It is the first \u00a320 British banknote printed on polymer. The Turner \u00a320 note entered circulation on Thursday, 20 February 2020.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the eldest surviving brother of Queen Jane Seymour, the third wife of King Henry VIII and mother of King Edward VI.\nSeymour grew rapidly in favour with Henry VIII following Jane's marriage to the king in 1536, and was subsequently made Earl of Hertford. On Henry's death in 1547, he was appointed protector by the Regency Council on the accession of the nine-year-old Edward VI. Rewarded with the title Duke of Somerset, Seymour became the effective ruler of England. Somerset continued Henry's military campaign against the Scots and achieved a sound victory at the Battle of Pinkie, but ultimately he was unable to maintain his position in Scotland. Domestically, Somerset pursued further reforms as an extension of the English Reformation, and in 1549 imposed the first \"Book of Common Prayer\" through the Act of Uniformity, offering a compromise between Protestant and Roman Catholic teachings. The unpopularity of Somerset's religious measures, along with agrarian grievances, resulted in unrest in England and provoked a series of uprisings (including the Prayer Book Rebellion and Kett's Rebellion). Costly wars and economic mismanagement brought the Crown to financial ruin, further undermining his government.\nIn October 1549, Somerset was forced out of power and imprisoned in the Tower of London by John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, and a group of privy councillors. He was later released and reconciled with Warwick (now Duke of Northumberland), but in 1551 Northumberland accused him of treason, and he was executed in January 1552. Until the 1970s historians had a highly positive view of Somerset, seeing him as a champion of political liberty and the common people, but since then he has also often been portrayed as an arrogant and inept ruler of the Tudor state.\nOrigins and early career.\nEdward Seymour was born c.\u00a01500, the son of Sir John Seymour (1474\u20131536), feudal baron of Hatch Beauchamp in Somerset, by his wife Margery Wentworth, eldest daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, Suffolk, and descended from Edward III. In 1514, aged about 14, he received an appointment in the household of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and was \"enfant d'honneur\" at her marriage with Louis XII.\nSeymour served in the Duke of Suffolk's campaign in France in 1523, being knighted by the duke on 1 November, and accompanied Cardinal Wolsey on his embassy to France in 1527. Appointed Esquire of the Body to Henry VIII in 1529, he grew in favour with the king, who visited his manor at Elvetham in Hampshire in October 1535. Through his marriage to Catherine Fillol he became the owner of Woodmancote Place, Sussex.\nRise under Henry VIII.\nWhen Seymour's sister, Jane, married King Henry VIII in 1536, Edward was created Viscount Beauchamp on 5 June 1536, and Earl of Hertford on 15 October 1537. He became Warden of the Scottish Marches and continued in royal favour after his sister's death on 24 October 1537.\nIn 1541, during Henry's absence in the north, Hertford, Thomas Cranmer and Thomas Audley had the chief management of affairs in London. In September 1542 he was appointed Warden of the Scottish Marches, and a few months later Lord High Admiral, a post which he almost immediately relinquished in favour of John Dudley, the future duke of Northumberland. In March 1544 he was made lieutenant-general of the north and instructed to punish the Scots for their repudiation of the treaty of marriage between Prince Edward and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots. He landed at Leith on 3 May 1544, captured and pillaged Edinburgh, and returned by land burning villages and castles along the way.\nIn July 1544 he was appointed lieutenant of the realm under Catherine Parr, Henry's sixth wife and regent, during Henry's absence at Boulogne, but in August he joined the king and was present at the surrender of the town. In the autumn he was one of the commissioners sent to Flanders to keep Emperor Charles V to the terms of his treaty with England, and in January 1545 he was placed in command at Boulogne, where on the 26th he repelled an attempt of Marshal de Biez to recapture the town. In May he was once more appointed lieutenant-general in the north to avenge the Scottish victory at the Battle of Ancrum Moor; this he did by a savage foray into Scotland in September. He reported that on 16 September 1545 he had \"sent forth a good band to the number of 1500 light horsemen in the leading of me [and] Sir Robert Bowes, which from 5 a.m. till 3 p.m., forayed along the waters of Tyvyote and Rowle, 6 or 7 miles beyond Jedburgh, and burnt 14 or 15 towns and a great quantity of all kinds of corn\".\nIn March 1546 he was sent back to Boulogne to supersede the Earl of Surrey, whose command had not been a success; and in June he was engaged in negotiations for peace with France and for the delimitation of the English conquests.\nFrom October to the end of Henry's reign he was in attendance on the king, engaged in the struggle for predominance which was to determine the complexion of the government during the coming minority. Personal, political and religious rivalry separated him and Baron Lisle from the Howards, and Surrey's hasty temper precipitated his own ruin and that of his father, the duke of Norfolk. They could not acquiesce in the Imperial ambassador's verdict that Hertford and Lisle were the only noblemen of fit age and capacity to carry on the government; and Surrey's attempt to secure the predominance of his family led to his own execution and to his father's imprisonment in the Tower of London.\nSeymour's Protectorate.\nCouncil of Regency.\nUpon the death of Henry VIII (28 January 1547), Seymour's nephew became king as Edward VI. Henry VIII's will named sixteen executors, who were to act as Edward's Council until he reached the age of 18. These executors were supplemented by twelve men \"of counsail\" who would assist the executors when called on. The final state of Henry VIII's will has occasioned controversy. Some historians suggest that those close to the king manipulated either him or the will itself to ensure a shareout of power to their benefit, both material and religious. In this reading, the composition of the Privy Chamber shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the Protestant faction. In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power. Stephen Gardiner was refused access to Henry during his last months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; on 24\u201325 December, he offered his vast estates to the Crown making them available for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London.\nOther historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion had non-religious causes, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the council, and that the radicalism of men such as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable. Whatever the case, Henry's death was followed by a lavish hand-out of lands and honours to the new power group. The will contained an \"unfulfilled gifts\" clause, added at the last minute, which allowed Henry's executors to freely distribute lands and honours to themselves and the court, particularly to Seymour (then known as Earl of Hertford), who became the Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the King's Person, and who created himself Duke of Somerset.\nHenry VIII's will did not provide for the appointment of a Protector. It entrusted the government of the realm during his son's minority to a Regency Council that would rule collectively, by majority decision, with \"like and equal charge\". Nevertheless, a few days after Henry's death, on 4 February, the executors chose to invest almost regal power in Edward Seymour. Thirteen out of the sixteen (the others being absent) agreed to his appointment as Protector, which they justified as their joint decision \"by virtue of the authority\" of Henry's will. Seymour may have done a deal with some of the executors, who almost all received hand-outs; he is known to have done so with William Paget, private secretary to Henry VIII, and to have secured the support of Sir Anthony Browne of the Privy Chamber.\nSeymour's appointment was in keeping with historical precedent, and his eligibility for the role was reinforced by his military successes in Scotland and France. He was senior to his ally Lisle in the peerage, and was the new king's closest relative.\nIn March 1547, he secured letters patent from King Edward granting him the almost monarchical right to appoint members to the Privy Council himself and to consult them only when he wished. In the words of historian G. R. Elton, \"from that moment his autocratic system was complete\". He proceeded to rule largely by proclamation, calling on the Privy Council to do little more than rubber-stamp his decisions.\nSeymour's takeover of power was smooth and efficient. The imperial ambassador Francis van der Delft reported that he \"governs everything absolutely\", with Paget operating as his secretary, although he predicted trouble from John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, who had recently been raised to Earl of Warwick in the share-out of honours. In fact, in the early weeks of his Protectorate, Seymour met opposition only from the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, whom the Earldom of Southampton had evidently failed to buy off, and from his own brother. Wriothesley, a religious conservative, objected to Seymour's assumption of monarchical power over the council. He then found himself abruptly dismissed from the chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates.\nIn his first parliament, which met in November 1547, Seymour procured the repeal of all the heresy laws and nearly all the treason laws passed since Edward III. He sought to win over the Scots by those promises of autonomy, free trade, and equal privileges with England. But the Scots were not to be won over yet, and would not be persuaded; the protector led another army into Scotland in September 1547, and won the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh on 10 September. He trusted the garrisons he established throughout the Lowlands to wear down Scottish opposition, but their pressure was soon weakened by troubles in England and abroad; and Mary, Queen of Scots, having been betrothed to Francis, heir to the French throne, was transported to France in 1548, where the two married ten years later.\nTo deal with the widespread social problems in England, Seymour introduced the Vagabonds Act 1547, which dictated that able-bodied men who were unemployed for three days or more should be sold into slavery for two years. This law was deeply unpopular and turned many people against him, particularly local officials who were blamed for enforcing the Act.\nSeymour also attempted to bring uniformity to forms of worship, and in 1549 the first Act of Uniformity introduced a \"Book of Common Prayer\" that attempted to compromise between different teachings; it was replaced by a more severe form in 1552, after his fall. Prior to and during the Protectorate, the Book of Common Prayer was a central element of the emerging Protestant literature.\nThomas Seymour.\nEdward Seymour faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother Thomas, who has been described as a \"worm in the bud\". As King Edward's uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king's person and a greater share of power. Seymour tried to buy his brother off with a barony, an appointment to the Lord Admiralship, and a seat on the Privy Council\u2014but Thomas was bent on scheming for power. He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that the Duke of Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a \"beggarly king\". He also urged him to throw off the Protector within two years and \"bear rule as other kings do\"; but Edward, schooled to defer to the council, failed to co-operate.\nIn April 1547, using King Edward's support to circumvent his brother's opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII's widow Catherine Parr, whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old Lady Jane Grey and the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth.\nIn summer 1548, a pregnant Catherine Parr discovered Thomas Seymour embracing Princess Elizabeth. As a result, Elizabeth was removed from Catherine Parr's household and transferred to that of Sir Anthony Denny. In that September, Catherine Parr died in childbirth, and Thomas Seymour promptly resumed his attentions to Elizabeth by letter, planning to marry her. Elizabeth was receptive, but, like Edward, unready to agree to anything unless permitted by the council. In January 1549, the council had Thomas Seymour arrested on various charges, including embezzlement at the Bristol mint. King Edward himself testified about the pocket money. Most importantly, Thomas Seymour had sought to officially receive the governorship of King Edward, for no earlier Lord Protectors, unlike Edward Seymour, had ever held both functions. Lack of clear evidence for treason ruled out a trial, so Thomas was condemned instead by an Act of Attainder and beheaded on 20 March 1549.\nWar.\nEdward Seymour's only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proved on his expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of Boulogne in 1546. From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland. After a crushing victory at the Battle of Pinkie in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as Dundee. His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction. His aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic. The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548, while Mary, Queen of Scots, was removed to France, where she was betrothed to the dauphin. The cost of maintaining the Protector's massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances. A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549 at last forced Seymour to begin a withdrawal from Scotland.\nRebellion.\nDuring 1548, England was subject to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions required major military intervention to put down: one was in Devon and Cornwall, the other in Norfolk. The first, called the Prayer Book Rebellion (and also known as the Western rebellion), arose mainly from the imposition of church services in English; the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protestors believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.\nThe same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west. The origin of the popular view of Edward Seymour as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory, proclamations, and partly in the uncoordinated activities of the commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage, encroachment of large sheep flocks on common land, and similar issues. Seymour's commissions were led by the evangelical M.P. John Hales, whose socially liberal rhetoric linked the issue of enclosure with Reformation theology and the notion of a godly commonwealth. Local groups often assumed that the findings of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves. King Edward wrote in his \"Chronicle\" that the 1549 risings began \"because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures\".\nWhatever the popular view of the Duke of Somerset, the disastrous events of 1549 were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government, and the Council laid the responsibility at the Protector's door. In July 1549, Paget wrote to Seymour: \"Every man of the council have misliked your proceedings ... would to God, that, at the first stir you had followed the matter hotly, and caused justice to be ministered in solemn fashion to the terror of others ...\".\nFall from power.\nThe sequence of events that led to Seymour's removal from power has often been called a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". By 1 October 1549, Seymour had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king's person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified Windsor Castle, where Edward said, \"Methinks I am in prison\".\nBy 7 October he was writing desperately to Sir Rowland Hill, Lord Mayor of London, and a fellow member of the Privy Council requesting 1000 troops to defend him and the King. By this point a meeting had already been had between Hill and London representatives with John Dudley, then Earl of Warwick at Ely Palace. That meeting moved decisively against Somerset.\nMeanwhile, a united Council published details of Seymour's mismanagement of government. They made clear that the Protector's power came from them, not from Henry VIII's will. On 11 October, the council had Seymour arrested and brought the king to Richmond. Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his \"Chronicle\": \"ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc.\"\nIn February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, emerged as the leader of the Council and, in effect, as Seymour's successor. Although Seymour was released from the Tower and restored to the council in early 1550, in October 1551 he was sent to the Tower on an exaggerated charge of treason. Instead, he was executed for felony (that of seeking a change of government) on 22 January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime. Edward noted his uncle's death in his \"Chronicle\": \"the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o'clock in the morning\". Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset was interred at St. Peter ad Vincula, Tower of London.\nHistoriography.\nHistorians have contrasted the efficiency of Edward Seymour's takeover of power in 1547 with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. Until recent decades, Seymour's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class. In the early 20th century this line was taken by the influential A. F. Pollard, and was echoed by Edward VI's 1960s biographer W. K. Jordan. A more critical approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the mid-1970s. Since that time the first Duke of Somerset has often been portrayed as an arrogant ruler, devoid of the political and administrative skills necessary for governing the Tudor state.\nMarriages and issue.\nEdward Seymour married twice:\nThe male line of Edward Seymour and Anne Stanhope died out with the seventh Duke of Somerset in 1750, when the descendants of Edward Seymour by his first wife, Catherine Fillol, inherited the Somerset dukedom in accordance with the private act of 1540. However, the female line continued, and Queen Elizabeth II was descended from Somerset through his grandchild by Catherine Grey.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The works of Rudolf Simek suggest that Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf could be the model that actual sei\u00f0hjallr platforms attempted to emulate.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", Odin and Frigg are both sitting in Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf when they see their foster sons Agnarr and Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r, one living in a cave with a giantess and the other a king. Frigg then made the accusation to her husband that Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r was miserly and inhospitable toward guests, so after wagering with one another over the veracity of the statement, Odin set out to visit Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r in order to settle the matter.\nIn \"Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l\", Freyr sneaks into Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf when he looks into J\u00f6tunheimr and sees the beautiful giant maiden Ger\u00f0r, with whom he instantly falls in love.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nIn \"Gylfaginning\", Snorri mentions the high seat on four occasions. In the first instance he seems to refer to it rather as a dwelling place:\n\"There is one abode called Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, and when Allfather sat in the high seat there, he looked out over the whole world and saw every man's acts, and knew all things which he saw.\"\nHowever, later he explicitly refers to it as the high seat itself:\n\"Another great abode is there, which is named Valaskj\u00e1lf. Odin possesses that dwelling. The gods made it and thatched it with sheer silver, and in this hall is the Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, the high seat so called. Whenever Allfather sits in that seat, he surveys all lands.\"\nThe third mention made of Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf is during Snorri's recounting of the wooing of Gerd, quoted by him from \"Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l\". Lastly, Snorri relates how Odin used the high seat to find Loki after he fled from the scene of his murder of Baldr.\nIt is described to be inside the throne room of Valaskj\u00e1lf Odin's home. It said upon it that Odin looks upon his world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The work is often considered to have been to some extent written, or at least compiled, by the Icelandic scholar, lawspeaker, and historian Snorri Sturluson c. 1220. It is considered the fullest and most detailed source for modern knowledge of Norse mythology, the body of myths of the North Germanic peoples, and draws from a wide variety of sources, including versions of poems that survive into today in a collection known as the \"Poetic Edda\".\nThe \"Prose Edda\" consists of four sections: The Prologue, a euhemerized account of the Norse gods; \"Gylfaginning\", which provides a question and answer format that details aspects of Norse mythology (consisting of approximately 20,000 words), \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", which continues this format before providing lists of kennings and \"heiti\" (approximately 50,000 words); and \"H\u00e1ttatal\", which discusses the composition of traditional skaldic poetry (approximately 20,000 words).\nDating from c. 1300 to 1600, seven manuscripts of the \"Prose Edda\" differ from one another in notable ways, which provides researchers with independent textual value for analysis. The \"Prose Edda\" appears to have functioned similarly to a contemporary textbook, with the goal of assisting Icelandic poets and readers in understanding the subtleties of alliterative verse, and to grasp the meaning behind the many kennings used in skaldic poetry.\nOriginally known to scholars simply as \"Edda\", the \"Prose Edda\" gained its contemporary name in order to differentiate it from the \"Poetic Edda\". Early scholars of the \"Prose Edda\" suspected that there once existed a collection of entire poems, a theory confirmed with the rediscovery of manuscripts of the \"Poetic Edda\".\nNaming.\nThe etymology of \"Edda\" remains uncertain; there are many hypotheses about its meaning and development, yet little agreement. Some argue that the word derives from the name of Oddi, a town in the south of Iceland where Snorri was raised. Edda could therefore mean \"book of Oddi.\" However, this assumption is generally rejected. Anthony Faulkes in his English translation of the Prose Edda comments that this is \"unlikely, both in terms of linguistics and history\" since Snorri was no longer living at Oddi when he composed his work.\nAnother connection was made with the word \"\u00f3\u00f0r\", which means 'poetry or inspiration' in Old Norse. According to Faulkes, though such a connection is plausible semantically, it is unlikely that \"Edda\" could have been coined in the 13th century on the basis of \"\u00f3\u00f0r\", because such a development \"would have had to have taken place gradually\", and \"Edda\" in the sense of 'poetics' is not likely to have existed in the preliterary period.\nEdda also means 'great-grandparent', a word that appears in \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", which occurs as the name of a figure in the eddic poem \"Rigsthula\" and in other medieval texts.\nA final hypothesis is derived from the Latin \"edo\", meaning \"I write\". It relies on the fact that the word \"kredda\" (meaning \"belief\") is certified and comes from the Latin \"credo\", meaning 'I believe'. \"Edda\" in this case could be translated as \"Poetic Art\". This is the meaning that the word was then given in the medieval period.\nThe now uncommonly used name \"S\u00e6mundar Edda\" was given in 1643 by the Bishop Brynj\u00f3lfur Sveinsson to the collection of poems contained in the Codex Regius, many of which are quoted by Snorri. Brynj\u00f3lfur, along with many others of his time incorrectly believed that they were collected by S\u00e6mundr fr\u00f3\u00f0i (therefore before the drafting of the Edda of Snorri), and so the Poetic Edda is also known as the Elder Edda.\nManuscripts.\nSeven manuscripts of the \"Prose Edda\" have survived into the present day: Six copies from the medieval period and another dating to the 1600s. No one manuscript is complete, and each has variations. In addition to three fragments, the four main manuscripts are Codex Regius, Codex Wormianus, Codex Trajectinus, and the Codex Upsaliensis:\nThe other three manuscripts are AM 748; AM 757 a 4to; and AM 738 II 4to, AM le \u00df fol. Although some scholars have doubted whether a sound stemma of the manuscripts can be created, due to the possibility of scribes drawing on multiple exemplars or from memory, recent work has found that the main sources of each manuscript can be fairly readily ascertained. The \"Prose Edda\"' remained fairly unknown outside of Iceland until the publication of the \"Edda Islandorum\" in 1665.\nAuthorship.\nThe text is generally considered to have been written or at least compiled by Snorri Sturluson. This identification is largely based on the following paragraph from a portion of Codex Upsaliensis, an early 14th-century manuscript containing the \"Edda\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nScholars have noted that this attribution, along with that of other primary manuscripts, is not clear whether or not Snorri is more than the compiler of the work and the author of \"H\u00e1ttatal\" or if he is the author of the entire \"Edda\". Faulkes summarizes the matter of scholarly discourse around the authorship of the \"Prose Edda\" as follows:\nSnorri's authorship of the Prose Edda was upheld by the renaissance scholar Arngr\u00edmur J\u00f3nsson (1568\u20131648), and since his time it has generally been accepted without question. But the surviving manuscripts, which were all written more than half a century after Snorri's death, differ from each other considerably and it is not likely that any of them preserves the work quite as he wrote it. A number of passages in Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l especially have been thought to be interpolations, and this section of the work has clearly been subject to various kinds of revision in most manuscripts. It has also been argued that the prologue and the first paragraph and part of the last paragraph of Gylfaginning are not by Snorri, at least in their surviving forms.\nWhatever the case, the mention of Snorri in the manuscripts has been influential in a common acceptance of Snorri as the author or at least one of the authors of the \"Edda\".\nContents.\nPrologue.\nThe Prologue is the first section of four books of the \"Prose Edda\", consisting of a euhemerized Christian account of the origins of Norse mythology: the Nordic gods are described as human Trojan warriors who left Troy after the fall of that city (an origin which parallels Virgil's \"Aeneid\").\n\"Gylfaginning\".\n\"Gylfaginning\" (Old Icelandic 'the tricking of Gylfi') follows the Prologue in the \"Prose Edda\". \"Gylfaginning\" deals with the creation and destruction of the world of the Nordic gods, and many other aspects of Norse mythology. The section is written in prose interspersed with quotes from eddic poetry.\n\"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\".\n\"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" (Old Icelandic 'the language of poetry') is the third section of \"Edda\", and consists of a dialogue between \u00c6gir, a j\u00f6tunn who is one of various personifications of the sea, and Bragi, a skaldic god, in which both Norse mythology and discourse on the nature of poetry are intertwined. The origin of a number of kennings are given and Bragi then delivers a systematic list of kennings for various people, places, and things. Bragi then goes on to discuss poetic language in some detail, in particular \"heiti\", the concept of poetical words which are non-periphrastic, for example \"steed\" for \"horse\", and again systematises these. This section contains numerous quotes from skaldic poetry.\n\"H\u00e1ttatal\".\n\"H\u00e1ttatal\" (Old Icelandic \"list of verse-forms\") is the last section of \"Prose Edda\". The section is composed by the Icelandic poet, politician, and historian Snorri Sturluson. Primarily using his own compositions, it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in Old Norse poetry. Snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach; he has systematized the material, often noting that the older poets did not always follow his rules.\nTranslations.\nThe \"Prose Edda\" has been the subject of numerous translations. The most recent ones into English have been by Jesse Byock (2006), Anthony Faulkes (1987 / 2nd ed. 1995), Jean Young (1954), and Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur (1916). Many of these translations are abridged; the technical nature of the \"H\u00e1ttatal\" means it is frequently excluded, and the \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" often has its more Old Norse thesaurus aspects abridged as well.\nTranslations into English\nTranslations into other languages\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The concept of nothing has been a matter of philosophical debate since at least the 5th century BCE. Early Greek philosophers argued that it was impossible for \"nothing\" to \"exist\". The atomists allowed \"nothing\" but only in the spaces between the invisibly small atoms. For them, all space was filled with atoms. Aristotle took the view that there exists matter and there exists space, a receptacle into which matter objects can be placed. This became the paradigm for classical scientists of the modern age like Isaac Newton. Nevertheless, some philosophers, like Ren\u00e9 Descartes, continued to argue against the existence of empty space until the scientific discovery of a physical vacuum.\nExistentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger (as interpreted by Sartre) have associated \"nothing\" with consciousness. Some writers have made connections between Heidegger's concept of \"nothing\" and the nirvana of Eastern religions.\nModern science does not equate \"vacuum\" with \"nothing\". The vacuum in quantum field theory is filled with virtual particles. The quantum vacuum is often viewed as a modern version of an aether theory.\nPhilosophy.\nWestern.\nSome would consider the study of \"nothing\" to be absurd. A typical response of this type is voiced by the Venetian Giacomo Casanova in conversation with his landlord, one Dr. Gozzi, who also happens to be a priest:\n\"Nothingness\" has been treated as a serious subject for a very long time. In philosophy, to avoid linguistic traps over the meaning of \"nothing\", a phrase such as \"not-being\" is often employed to make clear what is being discussed.\nParmenides.\nOne of the earliest Western philosophers to consider nothing as a concept was Parmenides (5th century BCE), a Greek philosopher of the monist school. He argued that \"nothing\" cannot exist by the following line of reasoning: To speak of a thing, one has to speak of a thing that exists. If one can speak of a thing in the past, this thing must still exist (in some sense) now, and from this he concluded that there is no such thing as change. As a corollary, there can be no such things as \"coming-into-being\", \"passing-out-of-being\", or \"not-being\".\nOther philosophers, for instance, Socrates and Plato largely agreed with Parmenides's reasoning on nothing. Aristotle differs with Parmenides's conception of nothing and says, \"Although these opinions seem to follow logically in a dialectical discussion, yet to believe them seems next door to madness when one considers the facts.\"\nIn modern times, Albert Einstein's concept of spacetime has led many scientists, including Einstein himself, to adopt a position remarkably similar to Parmenides. On the death of his friend Michele Besso, Einstein consoled his widow with the words, \"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That signifies nothing. For those of us that believe in physics, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\"\nLeucippus.\nLeucippus (early 5th century BCE), one of the atomists, along with other philosophers of his time, made attempts to reconcile this monism with the everyday observation of motion and change. He accepted the monist position that there could be no motion without a void. The void is the opposite of being. It is \"not-being\". On the other hand, there exists something known as an absolute plenum, a space filled with matter, and there can be no motion in a plenum because it is completely full. But, there is not just one monolithic plenum, for existence consists of a multiplicity of plenums. These are the invisibly small \"atoms\" of Greek atomist theory, later expanded by Democritus (c. 460\u2013370 BCE), which allows the void to \"exist\" between them. In this scenario, macroscopic objects can \"come-into-being\", move through space, and pass into \"not-being\" by means of the coming together and moving apart of their constituent atoms. The void must exist to allow this to happen, or else the \"frozen world\" of Parmenides must be accepted.\nBertrand Russell points out that this does not exactly defeat the argument of Parmenides but, rather, ignores it by taking the rather modern scientific position of starting with the observed data (motion, etc.) and constructing a theory based on the data, as opposed to Parmenides' attempts to work from pure logic. Russell also observes that both sides were mistaken in believing that there can be no motion in a plenum, but arguably motion cannot \"start\" in a plenum. Cyril Bailey notes that Leucippus is the first to say that a \"thing\" (the void) might be real without being a body and points out the irony that this comes from a materialistic atomist. Leucippus is therefore the first to say that \"nothing\" has a reality attached to it.\nAristotle, Newton, Descartes.\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) provided the classic escape from the logical problem posed by Parmenides by distinguishing things that are \"matter\" and things that are \"space\". In this scenario, space is not \"nothing\" but, rather, a receptacle in which objects of matter can be placed. The true void (as \"nothing\") is different from \"space\" and is removed from consideration. This characterization of space reached its pinnacle with Isaac Newton who asserted the existence of absolute space. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, on the other hand, returned to a Parmenides-like argument of denying the existence of space. For Descartes, there was matter, and there was extension of matter leaving no room for the existence of \"nothing\".\nThe idea that space can actually be empty was generally still not accepted by philosophers who invoked arguments similar to the plenum reasoning. Although Descartes' views on this were challenged by Blaise Pascal, he declined to overturn the traditional belief, \"horror vacui\", commonly stated as \"nature abhors a vacuum\". This remained so until Evangelista Torricelli invented the barometer in 1643 and showed that an empty space appeared if the mercury tube was turned upside down. This phenomenon being known as the Torricelli vacuum and the unit of vacuum pressure, the torr, being named after him. Even Torricelli's teacher, Galileo Galilei, had previously been unable to adequately explain the sucking action of a pump.\nJohn the Scot.\nJohn the Scot, or Johannes Scotus Eriugena (c. 815\u2013877) held many surprisingly heretical beliefs for the time he lived in for which no action appears ever to have been taken against him. His ideas mostly stem from, or are based on his work of translating pseudo-Dionysius. His beliefs are essentially pantheist and he classifies evil, amongst many other things, into \"not-being\". This is done on the grounds that evil is the opposite of good, a quality of God, but God can have no opposite, since God is everything in the pantheist view of the world. Similarly, the idea that God created the world out of \"nothing\" is to be interpreted as meaning that the \"nothing\" here is synonymous with God.\nG. W. F. Hegel.\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831) is the philosopher who brought the dialectical method to a new pinnacle of development. According to Hegel in \"Science of Logic\", the dialectical methods consists of three steps. First, a thesis is given, which can be any proposition in logic. Second, the antithesis of the thesis is formed and, finally, a synthesis incorporating both thesis and antithesis. Hegel believed that no proposition taken by itself can be completely true. Only the whole can be true, and the dialectical synthesis was the means by which the whole could be examined in relation to a specific proposition. Truth consists of the whole process. Separating out thesis, antithesis, or synthesis as a stand-alone statement results in something that is in some way or other untrue. The concept of \"nothing\" arises in Hegel right at the beginning of his \"Logic\". The whole is called by Hegel the \"Absolute\" and is to be viewed as something spiritual. Hegel then has:\nExistentialists.\nThe most prominent figure among the existentialists is Jean-Paul Sartre, whose ideas in his book \"Being and Nothingness\" (\"L'\u00eatre et le n\u00e9ant\") are heavily influenced by \"Being and Time\" (\"Sein und Zeit\") of Martin Heidegger, although Heidegger later stated that he was misunderstood by Sartre. Sartre defines two kinds of \"being\" (\u00eatre). One kind is \"\u00eatre-en-soi\", the brute existence of things such as a tree. The other kind is \"\u00eatre-pour-soi\" which is consciousness. Sartre claims that this second kind of being is \"nothing\" since consciousness cannot be an object of consciousness and can possess no essence. Sartre, and even more so, Jaques Lacan, use this conception of nothing as the foundation of their atheist philosophy. Equating nothingness with being leads to creation from nothing and hence God is no longer needed for there to be existence.\nEastern.\nThe understanding of \"nothing\" varies widely between cultures, especially between Western and Eastern cultures and philosophical traditions. For instance, \"\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101\" (emptiness), unlike \"nothingness\", is considered to be a state of mind in some forms of Buddhism (see Nirvana, mu, and Bodhi). Achieving \"nothing\" as a state of mind in this tradition allows one to be totally focused on a thought or activity at a level of intensity that they would not be able to achieve if they were consciously thinking. A classic example of this is an archer attempting to erase the mind and clear the thoughts to better focus on the shot. Some authors have pointed to similarities between the Buddhist conception of nothingness and the ideas of Martin Heidegger and existentialists like Sartre, although this connection has not been explicitly made by the philosophers themselves.\nIn some Eastern philosophies, the concept of \"nothingness\" is characterized by an egoless state of being in which one fully realizes one's own small part in the cosmos.\nThe Kyoto School handles the concept of nothingness as well.\nTaoism.\nLaozi and Zhuangzi were both conscious that language is powerless in the face of the ultimate. In Taoist philosophy, however real this world is, its main characteristic is impermanence, whereas the Tao has a permanence that cannot be described, predetermined, or named. In this way the Tao is different from any thing that can be named. It is nonexistence, in other words, nothing.\nTaoists also have the related concept of \"wu wei\".\nScience.\nDespite the proven existence of vacuum, scientists through the 17th to 19th centuries thought there must be a medium pervading all space that allowed the transmission of light or gravity. Thus, in this period, it was not accepted that complete \"nothing\" was possible. Theories describing such a medium are collectively known as aether theories, so named as an evocation of the aether, the classical element from Greek philosophy. In particular, the medium that is supposed to allow the transmission of light is called the luminiferous aether. This became the centre of attention after James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave in 1865.\nEarly aether theories include those of Robert Hooke (1665) and Christiaan Huygens (1690). Newton also had an aether theory, but to Newton, it was not the medium of transmission since he theorised light was composed of \"corpuscles\" which moved by simple mechanical motion. He needed the aether instead to explain refraction. Early theories generally proposed a mechanical medium of some sort, allowing the possibility of the same medium supporting both light and gravity. Proof that light has a wave nature, rather than Newton's corpuscles, was provided by Thomas Young in his 1803 interference experiment, seemingly confirming the need for an aether. The most well known attempt to detect the existence of the aether was the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment conducted by Albert A. Michelson in 1881, later repeated with Edward W. Morley in 1887 with more precision. This failed to show the desired effect, but reluctant to abandon the aether theory, various attempts were made to modify it to account for the Michelson-Morley result. Finally, Albert Einstein, building on the work of Hendrik Lorentz, published his theory of special relativity in 1905 which dispenses entirely with the need for a luminiferous aether to explain the transmission of light.\nAlthough a physical medium was no longer required, the concept of aether still did not entirely vanish. It remained necessary to assign properties to the vacuum for various purposes. In some respects \"vacuum\" and \"aether\" are treated as synonyms by science. In modern quantum field theory, a completely empty vacuum is not at zero-point energy, the lowest possible energy state. First proposed by Paul Dirac in 1927, the lowest energy state has constant random vacuum fluctuations which bring into existence short-lived virtual particles. This is somewhat reminiscent of early philosophical plenum ideas, and means that \"vacuum\" and \"nothing\" are certainly not synonyms.\nWhile studying Kaluza\u2013Klein theory, Edward Witten proposed the possible formation of a bubble of nothing in 1982, a singularity with no interior, not even spacetime.\nMathematics.\nPerhaps the best-known usage of the term \"nothing\" in mathematics is the number 0, which is neither a positive number nor a negative number. It's sometimes included in the set of natural numbers, denoted by formula_1, but it's always included in the set of real numbers, denoted by formula_2. \"Nothing\" can also apply to empty sets, indicated by the symbol formula_3, whose size or cardinality is 0.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the elder son of King Charles\u00a0III and Diana, Princess of Wales.\nWilliam was born during the reign of his paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II. He was educated at Wetherby School, Ludgrove School and Eton College. He earned a Master of Arts degree in geography at the University of St Andrews where he met his future wife, Catherine Middleton. They have three children: George, Charlotte and Louis.\nAfter university, William trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst prior to serving with the Blues and Royals. In 2008 he graduated from the Royal Air Force College Cranwell, joining the RAF Search and Rescue Force in early 2009. He served as a full-time pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance for two years from July 2015.\nWilliam performs official duties and engagements on behalf of the monarch. He is patron of multiple charitable and military organisations, including the Tusk Trust, Centrepoint, The Passage, Wales Air Ambulance and London's Air Ambulance Charity. Through the Royal Foundation, his work focuses on mental health, conservation, homelessness, and emergency workers. In 2020 William launched the Earthshot Prize, a \u00a350 million initiative to incentivise environmental solutions.\nWilliam was made Duke of Cambridge immediately before his wedding in April 2011. He became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay upon his father's accession to the throne on 8 September 2022. The following day he was made Prince of Wales.\nEarly life.\nWilliam was born at 9:03pm on 21 June 1982 at St Mary's Hospital, London, as the first child of Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles\u00a0III), and his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, during the reign of his paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II. He was the first direct heir to the British throne to be born in a hospital. Buckingham Palace announced his name\u00a0\u2013 William Arthur Philip Louis\u00a0\u2013 on 28 June. William was christened in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, on 4 August, coinciding with the 82nd birthday of his paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\nWilliam was the first child born to a Prince and Princess of Wales since Prince John was born to Prince George and Princess Mary (later King George\u00a0V and Queen Mary) in July 1905. When he was nine months old, William accompanied his parents on their 1983 tour of Australia and New Zealand, as his first trip overseas. It also marked the first time that a royal baby was taken on an overseas tour. Family photographs of William and his parents on the grounds of Government House in Auckland, New Zealand, received significant global coverage, and have been identified as a major reason why the Buzzy Bee, the toy which William was playing with, became a New Zealand cultural icon.\nHis younger brother, Prince Harry, was born in September 1984. Both of them were raised at Kensington Palace in London, and Highgrove House in Gloucestershire.\nKnown informally as \"Wills\" within his family, William was nicknamed \"Willy\" by his brother and \"Wombat\" by his mother. Diana wished her sons to obtain broader and more typical life experiences beyond royal upbringing, taking them to Walt Disney World, McDonald's, AIDS clinics and shelters for the homeless. The biographer Robert Lacey asserts that William, described as a \"rambunctious\" and \"bratty\" child, became \"more reflective\" with a \"noticeably quiet character\" as he began boarding school. Diana was reported to have described William as \"my little wise old man\" on whom she started to rely as her confidant by his early teens.\nWilliam carried out his first public engagement while accompanying his parents on a visit to Llandaff on Saint David's Day in 1991. He and Harry travelled to Canada on an official visit with their parents in 1991 and again with Charles in 1998. William's parents divorced in 1996. Diana died in a car accident in the early hours of 31 August 1997. William, then aged 15, together with his 12-year-old brother and their father, was staying at Balmoral Castle at the time. The following morning, Charles informed William and Harry of their mother's death. William was reportedly uncertain as to whether he should walk behind his mother's coffin during the funeral procession. His grandfather Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, told him: \"If you don't walk, I think you'll regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?\". At the funeral, William and Harry walked alongside their father, grandfather, and maternal uncle, Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, behind the funeral cort\u00e8ge from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.\nAfter his mother's death, William stated that he was \"in a state of shock for many years\". He and Harry inherited the majority of the \u00a312.9 million left by their mother on their respective 30th birthdays, a figure that had grown to \u00a310 million each by 2014. In 2014 the brothers inherited their mother's wedding dress along with many other of her personal possessions including dresses, diamond tiaras, jewels, letters and paintings. They also received the original lyrics and score of \"Candle in the Wind\" by Bernie Taupin and Elton John as performed by the latter at Diana's funeral. In 2002 \"The Times\" reported that William and Harry would also share \u00a34.9 million from trust funds established by their great-grandmother on their respective 21st birthdays, as well as \u00a38 million upon their respective 40th birthdays.\nEducation.\nWilliam was educated at private schools. He started at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School (both in London) before continuing at Ludgrove School near Wokingham, Berkshire. At Ludgrove, William was active in sport before being admitted to Eton College, where he studied geography, biology, and history of art at A-Level. He also took part in several sports.\nThe decision to send William to Eton broke with royal tradition, as his father and grandfather had both attended Gordonstoun. The royal family and the press agreed William would be allowed to study free from media intrusion in exchange for periodic official updates. In June 1991, William was admitted to the Royal Berkshire Hospital after being accidentally hit on the forehead by a fellow pupil wielding a golf club. He suffered a depressed fracture of the skull and was operated on at Great Ormond Street Hospital, resulting in a permanent scar. The incident received widespread media attention. After leaving Eton, William took a gap year. He joined British Army training exercises in Belize, worked on English dairy farms, and visited Africa. He also spent ten weeks in southern Chile with Raleigh International, taking part in community projects and teaching English.\nIn 2001 William enrolled at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Similar to his time at Eton, the media agreed not to invade his privacy, and students were warned not to leak stories to the press. William embarked on a degree course in art history but later changed his main subject to geography. He focused his dissertation on the Indian Ocean's Rodrigues coral reefs and graduated with an undergraduate Master of Arts (MA Hons) degree with upper second class honours in 2005. While at university, he represented the Scottish national universities water polo team at the Celtic Nations tournament in 2004. He was reportedly known as \"Steve\" by other students to avoid any journalists realising his identity.\nEarly appointments and duties.\nAt the age of 21, William became a Counsellor of State. In July 2005, he undertook his first solo public engagements on an overseas tour of New Zealand, travelling to participate in World War II commemorations. In 2009 the Queen set up a private office for William and Harry with David Manning as their adviser. Manning accompanied William on his first official tour in January 2010 as the latter toured Auckland and Wellington. The visit spurred crowds of \"many thousands\", with positive public reception compared to that of his mother's 1983 tour. In March 2011, William visited Christchurch, New Zealand, shortly after the earthquake, and spoke at the memorial service at Hagley Park on behalf of his grandmother. He also travelled to Australia to visit areas affected by flooding in Queensland and Victoria.\nBefore attending Sandhurst, William did a three-week internship at several institutions, including the Bank of England, the London Stock Exchange and Lloyd's of London. To prepare for his eventual management of the Duchy of Cornwall, in 2014, he entered St John's College, Cambridge to undertake an executive agriculture management degree run by the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL), of which his father is patron. In April 2019, Kensington Palace announced that William had completed a three-week internship at MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, during which he was tasked with monitoring extreme Islamist terror cells, identifying potential threats abroad, and observing code breaking technology.\nMilitary and air ambulance service.\nHaving decided on a military career, William was admitted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 2006; his admission was based on successfully completing a 44-week course as an Officer Cadet which led to his commission as a British Army officer. As \"Lieutenant Wales\"\u00a0\u2013 a name based on his father's then title Prince of Wales\u00a0\u2013 he followed his brother into the Blues and Royals in December that year as a second lieutenant after which he spent five months training for the post at Bovington Camp in Dorset.\nDespite the Queen's approval for William to serve on the frontline, his position as second-in-line to the throne at the time cast doubts on his chances of seeing combat. Plans by the Ministry of Defence to send William to Southern Iraq leaked and the government eventually decided against sending him as it would endanger both his life and the lives of people around him if he was targeted. William instead trained in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, obtaining his commission as a sub-lieutenant in the former and a flying officer in the latter, both broadly equivalent to the army rank of lieutenant. After completing his training, he undertook an attachment with the Royal Air Force at RAF Cranwell.\nUpon completing the course he was presented with his RAF wings by his father, who had received his own wings after training at Cranwell. During this secondment, William flew to Afghanistan in a C-17 Globemaster that repatriated the body of Trooper Robert Pearson. William was then seconded to train with the Royal Navy. He then completed an accelerated Naval Officer training course at the Britannia Royal Naval College. Whilst serving on HMS \"Iron Duke\" in July 2008, William participated in a \u00a340m drug seizure in the Atlantic, north-east of Barbados. He was part of the crew on the Lynx helicopter which helped seize 900\u00a0kg of cocaine from a speedboat.\nIn January 2009, William transferred his commission to the RAF and was promoted to Flight Lieutenant. He trained to become a helicopter pilot with the RAF's Search and Rescue Force. As part of his training across all branches of the military in 2009, he spent up to six weeks with the Special Air Service, the Special Boat Service, and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment. In January 2010, he graduated from the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury. In the same month, he transferred to the Search and Rescue Training Unit at RAF Valley, Anglesey, to receive training on the Sea King search and rescue helicopter; he graduated in September 2010. This made him the first member of the British royal family since Henry VII to live in Wales.\nWilliam's first rescue mission as co-pilot of a RAF Sea King was in response to an emergency call from Liverpool Coastguard in October 2010. In November 2011, he participated in a search-and-rescue mission involving a cargo ship that was sinking in the Irish Sea; William, as a co-pilot, helped rescue two sailors. He was deployed to the Falkland Islands for a six-week tour with No. 1564 Flight from February to March 2012. The Argentine government condemned William's deployment to the islands close to the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the Falklands War as a \"provocative act\". In June 2012, he gained a qualification to be captain or pilot in command of a Sea King rather than a co-pilot. His active service as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot ended in September 2013. He conducted 156 search and rescue operations, which resulted in 149 people being rescued. He later became patron of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.\nIn July 2015, William began working full-time as a pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance (EAAA) based at Cambridge Airport, which he felt was a natural progression from his previous search-and-rescue role. He donated his full salary to the EAAA charity. William required a civil pilot's licence and further training before being permitted to begin his role. He underwent part of his training at Norwich Airport. William described working irregular shifts and dealing mostly with critical care cases. He also discussed the impact of witnessing intensive trauma and bereavement on his mental health and personal life. The BBC has written that William was \"exposed to the National Health Service in a way that no other senior royal has been or possibly ever will be.\"\nWilliam left his position with EAAA in July 2017 to assume full-time royal duties. After supporting an anniversary campaign for London's Air Ambulance Charity in 2019, he became the charity's official patron in March 2020. In May 2020, he granted permission to the charity to use Kensington Palace's private lawn to refuel during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2023, he became patron of the Wales Air Ambulance charity.\nPersonal life.\nRelationship with Catherine Middleton.\nIn 2001 William met Catherine Middleton, while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall, at the University of St Andrews, and they became close friends. She reportedly caught William's attention at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002. During their second year, William shared a flat with Middleton and two other friends. The couple began dating in 2003. From 2003 to 2005 they both resided at Balgove House on the Strathtyrum estate with two roommates. They began staying at a cottage on the Balmoral estate known as Tam-Na-Ghar, which was a gift from the Queen Mother to William shortly before her death. The property has remained a private retreat for the couple in subsequent years. In 2004 the couple briefly split but reconciled soon afterwards.\nThe relationship was followed closely by the tabloid press. Media attention became so intense that William asked the press to keep their distance from Middleton. In December 2006, Middleton and her family attended William's passing out parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. In April 2007, William and Middleton were reported to have split. Middleton and her family attended the Concert for Diana three months later; the couple were subsequently reported to have \"rekindled their relationship\". She also attended the Order of the Garter procession at Windsor Castle in June 2008, where William was made a Royal Knight of the Garter. In June 2010, the couple moved into a cottage on the Bodorgan Estate in Anglesey, Wales, where they resided until 2014.\nMarriage and children.\nThe couple became engaged in October 2010, at a remote alpine cabin on Mount Kenya, during a 10-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate William's passing the RAF helicopter search and rescue course. Clarence House announced their engagement on 16 November. William gave his fianc\u00e9e his mother's engagement ring. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011. The global audience for the wedding ranged around 300\u00a0million, whereas 26\u00a0million watched the event live in Britain alone. \nWilliam and Catherine used Nottingham Cottage as their London residence until 2013, when \u00a34.5 million renovations completed at Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace, which continues to be their official residence in the capital. The couple were given the country house Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham House estate, as a wedding gift from the Queen, where they lived from 2015 to 2017. Kensington Palace was the couple's primary residence until 2022, and Adelaide Cottage in Windsor until October 2025. Forest Lodge is their current residence.\nCatherine was admitted on 22 July 2013 to the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London, where Prince William had been delivered. Later that day, she gave birth to Prince George. She was admitted on 2 May 2015 to the same hospital where she gave birth to Princess Charlotte the same day. Their third child, Prince Louis, was born on 23 April 2018.

He and Catherine toured Canada that summer. Nicholas Witchell, writing for BBC News, described the tour as an \"unqualified success\", noting the couple's relaxed approach\u2014from tree planting to street hockey\u2014charmed the public and bolstered support for the monarchy.

In November 2020, it was reported that William had tested positive for COVID-19 in April but decided not to alert the media to 'avoid alarming the nation'. \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported he had been \"very ill\" and had isolated away from his family; other sources said that he had not been seriously ill, not bed-ridden and working for most of the time. In December that year, the couple embarked on a tour of England, Scotland, and Wales via the British royal train \"to pay tribute to the inspiring work\" of communities and charities in 2020.

In May 2022, he attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time as a counsellor of state, where his father delivered the Queen's Speech on behalf of Elizabeth II.\nPrince of Wales.\nQueen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, and William's father succeeded as Charles III. William, now heir apparent, was created Prince of Wales by his father on 9 September. Controversy regarding the title became a topic of public debate in Wales. Senedd Llywydd Elin Jones said an investiture was not constitutionally required and likely unnecessary, a view echoed by Kensington Palace, which stated it was \"not on the table\". As the eldest son of the British monarch, William inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, a \u00a31.3 billion private estate established in 1337 to provide a private income to the monarch's eldest son. The duchy paid him in his first full year as Duke of Cornwall.\nWilliam and Catherine visited Anglesey and Swansea on 27 September 2022, which marked their first visit to Wales since becoming Prince and Princess of Wales.

In 2014 Jane Goodall stated that William had expressed the view that all ivory in the royal collection needed to be destroyed. William has occasionally commented on the effects of overpopulation on the wildlife of Africa, but his remarks have been criticised in the media for not taking resource consumption and population density into consideration.\nAfter two years of research, William launched the Earthshot Prize in October 2020, designed to provide funding and incentive for environmental solutions over the next decade.

Legacy programmes include Mental Health at Work, launched in September 2018 to change the approach to workplace mental health in the United Kingdom, as well as Heads Up, launched in May 2019 in partnership with the Football Association, utilising football to affect the conversation surrounding mental health in adults. Later that month, William and Catherine, together with William's brother Harry and sister-in-law Meghan, launched Shout, the United Kingdom's first 24/7 text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues. William later volunteered on the crisis helpline during the COVID-19 lockdowns to provide support via text message.

In 2022 and 2023 he was spotted selling copies of The Big Issue, usually sold by homeless and unemployed people to earn money.\nIn June 2023, William launched Homewards after two years of development, with aims to end homelessness in the United Kingdom. The five-year initiative aims to tackle homelessness in six pilot locations across the United Kingdom with an initial seed funding allocated for each area by the Royal Foundation, working with existing private sector and grassroots charity partners. The project focuses on early intervention and providing housing to families before other issues, such as abuse and joblessness, are addressed. In February 2024, William, in partnership with Cornish charity St Petrocs, announced plans for building 24 homes on Duchy of Cornwall land in Nansledan to provide temporary accommodation for people experiencing homelessness in the area. Future plans include building more than 400 social rented homes and a further 475 affordable dwellings in South East Faversham.\nSport.\nWilliam often plays polo to raise money for charity. He is a fan of football, and supports the English club Aston Villa. He became president of England's Football Association (FA) in May 2006 and vice-royal patron of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in February 2007, supporting the Queen as patron. The same year, the WRU's decision to name the Prince William Cup drew criticism as some believed it would have been more appropriate to name it after Ray Gravell. William became patron of the WRU and the FA in 2016 and 2024, respectively.\nIn December 2010, William, alongside David Cameron, attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon at which Chung suggested a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England. The English delegation reported the suggestion to FIFA, considering it a violation of anti-collusion rules. In 2011 William, as president of the English FA, voted against Australia's 2022 FIFA bid and instead voted for South Korea, despite being Australia's future heir.

In May 2014, William, like his father and grandfather, became president of the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC). He also took part in a bandy event in Stockholm in January 2018.\nIn November 2022, William was criticised by Welsh football followers and Welsh actor Michael Sheen for holding the Prince of Wales title whilst having affiliations with the England national football team, particularly after he presented jerseys to the squad in advance of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in which both Wales and England were placed in the same Group B. William commented that he had supported the England football team from a very young age, but happily supported Welsh rugby union, of which he is patron, over England. In August 2023, he was criticised in segments of the press and social media for not attending 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final in Australia as president of the FA.\nPublic image.\nWilliam has been one of the most popular members of the British royal family since his birth. Having lived a public life since birth, he was regarded as a \"heartthrob\" and eligible as a young adult, similar to his father. Ruth La Ferla of \"The New York Times\" contrasted William's \"refined\" and \"polite\" appeal to Leonardo DiCaprio's \"bad-boy\" popularity. Following his marriage, William's public image assumed a more \"staid\" and fatherly demeanour, having \"settled into a stable domestic order\".\nAnne McElvoy has described William's public personality as a \"genial presence\" with a \"tougher side\", alongside his mother's \"inimitable style\". Much of his royal duties focus on \"big bet\" projects, rather than \"plaques and patronages\". In a 2016 interview, William said his aim was to keep the royal family relevant over the next 20 years. William and Catherine's close partnership has been described by \"The Times\" as a \"good double act\" with both valuing normality, privacy, and control.\nIn 2011 \"Time\" magazine listed him as one of the most influential people in the world alongside his then-newlywed wife Catherine. In August 2023, Gallup, Inc. named him as the most popular public figure in the US after conducting a survey that asked for people's views on 15 prominent individuals. He was found to be the most popular member of the royal family by YouGov in December 2022 and September 2023, and as the second most popular in April 2024. In December 2024, \"The Daily Telegraph\" included William in its annual list of best-dressed celebrities. In 2025 he was listed alongside Catherine on the inaugural \"Time\" 100 Philanthropy list; that year the couple also topped \"Tatler\"'s social power index.\nPrivacy and the media.\nThe death of Diana, Princess of Wales while being chased by the paparazzi in 1997 has shaped William and Catherine's guarded stance towards the media. They have repeatedly asked for privacy when off-duty.\nIn 2005 William spoke with the ITV reporter Tom Bradby and concluded that it was likely that their voicemails were being accessed. An investigation under then Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke concluded that the compromised voice mail accounts belonged to William's aides, including Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, and not the prince himself. However, Clive Goodman later stated that he had hacked William's phone on 35 occasions. Andy Coulson, the editor of \"News of the World\" from 2003 to 2007, apologised to William and his brother for invading their privacy, accepting \"ultimate responsibility\" for Goodman's actions. William later sued News Group Newspapers, publisher of \"News of the World\" and \"The Sun\", which resulted in an out-of-court settlement in 2020. He and Harry brought a private claim through mutual solicitors, but Harry later pursued it separately with a new one.\nAt the time of Middleton's 25th birthday in January 2007, William issued a statement expressing that the level of media intrusion had become intolerable. In October that year, he condemned the \"aggressive pursuit\" by photographers as the couple left a London nightclub. The Press Complaints Commission warned editors against publishing images obtained through harassment; the \"Daily Mail\", \"Daily Mirror\" and \"Daily Express\" complied, while \"The Sun\" ran shots taken before their car departed. In April 2009, William's lawyers secured an apology from the \"Daily Star\" over a false claim he had \"wrecked\" a $2 million training aircraft.\nIn September 2012, the French edition of \"Closer\" and Italian magazine \"Chi\" published topless photos of Catherine sunbathing at Ch\u00e2teau d'Autet. William and Catherine filed a criminal complaint and civil suit in Nanterre. A court granted an injunction banning further publication and launched a criminal inquiry. In 2017 \"Closer\" was fined \u20ac100,000, and its editor and owner \u20ac45,000 each.\nIn October 2014, Catherine and William issued a legal warning to a freelance photographer for \"harassing and following\" their son George and his nanny. In August 2015, Kensington Palace released a letter describing the media's \"dangerous\" efforts to photograph George and Charlotte.\nIn November 2016, William issued a statement supporting Harry and his girlfriend, Meghan Markle, following their complaints about the press intrusion. During a visit to the BBC studios in central London in November 2018, William criticised social media companies for failing to address misinformation and their role in fuelling social problems.\nIn June 2022, a three-minute video of William confronting Terry Harris, a paparazzi photographer, was posted on Harris' YouTube channel. It was recorded in January 2021 and shows William arguing with Harris as the latter attempts to film William's family on a bike ride near Anmer Hall. Kensington Palace called the video a privacy breach and requested its removal from public sites.\nIn October 2025, Prince Harry named William and Catherine in his court case against Associated Newspapers, alleging that private investigators had been employed to collect information about them, including a payment for details of William\u2019s 21st-birthday party in 2003. Later that month, he and Catherine won a privacy case in France against \"Paris Match\" over unauthorised photos from a family ski trip in the Alps.\nTitles, styles, and honours.\nTitles and styles.\nWilliam has been a British prince since birth, and was known as \"Prince William of Wales\" until April 2011. He was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus by Elizabeth II on the day of his wedding. The letters patent granting these titles were issued on 26 May that year.\nAs the eldest son of the monarch, William automatically became Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland on the accession of his father on 8 September 2022. From 8 to 9 September, William was styled as \"His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge\". On 9 September, Charles announced the creation of William as Prince of Wales, the traditional title for the male heir apparent to the British monarch. William has since been known as \"His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales\", except in Scotland, where he is called \"His Royal Highness the Duke of Rothesay\" instead. The letters patent formally granting him this title and that of Earl of Chester were issued on 13 February 2023.\nHonours.\nWilliam is a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter (KG), an Extra Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle (KT), Great Master of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (GCB), a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom (PC), and a Personal Aide-de-Camp (ADC) to the sovereign.\nAncestry.\nPatrilineally, William is a member of the House of Windsor and also descends from the House of Oldenburg, one of Europe's oldest royal houses. More specifically, he descends from the cadet branch known as the House of Gl\u00fccksburg.\nThrough his mother, William descends from the Earls Spencer\u00a0\u2013 a cadet branch of the Spencer family descended from the earls of Sunderland (the senior branch are now also dukes of Marlborough); the Barons Fermoy; and more anciently from Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond\u00a0\u2013 two illegitimate sons of King Charles II. As king, William would be the first monarch since the death of Anne in 1714 to undisputedly descend from Charles I and the first to descend from Charles II.\nWilliam descends matrilineally from Eliza Kewark, a housekeeper for his 18th-century ancestor Theodore Forbes\u00a0\u2013 a Scottish merchant who worked for the East India Company in Surat. She is variously described in contemporary documents as \"a dark-skinned native woman\", \"an Armenian woman from Bombay\", and \"Mrs. Forbesian\". Genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner assumed Kewark was Armenian. In June 2013, it was reported that genealogical DNA tests on two of William's distant matrilineal cousins confirm Kewark was matrilineally of Indian descent.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a broadcaster, he presented BBC Radio 2's \"The Best of Jazz\" for forty years, and hosted the comedy panel game \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\" on BBC Radio 4, becoming the UK's oldest panel game host.\nLyttelton was also a cartoonist, collaborating on the long-running \"Flook\" series in the \"Daily Mail\", and a calligrapher and president of The Society for Italic Handwriting.\nEarly life and career.\nLyttelton was born at Eton College (then in Buckinghamshire), where his father, George William Lyttelton (second son of the 8th Viscount Cobham), was a house master. (As a male-line descendant of Charles Lyttelton, Lyttelton was in remainder to both the Viscountcy Cobham and the Barony of Lyttelton.) From Sunningdale Preparatory School, Lyttelton duly progressed to Eton College. He was a first cousin of the 10th Viscount Cobham and of Viola Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster and a great-nephew of the politician and sportsman Alfred Lyttelton, the first man to represent England at both football and cricket, both of whom also attended Eton.\nAt Eton, Lyttelton fagged for Lord Carrington and formed his love of jazz. He was inspired by the trumpeters Louis Armstrong (who subsequently referred to Lyttelton as \"that cat in England who swings his ass off\") and Nat Gonella. He taught himself the instrument, and formed a quartet at the school in 1936 that included the future journalist Ludovic Kennedy on drums.\nAfter leaving school, Lyttelton spent some time at the Port Talbot steel plate works in South Wales, an experience which led to his becoming what he termed a \"romantic socialist\". After being called up for war service, he was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards as a second lieutenant on 29 November 1941 alongside future politician Mark Bonham Carter, and saw action at Salerno, Italy, during Operation Avalanche, when he came ashore with his pistol in one hand, and his trumpet in the other.\nOn VE Day, 8 May or 9 May 1945, Lyttelton joined in the celebrations by playing his trumpet from a wheelbarrow, inadvertently giving his first broadcast performance; the BBC recording still survives. Following demobilisation after World War II, he attended Camberwell Art College for two years.\nIn 1949, he joined the \"Daily Mail\" as a cartoonist, where he remained until 1956. He was one of the collaborators with Wally Fawkes on the long-running cartoon strip \"Flook\".\nThe jazzman.\nLyttelton received a grant for further study. He went to Camberwell School of Art, where he met Wally Fawkes, a fellow jazz enthusiast and clarinet-player, also known as the cartoonist \"Trog\". In 1949, Fawkes helped him to get a job with the \"Daily Mail\" writing the words for \"Flook\", Fawkes's comic strip. They had both joined the George Webb Dixielanders in 1947. Webb was an important catalyst in the British postwar jazz boom.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s Lyttelton was prominent in the British revival of traditional jazz forms from New Orleans, recording with Sidney Bechet in 1949. To do so he had to break with the Musicians' Union restrictive practices which forbade working with jazz musicians from the United States. In 1956, he had his only pop chart hit, with the Joe Meek-produced recording of \"Bad Penny Blues\", which was in the UK Singles Chart for six weeks.\nOver time, Lyttelton gradually shifted to a more mainstream approach favoured by American musicians such as trumpeter Buck Clayton. By 1953 he had begun to add saxophonists to the lineup. On one occasion in that year, the development did not meet with the approval of his fans. At a Birmingham Town Hall concert at which alto saxophonist Bruce Turner debuted, a banner with the words \"Go Home Dirty Bopper!\" was prominently unfolded.\nOccasionally, with the help of Eddie Harvey, he assembled a big band for BBC broadcasts and records. In 1957 and 1958 blues singer Jimmy Rushing toured England with the band, as did Clayton, Vic Dickenson and Big Joe Turner in 1965. Clayton recorded with Lyttelton in the early 1960s and toured with the band on numerous occasions. Clayton considered himself and Lyttelton to be brothers. He also recorded with visiting Americans Al Casey, Buddy Tate, and Kenny Davern.\nHe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1958, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.\nBy now his repertoire had expanded, including not only lesser known Duke Ellington pieces, but even \"The Champ\" from Dizzy Gillespie's band book. The Lyttelton band\u2014he saw himself primarily as a leader\u2014helped develop the careers of many now prominent British musicians, including Tony Coe and Alan Barnes.\nIn 1983, Lyttelton formed Calligraph Records, which reissued some of his old recordings, all future recordings by his band, and recordings by band members.\nOn 11 March 2008, he announced that he would cease presenting BBC Radio 2's \"Best of Jazz\".\nOn 23 July 2008, Lyttelton was posthumously named BBC Radio 2 Jazz Artist of the Year, voted by radio listeners.\nHumphrey Lyttelton Band.\nFor several years during the postwar period at 100 Oxford Street his regular band included Wally Fawkes, the Christie brothers, Pat Hawes and Johnny Parker. From 1958, Lyttelton's favoured line-up was an eight\u2013piece band with three saxophones (alto, tenor and baritone), although this was reduced to seven occasionally to save money. But he would sometimes add the baritone again for broadcasts and recordings.\nLyttelton's mainstream band usually included such established musicians as Jimmy Skidmore, Joe Temperley, Kathy Stobart, Jimmy Hastings, Mike McKenzie, John Barnes, Roy Williams and Pete Strange along with new talent such as Tony Coe, Alan Barnes, John Picard, Karen Sharpe, and Jo Fooks. Lyttelton regarded his band as a family, with some members returning to the fold after periods away and/or staying for long periods (Bruce Turner, Stan Greig, Adrian Macintosh, Stobart, Hastings).\nThe band maintained a busy schedule, frequently performing sold-out shows across the country. Performances occasionally included a guest singer, or a collaboration with another band. During the 1990s the band toured with Helen Shapiro in a series of \"Humph and Helen\" concerts. They also featured in several Giants of British Jazz tours with Acker Bilk and George Melly and John Chilton's Feetwarmers.\nLyttelton had a long established professional relationship with UK singer Elkie Brooks. After working together in the early 1960s they rekindled their working partnership in early 2000 with a series of sold-out and well-received concert performances. In early 2000, the band played on the track \"Life in a Glasshouse\" on Radiohead's album \"Amnesiac\", released the following year. In 2003, they released the critically acclaimed album \"Trouble in Mind\" and continued to perform occasional concerts. Lyttelton introduced American vocalist Stacey Kent to British audiences.\nLyttelton's last band featured, apart from himself on trumpet and clarinet: Ray Wordsworth on trombone; Jimmy Hastings on alto sax, clarinet and flute; Jo Fooks on tenor saxophone and flute; Rob Fowler on tenor sax, baritone sax and clarinet; Ted Beament on piano; John Rees-Jones on double bass and Adrian Macintosh on drums. His last formal recordings, one track each on trumpet and clarinet, appeared on his last CD 'Cornucopia 3', (CLG CD 46) all of which he supervised. Trumpet on the other tracks was played by Tony Fisher. He made some recordings as a vocalist.\nAfter his death, part of Lyttelton's appearance with his 2007 Band, (with Karen Sharpe instead of Robert Fowler), at the Brecon Jazz Festival, in which he was joined by American tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton was shown by BBCtv as a tribute, (\"Humph's Last Stand\"). The band continues to give concerts performing his music. The trumpet part is played by Tony Fisher with occasional guest spots by singer Sue Richardson and ex\u2013Lytteltonians such as Karen Sharp.\nRadio personality.\nFrom 1967 until April 2007, Lyttelton presented \"The Best of Jazz\" on BBC Radio 2, a programme that featured his idiosyncratic mix of recordings from all periods of the music's history, including current material. In 2007 he chose to cut his commitment to two quarterly seasons per year, in order to spend more time on other projects.\nIn 1972 Lyttelton was chosen to host the comedy panel game \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\" (\"ISIHAC\") on BBC Radio 4. The show was originally devised as a comedic antidote to traditional BBC panel games (both radio and television), which had come to be seen as dull and formulaic, and in keeping with the staid middle-class \"Auntie Beeb\" image. Lyttelton continued in this role until shortly before he died, and was known for both his deadpan, disgruntled, and occasionally bewildered style of chairmanship, and for his near-the-knuckle double entendres and innuendo which, despite always being open to an innocent interpretation, were, according to William Rushton, \"the filthiest thing on radio\".\nThe programme's success had considerable influence on the manner in which comedy was presented on radio, and Lyttelton's persona was a significant part of that success: he was a straight man surrounded by mayhem. At the time of his death, Lyttelton was the oldest active panel game host in the UK, being two and a half years older than his closest rival, Nicholas Parsons.\nAs well as his other activities, Lyttelton was a keen calligrapher and President of The Society for Italic Handwriting. He named his own record label \"Calligraph\" after this extracurricular interest. This label, founded in the early 1980s, not only issues his own albums and those of associates, but also re-issues (on CD) his analogue recordings for the Parlophone label in the 1950s. He is reported to have turned down a knighthood in 1995.\nPersonal life.\nLyttelton was married twice. His first wife was Patricia Mary Braithwaite (born 1929), whom he married on 19 August 1948. They had one daughter, Henrietta (born 1949). In 1952, following his divorce, he married (Elizabeth) Jill Richardson (1933\u20132006), with whom he had two sons and a daughter, Stephen (born 1955) and David (born 1958), and Georgina (born 1963).\nDespite his celebrity, he was intensely private. The house he had designed by John Voelcker in Arkley, Barnet, Greater London, had blank walls on the outside and the windows opening onto an internal courtyard. He hated using the telephone and kept his number ex-directory, changing it if anybody else discovered it. Given his dislike of the telephone, he communicated by post, including letters hiring and firing members of his band.\nHe twice refused state honours which were offered to him. One occasion was in 1976, and in 1994 he declined the knighthood offered by Downing Street: his son Stephen later wrote that \"Accepting it was never an option but he still felt sick to the stomach. He kept it from all of us, especially my mother who would have exerted a lot of pressure on him to accept, seeing it as recognition for all his work.\"\nIllness and death.\nOn 18 April 2008, Jon Naismith, the producer of \"I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue\", announced the cancellation of the spring series due to Lyttelton's hospitalisation to repair an aortic aneurysm. Rob Brydon and others were asked to deputise for Lyttelton during the tour shows, but Lyttelton postponed his operation and managed to perform on all but the last night. A further email on 21 April 2008 reported that the BBC were \"unclear precisely how long Humph's recovery period will be\" but Lyttelton was \"otherwise fine and in very good spirits\".\nOn 22 April 2008, Lyttelton and the \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\" team were booked to appear in the stage version of the programme at the Pavilion Theatre, Bournemouth. Because of his illness, his place was taken by Rob Brydon, but a pre-recorded message from Lyttelton was played to the audience (\"I'm sorry I can't be with you today as I am in hospital\u2014I wish I'd thought of this sooner!\"). The panellists on that night were Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, Barry Cryer and Jeremy Hardy.\nLyttelton died following his surgery on 25 April 2008, with his family around him. After his death was reported, members of the public began leaving flowers at Mornington Crescent station. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 1995 episode of \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\" as a tribute on Sunday 27 April, and a retrospective programme presented by Kenneth Clarke on Wednesday 30 April 2008. Radio 4 celebrated \"Humphrey Lyttelton Day\" on Sunday 15 June 2008, including a new profile of \"ISIHAC\" by Stephen Fry called \"Chairman Humph\u00a0\u2013 A Tribute\".\nAfter his death, the controller of Radio 4, Mark Damazer, said: \"He's just a colossally good broadcaster and possessed of this fantastic sense of timing.\u00a0... It's a very, very sad day but we should celebrate and be very grateful for how much he did for Radio 4, really terrific.\"\nResponding to news of Lyttelton's death, Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood wrote on the band's website: \"We were all sorry to hear of Humphrey Lyttelton's death\u2014he was an inspiring person to record with, and without his direction, we'd never have recorded/released 'Life in a Glasshouse'. So go and find 'Bad Penny Blues', and celebrate his life with some hot jazz.\"\nLyttelton is survived by his four children: a daughter from his first marriage to Pat Braithwaite, and two sons and a daughter from his second marriage to Jill Richardson. Richardson, to whom he had been married since 1952, predeceased him in 2006. His Humanist funeral took place on 6 May 2008 at the St Marylebone Crematorium (which shares grounds with East Finchley Cemetery) in East Finchley, north London. Lyttelton regarded himself as a Humanist.\nOn 25 April 2010, two years after Lyttelton's death, a celebratory concert entitled \"Humphrey Lyttelton\u00a0\u2014 A Celebration Concert\" was held at the Hammersmith Apollo to celebrate his life, works and contribution to music. Singer Elkie Brooks and many prominent British jazz musicians appeared at the concert, along with panellists from \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\". The event was organised and hosted by his son Stephen Lyttelton, who is also the founder and Chairman of The Humph Trust, an organisation set up after his death to support young up and coming jazz musicians and to provide sponsorship and support.\nThe event was opened by the 2010 winner of the Humphrey Lyttelton Royal Academy of Music Jazz Award, Tom Walsh, who played Horace Silver's \"Song for my Father\" with his quintet from the Royal Academy of Music.\nThe Lyttelton Arms pub, opposite Mornington Crescent station in Camden, is named after Lyttelton. It was formerly named The Southampton Arms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is endemic to the western U.S. state of California, being especially frequent in and around the San Francisco Bay Area.\nDescription.\n\"Trillium chloropetalum\" is a perennial, clump-forming herbaceous plant with a thick underground rhizome. Like all trilliums, it has a whorl of three bracts (leaves) and a single trimerous flower with 3\u00a0sepals, 3\u00a0petals, two whorls of 3\u00a0stamens each, and 3\u00a0carpels fused into a single ovary with 3\u00a0stigmas. Since its flower has no stalk, \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\" belongs to subgenus \"Sessilia\", the sessile-flowered trilliums. It is one of the largest of all \"Trillium\" species, with a scape (stem) from long. The bracts are broadly ovate, long and wide, usually with brownish mottling but sometimes unmottled. Petal color is highly variable, typically ranging from pale greenish yellow to greenish bronze (or purplish green) to dark purple. A variety that lacks yellow pigments has petal colors ranging from white to reddish-purple. The flower petals enclose purple stamens, long, and a purple ovary. Flowering occurs from late February to early April.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, a white-petaled form of \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\" is often confused with \"T.\u00a0albidum\", which also has white petals. The former is distinguished by the purple pigment in its anther connective tissue, a character lacking in \"T.\u00a0albidum\".\nTaxonomy.\nIn 1856, John Torrey described \"Trillium sessile\" var.\u00a0\"chloropetalum\" based on a specimen collected by John Milton Bigelow two years earlier in the \"redwoods\" of California. At the time, Bigelow was exploring the valleys and tributaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, but the precise original location of his specimen remains unknown. In 1903, Thomas Jefferson Howell described the species \"Trillium chloropetalum\" based on Torrey's variety. The epithet \"chloropetalum\" means \"green-petaled\".105\nIn 1975, John Daniel Freeman published an influential revision of subgenus \"Sessilia\" that included the description of a new species \"Trillium albidum\" J.D.Freeman and a completely new circumscription of \"Trillium chloropetalum\" (Torr.) Howell. By separating out white-flowered \"T.\u00a0albidum\", Freeman was able to provide a rational circumscription of \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\" that includes the following taxa:\nThe petals of \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\" var. \"chloropetalum\" always show yellow pigments but these are often masked by purple or other pigments. In contrast, the petals of \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\" var. \"giganteum\" lack yellow pigments altogether. The former is characterized by the green-petaled form described by Torrey while the latter includes a white-flowered form of \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\" distinguished from \"T.\u00a0albidum\" by the presence of dark purple stamens and carpels.\nFreeman's treatment of \"Trillium chloropetalum\" is widely (if not universally) accepted. Some authorities consider \"Trillium chloropetalum\" var.\u00a0\"giganteum\" to be a synonym for \"Trillium chloropetalum\", but even those authorities cite Freeman.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Trillium chloropetalum\" is endemic to California. Some authorities claim the species ranges across ten California counties, from Monterey County on the central California coast to Lake County in the north central part of the state:\nOther authorities claim that \"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\" has a broader range that extends northward to Siskiyou County or southward to Santa Barbara County.\n\"T.\u00a0chloropetalum\" is found at the edges of redwood forests and chaparral, usually on moist slopes, canyon banks, and alluvial soils.\nUses.\nThe variety \"Trillium chloropetalum\" var.\u00a0\"giganteum\", with its deep maroon flower petals, gained the Award of Garden Merit (AGM) from the Royal Horticultural Society in 1993.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72206", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72206", "title": "Ricimer", "text": "General and ruler of the Western Roman Empire (c. 418\u2013472)\nRicimer ( , ; c.\u2009418 \u2013 19 August 472) was a Romanized Germanic general, who ruled the remaining territory of the Western Roman Empire from 456 after defeating Avitus, until his death in 472, with a brief interlude in which he contested power with Procopius Anthemius. Deriving his power from his position as \"magister militum\" of the Western Empire, Ricimer exercised political control through a series of puppet emperors. Ricimer's death led to unrest across Italy and the establishment of a Germanic kingdom on the Italian Peninsula.\nLineage.\nThe date of Ricimer's birth is unknown. Some scholars have dated it as late as the early 430s, which would have made him unusually young when he rose to power. A birthdate of around 418 is more likely. The names of his parents are also unknown. In his panegyric to Anthemius, given in 468, the poet Sidonius Apollinaris claimed that Ricimer was Suevic on his father's side and Visigothic on his mother's, specifying that his maternal grandfather was Wallia, King of the Visigoths, who died in 418. It has been suggested that his Suevic father may have been a son of Hermeric, the king of the Suevi around 418, or else possibly Hermegarius, a Suevic war leader who died in 429.\nIt has been surmised that Ricimer was the offspring of a marriage alliance between the ruling Suevic and Gothic houses and although Ricimer's father was identified as a Sueve, his identity is more frequently attested as Gothic by ancient writers. Such an alliance has been suggested as occurring in the year 431, but a more likely date is anterior to Wallia's death in 418. Wallia's Visigothic successors were not his close relatives and may have been hostile toward the family members of the former king.\nAs entry into the Western Empire's military was a frequent option for \"losers of struggles for leadership among the barbarians\", Ricimer's family may have entered the service of Rome. Historian Peter Heather suggests that the lack of stability among the Visigoths themselves may have incentivized Ricimer's pursuit of an \"entirely Roman career\", despite being \"the grandson of the Visigothic king Wallia\".\nLike many Germanic figures of note, Ricimer had relational ties to other tribes, like the Burgundians. For instance, Gundobad, Ricimer's \"subordinate and successor\", was his nephew since his sister had married the Burgundian king Gondioc.\nRise to power.\nAccording to Sidonius Apollinaris, Ricimer served under the \"magister militum\" Aetius alongside the \"comes domesticorum\" Majorian, whom he befriended. Historian Penny MacGeorge writes, \"Majorian certainly, and Ricimer probably, had served under Aetius, and there may have been other elements to this connection, political, personal, and social, that would have brought them both close to the centers of political power.\"\nNonetheless, a power vacuum was created in the Western Empire after the events of 454 and 455, which saw the consecutive murders of Aetius and of the Western Emperor Valentinian III, who had been responsible for the \"magister militum\"'s assassination. After the assassinations, the Roman Senator Petronius Maximus proclaimed himself emperor. Petronius's reign lasted less than three months, as shortly before the Vandal sacking of Rome in 455, he too was murdered.\nAfter Rome's sack, the Visigothic King Theodoric II proclaimed Avitus as Emperor, the Roman military commander in Gaul. In return for Theodoric II's support, Avitus agreed to allow the Visigoths to enter Suevi-controlled Hispania. After being proclaimed the new emperor in 456, Avitus mounted a campaign into Italy but was defeated in the Po Valley. In the interim, Avitus had named the Visigoth Remistus as \"magister militum\".\nFollowing the arrival of Avitus in Rome, Majorian gave his support, albeit reluctantly, to the new emperor. Avitus is subsequently thought to have appointed Ricimer as \"comes\", a prominent military position, but this remains unclear and it is possible that Ricimer was \"comes\" before the elevation of Avitus. At this point, however, the Western Empire encompassed only the Italian Peninsula and portions of southern Gaul, a mere fraction of the territory held by imperial Rome in previous centuries. Ricimer, nonetheless, raised an army and navy from the Germanic mercenaries available to him and commenced campaigns directed against \"barbarian\" tribes in conflict with the empire. Ricimer achieved his first important victory in 456, when he defeated the Vandals in the Battle of Agrigentum and the Battle of Corsica. Although Priscus writes that Avitus had sent him to Sicily to engage the Vandals, Hydatius states Ricimer defeated the Vandals near Corsica.\nThe revolt against Avitus.\nVandal raids and civil disaffection\u2014due in part to famine\u2014proved problematic for Avitus. Not only was he never recognized as Emperor of the West by the eastern Emperor Marcian, Avitus found himself in an especially precarious position since disruptive events had hardly settled when Ricimer and Majorian rebelled against their former patron. The two led an army against Avitus's imperial forces commanded by the \"magister militum\" Remistus, whom they defeated; Remistus was executed at Ravenna in September 456 under \"obscure circumstances\". Avitus fled to Gaul to gather support from his Visigothic and Gallic followers but was defeated in the Battle of Placentia on 17 October 456. Avitus was captured, deposed, and forced to assume the bishopric of Piacenza, and finally executed\u2014allegedly starved to death by Majorian and Ricimer.\nMajorian (457\u2013461).\nAs Ricimer gained influence over the Germanic peoples occupying Gaul, Hispania, and Northern Africa, the sources suggest he and Majorian were operating in concert to seize power; the latter would become the future emperor, while Ricimer would command the military. Since Ricimer was a Germanic tribesman of Arian religious disposition, he was ineligible for the imperial throne himself. Whether or not he wished to be emperor is unknown, but in many respects, Ricimer can be viewed as an \"heir of Stilicho\", a barbarian general who served the Roman Empire faithfully.\nWith the throne of the Western Empire vacant, the Alamanni invaded Italy. They moved from Raetia and managed to reach Lake Maggiore on the south side of the Alps. Majorian led his field army north to fight the Alamanni, and defeated them. Reaching an agreement with Ricimer, Majorian was proclaimed emperor on 1 April 457. Realizing Majorian's potential as a puppet, Ricimer induced Leo to give his consent to this arrangement and on 28 December 457, Majorian's elevation to Emperor in the West was officially recognized by Constantinople.\nLeo may not have actually wanted to see Majorian on the throne, but he was in \"no position to object\" since Majorian had a coalition that included the palatinate at Ravenna, Ricimer's Italian army, the Gallo-Roman general Aegidius, and Theodoric the Great. Leo also granted Ricimer the rank of .\nMajorian proved to be quite a capable ruler, to such a degree that historian Michael Grant claims he was \"the last competent emperor the west ever produced\". The new emperor demonstrated his military skill via campaigns in Gaul and Hispania against the Vandals and the Visigoths\u2014atop instituting diplomatic and economic reforms\u2014which greatly increased Majorian's standing among the senate and army, prompting Sidonius to produce a panegyric. Sometime in 458, Majorian staved off an Alamanni attack on Raetia and a Vandal assault on Campania. In 460, Majorian then prepared to lead a campaign by embarking from Spain against the Vandals of King Gaiseric. However, before the invasion was launched, the bulk of Majorian's fleet was sunk in the harbor at Cartagena, resulting in a blow to Roman prestige and to Majorian's reputation, which Ricimer exploited.\nDuring his absence, Ricimer convinced the senate to turn against the emperor, who soon disbanded his army and returned to Italy. Learning that the emperor was in Tortona, Ricimer led a detachment there and arrested him. With the Western throne vacant, the new Eastern Emperor, Leo I, appointed Ricimer to replace Majorian in his Italian command. Without a Western Emperor, Leo hoped to use Ricimer as his effective vice-regent in the West. Deposing Majorian on 3 August 461, Ricimer had the emperor tortured and finally beheaded.\nLibius Severus (461\u2013465).\nRicimer's murder of Majorian did not sit well with some portions of the military establishment, especially the commanding general in Gaul, Aegidius, and the commanding general in Dalmatia, Marcellinus, who ruled their respective domains independent from imperial authority. These two generals entered into open hostilities with Ricimer and refused to recognize Ricimer's position. Ricimer ruled the West without an emperor for three months. Facing pressure from the Senate and Italian aristocracy, Ricimer named the undistinguished Senator Libius Severus as Emperor on 19 November 461; Severus was recognized by the Senate in Rome, but the Eastern Emperor Leo I refused to acknowledge him as his Western counterpart.\nAlthough he faced open military opposition from Western generals, with the docile Severus as emperor, Ricimer was master of Rome and Italy. The principal problem facing Ricimer during Severus' reign was the lengthy war against the Vandals\u2014who controlled Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, the Balearics, and Sicily, while also making incursions into mainland Greece and Italy\u2014and political opposition from the Eastern Empire.\nIn 461, Ricimer suborned the Huns under Marcellinus, who was compelled to abandon Sicily. Sometime in 463, Ricimer defeated a contingent of Visigoths at Orleans, formerly an Alan stronghold. Then in 464, Ricimer commanded an army that met an invading Alan host at the Battle of Bergamo, where he defeated the invaders and killed their king, Beorgor.\nDue to diminished tax revenues and with the key armies of the West under opposition control, Ricimer needed assistance from the East to maintain order in the West. As such, Severus, despite his docile nature, represented an obstacle to Ricimer's power and a hindrance to any reconciliation efforts with Leo or Geiseric. On 14 November 465, Libius Severus died. According to Cassiodorus, he was poisoned by Ricimer, but this reconstruction is doubted on the basis of Sidonius Apollinaris. Ricimer proceeded to rule the West for eighteen months without an emperor as he waited for Leo to name Severus' successor.\nAnthemius (467\u2013472).\nFor nearly two years, the throne in the West remained vacant, until 14 April 467, when Leo named the Greek aristocrat and son-in-law of Marcian, Anthemius, to the position. Leo's motivation included pressure from the Vandals, and perhaps the removal of a potential rival at Constantinople. Meanwhile, Ricimer married Anthemius's daughter Alypia, solidifying his connection to the emperor and providing the appearance of unity between the two-halves of the Empire. The marriage was an extravagant affair with much pomp and show, and the union appears to have garnered support from the Roman population. On this occasion, Sidonius composed a lengthy panegyric to Anthemius and within it praises Ricimer; he claims that a goddess representing Italy speaks to the river god of the Tiber thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Furthermore, unconquerable Ricimer, to whom the destiny of the state looks anxiously, his own efforts alone hardly repulse the pirate who roves across the countryside, who avoids battle, who becomes the victor by flight. Who could endure such an enemy who refuses both peace and war? For he will never make a treaty with Ricimer. Harken to why he hates him so much. He is born of an uncertain father, while a slavewoman was certainly his mother. Now, [to show] that he is the son of a king, he proclaims his mother's adultery. Especially he envies Ricimer because two kingdoms call him to kingship; for he is Suevian through his father and Gothic through his mother. And at the same time he [Gaiseric] remembers that in the Tartesian lands [i.e. Spain] his grandfather Vallia, cast down the Vandal armies and their allies in war the Alans\u00a0... But why relate ancient flights and former defeats? He [Gaiseric] recalls his losses on the plain of Agrigentum. Ever since then he rages, because he knows that he [Ricimer] is the true grandson of the hero at whose sight the Vandals always turned in flight [Vallia]. Certainly you Marcellus were no more glorious when you returned from the lands of Sicily\u00a0... Noricum holds back the Ostrogoth because he [Ricimer] is feared; Gaul ties down the might of the Rhine because he inspires terror; because the Vandal hosts and their relatives the Alans plundered me [Italy] bare, he himself then took vengeance by his own arms. But, for all that, he is only one man; who can only accept so many risks alone.\nLeo sent Anthemius to Italy with an army led by the commanding general of the Dalmatian Army, Marcellinus, a former rival of Ricimer. Ricimer must have initially viewed Anthemius' appointment as undermining his position, for unlike Libius Severus, Anthemius had a proven history of military success and had family ties to the Theodosian Dynasty. However, needing the support of the Eastern Empire, Ricimer was forced to accept him as the price for Leo's good will and for \"eastern protection against the depredations of Geiseric\".\nSoon after assuming the Western throne, Anthemius granted Marcellinus the rank of patrician in an effort to counterbalance the authority of Ricimer. Both Leo and Anthemius had seen the difficulty Western Emperors had in maintaining control over the Western military with the existence of a single unchallenged supreme commander. Despite these potential machinations, sources such as Ennodius attest to the power and influence of Ricimer, who once wrote that Ricimer was directing governmental affairs at this time and was \"second only to the Emperor Anthemius\".\nCampaign in North Africa.\nIn 468, Leo organized a grand campaign against the Vandals in North Africa, to which the East and West would commit substantial forces. The commanding general of the Thracian army, Basiliscus, brother-in-law of Leo, assumed supreme command over the joint East-West assault, with Marcellinus commanding the Western forces. The plan called for a three-pronged attack led by Basiliscus, Marcellinus, and Heraclius of Edessa, the (military count) of Egypt. Basiliscus was to land at a distance from Carthage with the main army (transported by an armada of over 1,000 ships) and then link up with Heraclius, advancing from Tripolitania. Marcellinus was to invade Africa from Sicily. Ricimer, under the overall command of Marcellinus, commanded a large portion of the Western forces in the expedition, but their fleet never sailed\u2014due to Ricimer's veto\u2014despite the West having agreed to contribute one-fourth of the total expedition's costs. Despite the other prongs of the attack making good progress at the onset, at least half of the joint armada was destroyed by Geiseric's fireships, causing Basilicus to abandon the attack against Carthage and withdraw back to Sicily. At this stage, Marcellinus was suddenly murdered while in Sicily, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer.\nConsequences of failure.\nThe failed joint expedition against the Vandals was a \"shock to Roman prestige\". This combined military venture\u2014known otherwise as the Battle of Cape Bon (468)\u2014was an unequivocal disaster that reduced Roman military might and also nearly bankrupted the Western and Eastern Empires alike, certainly dooming the Western half \"to extinction\" according to historian Peter Heather. Upon hearing of the disastrous defeat, the Visigoths resumed their wars of expansion against the West and the Burgundians expanded their kingdom towards Arles. With Marcellinus dead, Geiseric recommenced his attacks upon Italy in 470, which forced Ricimer\u2014as the sole commander in the West\u2014to assume command of Italy's defense against the Vandals. Marcellinus had been Anthemius' favorite of the two generals, and his death served to widen the divide between the emperor and Ricimer. The tipping point of their relationship was the trial of Romanus, the imperial chancellor () and supporter of Ricimer, whom Anthemius accused of treason and condemned to death in 470. Following the execution of Romanus by Anthemius, Ricimer moved north to Milan with a force of six thousand soldiers. Relations between the two deteriorated to the point that Epiphanius of Pavia, bishop of Milan, was asked to negotiate peace between them.\nDespite the bishop's efforts, the two were irreconcilable and began insulting one another; Anthemius called Ricimer a \"skin-clad Goth\", while Ricimer referred to the emperor as \"an excitable Galatian\". By 472, open warfare broke out between them, during which Ricimer marched on Rome itself, a siege that lasted many months. Four months into the assault on Rome, Ricimer named Olybrius (the brother-in-law of Geiseric) to the throne in a move of conciliation, since the Vandal king had been pressing for his elevation. After months of siege and suffering from starvation, Rome surrendered and Ricimer finally entered the city. Anthemius tried to escape by disguising himself as a beggar, but the emperor was caught attempting to flee the city at the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere, where he was beheaded on 11 July 472.\nDeath and legacy.\nRicimer's rule lasted until his death of natural causes\u2014apparently a hemorrhage on 19 August 472\u2014six weeks after deposing Anthemius. His title of patrician and position as supreme commander were assumed by his nephew Gundobad. Nonetheless, Ricimer had been a figure of major significance and historians Stephen Williams and Gerard Friell put this into context with the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In his seventeen-year rule of Italy Ricimer worked through four emperors\u2014Majorian, Severus, Anthemius, and Olybrius\u2014in almost cavalier fashion. Each was simply cast aside when they no longer served his purpose. Indeed Majorian, the last competent military emperor who took his position seriously, was deposed precisely because of this. There were three periods in which no Western emperor reigned at all. All Ricimer's public actions suggest that he found the Western emperor an irrelevant encumbrance, and he would probably have preferred to rule Italy directly in the name of the emperor at Constantinople.\nFurther contextualization that led to a barbarian generalissimo like Ricimer having so much influence on the Western Roman Empire is captured by historian James M. O'Flynn, who writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Circumstances in the West demanded the existence of a supreme military commander who had a long record of intimate contact with barbarian troops; by the 470s, this virtually meant that he should be a barbarian. If a barbarian was unacceptable on the imperial throne (and, from the time of Constantius III, the throne was becoming less attractive to the few Romans who were eligible as generalissimos), then there had to be a generalissimo to function as a middle-man between the emperor\u2014the impotent figurehead\u2014and the barbarian troops, who represented real power. One is tempted, at first view, to wonder why the eastern emperors, in addition to fostering western colleagues, did not occasionally try to cultivate some well-disposed candidate for the post of generalissimo. Had Leo attempted this, perhaps the western throne might have been saved.\nWithout a powerful figure to guide it, the Western Roman Empire experienced an even more rapid succession of emperors, none of whom was able to effectively consolidate power. The line of Western Roman Emperors ended arguably in either 476 (with Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustus) or 480 (with Julius Nepos's death), concentrating the remaining imperial power in far-off Constantinople. Historian J. B. Bury claims that Odoacer was more or less a constitutional successor to Ricimer.\nAppearances in opera.\nRicimer's life was used as a subject of opera libretti in the 17th and 18th centuries, embellishing his biography with romantic and political intrigues. The earliest setting was Matteo Noris's \"Ricimero re de' Vandali\" (set by Carlo Pallavicino, 1684), which focuses on the installation of Anthemius in Rome and the promise of marriage to his daughter Domizia. A better-known setting was Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati's libretto \"Flavio Anicio Olibrio\", set by Francesco Gasparini (1708), Nicola Porpora (1711), Leonardo Vinci (1728), and Niccol\u00f2 Jommelli (1740). This libretto is based on Ricimer's siege of Rome and his relationship with Olybrius and their loves.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Counterfactual history seeks by \"conjecturing on what did not happen, or what might have happened, in order to understand what did happen.\" It has produced a literary genre which is variously called alternate history, speculative history, allohistory, and hypothetical history.\nDevelopment.\nAn early book of counterfactual histories is \"If It Had Happened Otherwise\" (1931) which features \"If Lee Had Not Won the Battle at Gettysburg\", by Winston Churchill, about a fictional Confederate victory at the Battle of Gettysburg (1863). As a text of counterfactual histories written by historians, \"If It Had Happened Otherwise\" contains works of alternative history\u2014fictional reinterpretations of historical events\u2014because the narrative tone tends to whimsy, and offers neither historical analysis nor the logic behind such \"What if?\" scenarios.\nIn \"Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History\", Robert Fogel applied quantitative methods to imagine the U.S. economy of 1890 had there been no railroads. That in the absence of the railroad in the U.S., the great system of canals would have been expanded and the roads would have been paved and improved into a reliable transport system; both improvements would have diminished the social and economic importance of the railroad, because \u201cthe level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.\u201d\nFew further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of \"Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences\" by the Cambridge sociologist Geoffrey Hawthorn, who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios. This work helped inspire \"Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals\" (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian Niall Ferguson. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as Marxism, and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of \"What If?\" books edited by Robert Cowley presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about \"how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time.\"\nSome scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven globalization processes for almost a thousand years. From Song dynasty in China to Genoa, Venice, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.\nDifferences from alternate history.\nCounterfactual history is neither historical revisionism nor alternate history.\nCounterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event's relative historical importance. Historians produce arguments subsequent changes in history, outlining each in broad terms only, since the main focus is on the importance and impact of the negated event.\nAn alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history.\nAn example of a counterfactual question would be: \"What if the Pearl Harbor attack did not happen?\"; whereas an alternate history writer would focus on a possible series of events arising therefrom.\nThe line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes.\nThe line is further blurred by novelists such as Kim Stanley Robinson, whose alternate-history novel \"The Years of Rice and Salt\" has a character talking of historians' use of counterfactuals, within the novel's alternate history. He dismisses this as \"a useless exercise\".\nCriticism.\nMost historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about causality in history contain implicit counterfactual claims\u2014for example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer.\nRichard Evans provides a systematic critique of the concept in his book \"Altered Pasts\". In his view most counterfactuals are written by right wing historians engaging in wishful thinking either describing a hoped for present or to discredit left wing ideology. He claims that reducing outcomes to a single cause ignores the complexity of influences on outcomes. In contrast Christopher Prendergast believes that counterfactuals have the important role of testing explanations of historical causality by exploring the implication of alternatives.\nAviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson's \"Virtual History in History and Theory\" and in his book \"Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography\". Tucker rejected the use of multi-causal counterfactuals stating that every counterfactual should be posed as \"ceteris paribus\", everything else remaining the same.115\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Children (defined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child as people under the age of 18) have been recruited for participation in military operations and campaigns throughout history and in many cultures.\nChildren are targeted for their susceptibility to influence, which renders them easier to recruit and control. While some are recruited by force, others choose to join up, often to escape poverty or because they expect military life to offer a rite of passage to maturity.\nChild soldiers who survive armed conflict frequently develop psychiatric illness, poor literacy and numeracy, and behavioral problems such as heightened aggression, which together lead to an increased risk of unemployment and poverty in adulthood. Research in the United Kingdom has found that the enlistment and training of adolescent children, even when they are not sent to war, is often accompanied by a higher risk of suicide, stress-related mental disorders, alcohol abuse, and violent behavior.\nSince the 1960s, a number of treaties have successfully reduced the recruitment and use of children worldwide. Nonetheless, around a quarter of armed forces worldwide, particularly those of third-world nations, still train adolescent children for military service, while elsewhere, the use of children in armed conflict and insurgencies has increased in recent years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nHistory is filled with children who have been trained and used for fighting, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, used as sex slaves, or recruited for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda. In 1813 and 1814, for example, Napoleon conscripted many young French teenagers for his armies. Thousands of children participated on all sides of the First and Second World Wars. Children continued to be used throughout the 20th and early 21st century on every continent, with concentrations in parts of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Only since the turn of the millennium have international efforts begun to limit and reduce the military use of children.\nCurrent situation.\nState armed forces.\nThe adoption in 2000 of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) committed states who ratified it to \"take all feasible measures\" to ensure that no child takes a direct part in hostilities and to cease recruitment below the age of 16. As most states have now opted into OPAC, the global trend has been towards reserving military recruitment to adulthood, known as the \"Straight-18\" standard.\nNonetheless, as of 2018[ [update]], children aged under 18 were still being recruited and trained for military purposes in 46 countries. Most of these states recruit from age 17, fewer than 20 recruit from age 16, and an unknown, smaller number, recruit younger children.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], the United Nations (UN) verified that nine state armed forces were using children in hostilities: Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Somalia, and South Sudan in Africa, Syria and Yemen in Western Asia; Afghanistan in Central Asia; and Myanmar in South East Asia.\nNon-state armed groups.\nThese include non-state armed paramilitary organisations such as militias, insurgents, terrorist organizations, guerrilla movements, armed liberation movements, and other types of quasi-military organisation.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], the UN identified 12 countries where children were widely used by such groups: Colombia in South America; Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan in Africa; Lebanon and Palestine in the Middle East; Syria and Yemen in Western Asia; Afghanistan in Central Asia; and Myanmar in South East Asia.\nNot all armed groups use children and approximately 60 have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999. For example, by 2017, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the Philippines had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks, and in 2016, the FARC-EP guerrilla movement in Colombia agreed to stop recruiting children. Other countries have seen the reverse trend, particularly Afghanistan and Syria, where Islamist militants and groups opposing them have intensified their recruitment, training, and use of children.\nGlobal estimates.\nIn 2003, one estimate calculated that child soldiers participated in about three-quarters of ongoing conflicts. In the same year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) estimated that most of these children were aged over 15, although some were younger.\nDue to the widespread military use of children in areas where armed conflict and insecurity prevent access by UN officials and other observers, it is difficult to estimate how many children are affected. \nIt is estimated that girl soldiers make between 10% and 30%, 6 and 50%, or over 40% of the child soldier population. Of the verified cases presented in the 2023 UN Secretary General report, girls make 12.3% of all child soldiers recruited or used by armed groups.\nDriving factors.\nDespite children's physical and psychological underdevelopment relative to adults, there are many reasons why state and non-state military organisations seek them out, and why children themselves are often drawn to join of their own volition.\nPsychological factors.\nRelative to adults, the neurological underdevelopment of children, including adolescent children, renders them more susceptible to recruitment and also more likely to make consequential decisions without due regard to the risks.\nWith these susceptibilities in mind, military marketing to adolescents has been criticised in Germany, the UK, and the US for glamorizing military life while omitting the risks and the loss of fundamental rights.\nResearch in the same three countries finds that recruiters disproportionately target children from poorer backgrounds. In the UK, for example, the army finds it easier to attract child recruits from age 16 than adults from age 18, particularly those from poorer backgrounds.\nOnce recruited, children are easier than adults to indoctrinate and control, and are more motivated than adults to fight for non-monetary incentives such as religion, honour, prestige, revenge, and duty.\nSocial factors.\nIn many countries growing populations of young people relative to older generations have made children a cheap and accessible resource for military organisations. In a 2004 study of children in military organisations around the world, Rachel Brett and Irma Specht pointed to a complex of factors that incentivise children to join military organisations, particularly:\nThe following testimony from a child recruited by the Cambodian armed forces in the 1990s is typical of many children's motivations for joining up:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I joined because my parents lacked food and I had no school\u00a0... I was worried about mines but what can we do\u2014it's an order [to go to the front line]. Once somebody stepped on a mine in front of me\u2014he was wounded and died\u00a0... I was with the radio at the time, about 60 metres away. I was sitting in my hammock and saw him die\u00a0... I see young children in every unit\u00a0... I'm sure I'll be a soldier for at least a couple of more years. If I stop being a soldier, I won't have a job to do because I don't have any skills. I don't know what I'll do\u00a0...\nMilitary factors.\nSome leaders of armed groups have claimed that children, despite their underdevelopment, bring their own qualities as combatants to a fighting unit, often being remarkably fearless, agile and hardy.\nThe global proliferation of light automatic weapons, which children can easily handle, has also made the use of children as direct combatants more viable.\nImpact on children.\nArmed conflict.\nChild soldiers who survive armed conflict face a markedly elevated risk of debilitating psychiatric illness, poor literacy and numeracy, and behavioural problems. Research in Palestine and Uganda, for example, has found that more than half of former child soldiers showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and nearly nine in ten in Uganda screened positive for depressed mood. Researchers in Palestine also found that children exposed to high levels of violence in armed conflict were substantially more likely than other children to exhibit aggression and anti-social behaviour. The combined impact of these effects typically includes a high risk of poverty and lasting unemployment in adulthood.\nDetention.\nFurther harm is caused when armed forces and groups detain child recruits. Children are often detained without sufficient food, medical care, or under other inhumane conditions, and some experience physical and sexual torture. Some are captured with their families, or detained due to one of their family members' activity. Lawyers and relatives are frequently banned from any court hearing.\nMilitary training.\nWhile the use of children in armed conflict has attracted most attention, other research has found that military settings present several serious risks before child recruits are deployed to war zones, particularly during training.\nResearch from several countries finds that military enlistment, even before recruits are sent to war, is accompanied by a higher risk of attempted suicide in the US, higher risk of mental disorders in the US and the UK, higher risk of alcohol misuse and higher risk of violent behaviour, relative to recruits' pre-military experience.\nMilitary academics in the US have characterized military training as \"intense indoctrination\" in conditions of sustained stress, the primary purpose of which is to establish the unconditional and immediate obedience of recruits. The research literature has found that adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to a high-stress environment, particularly those from a background of childhood adversity. It finds in particular that the prolonged stressors of military training are likely to aggravate pre-existing mental health problems and hamper healthy neurological development.\nMilitary settings are characterized by elevated rates of bullying, particularly by instructors. In the UK between 2014 and 2020, for example, the army recorded 62 formal complaints of violence committed by staff against recruits at the military training centre for 16- and 17-year-old trainee soldiers, the Army Foundation College. Joe Turton, who joined up aged 17 in 2014, recalls bullying by staff throughout his training. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The corporals come into the hangar where we sleep and they're wild-eyed, screaming, shoving people out. A massive sergeant lifts a recruit in the air and literally throws him into the wall. A corporal smacks me full-force around the head\u2014I've got my helmet on but he hits me so hard that I'm knocked right over, I mean this man's about 40 and I'm maybe 17 by then. A bit later, we're crawling through mud and a corporal grabs me and drags me along the ground, half-way across a field. When he lets go I'm in that much pain that I'm whimpering on the ground. When the other corporal, the one who hit me, sees me crying on the ground, he just points at me and laughs.Elevated rates of sexual harassment are characteristic of military settings, including the training environment. Between 2015 and 2020, for example, girls aged 16 or 17 in the British armed forces were twice as likely as their same-age civilian peers to report rape or other sexual assault.\nInternational law.\nRecruitment and use of children.\nDefinition of child.\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as any person under the age of 18. The Paris Principles define a child associated with an armed force or group as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes. The document is approved by the United Nations General Assembly. It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in hostilities.\nChildren aged under 15.\nThe Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions (1977, Art. 77.2), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (2002) all forbid state armed forces and non-state armed groups from using children under the age of 15 directly in armed conflict (technically \"hostilities\"). This is now recognised as a war crime.\nChildren aged under 18.\nMost states with armed forces are also bound by the higher standards of the widely ratified Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC) (2000) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (1999), which forbid the compulsory recruitment of those under the age of 18. OPAC also requires governments that still recruit children (from age 16) to \"take all feasible measures to ensure that persons below the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities\". In addition, OPAC forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting children under any circumstances, although the legal force of this is uncertain.\nThe highest standard in the world is set by the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which forbids state armed forces from recruiting children under the age of 18 under any circumstances. Most African states have ratified the Charter.\nNone of the above treaties either explicitly forbids the \"indirect\" participation of children in \"hostilities\", or from contributing to a military operation in a stand-off position (i.e. away from hostilities).\nIn a 2008 report from Human Rights Watch listed 14 governments (Chad, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the DRC, India, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Peru, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Uganda, and Zimbabwe) who recruit minors for military service. In 8 countries (Burundi, Colombia, the DRC, India, Indonesia, Israel, Nepal, and Uganda) \"children \u2013 often captured, surrendered or escaped from armed groups - were also used as spies, informants or messengers\".\nStandards for the release and reintegration of children.\nOPAC requires governments to demobilise children within their jurisdiction who have been recruited or used in hostilities and to provide assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration. Under war, civil unrest, armed conflict and other emergency situations, children and youths are also offered protection under the United Nations \"Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict\". To accommodate the proper disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former members of armed groups, the United Nations started the Integrated DDR Standards in 2006.\nWar crimes.\nOpinion is currently divided over whether children should be prosecuted for war crimes. International law does not prohibit the prosecution of children who commit war crimes, but Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child limits the punishment that a child can receive: \"Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age.\"\nExample: Sierra Leone.\nIn the wake of the Sierra Leonean Civil War, the UN mandated the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) to try former combatants aged 15 and older for breaches of humanitarian law, including war crimes. However, the Paris Principles state that children who participate in armed conflict should be regarded first as victims, even if they may also be perpetrators:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... [those] who are accused of crimes under international law allegedly committed while they were associated with armed forces or armed groups should be considered primarily as victims of offenses against international law; not only as perpetrators. They must be treated by international law in a framework of restorative justice and social rehabilitation, consistent with international law which offers children special protection through numerous agreements and principles.\nThis principle was reflected in the Court's statute, which did not rule out prosecution but emphasised the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former child soldiers. David Crane, the first Chief Prosecutor of the Sierra Leone tribunal, interpreted the statute in favour of prosecuting those who had recruited children, rather than the children themselves, no matter how heinous the crimes they had committed.\nExample: Omar Khadr.\nIn the US, prosecutors charged Omar Khadr, a Canadian, for offences they alleged he committed in Afghanistan while under the age of 16 and fighting for the Taliban against US forces. These crimes carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment under US law. In 2010, while under torture and duress, Khadr pleaded guilty to murder in violation of the laws of war, attempted murder in violation of the laws of war, conspiracy, two counts of providing material support for terrorism, and spying. The plea was offered as part of a plea bargain, which would see Khadr deported to Canada after one year of imprisonment to serve seven further years there. Omar Khadr remained in Guantanamo Bay and the Canadian government faced international criticism for delaying his repatriation. Khadr was eventually transferred to the Canadian prison system in September 2012 and was freed on bail by a judge in Alberta in May 2015. As of 2016[ [update]], Khadr was appealing his US conviction as a war criminal.\nBefore sentencing the Special Representative to the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict wrote to the US military commission at Guantanamo appealing unsuccessfully for Khadr's release into a rehabilitation program. In her letter she said that Khadr represented the \"classic child soldier narrative: recruited by unscrupulous groups to undertake actions at the bidding of adults to fight battles they barely understand\".\nRole of the United Nations.\nBackground.\nChildren's rights advocates were left frustrated after the final text of the convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) did not prohibit the military recruitment of all children under the age of 18, and they began to call for a new treaty to achieve this goal. As a consequence the newly formed Committee on the Rights of the Child made two recommendations: first, to request a major UN study into the impact of armed conflict on children; and second, to establish a working group of the UN Commission on Human Rights to negotiate a supplementary protocol to the convention. Both proposals were accepted.\nResponding to the committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN General Assembly acknowledged \"the grievous deterioration in the situation of children in many parts of the world as a result of armed conflicts\" and commissioned the human rights expert Gra\u00e7a Machel to conduct a major fact-finding study. Her report, \"Impact of Armed Conflict on Children\" (1996), was particularly concerned with the military use of younger children, which was killing, maiming, and psychiatrically injuring many thousands every year. It noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMeanwhile, the UN Commission on Human Rights established a working group to negotiate a treaty to raise the legal standard. After a global campaign and complex negotiations, the new treaty was agreed in 2000 as the Optional Protocol to the convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. The treaty prohibited the direct participation of all children in armed conflict for the first time, while continuing to allow state armed forces (though not non-state armed groups) to recruit children from age 16. The protocol came into force on 12 February 2002.\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.\nThe Machel Report led to a new mandate for a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (SRSG-CAAC). Among the tasks of the SRSG is to draft the Secretary-General's annual report on children and armed conflict, which lists and describes the worst situations of child recruitment and use from around the world.\nSecurity Council.\nThe United Nations Security Council convenes regularly to debate, receive reports, and pass resolutions under the heading \"Children in armed conflict\". The first resolution on the issue, Resolution 1261, was passed in 1999. In 2004 Resolution 1539 was passed unanimously, condemning the use of child soldiers and mandating the UN Secretary-General to establish a means of tracking and reporting on the practice, known as the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General.\nThe Secretary-General publishes an annual report on children and armed conflict. As of 2017[ [update]], his report identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups during 2016 (Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) and six countries where state armed forces were using children in hostilities (Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Syria).\nChildren in the military today\u2014by region and country.\nThis section covers the use of children for military purposes today. For historical cases, see History of children in the military.\nAfrica.\nIn 2003, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that up to half of children involved with state armed forces and non-state armed groups worldwide were in Africa. In 2004, Child Soldiers International estimated that 100,000 children were being used in state and non-state armed forces on the continent; and in 2008 an estimate put the total at 120,000 children, or 40 percent of the global total.\nThe African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (1990), which most African states have ratified, prohibits all military recruitment of children aged under 18. Nonetheless, according to the UN, in 2016 children were being used by armed groups in seven African countries (Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan) and by state armed forces in three (Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan).\nInternational efforts to reduce the number of children in military organisations in Africa began with the Cape Town Principles and Best Practices, developed in 1997. The Principles proposed that African governments commit to OPAC, which was being negotiated at the time, and raise the minimum age for military recruitment from 15 to 18. The Principles also defined a child soldier to include any person under the age of 18 who is \"part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or group in any capacity ... including girls recruited for sexual purposes...\"\nIn 2007, the Free Children from War conference in Paris produced the Paris Principles, which refined and updated the Cape Town Principles, applied them globally, and outlined a practical approach to reintegrating current child soldiers.\nCentral African Republic.\nThe use of children by armed groups in the Central African Republic has historically been common. Between 2012 and 2015 as many as 10,000 children were used by armed groups in the nationwide armed conflict and as of 2024[ [update]] the problem persists nationwide with a most likely greater amount fighting now. The mainly Muslim \"S\u00e9l\u00e9ka\" coalition of armed groups and the predominantly Christian \"Anti-balaka\" militias have both used children in this way; some are as young as eight.\nIn May 2015 at the \"Forum de Bangui\" (a meeting of government, parliament, armed groups, civil society, and religious leaders), a number of armed groups agreed to demobilize thousands of children.\nIn 2016 a measure of stability returned to the Central African Republic and, according to the United Nations, 2,691 boys and 1,206 girls were officially separated from armed groups. Despite this, the recruitment and use of children for military purposes increased by approximately 50 percent over that year, mostly attributed to the Lord's Resistance Army.\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nThousands of children serve in the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and various rebel militias. It has been estimated that more than 30,000 children were fighting with various parties to the conflict at the height of the Second Congo War. It was claimed in the film \"Kony 2012\" that the Lord's Resistance Army recruited this number.\nCurrently, the DRC has one of the highest proportions of child soldiers in the world. The international court has passed judgment on these practices during the war. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, one of the warlords in the DRC, has been sentenced to 14 years in prison because of his role in the recruitment of child soldiers between 2002 and 2003. Lubanga directed the Union of Congolese Patriots and its armed wing Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. The children were forced to fight in the armed conflict in Ituri.\nSomalia.\nA report published by the Child Soldiers International in 2004 estimated that 200,000 children had been recruited into the country's militias against their will since 1991. In 2017 UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres commented on a UN report which estimated that over 50 percent of Al-Shabaab's membership in the country was under the age of 18, with some as young as nine being sent to fight. The report verified that 6,163 children had been recruited in Somalia between 1 April 2010 and 31 July 2016, of which 230 were girls. Al-Shabaab accounted for seventy percent of this recruitment, and the Somali National Army was also recruiting children.\nSudan.\nIn 2004 approximately 17,000 children were being used by the state armed forces and non-state armed groups. As many as 5,000 children were part of the main armed opposition group at the time, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Some former child soldiers were sentenced to death for crimes committed while they were soldiers.\nIn 2006, children were also recruited from refugee camps in Chad, and thousands were used in the conflict in Darfur. In 2005 the government ratified the OPAC treaty and by 2008 the military use of children had reduced in the country, but both state armed forces and the SPLA continued to recruit and use them. The use of children has continued to diminish, but in 2017 the UN was still receiving reports of children as young as 12 in government forces.\nUganda.\n\"The LRA in Uganda became known mainly through the forced recruitment of thousands of children and adolescents who were trained as soldiers or forced to 'marry' members of the rebel group. Unlike all other, or earlier, rebel groups in Uganda, the LRA made the violent abduction or enslavement of children (preferably aged between twelve and fourteen) its main method of recruitment and concentrated its activities on attacking the civilian population.\"\nZimbabwe.\nIn 2003, the \"Guardian\" reported multiple human rights violations by the National Youth Service, a state-sponsored youth militia in Zimbabwe. Originally conceived as a patriotic youth organisation, it became a paramilitary group of youth aged between 10 and 30, and was used to suppress dissent in the country. The organisation was finally banned in January 2018.\nAmericas.\nBolivia.\nIn 2001 the government of Bolivia acknowledged that male children as young as 14 may have been forcibly conscripted into the armed forces during recruitment sweeps. About 40% of the Bolivian army was believed to be under the age of 18, with half of those below the age of 16. As of 2018[ [update]], Bolivia invites children to begin their adult conscription early, from age 17.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil the local organized crime groups, such as Comando Vermelho, recruit children to sell drugs and commit homicides, as well as to fight with the police and other rival groups. Also the Brazilian militias recruit children to fight in the conflict against Comando Vermelho.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, people may join the reserve component of the Canadian Forces at age 16 with parental permission, and the regular component at 17 years of age, also with parental permission. They may not volunteer for a tour of duty until reaching age 18.\nColombia.\nIn the Colombian armed conflict, from the mid-1960s to present, one-fourth of non-state combatants have been and still are under 18 years old. In 2004 Colombia ranked fourth in the world for the greatest use of child soldiers. There are currently 11,000\u201314,000 children in armed groups in the country. In negotiations with the government, armed groups have offered to stop the recruitment of minors as a bargaining chip, but they have not honoured these offers. Bj\u00f8rkhaug argues that most child soldiers were recruited through some combination of voluntary participation and coercion.\nIn 1998 a Human Rights Watch press release indicated that 30 percent of some guerrilla units were made up of children and up to 85 percent of some of the militias, which are considered to serve as a \"training ground for future guerrilla fighters\", had child soldiers In the same press release it was estimated that some of the government-linked paramilitary units consisted of up to 50 percent children, including some as young as eight years old.\nIn 2005 an estimated 11,000 children were involved with left- or right-wing paramilitaries in Colombia. \"Approximately 80 percent of child combatants in Colombia belong to one of the two left-wing guerrilla groups, the FARC or ELN. The remainder fight in paramilitary ranks, predominately the AUC.\" According to P. W. Singer the FARC attack on the Guatape hydroelectric facility in 1998 involved militants as young as eight years old and a 2001 FARC training video depicted boys as young as 11 working with missiles. The group has also taken in children from Venezuela, Panama, and Ecuador.\nThe Colombian government's security forces do not officially recruit children as the legal age for both compulsory and voluntary recruitment has been set at 18. However, students were allowed to enroll as cadets in military secondary schools and 16- or 17-year-olds could enter air force or national army training programs, respectively. In addition, captured enemy child combatants were employed by the Colombian military for intelligence gathering purposes in potential violation of legal prohibitions.\nThe demobilization efforts targeted toward the FARC in 2016\u20132017 have provided hope that the conflict will come to an end, limiting the number of children involved in violence. However, other armed groups have yet to be demobilized, and conflict is not yet resolved.\nCuba.\nIn Cuba, compulsory military service for both boys and girls starts at age 17. Male teenagers are allowed to join the Territorial Troops Militia prior to their compulsory service.\nHaiti.\nIn Haiti an unknown number of children participate in various loosely organised armed groups that are engaged in political violence.\nMexico.\nIn Mexico, an unknown number of children are used by criminal organizations like the Gulf Cartel in the Mexican drug war to fight the government and the other rival cartels. Also the Grupos de autodefensa comunitaria recruited some children to defend their villages from the violence of the local crime groups, one of the self-defense groups that recruit soldier children is Coordinadora Regional de Autoridades Comunitarias-Pueblos Fundadores (CRAC-PF) to fight with Los Ardillos, a criminal group split from the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Cartel. The battles between CRAC-PF and Los Ardillos caused 53 deaths.\nParaguay.\nThe government of Paraguay accused the guerrilla groups EPP and the ACA of recruit child soldiers to fight the government in the ongoing insurgency in the northeastern part of the country.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, 17-year-olds may join the armed forces with the written agreement of parents. As of 2015[ [update]], approximately 16,000 17-year-olds were being enlisted annually.\nThe US Army describes outreach to schools as the 'cornerstone' of its approach to recruitment, and the No Child Left Behind Act gives recruiters the legal right of access to all school students' contact details. Children's rights bodies have criticized the US' reliance on children to staff its armed forces. The committee on the Rights of the Child has recommended that the US raise the minimum age of enlistment to 18.\nIn negotiations on the OPAC treaty during the 1990s the US joined the UK in strongly opposing a global minimum enlistment age of 18. As a consequence the treaty specified a minimum age of 16. The US ratified the treaty in 2002 (but as of 2018[ [update]] U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child has not happened).\nPer OPAC, US military personnel are normally prohibited from direct participation in hostilities until the age of 18. Still, they are eligible for 'forward deployment', which means that they may be posted to a combat zone to perform support tasks. The committee on the Rights of the Child has called on the US to change this policy and ensure that no minor can be deployed to a forward operating area in a combat zone.\nIn 2003 and 2004 approximately 60 underage personnel were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq in error. The Department of Defense subsequently stated that \"the situations were immediately rectified and action taken to prevent recurrence.\"\nIn 2008 President George W. Bush signed the Child Soldiers Protection Act into law. The law criminalizes leading a military force which recruits child soldiers. It also prohibits arms sales to countries where children are used for military purposes. The law's definition of child soldiers includes \"any person under 18 years of age who takes a direct part in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces.\" Waivers from the act were issued by both the Obama and Trump administrations.\nAsia.\nIn 2004 the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) reported that in Asia thousands of children are involved in fighting forces in active conflict and ceasefire situations in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Government refusal of access to conflict zones has made it impossible to document the numbers involved. In 2004 Myanmar was unique in the region as the only country where government armed forces forcibly recruited and used children between the ages of 12 and 16. Johnny and Luther Htoo, twin brothers who jointly led the God's Army guerrilla group, were estimated to have been around ten years old when they began leading the group in 1997.\nAfghanistan.\nMilitias recruited thousands of child soldiers during the Afghan civil war over three decades. Many are still fighting now for the Taliban. Some of those taken from Islamic religious schools or madrassas, are used as suicide bombers and gunmen. A propaganda video of boys marching in camouflage uniform and using slogans of martyrdom was issued in 2009 by the Afghan Taliban's leadership. This included a eulogy to a 14-year-old Taliban fighter who allegedly killed an American soldier.\nBurma/Myanmar.\nThe State Peace and Development Council has asserted that all of its soldiers volunteered and that all of those accepted are 18 or over. According to Human Rights Watch as many as 70,000 boys serve in Burma/Myanmar's national army, the Tatmadaw, with children as young as 11 being forcibly recruited off the streets. Desertion, the group reported, leads to punishments of three to five years in prison or even execution. The group has also stated that about 5,000\u20137,000 children serve with a range of different armed ethnic opposition groups, most notably in the United Wa State Army. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a report in June 2009 mentioning \"grave violations\" against children in the country by both the rebels and the government. The administration announced on 4August that they would send a team into Burma/Myanmar to press for more action. \nOn March 31, 2025, The Guardian interviewed an 18-year-old female sniper in the CNDF with the nom de guerre \"Anina.\" She joined the Chin National Defence Force at the age of 14 in 2021. At first, her duties were relegated to domestic work. However, she joined a sniper training course at the age of 17, where she graduated as a top-scoring marksman. Despite the CNDF discouraging her from engaging in combat in favor of earning an education, Anina still insists on fighting.\nThe State Administration Council military junta also conscripted youth from the ages of 16 to 20 into militias in Putao District, Kachin State from February 7 to the end of March 2025. Conscription also happened in Karenni State.\nConscription policies enacted by the Matupi Revolutionary Organisation/Chinland Defence Force \u2013 Matupi rebel group targeted individuals ranging in age from 16 to 40. Civilians started fleeing into nearby forests due to these policies. The length of service for conscripts is 6 years; in contrast, volunteers serve half that time.\nIndonesia.\nWest Papua National Liberation Army used children in its ranks with an age range of 8 to 15 years old. WPNLA claimed that they joined voluntarily and were not sent into the frontline. On 9 June 2025, a 14 years old WPLA captain, Pitenus Lilbid, was killed in a skirmish with Indonesian soldiers and police.\nIran.\nCurrent Iranian law officially prohibits the recruitment of those under 16.\nDuring the Iran\u2013Iraq War, male children were drafted into the Basij paramilitary militia where, according to critics of the Iranian government, they \"were sent to the front as waves of human shields\". Other sources have estimated the total number of all Iranian casualties to be in the 200,000\u2013600,000 range. One source estimates that 3% of the Iran\u2013Iraq War's casualties were under the age of 14.\nThere were male Iranian children who left school and participated in the Iran\u2013Iraq War without the knowledge of their parents, including Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh. Iraqi officers claimed that they sometimes captured Iranian child soldiers as young as eight years old.\nAs of 2018[ [update]] the Iranian government has been recruiting children from Iran and Afghanistan to fight in the Syrian Civil War on the side of forces loyal to the Assad government.\nLebanon.\nMany different sides in the Lebanese Civil War used child soldiers. A May 2008 Child Soldiers International report stated that Hezbollah trains children for military services. In 2017, the UN reported that armed groups, suspected to be Islamist militants, were recruiting children in the country.\nNepal.\nAn estimated 6,000\u20139,000 children serve in the Communist Party of Nepal forces. As of 2010[ [update]], child soldiers of the CPN have since been demobilized.\nPhilippines.\nIslamist and communist armed groups fighting the government have routinely relied on child recruits. In 2001 Human Rights Watch reported that an estimated 13 percent of the 10,000 soldiers in the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) were children, and that some paramilitary forces linked to the government were also using children. In 2016 the MILF allowed 1,869 children to leave and committed not to recruit children any more. In the same year, however, the UN reported that other armed groups in the Philippines continue to recruit children, mainly between the ages of 13 and 17.\nSri Lanka.\nMilitant use of children in Sri Lanka has been an internationally recognized problem since the inception of the Sri Lankan civil war in 1983. The primary recruiters of children are the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.\nSyria.\nDuring the Syrian Civil War children have joined groups opposed to Bashar al Assad. In 2012 the UN received allegations of rebels using child soldiers, but said they were unable to verify these. In June 2014 a United Nations report said that the opposition had recruited children in military and support roles. While there seemed to be no policy of doing so, the report said, there were no age verification procedures. Human Rights Watch reported in 2014 that rebel factions have been using children in support and combatant roles, ranging from treating the wounded on battlefields, ferrying ammunition and other supplies to frontlines while fighting raged, to acting as snipers.\nThe Turkish government linked think tank SETA withdrew a report detailing the composition of the Syrian National Army as it revealed the use of child soldiers. The Syrian National Army is currently funded by Turkey, who signed the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of the child on the involvement of children in armed conflict 8 September 2000. It was reported that Turkey has deployed child soldiers in the Syrian National Army to Libya according to a report by Al-Monitor, citing sources on the ground. In July 2021, the United States of America added Turkey to the list of countries that implicated in the use of child soldiers, because it used them in Syria and Libya. The \"2023 Trafficking in Persons Report\" mentioned that factions of the Turkish backed Syrian National Army recruited and used Syrian children as child soldiers in Libya.\nThe 2021 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices mentioned the recruitment and use of child soldiers from Turkish-supported forces in Syria. \nThe 2021, 2022 and 2023 Trafficking in Persons Reports mentioned that Turkey provided support to armed groups in Syria which recruit and use child soldiers.\nKurdish forces have also been accused of using this tactic. In 2015 Human Rights Watch claimed that 59 children, 10 of them under 15 years old, were recruited by or volunteered for the YPG or YPJ since July 2014 when the Kurdish militia leaders signed a Deed of Commitment with Geneva Call.\nThe at-the-time President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, passed a law in 2013 prohibiting the use of child soldiers (anyone under 18), the breaking of which is punishable by 10\u201320 years of 'penal labour.' Whether or not the law was actually enforced on government's forces has not been confirmed, and there have been allegations of children being recruited to fight for the Syrian government against rebel forces.\nIranian government recruited children from Iran and Afghanistan to fight in the Syrian Civil War on the side of the government forces loyal to Assad.\nTurkey (PKK).\nDuring the Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has actively recruited and kidnapped children. The organization has been accused of abducting more than 2,000 children by Turkish Security Forces. The independent reports by the Human Rights Watch (HRW), the United Nations (UN) and the Amnesty International have confirmed the recruitment and use of child soldiers by the organization and its armed wings since the 90's. In 2001, it was reported that the recruitment of the children by the organization has been systematic. Several reports have reported about the organization's battalion, called \"Tabura Zaroken Sehit Agit\", which has been formed mainly for the recruitment of children. It was also reported that the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) had recruited children.\nAccording to the Turkish Security Forces, the PKK has abducted more than 983 children aged between 12 and 17. More than 400 children have fled from the organization and surrendered to the security forces. The United Nations Children's Fund report, published in 2010, saw the recruitment of the children by the PKK concerning and dangerous.\nIn 2016, the Human Rights Watch, accused the PKK of committing war crimes by recruiting child soldiers in the Shingal region of Iraq and in neighboring countries.\nThroughout the Syrian Civil War multiple media outlets including Human Rights Watch have confirmed that the YPG, an organization linked to the PKK, has been recruiting and deploying child soldiers. Despite a claim by the group that it would stop using children, which has been violation of international law, the group has continued the recruitment and use of children.\nIn 2018, the annual UN report on children in armed conflict found 224 cases of child recruitment by the People's Defense Units and its women's unit in 2017, an almost fivefold increase from the 2016. Seventy-two of the children, nearly one-third, were girls. The group was also reported to had abducted children to enlist them.\nYemen.\nU.N. Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict Radhika Coomaraswamy stated in January 2010 that \"large numbers\" of teenage boys are being recruited in Yemeni tribal fighting. NGO activist Abdul-Rahman al-Marwani has estimated that as many as 500\u2013600 children are either killed or wounded through tribal combat every year in Yemen.\nSaudi Arabia hired child soldiers from Sudan (especially from Darfur), and Yemen to fight against Houthis during the Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present).\nBritish SAS special forces are allegedly involved in training child soldiers in Yemen. Reportedly at least 40% of soldiers fighting for the Saudi-led coalition are children.\nSaudi Arabia is also hiring Yemeni child soldiers to guard Saudi border against Houthis.\nIn June 2019, Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, blocked the inclusion of Saudi Arabia on the US list of countries that recruit child soldiers, dismissing his experts' findings that a Saudi-led coalition has been using children in Yemen's civil war.\nEurope.\nAccording to Child Soldiers International the trend in Europe has been towards recruiting only adults from age 18; most states only allow adult recruitment, and as of 2016[ [update]] no armed groups were known to be using children. As of 2018[ [update]] one country, the United Kingdom, was enlisting children from age 16, and five were enlisting from age 17 (Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, and Netherlands). Of these, the UK recruits children in the greatest numbers; in 2016, approximately a quarter of new recruits to the British army were aged under 18.\nAll European states have ratified the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and so child recruits are not typically used in hostilities until they reach adulthood. Children were used as combatants in the First Chechen War during the 1990s.\nAustria.\nAustria invites male children to begin their adult compulsory military service one year early, at age 17, with the consent of their parents.\nCyprus.\nCyprus invites children to begin their adult compulsory military service two years early, at age 16, with the consent of their parents.\nFrance.\nFrance enlists military personnel from age 17 and 6 months, and students for military technical school from age 16; 3% of its armed forces' intake is aged under 18.\nGermany.\nGermany enlists military personnel from age 17; in 2015 6% of its armed forces' intake was aged under 18.\nNetherlands.\nThe Netherlands enlists military personnel from age 17; in 2014 5% of its armed forces' intake was aged under 18.\nUkraine.\nDuring the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine in 2014 Justice for Peace at Donbas documented 41 verified individual cases of child recruitment into armed formations. Of those 37 concerned the participation of children in armed formations on territory occupied by Russia and 4 on territory controlled by Ukraine. There were 31 further reports of child recruitment which could not be verified. Of the 37 verified cases on territory controlled by Russia, 33 were boys and 4 were girls; 57% were aged 16\u201317, 35% were under 15, and age could not be determined in 8% of cases.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe British armed forces enlist personnel from age 16 and accept applications from children aged 15 years, 7 months. Parental consent is required prior to enlistment.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], 23% of enlistees to the British armed forces were aged under 18. Most child recruits were enlisted for the army, where 30% of the intake in the year 2021-2022 was aged under 18; more new soldiers were 16 than any other age.\nArmy recruits aged between 16 and 17.5 train initially at the Army Foundation College, a military training centre dedicated to the age group.\nAs per the OPAC, the UK does not normally send child recruits to participate in hostilities, although it does not rule out doing so.\nThe UK inadvertently deployed 22 personnel aged under 18 to Iraq and Afghanistan between 2003 and 2010. The committee on the Rights of the Child has urged the UK to alter its policy so as to ensure that children cannot take part in hostilities under any circumstances.\nIn negotiations on the OPAC during the 1990s the UK joined the US in opposing a global minimum enlistment age of 18. Children's rights bodies have criticised the UK's continuing reliance on children to staff its armed forces.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian Defence Force allows personnel to enlist with parental consent from the age of 16. Personnel under the age of 18 cannot be deployed overseas or used in direct combat except in extreme circumstances where it is not possible to evacuate them.\nNew Zealand.\nAs of 2018[ [update]], the minimum age for joining the New Zealand Defence Force was 17.\nMovement to end military use of children.\nThe military use of children has been common throughout history; only in recent decades has the practice met with informed criticism and concerted efforts to end it. Progress has been slow, partly because many armed forces have relied on children to fill their ranks, and partly because the behaviour of non-state armed groups is difficult to influence.\nRecent history.\n1970s\u20131980s.\nInternational efforts to limit children's participation in armed conflict began with the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977 (Art. 77.2). The new Protocols prohibited the military recruitment of children aged under 15 in direct hostilities, but continued to allow state armed forces and non-state armed groups to recruit children from age 15 and use them in warfare.\nEfforts were renewed during negotiations on the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), when Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) campaigned for the new treaty to outlaw child recruitment entirely. Some states, whose armed forces relied on recruiting below the age of 18, resisted this, so the final treaty text of 1989 only reflected the existing legal standard: the prohibition of the direct participation of children aged under 15 in hostilities.\n1990s.\nIn the 1990s NGOs established the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International) to work with sympathetic governments on a campaign for a new treaty to correct the deficiencies they saw in the CRC. After a global campaign lasting six years, the treaty was adopted in 2000 as the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC). The treaty prohibits child conscription, ensures that military recruits are no younger than 16, and forbids the use of child recruits in hostilities. The treaty also forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for any purpose. Although most states negotiating OPAC supported a ban on recruiting children, some states, led by the US in alliance with the UK, objected to this. As such, the treaty does not ban the recruitment of children aged 16 or 17, although it allows states to bind themselves to a higher standard in law.\n2000s\u2013present.\nAfter the adoption of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, a campaign for global ratification made swift progress. As of 2018[ [update]] OPAC had been ratified by 167 states. The campaign also successfully encouraged many states not to recruit children at all. In 2001 83 states only allowed adult enlistment. By 2016 this had increased to 126, which is 71 percent of countries with armed forces. Approximately 60 non-state armed groups have also entered agreements to stop or scale back their use of children, often brokered by the UN or the NGO Geneva Call.\nChild Soldiers International reports that the success of the OPAC treaty, combined with the gradual decline in child recruitment by state armed forces, has led to a reduction of children in military organisations worldwide. As of 2018[ [update]] the recruitment and use of children remains widespread. In particular, militant Islamist organisations such as ISIS and Boko Haram, as well as armed groups fighting them, have used children extensively. In addition, the three most populous states \u2013 China, India and the United States \u2013 still allow their armed forces to enlist children aged 16 or 17, as do five of the Group of Seven countries: Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, again.\nEvents.\nRed Hand Day (also known as the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers) on 12February is an annual commemoration day to draw public attention to the practice of using children as soldiers in wars and armed conflicts. The date reflects the entry into force of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.\nCountering the militarisation of childhood.\nMany states which do not allow their armed forces to recruit children have continued to draw criticism for marketing military life to children through the education system, in civic spaces and in popular entertainment such as films and videogames. Some commentators have argued that this marketing to children is manipulative and part of a military recruitment process and should therefore be evaluated ethically as such. This principle has led some groups to campaign for relations between military organisations and young people to be regulated, on the grounds of children's rights and public health. Examples are the Countering the Militarization of Youth programme of War Resisters' International, the Stop Recruiting Kids campaign in the US, and the Military Out of Schools campaign in the UK. Similar concerns have been raised in Germany and Israel.\nRehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers.\nChild Soldiers International defines reintegration as: \"The process through which children formerly associated with armed forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued role in their families and communities\" Programs that aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate child soldiers, such as those sponsored by UNICEF, often emphasise three components: family reunification/community network, psychological support, and education/economic opportunity. These efforts take a minimum commitment of 3 to 5 years in order for programs to be successfully implemented. Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family.\nReintegration efforts can become challenging when the child in question has committed war crimes because in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated. In situations such as these, it is important that the child's needs are balanced with a sense of community justice. These situations should be addressed immediately because if not, many children face the threat of re-enlistment. There are also two areas of reintegration that warrant special consideration: female child soldiers and drug use among child soldiers. Child soldiers under the influence of drugs or who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases require additional programmes specific to their needs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

PWORD.2660.TTY 112. Lusers, Fair Share = 2%* Classic use of \"luser\" at the ITS login screen\nBefore the popularization of the Internet in the 1990s, Internet slang defined a luser (sometimes expanded to local user; also luzer or luzzer) as a painfully annoying, stupid, or irritating computer user.\nThe word is a blend of \"loser\" and \"user\". Among hackers, the word \"luser\" takes on a broad meaning, referring to any normal user (in other words, not a \"guru\"), with the implication the person is also a loser. The term is partially interchangeable with the hacker term \"lamer\". \nThe term can also signify a layman with only user account privileges, as opposed to a power user or administrator, who has knowledge of, and access to, superuser accounts; for example, an end luser who cannot be trusted with a root account for system administration. It is popular with technical support staff who have to deal with lusers as part of their job, often metaphorically employing a LART (Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool, also known as a clue-by-four, cluestick, or cluebat), meaning turning off the user's access to computer resources and the like.\nHistory.\nThe Jargon File states that the word was coined around 1975 at MIT, although LUSER is visible in CTSS source code circa 1969 in subroutines involving spying on and killing users and deleting their files and directories. Under ITS, when a user first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed control-Z to get the computer's attention, it printed out some status information, including how many people were already using the computer. A patch to the system was then written to print \"14 losers\" instead of \"14 users\", as a joke. For a while, several hackers who disagreed on the appropriateness of the change struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the backs of the others; any time a user logged into the computer it was equally probable that a user would see, say, \"users\" or \"losers\". Finally, someone tried the compromise \"lusers\", and it stuck. Later, ITS also had the command \"luser\", which attempted to summon assistance from a list of designated helpers.\nAlthough ITS ceased to be used in the mid-1990s, use of the term continued to spread, partly because in Unix-style computer operating systems, \"user\" designates all unprivileged accounts, while the superuser, or root, is the special user account used for system administration. \"root\" is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions (to all files and programs) in all modes (single- or multi-user). The usage lives on, however, and the term \"luser\" is often seen in program comments and on Usenet.\nOn IRC, codice_1 (which abbreviates \"list users\") is a common command to get the number of users connected to a server or network.\nOn Microsoft Windows the 'Local User and Groups' management tool is named 'lusrmgr.msc', an abbreviation of \"Luser Manager\".\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n\"This article is based in part on the Jargon File, which is in the public domain.\""}

{"id": "72227", "revid": "50881134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72227", "title": "Plywood", "text": "Manufactured wood panel made from thin sheets of wood veneer\nPlywood is a composite material manufactured from thin layers, or \"plies\", of wood veneer that have been stacked and glued together. It is an engineered wood from the family of manufactured boards, which include plywood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), and particle board (or chipboard).\nAll plywoods bind resin and wood fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) to form a composite material. The sheets of wood are stacked such that each layer has its grain set typically (see below) perpendicular to its adjacent layers. This alternation of the grain is called \"cross-graining\" and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed at the edges; it reduces thickness swelling and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes the strength of the panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced, that is, the surface layers have their grains set parallel to one another. This balance reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, it has high stiffness perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply. \nSmaller, thinner, and lower-quality plywoods may only have their plies (layers) arranged at right angles to each other. Some better-quality plywood products by design have five plies in steps of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees), giving strength in multiple axes.\nThe word \"ply\" derives from the French verb , \"to fold\", from the Latin verb , from the ancient Greek verb .\nStructural characteristics.\nA typical plywood panel has face veneers of a higher grade than the core veneers. The principal function of the core layers is to increase the separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher in the center of the panel, and at the outer fibres. Within Europe basic plywood can be divided into three main categories: birch plywood (density approx. ), mixed plywood (density approx. ) and conifer plywoods (density 460\u2013).\nTypes.\nDifferent varieties of plywood exist for different applications:\nSoftwood.\nSoftwood plywood is usually made either of cedar, Douglas fir or spruce, pine, and fir (collectively known as spruce-pine-fir or SPF) or redwood and is typically used for construction and industrial purposes.\nThe most common dimension is or the slightly larger imperial dimension of 4\u00a0feet \u00d7 8\u00a0feet. Plies vary in thickness from 1.4\u00a0mm to 4.3\u00a0mm. The number of plies\u2014which is always odd\u2014depends on the thickness and grade of the sheet. Roofing can use the thinner plywood. Subfloors are at least thick, the thickness depending on the distance between floor joists. Plywood for flooring applications is often tongue and groove (T&amp;G); This prevents one board from moving up or down relative to its neighbor, providing a solid-feeling floor when the joints do not lie over joists. T&amp;G plywood is usually found in the range. \nHardwood.\nHardwood plywood is made out of wood from dicot trees (oak, beech and mahogany) and used for demanding end uses. Hardwood plywood is characterized by its excellent strength, stiffness, durability and resistance to creep. It has a high planar shear strength and impact resistance, which make it especially suitable for heavy-duty floor and wall structures. Oriented plywood construction has a high wheel-carrying capacity. Hardwood plywood has excellent surface hardness, and damage- and wear-resistance.\nTropical.\nTropical plywood is made of mixed hardwood species of tropical timber. Originally from the Asian region, it is now also manufactured in African and South American countries. Tropical plywood is superior to softwood plywood due to its density, strength, evenness of layers, and high quality. It is usually sold at a premium in many markets if manufactured with high standards. Tropical plywood is widely used in the UK, Japan, United States, Taiwan, Korea, Dubai, and other countries worldwide. It is used for construction purposes in many regions due to its low cost. However, many countries' forests have been over-harvested, including the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, largely due to the demand for plywood production and export.\nAircraft.\nHigh-strength plywood, also known as aircraft plywood, is made from mahogany, spruce and/or birch using adhesives with an increased resistance to heat and humidity. It was used in the construction of air assault gliders during World War II and also several fighter aircraft, most notably the multi-role British De Havilland Mosquito. Nicknamed \"The Wooden Wonder\", plywood was used for the wing surfaces, and also flat sections such as bulkheads and the webs of the wing spars. The fuselage had exceptional rigidity from the bonded ply-balsa-ply 'sandwich' of its monocoque shell; elliptical in cross-section, it was formed in two separate mirror-image halves, using curved moulds.\nStructural aircraft-grade plywood is most commonly manufactured from African mahogany, spruce or birch veneers that are bonded together in a hot press over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar or from European Birch veneers throughout. Basswood is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and birch plywood but has slightly less structural strength. Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured to a number of specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in boiling water for three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies meets specifications. Aircraft grade plywood is made from three or more plies of birch, as thin as thick in total, and is extremely strong and light. \nHoward Hughes' H-4 Hercules was constructed of plywood. The plane was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company employing a plywood-and-resin Duramold process. The specialized wood veneer was made by Roddis Manufacturing in Marshfield, Wisconsin.\nDecorative (overlaid).\nUsually faced with hardwood, including ash, oak, red oak, birch, maple, mahogany, shorea (often called lauan, meranti, or Philippine mahogany, though having no relation to true mahogany), rosewood, teak and a large number of other hardwoods.\nFlexible.\nFlexible plywood is designed for making curved parts, a practice which dates back to the 1850s in furniture making. At thick, mahogany three-ply \"wiggle board\" or \"bendy board\" come in sheets with a very thin cross-grain central ply and two thicker exterior plies, either long grain on the sheet, or cross grain. Wiggle board is often glued together in two layers once it is formed into the desired curve, so that the final shape will be stiff and resist movement. Often, decorative wood veneers are added as a surface layer.\nIn the United Kingdom single-ply sheets of veneer were used to make stove pipe hats in Victorian times, so flexible modern plywood is sometimes known there as \"hatters ply\", although the original material was not strictly plywood, but a single sheet of veneer.\nMarine.\nMarine plywood is manufactured from durable face and core veneers, with few defects so it performs longer in both humid and wet conditions and resists delaminating and fungal attack. Its construction is such that it can be used in environments where it is exposed to moisture for long periods. Each wood veneer will be from tropical hardwoods and have negligible core gap, limiting the chance of trapping water in the plywood and hence providing a solid and stable glue bond. It uses an exterior Weather and Boil Proof (WBP) glue similar to most exterior plywoods.\nMarine plywood can be graded under BS 1088, which is a British Standard for marine plywood and under IS:710, an Indian Standard for marine grade plywood. There are few international standards for grading marine plywood and most of the standards are voluntary. Some marine plywood has a Lloyd's of London stamp that certifies it to be BS 1088 compliant. Some plywood is also labeled based on the wood used to manufacture it. Examples of this are Okoum\u00e9 or Meranti.\nIn the UK, one can find builders' merchants advertising a grade of ply as \"marine ply\" that does not conform to BS 1088 - generally online adverts for these products will include a caveat along the lines of \"not suitable for boat\".\nIn India, marine ply is popularly called \"Kitply\" after the brand which popularised the concept of water proof marine plywood in the 1980s.\nOther.\nOther types of plywoods include fire-retardant, moisture-resistant, wire mesh, sign-grade, or even pressure-treated. However, the plywood may be treated with various chemicals to improve the plywood's fireproofing. Each of these products is designed to fill a need in industry.\nBaltic Birch plywood is a product of an area around the Baltic Sea. Originally manufactured for European cabinet makers but now popular in the United States as well. It is very stable composed of an inner void-free core of cross-banded birch plys with an exterior grade adhesive. The face veneers are thicker than traditional cabinets.\nProduction.\nPlywood production requires a good log, called a peeler, which is generally straighter and larger in diameter than one required for processing into dimensioned lumber by a sawmill. The log is laid horizontally and rotated about its long axis while a long blade is pressed into it, causing a thin layer of wood to peel off (much as a continuous sheet of paper from a roll). An adjustable nosebar, which may be solid or a roller, is pressed against the log during rotation, to create a \"gap\" for veneer to pass through between the knife and the nosebar. The nosebar partly compresses the wood as it is peeled; it controls vibration of the peeling knife; and assists in keeping the veneer being peeled to an accurate thickness. In this way the log is peeled into sheets of veneer, which are then cut to the desired oversize dimensions, to allow it to shrink (depending on wood species) when dried. The sheets are then patched, graded, glued together and then baked in a press at a temperature of at least , and at a pressure of up to (but more commonly ) to form the plywood panel. The panel can then be patched, have minor surface defects such as splits or small knot holes filled, re-sized, sanded or otherwise refinished, depending on the market for which it is intended.\nPlywood for indoor use generally uses the less expensive urea-formaldehyde glue, which has limited water resistance, while outdoor and marine-grade plywood are designed to withstand moisture, and use a water-resistant resorcinol-formaldehyde or phenol-formaldehyde glue to prevent delamination and to retain strength in high humidity.\nThe adhesives used in plywood have become a point of concern. Both urea formaldehyde and phenol formaldehyde are carcinogenic in very high concentrations. As a result, many manufacturers are turning to low formaldehyde-emitting glue systems, denoted by an \"E\" rating. Plywood produced to \"E0\" has effectively zero formaldehyde emissions.\nIn addition to the glues being brought to the forefront, the wood resources themselves are becoming the focus of manufacturers, due in part to energy conservation, as well as concern for natural resources. There are several certifications available to manufacturers who participate in these programs. Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), and Greenguard are all certification programs that ensure that production and construction practices are sustainable. Many of these programs offer tax benefits to both the manufacturer and the end user.\nSizes.\nThe most commonly used thickness range is from . The sizes of the most commonly used plywood sheets are which was first used by the Portland Manufacturing Company, who developed modern veneer core plywood for the 1905 Portland World Fair. A common metric size for a sheet of plywood is 1200 \u00d7 2400\u00a0mm. is also a common European size for Baltic birch ply, and aircraft ply.\nSizes on specialised plywood for concrete-forming can range from , and a multitude of formats exist, though 15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 (19/32in\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0ft-6in\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0ft-11in) is very commonly used.\nAircraft plywood is available in thicknesses of (3-ply construction) and upwards; typically aircraft plywood uses veneers of 0.5\u00a0mm\u00a0(approx\u00a01/64\u00a0in) thickness although much thinner veneers such as 0.1\u00a0mm are also used in construction of some of the thinner panels.\nGrades.\nGrading rules differ according to the country of origin. The most popular standards are the British Standard (BS) and the American Standard (ASTM). Joyce (1970), however, list some general indication of grading rules:\nApplications.\nPlywood is used in many applications that need high-quality, high-strength sheet material. Quality in this context means resistance to cracking, breaking, shrinkage, twisting and warping.\nExterior glued plywood is suitable for outdoor use, but because moisture affects the strength of wood, optimal performance is achieved where the moisture content remains relatively low. Subzero conditions do not affect the dimensional or strength properties of plywood, making some special applications possible.\nPlywood is also used as an engineering material for stressed-skin applications. It has been used for marine and aviation applications since WWII. Most notable is the British de Havilland Mosquito bomber, with a fuselage made of birch plywood sandwiching a balsa core, and using plywood extensively for the wings. Plywood was also used for the hulls in the hard-chine Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) and Motor Gun Boats (MGB) built by the British Power Boat Company and Vosper's, American PT boats, and the Higgins landing craft critical to the D-Day landings. The American designers Charles and Ray Eames are known for their plywood-based furniture, as is Finnish Architect Alvar Aalto and his firm Artek, while Phil Bolger has designed a wide range of boats built primarily of plywood. Jack K\u00f6per of Cape Town designed the plywood Dabchick sailing dinghy, which as of 2015[ [update]] is still sailed by large numbers of teenagers.\nPlywood is often used to create curved surfaces because it can easily bend with the grain. Skateboard ramps often utilize plywood as the top smooth surface over bent curves to create transition that can simulate the shapes of ocean waves.\nSoftwood plywood.\nTypical end uses of spruce plywood are:\nThere are coating solutions available that mask the prominent grain structure of spruce plywood. For these coated plywoods there are some end uses where reasonable strength is needed but the lightness of spruce is a benefit, e.g.:\nHardwood plywood.\nPhenolic resin film coated (Film Faced) hardwood plywood is typically used as a ready-to-install component e.g.:\n(\"Wire\" or other styles of imprinting available for better traction)\nBirch plywood is used as a structural material in special applications e.g.:\nSmooth surface and accurate thickness combined with the durability of the material makes birch plywood a favorable material for many special end uses e.g.:\nTropical plywood.\nTropical plywood is widely available from the South-East Asia region, mainly from Malaysia and Indonesia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His base of power was the largest circulation newspaper in the world, the \"Daily Express\", which appealed to the conservative working class with intensely patriotic news and editorials. During the Second World War, he played a major role in mobilising industrial resources as Winston Churchill's Minister of Aircraft Production.\nThe young Max Aitken had a gift for making money and was a millionaire by the age of 30. His business ambitions quickly exceeded opportunities in Canada, and he moved to Britain. There he befriended Andrew Bonar Law and with his support won a seat in the House of Commons at the December 1910 United Kingdom general election. A knighthood followed shortly after. During the First World War, he ran the Canadian Records office in London, and played a role in the removal of H.\u00a0H. Asquith as prime minister in 1916. The resulting coalition government (with David Lloyd George as prime minister and Bonar Law as Chancellor of the Exchequer) rewarded Aitken with a peerage and, briefly, a Cabinet post as Minister of Information.\nAfter the war, the now Lord Beaverbrook concentrated on his business interests. He built the \"Daily Express\" into the most successful mass-circulation newspaper in the world, with sales of 2.25 million copies a day across Britain. He used it to pursue personal campaigns, most notably for tariff reform and for the British Empire to become a free trade bloc. Beaverbrook supported the governments of Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain throughout the 1930s and was persuaded by another long-standing political friend, Winston Churchill, to serve as his Minister of Aircraft Production from May 1940. Churchill later praised his \"vital and vibrant energy\". He resigned due to ill-health in 1941 but later in the war was appointed Lord Privy Seal.\nBeaverbrook spent his later life running his newspapers, which by then included the \"Evening Standard\" and the \"Sunday Express\". He served as Chancellor of the University of New Brunswick and developed a reputation as a historian with his books on political and military history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nAitken was born in Maple, Ontario, Canada, in 1879, one of the ten children of William Cuthbert Aitken, a Scottish-born Presbyterian minister, and Jane (Noble), the daughter of a prosperous local farmer and storekeeper Joseph Vaughan Noble. When he was a year old, the family moved to Newcastle, New Brunswick, which Aitken later considered to be his hometown. It was here, at the age of 13, that he set up a school newspaper, \"The Leader\". Whilst at school, he delivered newspapers, sold newspaper subscriptions and was the local correspondent for the \"St John Daily Star\".\nAitken took the entrance examinations for Dalhousie University, but because he had declined to sit the Greek and Latin papers, he was refused entry. He registered at the King's College Law School, but left after a short while. This was to be his only formal higher education. Aitken worked in a shop, then borrowed some money to move to Chatham, New Brunswick, where he worked as a local correspondent for the \"Montreal Star\", sold life insurance and collected debts. Aitken attempted to train as a lawyer and worked for a short time in the law office of R. B. Bennett, a future prime minister of Canada. Aitken managed Bennett's successful campaign for a place on Chatham town council. When Bennett left the law firm, Aitken moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where he again sold life insurance before moving to Calgary where he helped to run Bennett's campaign for a seat in the legislative assembly of the North-West Territories in the 1898 general election. After an unsuccessful attempt to establish a meat business, Aitken returned to Saint John and to selling insurance.\nEarly business career.\nIn 1900, Aitken made his way to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where John F. Stairs, a member of the city's dominant business family, gave him employment and trained him in the business of finance. In 1904, when Stairs launched the Royal Securities Corporation, Aitken became a minority shareholder and the firm's general manager. Under the tutelage of Stairs, who would be his mentor and friend, Aitken engineered a number of successful business deals and was planning a series of bank mergers.\nStairs' unexpected early death in September 1904 led to Aitken acquiring control of the company and moving to Montreal, then the business capital of Canada. There he bought and sold companies, invested in stocks and shares and also developed business interests in both Cuba and Puerto Rico. He started a weekly magazine, the \"Canadian Century\" in 1910, invested in the \"Montreal Herald\" and almost acquired the \"Montreal Gazette\". In 1907 he founded the Montreal Engineering Company. In 1909, also under the umbrella of his Royal Securities Company, Aitken founded the Calgary Power Company Limited, now the TransAlta Corporation, and oversaw the building of the Horseshoe Falls hydro station.\nIn 1910\u20131911 Aitken acquired a number of small regional cement plants in Canada, including Sir Sandford Fleming's Western Canada Cement Co. plant at Exshaw, Alberta, and amalgamated them into Canada Cement, eventually controlling four-fifths of the cement production in Canada. Canada was booming economically at the time, and Aitken had close to a monopoly on the material. There were irregularities in the stock transfers leading to the conglomeration of the cement plants, resulting in much criticism of Aitken, as well as accusations of price-gouging and poor management of the cement plants under his company's control. Aitken sold his shares, making a large amount of money.\nAitken had made his first visit to Britain in September 1908, and when he returned there in the spring of 1910, in an attempt to raise money to form a steel company, he decided to make the move permanent, but not before he led the underwriting, with a preponderance of British money, of an amalgamation of smaller units into the Steel Company of Canada. Very shortly later Aitken moved his family to the UK.\nMove to Britain.\nIn 1910, Aitken moved to Britain, and he became friends with Bonar Law, a native of New Brunswick and the only Canadian to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The two men had a lot in common: they were both sons of the manse from Scottish-Canadian families and both were successful businessmen. Aitken persuaded Bonar Law to support him in standing for the Unionist Party in the December 1910 general election at Ashton-under-Lyne. Aitken was an excellent organiser and, with plenty of money for publicity, he won the seat by 196 votes. Aitken's \"bumptious\" election campaign brought him some notoriety.\nAitken rarely spoke in the House of Commons, but he did promise substantial financial support to the Unionist Party, and in 1911 he was knighted by King George V. Aitken's political influence grew when Bonar Law replaced A.J. Balfour as leader of the Unionist party late in 1911. Aitken's demands for a protectionist bloc uniting the British empire made him into a disruptive force in the Conservative and Unionist ranks as the idea of a bloc would mean higher food prices, making the plan unpopular with many segments of the British people who disliked the \"food taxes\" and \"stomach taxes\". The great dividing line in British politics were between the Whole Hoggers who were willing to accept higher food prices as the consequences of a protectionist bloc vs. the Free Fooders who were not. Aitken had a financial interest in the supporting the Whole Hoggers as in 1912 he purchased all of the grain terminals in Alberta in the expectation that an Imperial Preference tariffs would soon be enacted as law. Aitken had little to do as an MP, and set about seeking the acceptance of British elites. The British historian Neal Ascherson wrote: \"The first is that posh English society was no match for him. He was 'vulgar', but there was a charm in his self-promotion which made languid ladies and gentlemen want to be on his side and at his side. He was wildly rich even then, but knew how to use his wealth in hospitality and (discreetly) by rescuing grand friends from awkward debts. Above all, he was fun to be with.\"\nIn 1911, Aitken was strongly opposed to the reciprocity agreement with the United States signed by the Liberal prime minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, which he believed would lead to the American annexation of Canada. As such, Aitken temporarily returned to Canada to vigorously campaign for the Conservatives led by Sir Robert Borden. Aitken had his friend Rudyard Kipling intervene in the election on behalf of the Conservatives. At the time the line between British and English-Canadian national identities was more blurred than today, and Aitken did not regard Kipling as a \"foreign\" figure. On 7 September 1911, the \"Montreal Daily Star\" (the most widely read newspaper in Canada at the time) published a front-page appeal to all Canadians by Kipling, where he wrote: \"It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration, Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial, legal, financial, social and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States.\" Kipling's article attracted much attention in Canada and was reprinted in every English-language Canadian newspaper over the following week, where it was credited with helping the Conservatives win the election.\nAitken bought Cherkley Court south of Leatherhead in Surrey and entertained lavishly there. In 1913, the house was offered as a venue for negotiations between Bonar Law and the Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, over Ulster and Irish home rule. Later in life, Aitken wrote about his early political efforts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Empire Fiscal Union was, in fact, my only reason for entering politics in Britain and for continuing to take an interest in public life. My devotion to Bonar Law, my belief in his Leadership, my faith in his ability to give to the Empire some day, perhaps some day soon, the Union I so ardently desired, had kept me in close and intimate touch with him and his political problems.\nAitken continued to grow his business interests while in Parliament, and also began to build a British newspaper empire. After the death of Charles Rolls in 1910, Aitken bought his shares in Rolls-Royce Limited, and over the next two years gradually increased his holding in the company. However, Claude Johnson, Rolls-Royce's Commercial managing director, resisted his attempt to gain control of the company, and in October 1913 Aitken sold his holding to James Buchanan Duke of the American Tobacco Company. In January 1911 Aitken secretly invested \u00a325,000 in the failing \"Daily Express\". An attempt to buy the \"Evening Standard\" failed, but he did gain control of another London evening paper, \"The Globe\". In November 1916, a share deal worth \u00a317,500, with Lawson Johnson, landed Aitken a controlling interest in the \"Daily Express\", but again he kept the deal secret.\nFirst World War.\nDue to the outbreak of the First World War, Aitken was able to show off his great organisational skills. He was innovative in the employment of artists, photographers and film-makers to record life on the Western Front. Aitken also established the Canadian War Memorials Fund, which evolved into a collection of art works by the premier artists and sculptors in Britain and Canada. In accordance with establishing these works, he was also instrumental in creating the Canadian War Records Office in London and arranged for stories about Canadian forces appearing in newspapers. His visits to the Western Front, with the honorary rank of colonel in the Canadian Army, resulted in his 1916 book \"Canada in Flanders\", a three-volume collection that chronicled the achievements of Canadian soldiers on the battlefields. Aitken also wrote several books after the war, including \"Politicians and the Press\" in 1925 and \"Politicians and the War\" in 1928. At a time when censorship was extremely strict with British journalists being kept away from the Western Front, Aitken's 'Eyewitness' reports from the Western Front, which were published in the Canadian newspapers, made him famous.\nAitken became increasingly hostile towards the British Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, whom he considered to be mismanaging the war effort. Aitken's opinion of Asquith did not improve when he failed to get a post in the Cabinet reshuffle of May 1915. An attempt by Bonar Law to secure the Order of St Michael and St George for Aitken was also blocked by Asquith. After the failure of the Dardanelles campaign, Winston Churchill was sacked as the First Lord of the Admiralty, and Aitken went to see him to offer him his sympathy. Aitken wrote about Churchill: \"The charm, the imaginative sympathy of his hours of defeat, the self-confidence, the arrogance of his hours of power and prosperity\". Later, when Churchill went to the Western Front, Aitken allowed him to stay as his guest at his house in Saint-Omer. Ascherson wrote: \"A momentous friendship began. In return for contacts and inside information, Aitken would give Churchill hope and energy, and Churchill \u2013 in spite of some volcanic quarrels over the next half-century \u2013 came to rely on him not only as a political and journalistic ally but as an unfailing source of optimism, gossip, reassurance and sheer fun.\"\nAitken was happy to play a small part, which he greatly exaggerated, as a go-between when Asquith was forced from office and replaced by David Lloyd George in December 1916. The man Aitken wanted to see replace Asquith was Bonar Law, not Lloyd George. Lloyd George offered to appoint Aitken as President of the Board of Trade. At that time, an MP taking a cabinet post for the first time had to resign and stand for re-election in a by-election. Aitken made arrangements for this, but then Lloyd George decided to appoint Albert Stanley instead. Aitken was a friend of Stanley and agreed to continue with the resignation, so that Stanley could take Aitken's seat in Parliament and be eligible for ministerial office. In return, Aitken received a peerage on 23 January 1917 as the \"1st Baron Beaverbrook\", the name \"Beaverbrook\" being adopted from a small community near his boyhood home. He had initially considered \"Lord Miramichi\", but rejected it on the advice of Louise Manny as too difficult to pronounce. The name \"Beaverbrook\" also had the advantage of conveying a distinctive Canadian ring to the title.\nBeaverbrook's controlling stake in the \"Daily Express\" became public knowledge later in 1917, and he was criticised by parts of the Conservative Party for financing a publication they regarded as irresponsible and often unhelpful to the party.\nOn 10 February 1918, Beaverbrook became the first minister in the newly formed Ministry of Information, was also made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and was sworn of the Privy Council. Beaverbrook became responsible for propaganda in Allied and neutral countries and Lord Northcliffe (owner of the \"Daily Mail\" and \"The Times\") became Director of Propaganda with control of propaganda in enemy countries. Beaverbrook established the British War Memorials Committee within the Ministry, on lines similar to the earlier Canadian war art scheme, but when he established a private charity that would receive income from BWMC exhibitions, it was regarded as a conflict of interest and he dropped the scheme. Beaverbrook had a number of clashes with the Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour over the use of intelligence material. He felt that intelligence should become part of his department, but Balfour disagreed. Eventually, the intelligence committee was assigned to Beaverbrook, but they then resigned \"en masse\" to be re-employed by the Foreign Office. In August 1918, Lloyd George became furious with Beaverbrook over a leader in the \"Daily Express\" threatening to withdraw support from the government over tariff reform. Beaverbrook increasingly came under attack from MPs who distrusted a press baron being employed by the state. He survived but became increasingly frustrated with his limited role and influence, and in October 1918, he resigned due to ill health. A tooth had become infected with actinomycosis and the often fatal disease progressed into his throat; his English doctors were unable to provide a cure, and it was a Portuguese medic who cured him by administering iodine solution orally until the infection was arrested.\nA. J. P. Taylor later wrote that Beaverbrook was a pathbreaker who \"invented all the methods of publicity\" used by Britain to promote the war, including the nation's first war artists, the first war photographers, and the first makers of war films. He was especially effective in promoting the sales of war bonds to the general public. Nevertheless, he was widely disliked and distrusted by the political elite, who were suspicious of all they sneeringly called \"press lords\".\nPress baron.\nAfter the war, Beaverbrook concentrated on running the \"Daily Express\". He turned the dull newspaper into a glittering and witty journal with an optimistic attitude, filled with an array of dramatic photo layouts. He hired first-rate writers such as Francis Williams and the cartoonist David Low. He embraced new technology and bought new presses to print the paper in Manchester. In 1919, the circulation of the \"Daily Express\" was under 40,000 a day; by 1937, it was 2,329,000 a day, making it the most successful of all British newspapers and generating huge profits for Beaverbrook, whose wealth was already such that he never took a salary. After the Second World War, the \"Daily Express\" became the largest-selling newspaper in the world, with a circulation of 3,706,000. Beaverbrook launched the \"Sunday Express\" in December 1918, but it only established a significant readership after John Junor became its editor in 1954. In 1923, in a joint deal with Lord Rothermere, Beaverbrook bought the \"Evening Standard\". Beaverbrook acquired a controlling stake in the Glasgow \"Evening Citizen\", and in 1928 he launched the \"Scottish Daily Express\".\nAfter the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, Beaverbrook, with Lords Rothermere, Camrose and Kemsley became one of the four so-called press barons that were the dominant figures in the inter-war press. By 1937, the four owned nearly one in every two national and local daily papers sold in Britain, as well as one in every three Sunday papers that were sold. The combined circulation of all their newspapers amounted to over thirteen million.\nBeaverbrook purchased The Vineyard, Fulham, a \"tiny Tudor house in Hurlingham Road\" where ... \"far from the centre of London I was relieved of casual callers and comparatively free of long-winded visitors. I provided facilities by means of private telephone lines without any direct contact with the Telephone Exchanges. Thus the political conferences held there were safeguarded against interruption.\" Powerful friends and acquaintances such as Asquith, Lloyd George, Churchill, Frederick Edwin Smith, Philip Sassoon, Diana and Duff Cooper, Balfour and Tim Healy were guests at both Cherkley and the Vineyard. The circle included Valentine Castlerosse, H. G. Wells and Rudyard Kipling, who was godfather to Beaverbrook's youngest son Peter, but this did nothing to repair the rift that developed between them when Beaverbrook endorsed Irish Home Rule.\nBeaverbrook, the first baron of Fleet Street, was often denounced as excessively powerful because his newspapers supposedly could make or break almost anyone. Beaverbrook enjoyed using his papers to attack his opponents and to promote his friends. From 1919 to 1922, he attacked David Lloyd George and his government on several issues. A colourful character, the American historian Randall Woods described him as \"...a sharp, intense, unpredictable man. He was something of a firebrand, tending to overstatement and even irresponsibility in his editorials or public statements...Conspiracy was second nature to him...In conversation, Beaverbrook was constantly exaggerating and embellishing.\" Beaverbrook was considered to be likeable character full of charm and zest, but he was widely distrusted by the British elite as he was viewed as an unprincipled intriguer. A flamboyant, charismatic man full of dynamism and exuberance who stood out on account of his Canadian Maritime accent, Beaverbrook was the subject of much fascination by the public. He was disliked by his employees as a demanding boss who had telephones installed in every room of his house so that he could always call his newspapers editors to give his orders about what story was interesting him at the moment without having to wait. Beaverbrook's much vaunted principle of \"independence\" under which he felt free to attack his allies via his newspapers made him few friends.\nThough a Conservative, Beaverbrook was opposed to British intervention in the Russian civil war and used his newspapers to argue that the question of who ruled Russia was no business of Britain's. Beaverbrook had one of his periodic falling outs with Churchill at the time, and saw attacking intervention in the Russian civil war, which Churchill had strongly promoted, as a way of lashing out. For example, on 6 September 1919, Beaverbrook ran on the front page of \"The Daily Express\" a banner headline, \"ARCHANGEL SCANDAL EXPOSED: FAMOUS VC APPEALS TO THE NATION\" above an article attacking the intervention as pointless and singled Churchill as the author of an expedition that had gone horribly wrong. The subtitle of the article was \"DUPLICITY OF CHRUCHILL'S POLICY TOWARDS RUSSIA-THE PUBLIC HUMBUGGED\". A linked article claimed that the British force in Arkhangelsk were poised to go deep into Russia with the aim of overthrowing the Bolshevik regime, and Churchill had lied to the British people about the purpose of the expedition. In 1920, Beaverbrook opposed British aid to Poland on the grounds that the Soviet-Polish war did not involve British interests.\nBeaverbrook opposed Zionism and visited Palestine in 1923. There, he hired anti-Zionist writer Jacob Isra\u00ebl de Haan to be the \"Daily Express\" correspondent. De Haan wrote anonymously for his own safety, but was nevertheless identified and murdered by the Zionist Haganah the following year.\nBeaverbrook began supporting independent Conservative candidates and campaigned for fifteen years to remove Stanley Baldwin from the leadership of the Conservative Party. In the 1924 election, he used the \"Daily Express\" to associate the Labour Party with the Soviet Union, writing in a leader: \"We are not fighting Mr. Ramsay MacDonald in his saner moments, but the Russian Bolshevists and the shade of Lenin.\" The \"Daily Express\" did not first publish the so-called Zinoviev letter, a probably forged letter in which Grigory Zinoviev, the chief of the Comintern, was alleged to order British Communists to infiltrate the Labour Party and the military, which was published in the \"Daily Mail\" instead. However, after the Zinoviev letter was published, Beaverbrook had the \"Daily Express\" in its coverage of 1924 election associate the Labour Party with Communism. The cartoons which the \"Daily Express\" published tended to depict Communists as alien, dirty, hairy, and unkempt, thereby associating them with popular stereotypes of the poor.\nIn foreign policy, Beaverbrook promoted a policy known as \"empire isolationism\", namely that Britain should devote its interests to the British empire, but be otherwise disengaged from the rest of the world. A recurring theme of Beaverbrook's newspapers was that Britain was not a European nation, and should have as little to do as possible with the affairs of Europe. Likewise, Beaverbrook was opposed to British membership in the League of Nations and in a 1923 leader advocated giving up the Palestine Mandate (modern Israel), which Britain held as the administering power for the League, under the grounds that Palestine was more of a debit than a credit for the British empire. A typical statement from Beaverbrook was: \"The British empire exists for the British race. It is our heritage. Let us cultivate it, defend it, cherish it, and make it great, rich and strong in righteousness, an example and object lesson for the rest of mankind\". In 1925, Beaverbrook wrote: \"In the Empire and not in Europe our future lies and the \"Daily Express\" has never failed to preach the Imperial doctrine in good or bad times. The \"Daily Express\" believes that the British Empire is the greatest instrument for good the world has ever seen\". Beaverbrook believed that protecting the greatness as he saw it of the empire could be best accomplished via \"splendid isolation\" as he consistently argued for an isolationist foreign policy. In 1925, Beaverbrook via the \"Daily Express\" was strongly opposed to the Treaty of Locarno under which Britain \"guaranteed\" the current borders of France, Belgium, and Germany along with the permanent demilitarized status of the Rhineland as involvement in European conflicts where no British interests were at stake.\nReflecting his origins, Beaverbrook always thought in terms of the British empire rather than of Britain, and he had an essentially Commonwealth perspective as he argued that the Dominions were just as important as Britain in holding the empire together. Beaverbrook believed that because Britain had more people than what British agriculture was capable of feeding while the Dominions produced more food than what their people needed that a symbiotic relationship would be possible with British industry supplying the manufactured goods for the Dominions while the Dominions would supply food and other raw materials to Britain. As such, Beaverbrook wanted to see the end of all trade barriers within the Commonwealth and a system of tariffs to keep non-Commonwealth products out of the Commonwealth to form what he called the Empire Free Trade zone. Taylor credited Beaverbrook's Canadian origins for his beliefs about an \"Empire Free Trade zone\" as he wrote: \"At the bottom this was pure sentiment, a desire to be both British as well as Canadian, and a desire, also characteristic of a Canadian, that the British empire should maintain its independence from the United States\".\nBeaverbrook had long resented Baldwin's leadership of the Conservative Party and the loss of his influence that had followed the resignation of Bonar Law in 1923. Beaverbrook had privately \"rejoiced\" when the Conservatives lost the 1929 election, seeing Labour's victory as a chance to impose his views on the Conservative party, especially with regard to the Empire Free Trade zone. Through there was much discontent within the Conservative ranks over Baldwin's leadership, Beaverbrook was regarded as an \"untouchable\" by the Conservative elite. In July 1929, Beaverbrook launched the Empire Crusade movement to campaign for the \"Empire Free Trade zone\", which attracted support from various Tory backbencher MPs, peers and local riding associations.\nHe very shrewdly sold the majority of his share holdings before the 1929 crash and in the resulting depression, launched a new political party to promote free trade within the British Empire. Empire Free Trade Crusade candidates had some success. An Independent Conservative who supported Empire Free Trade won the Twickenham by-election in 1929. In December 1929, Beaverbrook set up a central office to coordinate the Empire Crusade movement. However, Beaverbrook could not quite decide if the purpose of the Empire Crusade was to depose Baldwin or just merely have the Conservative party give him the respect he felt he deserved. In February 1930, the Empire Crusade movement was joined by Lord Rothermere, the proprietor of the \"Daily Mail\". Beaverbrook and Rothermere founded that month the United Empire Party. The United Empire Party was intended to split the right-wing vote to such an extent that it would be impossible for the Conservatives to ever win a general vote again, and in this way Rothermre and Beaverbrook intended to impose their will on the Conservative party. However, Beaverbrook and Rothermere differed in their intentions. Rothermere made it very clear that he wanted to see Baldwin replaced with a puppet leader of his choosing. Likewise, Rothermere had doubts about the \"food taxes\" as the proposed tariffs on food were known and promoted a \"no-surrender line\" with regard to the Government of India Act. The Empire Free Trade candidate won the South Paddington by-election in October 1930. In February 1931, Empire Free Trade lost the Islington East by-election and, by splitting the vote with the Conservatives, allowed Labour to hold a seat they had been expected to lose. Duff Cooper's victory for the Conservatives in the St George's Westminster by-election in March 1931 marked the end of the movement as an electoral force.\nOn 17 March 1931, during the St George's Westminster by-election, Stanley Baldwin described the media barons who owned British newspapers as having \"Power without responsibility\u00a0\u2013 the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages.\"\n\"Empire Isolationism\" and appeasement.\nIn March 1933, he visited Germany, where he wrote that it was his impression that \"the stories of Jewish persecution are exaggerated\". His most enduring impressions of his German trip was he felt that SA could not march properly, and he seemed to regard the Nazis as something of a joke who were not capable of achieving much of anything. Beaverbrook frequently changed his views about Adolf Hitler, which caused the obituary writers that worked for him much anguish as they were forced to change their drafts of a Hitler obituary from positive to negative to positive again. After the Night of the Long Knives, Beaverbrook \"turned solidly, fanatically anti-Hitler\" as he compared Hitler to Al Capone and the Nazis to gangsters. Beaverbrook was to change his opinions about Hitler a number of times afterwards.\nIn a guest opinion column published in April 1935 in the Hearst newspapers, Beaverbrook set out to explain \"the section of opinion to which I belong - the Isolationists\". Beaverbrook advocated that: \"Britain should make no alliances except with the United States, that we should incur no obligations, no responsibilities, no liabilities outside of the Empire except in relation to the Anglo-Saxon race\". He supported the \"limited liability\" rearmament under which the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy were built up at the expense of the British Army as the rearmament programme in best accord with his own foreign policy ideas. In 1935, Beaverbrook campaigned against the Peace Ballot, an unofficial referendum organised in 1935 by the League of Nations Union, as the \"Ballot of Blood\". He was concerned that if Britain should be obliged to enforce the collective security policies of the League of Nations against aggression, it could involve Britain in wars where no British interests were at stake. In a leader in the \"Daily Express\", he wrote the collective security policy of the League \"will drag you and your children into a war\" caused by \"the ambitious and unscrupulous powers\" that were the other members of the League (Beaverbrook failed to mention that to activate collective security required the approval of the League Council, of which Britain was a veto-holding member). Beaverbrook stated that his readers should not take part in the Peace Ballot and wrote: \"Tear up the ballot paper. Throw the pieces in the waste paper basket. Turn away from Europe. Stand by the Empire and Splendid Isolation\".\nDuring the crisis caused by the Italian aggression against Ethiopia, Beaverbrook was opposed to the policy of imposing sanctions on Italy under the banner of the League of Nations, as he argued that the Italo-Ethiopian war did not concern Britain. In a leader, he warned that the sanctions on Italy might cause a \"world race war\", as he stated that Ethiopia was not worth fighting for, as it was an African nation. Likewise, when Germany remilitarised the Rhineland on 7 March 1936, violating both the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Locarno, Beaverbrook used his newspapers to argue against Britain taking action to enforce the treaties it had signed. Beaverbrook maintained good relations with Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador in London, writing to him in 1936 about his \"...friendly attitude towards your Great Leader\" and he was \"determined that nothing shall be said or done by any newspaper controlled by me which is likely to disturb your tenure in office\". Beaverbrook concluded \"while I am free, and my newspapers in the attitude I take to the Russian leader, I must say I admire and praise his conduct of government\". In 1936, at the invitation of Joachim von Ribbentrop, the new German ambassador to the Court of St. James, Beaverbrook attended the opening of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, but quickly became bored with the Third Reich and soon returned to Britain.\"\nIn the 1930s, while personally attempting to dissuade King Edward VIII from continuing his affair with American divorcee, Wallis Simpson, Beaverbrook's newspapers published every titbit of the affair, especially allegations about pro-Nazi sympathies. Reflecting his \"empire isolationism\", Beaverbrook used the \"Daily Express\" to promote British neutrality as he wrote a leader which compared supporting the Second Spanish Republic as alike to supporting the Whites in the Russian Civil War, as he declared that British intervention in the Russian civil war \"cost us some thousands of British soldiers' lives, \u00a3100,000,000 in cash, and the bitter enmity of the Russian government for the next ten years...and the intervention failed anyway. Britain had backed a loser. It is the mark of a mug to go on backing the same loser\". In 1936, the \"Daily Express\" published an opinion piece by Lloyd George who had just returned from meeting Hitler at the Nuremberg Party Rally in which he called \"der F\u00fchrer\" \"the George Washington of Germany\". Beaverbrook published the piece, but told Lloyd George that he was embarrassed by it as he disliked \"the regimentation of opinion\" in Germany. In regards to the Sino-Japanese war, Beaverbrook was entirely concerned about a possible Japanese threat to the British empire and used the \"Daily Express\" to sound his fears that the Japanese might try to seize the British colonies in Asia. In a 1938 leader, Beaverbrook warned: \"Too many people would be interested in checking Japan if that country really MEANT trouble against white people...The British public seem to have sensed what the British ministers have not - that Japan is dynamiting her way not only through the Chinese empire, but dangerously near other empires. Get out your map!\" Along the leader was a map that showed the proximity of Japanese troops to Hong Kong. Beaverbrook supported the Munich Agreement and hoped the newly named Duke of Windsor would seek a peace deal with Germany.\nTestifying before a Parliamentary inquiry in 1947, former \"Express\" employee and future MP Michael Foot alleged that Beaverbrook kept a blacklist of notable public figures who were to be denied any publicity in his papers because of personal disputes. Foot said they included Sir Thomas Beecham, Paul Robeson, Haile Selassie and No\u00ebl Coward. Beaverbrook himself gave evidence before the inquiry and vehemently denied the allegations; Express Newspapers general manager E. J. Robertson denied that Robeson had been blacklisted, but did admit that Coward had been \"boycotted\" because he had enraged Beaverbrook with his film \"In Which We Serve\", for in the opening sequence Coward included an ironic shot showing a copy of the \"Daily Express\" floating in the dockside rubbish bearing the headline \"No War This Year\".\nIn the late 1930s, Beaverbrook used his newspapers to promote the appeasement policies of the Chamberlain government. The slogan 'There will be no war' was used by the \"Daily Express\". At the time of the Sudetenland crisis, Beaverbrook wrote in a leader: \"... do not get caught up in quarrels over foreign boundaries that do not concern you.\" Beaverbrook was strongly opposed to the famous \"guarantee\" offered by Chamberlain for Poland in the House of Commons on 31 March 1939 under his usual grounds that Britain had no interests in Poland, and no reason to go to war for Poland. Beaverbrook told Maisky: \"I want the empire to remain intact, but I don't understand why for the sake of this we must wage a three-year war to crush \"Hitlerism\"...Poland, Czechoslovakia? What are they to do with us? Cursed be the day when Chamberlain gave our guarantees to Poland!\" On 4 August 1939, a leader in the \"Daily Express\" questioned the need for British commitments to Poland as it was declared: \"while there are some reasons in favour of an alliance with France...our alliances in Eastern Europe are another matter\". On 7 August 1939, the \"Daily Express\" ran a banner headline saying \"No War This Year\" as it predicated the Danzig crisis would be settled peacefully. In a memo dated 3 March 1943, Beaverbrook was unapologetic about the \"no war\" headlines as he wrote: \"The prophecy proved wrong. The policy, had it been pursued more vigorously might have proved it right\". The British historian Daniel Hucker wrote that Beaverbrook was out of touch with the readers of his newspapers in the summer of 1939.\nSecond World War.\nThough Beaverbrook did not welcome the British declaration of war on the \"Reich\" on 3 September 1939, he had his newspapers take an ultra-patriotic line in supporting the war effort, not least because he knew the vast majority of his readers supported the war. During the Second World War, in May 1940, his friend Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, appointed Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft Production. Beaverbrook was given almost dictatorial powers over all aspects of aircraft production. In June 1940, Beaverbrook went with Churchill in a desperate mission to Tours to meet the French government with the aim of keeping France in the war. The French Premier, Paul Reynaud, was against an armistice with Germany and in favor of continuing the war from Algeria, but the strongest voice in the French cabinet was that of Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the revered \"Victor of Verdun\", who argued for an immediate armistice. Churchill devised a scheme for an Anglo-French Union as a way to keep France in the war, which Beaverbrook was strongly opposed to. Unlike Churchill, Beaverbrook did not see any particular importance of keeping France in the war, and was much more indifferent to the prospect of France being defeated than was the prime minister, arguing that Britain still had the Commonwealth and the empire. Churchill's viewpoint that if France were occupied, it would shorten the flying time of the Luftwaffe to bomb Britain from hours to minutes and allow the \"Kriegsmarine\" to use the French Atlantic ports to attack shipping in the Western Approaches made no impression on Beaverbrook. The plans for an Anglo-French union fell flat when P\u00e9tain - who regarded the plan for a union as a way for the British to seize France's colonial empire - persuaded the French cabinet to reject it.\nWith Churchill's blessing, Beaverbrook overhauled all aspects of wartime aircraft production. He increased production targets by 15% across the board, took control of aircraft repairs and RAF storage units, replaced the management of plants that were underperforming, and released German Jewish engineers from internment to work in the factories. He seized materials and equipment destined for other departments and was perpetually at odds with the Air Ministry. Beaverbrook did not tolerate the arguments that supply \"bottlenecks\" were hindering aircraft production and required that aircraft manufacturers submit to him a daily list of \"bottlenecks\" which he made his mission to resolve. One of Beaverbrook's first acts as minister of aircraft production was to order the \"cannibalization\" of all wrecked aircraft, which totalled about 2,000 aeroplanes. For every two wrecked planes, it was possible to fashion a new plane. His appeal for pots and pans \"to make Spitfires\" was afterwards revealed by his son, Sir Max Aitken, to have been nothing more than a propaganda exercise. Still, a \"Time Magazine\" cover story declared, \"Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook's fault. If she holds out, it will be his triumph. This war is a war of machines. It will be won on the assembly line.\"\nUnder Beaverbrook, fighter and bomber production increased so much so that Churchill declared: \"His personal force and genius made this Aitken's finest hour.\" Beaverbrook's impact on wartime production has been much debated but he certainly energized production at a time when it was desperately needed. The biography by Anthony Furze of Wilfrid Freeman, a senior official in the Ministry of Aircraft Production, discusses the Beaverbrook myth 'Magic is nine tenth's illusion' describing how Freeman had to limit the worst side-effects of Beaverbrook's short-term thinking (Spellmount Press, 2000). The Royal Marine General Leslie Hollis who worked as the Senior Assistant Secretary to the War Cabinet recalled in an interview: \"For all Beaverbrook's tremendous achievement in producing aeroplanes, there was little to praise in the way he rode roughshod over everyone. He never carried an oil can. He did as he liked, when he liked. He once promoted an Air Commodore to Air Vice-Marshal-over the heads of fifty more senior Air Commodores. This sort of behavior did not make for happiness, but it was the way he worked, and the end justified the means\". Hollis stated that for Beaverbrook all that mattered was if someone was efficient or not, and he was very ruthless about sacking those he viewed as inefficient. However, it has been argued that aircraft production was already rising when Beaverbrook took charge and that he was fortunate to inherit a system which was just beginning to bear fruit. Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, Head of Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain wrote that \"We had the organization, we had the men, we had the spirit which could bring us victory in the air but we had not the supply of machines necessary to withstand the drain of continuous battle. Lord Beaverbrook gave us those machines, and I do not believe that I exaggerate when I say that no other man in England could have done so.\" Hollis recalled in an interview: \"Beaverbrook's ruthless, cut-throat, steam-roller approach to every problem made him feared as well as respected. You either got on with him or you did not; and in the latter case, it was better and safer to give him a wide berth. Nevertheless, he was a staunch and faithful friend to me, and immensely kind.\" Beaverbrook increasingly came into conflict with Ernest Bevin over a number of issues such as whose ministry would be responsible for safety training in aircraft factories, and the two ministers spent much time feuding. Hollis recalled: \"Their hostility grew to such an extent that it embarrassed Mr. Churchill, and caused a great deal of unhappiness in the government. It seemed astonishing that, at such a time, two men of such stature and ability should be so eager to score points off each other. I was especially grieved at this because I admired both men very much\". Hollis also recalled that Beaverbrook's relations with Churchill would vary dramatically as he stated: \"Beaverbrook's friendship with Churchill was of very long standing and to my mind, quite stormy. They would fight and argue every Monday and Tuesday; part on Wednesday and Thursday; and then make it up again on Friday and Saturday\".\nBeaverbrook resigned on 30 April 1941 and, after a month as Minister of State, Churchill appointed him to the post of Minister of Supply. Here Beaverbrook clashed with Ernest Bevin who, as Minister of Labour and National Service, refused to let Beaverbrook take over any of his responsibilities. On 10 May 1941, Rudolf Hess made his flight to Scotland to contact the Duke of Hamilton about opening talks for an Anglo-German peace. Instead, he was taken into custody by local police constables. Beaverbrook was sent to interview Hess with orders to find out just what had motivated the deputy F\u00fchrer to fly to Scotland. Hess spoke fluent English and it was in that language that the interview was conducted. Beaverbrook reported to Churchill that Hess was an exceedingly eccentric and strange man who believed that the war between Germany and Britain was a grave mistake. Beaverbrook further stated that the best he could discern for Hess's motives was that he had told him that Germany was going to be invading the Soviet Union in the very near-future and now was the ideal time for the two \"Nordic\" nations to stop their pointless \"fratricidal\" war and join forces against the Soviet Union, whom Hess insisted was the common enemy of both nations.\nEarly on the morning of 22 June 1941, Hess's predications about the coming invasion of the Soviet Union came true when Operation Barbarossa, the largest invasion in history, was launched with 3 million German soldiers organised into three army groups invaded the Soviet Union. In September 1941, Beaverbrook headed the British delegation to Moscow with his American counterpart Averell Harriman (Moscow Conference (1941)). This made Beaverbrook the first senior British politician to meet Soviet leader Joseph Stalin since Adolf Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. Harriman said of Beaverbrook's role in the mission: 'has been a great salesman...His genius never worked more effectively.' Beaverbrook met Stalin at the Kremlin and developed a liking for the Soviet leader, finding him to be a man like himself who regarded committees as time-wasting and preferred action over meetings.\nBeaverbrook was one of the few close associates to Churchill to be present at his meetings with President Roosevelt on board HMS Prince of Wales and USS Augusta in the North Atlantic off the coast of Newfoundland over the period from 9 to 12 August 1941. Much impressed by Stalin and the sacrifice of the Soviet people, he returned to London determined to persuade Churchill to launch a second front in Europe to help draw German resources away from the Eastern Front to aid the Soviets. In a memo to Churchill on 19 October 1941, Beaverbrook wrote the involvement of the Soviet Union in the war offered a chance to win decisively far sooner than expected. In February 1942, Beaverbrook became Minister of War Production and again clashed with Bevin, this time over shipbuilding. In the face of Bevin's refusal to work with him, Beaverbrook resigned after only twelve days in the post. In September 1943, he was appointed Lord Privy Seal, outside of the Cabinet, and held that post until the end of the war. After leaving the War Cabinet, Beaverbrook made himself the main spokesman for the \"Second Front Now\" campaign, calling for an Anglo-American invasion of France. This put him at odds with Churchill, who favoured the \"peripheral strategy\" of winning the war via strategical bombing of Germany, maintaining command of the sea, and the \"Mediterranean strategy\" of engaging the Wehrmacht in North Africa and Italy. Despite their disagreement over the second front, Beaverbrook remained a close confidant of Churchill throughout the war, and could regularly be found with Churchill until the early hours of the morning. Clement Attlee commented that \"Churchill often listened to Beaverbrook's advice but was too sensible to take it.\"\nIn addition to his ministerial roles, Beaverbrook headed the Anglo-American Combined Raw Materials Board from 1942 to 1945 and accompanied Churchill to several wartime meetings with President Roosevelt. He was able to relate to Roosevelt in a different way than Churchill and became close to Roosevelt during these visits. This friendship sometimes irritated Churchill who felt that Beaverbrook was distracting Roosevelt from concentrating on the war effort. For his part, Roosevelt seems to have enjoyed the distraction.\nLater life.\nBeaverbrook devoted himself to Churchill's 1945 general election campaign, but a \"Daily Express\" headline warning that a Labour victory would amount to the 'Gestapo in Britain' (adapted from a passage in a radio election speech by Churchill on 4 June) was a huge mistake and completely misjudged the public mood. Beaverbrook renounced his British citizenship and left the Conservative Party in 1951, but remained an Empire loyalist throughout his life. In 1947, Beaverbrook was vehemently opposed to the plans to end the Raj, with the colony of India to be granted independence and partitioned into the new nations of India and Pakistan. Through the decision to end the Raj was taken by the Labour prime minister, Clement Attlee, Beaverbrook directed his ire against the last Viceroy, Admiral Louis Mountbatten, who Beaverbrook believed could have somehow defied the government and not granted independence if he had wanted to. In a leader, the \"Daily Express\" wrote that \"in all the world we have few more dangerous enemies\" than Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru. Beaverbrook never forgave Mountbatten and for the rest of his life used the \"Daily Express\" to blacken his reputation and always presented Mountbatten in the worst possible light.\nBeaverbrook took a typically idiosyncratic line with regard to the Cold War, holding out hopes in the editorial line of the \"Daily Express\" until 1948 that the wartime \"Big Three\" alliance of the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom should continue after the war. It was only after the Berlin blockade began in 1948 that Beaverbrook had the \"Daily Express\" take an anti-Soviet line, but even then he continued to hold out hopes that the Cold War would not be permanent and it might be possible to revive the \"Big Three\" alliance. Beaverbrook had Wilfred Burchett, an Australian journalist of extreme left-wing views based in East Berlin to run a column in \"The Daily Express\" entitled \"The Russian Window\" starting in October 1948. The nature of Burchett's \"Russian Window\" reports about life behind the Iron Curtain such as his claims that there was a surplus of luxury goods on sale in shops in Moscow led to accusations that he was engaged in propaganda for the Soviet Union, a nation that Burchett clearly admired. When Beaverbrook asked the editor of the \"Daily Express\", Arthur Christiansen about Burchett after reading several of his \"Russian Window\" columns, he was told: \"He is, I think, a fellow traveler, but nevertheless an able chap\". Even after the \"Russian Window\" column was terminated, Burchett continued to work as a free-lancer for \"The Daily Express\" based in Budapest, where he denied in one article that Cardinal J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty had confessed at his show trial under the influence of \"truth drugs\". In 1950, Christiansen turned down a chance to publish photographs of South Korean policemen engaged in a mass execution of suspected Communists because to do so would have \"given our enemies a chance to say we are playing the Communist game and did the \"Daily Worker\" propaganda for them\". The photographs were later published in \"The Daily Worker\" which presented the executions as typical of justice in South Korea, and led to Beaverbrook to complain that it was a shame that \"The Daily Express\" did not have those \"real fine pictures\".\nBeaverbrook used his newspapers to campaign against Mountbatten being appointed First Sea Lord on the grounds that he \"gave away\" India in 1947. When Mountbatten was appointed First Sea Lord, the Beaverbrook newspapers went out of their way to portray the Royal Navy under Mountbatten's leadership in a negative light. As part of his campaign against Mountbatten, Beaverbrook used his newspapers to make allegations to the effect that Mountbatten had deliberately launched the Dieppe raid of 19 August 1942 - in which the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division had taken heavy losses \u2013 in the full knowledge that it would fail to prevent a second front from being opened in 1942. Beaverbrook angrily told Mountbatten at a dinner party hosted by Harriman in London: \"You murdered my Canadians to wreck my Second Front campaign!\" Tom Driberg, the Labour MP who also worked as the gossip columnist for the \"Daily Express\" detailed these allegations in a manuscript of a biography of Beaverbrook he wrote in the mid-1950s, but the threats of a libel suit from Mountbatten led the allegations being removed from the published book. The British historian Adrien Smith argued that the real reason for Beaverbrook's feud with Mountbatten was that one of his various mistresses, Jean Norton, had shared her affections with Mountbatten. Beaverbrook was frequently unfaithful towards his wife, but he was possessive of his mistresses.\nIn 1956, Beaverbrook used the \"Daily Express\" to clamour for war against Egypt after President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the partly British-owned \"Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez\", an act that Beaverbrook considered to be intolerable. When the invasion of Egypt began in October 1956, Beaverbrook had the \"Daily Express\" support the war as a justified assertion of British national interests. Beaverbrook regarded the end of the Suez crisis, with Britain being forced to withdraw under strong American-Soviet pressure to be a national humiliation, and much of the anti-Americanism he was to express in his last years related to bitterness over the Suez crisis. Beaverbrook likewise favoured a hawkish line on the Cyprus Emergency as he used his newspapers to support keeping Cyprus a British colony and regarded the decision to grant Cyprus independence in 1960 again as a national humiliation.\nAitken continued to live lavishly. Ascherson noted: \"His life became a progress like a medieval king's, cruising on Atlantic liners and luxurious yachts with a great retinue of servants, cronies, henchmen, useful politicians and pretty women. But the Beaver did not forget old comrades. The ageing Churchill was free to stay and paint in the sun at La Capponcina whenever he pleased, and their friendship grew closer until Beaverbrook's death in 1964. He used his money and connections quietly to rescue many other lesser figures in trouble. A.J.P. Taylor justly called him \"a foul-weather friend\".\nHe opposed both Britain's acceptance of post-war loans from America and Britain's application to join the European Economic Community in 1961. In 1953 he became chancellor-for-life of the University of New Brunswick through an Act of the local legislature. In 1960, the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan decided to have the United Kingdom join the European Economic Community (EEC) as the European Union was then called, but he waited until July 1961 to formally make the application at least in part out of the fear over the reaction of the Beaverbrook newspapers. Beaverbrook was strongly opposed to the application and used his newspapers to offer ferocious criticism of Macmillan's application to join the EEC, accusing him of a betrayal of the Commonwealth, whom Beaverbrook continued to insist were Britain's natural allies. In 1960, the \"Daily Express\" was selling 4,300,000 copies per day, making it Britain's most popular newspaper.\nHe became the university's greatest benefactor, fulfilling the same role for the city of Fredericton and the province as a whole. He would provide additional buildings for the university, scholarship funds, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Beaverbrook Skating Rink, the Lord Beaverbrook Hotel, with profits donated to charity, the Playhouse, Louise Manny's early folklore work, and numerous other projects. He bought the archive papers of both Bonar Law and David Lloyd George and placed them in the Beaverbrook Library within the Daily Express Building. Beaverbrook was always proud of his New Brunswick roots, and liked to claim in his last years that four of the most outstanding men of his generation were from New Brunswick, by which he meant Bonar Law, R.B. Bennett, Sir James Hamet Dunn and himself.\nPersonal life.\nOn 29 January 1906, in Halifax, Aitken married Gladys Henderson Drury, daughter of Major-General Charles William Drury CB (a first cousin of Admiral Sir Charles Carter Drury) and Mary Louise Drury (n\u00e9e Henderson). They had three children before her death on 1 December 1927. \nTheir son Max Aitken Jr. became a fighter pilot with 601 Squadron, rising to Wing Commander. He logged 16 victories in World War II and was awarded both a DSO and DFC.\nTheir daughter Janet Gladys Aitken was married to Ian Campbell, who later became the 11th Duke of Argyll. Together they had one daughter, Lady Jeanne Campbell.\nBeaverbrook remained a widower for many years until 1963 when he married Marcia Anastasia Christoforides (1910\u20131994), the widow of his friend Sir James Dunn. \nBeaverbrook was rarely a faithful husband, and even in old age was often accused of treating women with disrespect. In Britain, he established the then-married Jean Norton as his mistress at Cherkley. Aitken left Norton for a Jewish ballet dancer named Lily Ernst whom he had rescued from pre-war Austria.\nHistorian.\nAfter the First World War, Beaverbrook had written \"Politicians and the Press\" in 1925, and \"Politicians and the War\" in two volumes, the first in 1928 and the second in 1932, republished in one volume in 1960. Upon their original publication, the books were largely ignored by professional historians and the only favourable reviews were in Beaverbrook's own newspapers. However, when the combined edition of \"Politicians and the War\" came out, the reviews were more positive. A. J. P. Taylor said it was \"Tacitus and Aubrey rolled into one\".\nLater, Taylor said: \"The enduring merits of the book are really beyond cavil. It provides essential testimony for events during a great political crisis...It contains character sketches worthy of Aubrey. On a wider canvas, it displays the behaviour of political leaders in wartime. The narrative is carried along by rare zest and wit, yet with the detached impartiality of the true scholar\". Sir John Elliot in 1981 said the work \"will remain, despite all carping, the authoritative narrative; nor does the story want in the telling thereof\".\n\"Men and Power 1917\u20131918\" was published in 1956. It is not a coherent narrative, but is divided by separate episodes centred on one man, such as Carson, Robertson, Rothermere and others. The reviews were favourable, with Taylor's review in \"The Observer\" greatly pleasing Beaverbrook. The book sold over 23,000 copies.\nWhen \"The Decline and Fall of Lloyd George\" was published in 1963, favourable reviewers included Clement Attlee, Roy Jenkins, Robert Blake, Lord Longford, Sir C. P. Snow, Lady Violet Bonham Carter, Richard Crossman and Denis Brogan. Kenneth Young said the book was \"the finest of all his writing\".\nBeaverbrook was both admired and despised in Britain, sometimes at the same time: in his 1956 autobiography, David Low quotes H.G. Wells as saying of Beaverbrook: \"If ever Max ever gets to Heaven, he won't last long. He will be chucked out for trying to pull off a merger between Heaven and Hell after having secured a controlling interest in key subsidiary companies in both places, of course.\"\nBeaverbrook was of an imperialist mindset, with the quote, \"There are countries so underdeveloped today that the gift of independence is like the gift of a razor to a child\", attributed to him in a panel discussion on Canadian TV.\nDeath.\nLord Beaverbrook died in Leatherhead in 1964, aged 85. He had recently attended a birthday banquet organized by fellow Canadian press baron, Lord Thomson of Fleet, where he was determined to be seen on his usual good form, despite suffering from cancer.\nA bust of him by Oscar Nemon stands in the park in the town square of Newcastle, New Brunswick, not far from where he sold newspapers as a young boy. His ashes are in the plinth of the bust.\nThe Beaverbrook Foundation continues his philanthropic interests. In 1957, a bronze statue of Lord Beaverbrook was erected at the centre of Officers' Square in Fredericton, New Brunswick, paid for by money raised by children throughout the province.\nLegacy.\nBeaverbrook and his wife, Lady Beaverbrook, left a considerable legacy to both New Brunswick and the United Kingdom. In 2014, he was named a National Historic Person on the advice of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. He is particularly cherished at the University of New Brunswick, to which he devoted most of his later largesse and at which he situated his extensive archival collection of British public life in the first half of the 20th century. Among other gifts over three years from 1946 he tripled the size of the library at UNB, and bestowed the Old Manse Library in Newcastle Miramichi. He endowed the Lord Beaverbrook Overseas Scholarships to send UNB undergraduates for a spell at the University of London. His legacy, and memorials, includes the following buildings:\nIn popular culture.\nFor a period of time, Beaverbrook employed novelist Evelyn Waugh in London and abroad. Waugh later lampooned his employer by portraying him as Lord Copper in \"Scoop\" and as Lord Monomark in both \"Put Out More Flags\" and \"Vile Bodies\".\nThe Kinks recorded \"Mr Churchill Says\" for their 1969 album \"Arthur\", which contains the lines: \"Mr Beaverbrook says: 'We've gotta save our tin/And all the garden gates and empty cans are gonna make us win...'.\"\nBeaverbrook was one of eight notable Britons cited in Bj\u00f8rge Lillelien's famous \"Your boys took a hell of a beating\" commentary at the end of an English football team defeat to Norway in 1981, mentioned alongside British Prime Ministers Churchill, Thatcher and Attlee.\nIn C. J. Sansom's alternate history novel \"Dominion\", Lord Beaverbrook is the incumbent Prime Minister in 1952, heading a Nazi collaborationist puppet government as a result of the United Kingdom entering into an armistice in 1940.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, the practice has been around for nearly as long as humans have been constructing their own shelters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDesign and construction.\nDesign.\nEarth sheltered homes are often constructed with energy conservation and savings in mind. Specific designs of earth shelters allow for maximum savings. For bermed or in-hill construction, a common plan is to place all the living spaces on the side of the house facing the equator (or north or east, depending on latitude). This provides maximum solar radiation to bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchen spaces. Rooms that do not require natural daylight and extensive heating such as the bathroom, storage, and utility room are typically located on the opposite (or in-hill) side of the shelter. This type of layout can also be transposed to a double level house design with both levels completely underground. This plan has the highest energy efficiency of earth sheltered homes because of the compact configuration as well as the structure being submerged deeper in the earth. This gives it a greater ratio of earth cover to an exposed wall than a one-story shelter would.\nThe soil type is one of the essential factors during site planning. The soil needs to provide adequate bearing capacity and drainage, and help to retain heat. With respects to drainage, the most suitable type of soil for earth sheltering is a mixture of sand and gravel. Well graded gravels have a large bearing capacity (about 8,000 pounds per square foot), excellent drainage and a low frost heave potential. Sand and clay can be susceptible to erosion. Clay soils, while least susceptible to erosion, often do not allow for proper drainage, and have a higher potential for frost heaves. Clay soils are more susceptible to thermal shrinking and expanding. Being aware of the moisture content of the soil and the fluctuation of that content throughout the year will help prevent potential heating problems. Frost heaves can also be problematic in some soil. Fine grain soils retain moisture the best and are most susceptible to heaving. A few ways to protect against capillary action responsible for frost heaves are placing foundations below the freezing zone or insulating ground surface around shallow footings, replacement of frost-sensitive soils with granular material, and interrupting capillary draw of moisture by putting a drainage layer of coarser material in the existing soil.\nWater can damage earthen shelters if it ponds around them. Avoiding sites with a high water table is crucial. Drainage, both surface and subsurface, must be properly dealt with. Waterproofing applied to the building is essential.\nAtrium designs have an increased risk of flooding, so the surrounding land should slope away from the structure on all sides. A drain pipe at the perimeter of the roof edge can help collect and remove additional water. For bermed homes, an interceptor drain at the crest of the berm along the rooftop's edge is recommended. An interceptor drainage swale in the middle of the berm is also helpful or the back of the berm can be terraced with retaining walls. On sloping sites, runoff may cause problems. A drainage swale or gully can be built to divert water around the house, or a gravel-filled trench with a drain tile can be installed along with footing drains.\nSoil stability should also be considered, especially when evaluating a sloping site. These slopes may be inherently stable when left alone, but cutting into them can greatly compromise their structural stability. Retaining walls and backfills may have to be constructed to hold up the slope prior to shelter construction.\nOn land that is relatively flat, a fully recessed house with an open courtyard is the most appropriate design. On a sloping site, the house is set right into the hill. The slope will determine the location of the window wall; the most practical orientation in moderate to cold climates is a south-facing exposed wall in the Northern hemisphere (and north-facing in the Southern hemisphere) due to solar benefits. The most practical orientation in the Tropics nearest the equator is north-facing toward the aphelion (or perhaps northeast) to moderate the temperature extremes. Just \"outside\" the Tropics, the most practical way to avoid afternoon heat excess may be an east-facing house or, if near a west coast, exposure of the east end and the west end, with the two \"long\" sides embedded in the earth.\nDepending on the region and site selected for earth-sheltered construction, the benefits and objectives of the earth shelter construction vary. For cool and temperate climates, objectives consist of retaining winter heat, avoiding infiltration, receiving winter sun, using thermal mass, shading and ventilating during the summer, and avoiding winter winds and cold pockets. For hot, arid climates objectives include maximizing humidity, providing summer shade, maximizing summer air movement, and retaining winter heat. For hot, humid climates objectives include avoiding summer humidity, providing summer ventilation, and retaining winter heat.\nRegions with extreme daily and seasonal temperatures emphasize the value of earth as a thermal mass. Earth sheltering is most effective in regions with high cooling and heating needs and high-temperature differentials. In regions such as the southeastern United States, earth sheltering may need additional care in maintenance and construction due to condensation problems in regard to the high humidity. The ground temperature of the region may be too high to permit earth cooling if temperatures fluctuate only slightly from day to night. Preferably, there should be adequate winter solar radiation and sufficient means for natural ventilation. Wind is a critical aspect to evaluate during site planning, for reasons regarding wind chill and heat loss, as well as shelter ventilation. In the Northern Hemisphere, south facing slopes tend to avoid cold winter winds typically blown in from the north. Fully recessed shelters also offer adequate protection against these harsh winds. However, atria within the structure can cause minor turbulence depending on the size. It is helpful to take advantage of the prevailing winds in the summer. Because of the limited window arrangement in most earth shelters, and the resistance to air infiltration, the air within a structure can become stagnant if proper ventilation is not provided. By making use of the wind, natural ventilation can occur without the use of fans or other active systems. Knowing the direction, and intensity, of seasonal winds, is vital in promoting cross ventilation. Vents are commonly placed in the roof of bermed or fully recessed shelters to achieve this effect.\nBuilding materials.\nThe selection of construction materials should consider the type of structure, site characteristics, climate, soil type, and design. Stronger, longer-lasting building materials are required for structures that are buried deeply. Waterproof and insulated materials should also be utilized to withstand the pressure and moisture of the surrounding ground. For instance, concrete and reinforced masonry, wood, and steel are all viable materials. Concrete is the most common choice for earth-sheltered buildings due to its strength, durability, and fire resistance. Cast-in-place concrete is employed for non-critical structural elements such as concrete foundations, floor slabs, and exterior walls with less than of earth cover. In contrast, precast reinforced concrete can be used for floors, walls, and roofs. Concrete masonry units should be or greater, with the use of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cH\u201d facilitating unit placement around vertical reinforcing bars, depending on the required structural integrity. It is typically advised to use Type S mortar, grout with a minimum strength of , and a concrete slab with a minimum strength of and thickness. Brick or stone masonry reinforced with steel bars can be utilized for walls that will be subjected to lateral or vertical pressure from earth cover. Masonry generally costs less than cast-in-place concrete. Wood can be widely employed in earth-sheltered buildings for structural and internal work, including floors, roofs, and exterior walls. However, wooden frame walls, which must endure lateral pressure, are limited to a burial depth of one story when used as a structural material. Beyond this depth, the cost will rapidly increase while using wood as a structural material. Although wood can be less expensive than other materials, it lacks steel's strength, therefore it might not be the ideal option for structural material in some earth-sheltered dwellings, especially in moist soil type. Steel is used for beams, columns, bar joists, and masonry reinforcement. The advantage is that steel has high tensional and compressional strength, while the disadvantage is that it must be protected from corrosion if it is exposed to air, water, or other chemicals. It must be used effectively because it is also expensive.\nExcavation.\nIn earth-sheltered construction, there is often extensive excavation done on the building site. An excavation several feet larger than the walls' planned perimeter is made to allow for access to the outside of the wall for waterproofing and insulation.\nFoundations.\nOnce the site is prepared and the utility lines installed, a foundation of reinforced concrete is poured. The walls are then installed. Usually, they are either poured in place or formed either on or off-site and then moved into place. Reinforced concrete is the most common choice. The process is repeated for the roof structure. If the walls, floor, and roof are all to be poured in place, it is possible to make them with a single pour. This can reduce the likelihood of there being cracks or leaks at the joints where the concrete has cured at different times. The foundation of the buildings designed by Vetsch are built conventionally.\nWalls.\nSeveral different methods of external (load-bearing) wall construction in earth shelters have been used successfully. These include concrete block (either conventionally mortared or surface-bonded), stone masonry, cordwood masonry, poured concrete, and pressure-treated wood. Earthships classically use rammed earth tire walls, which are labor-intensive but recycle used tires.\nOehler prescribed a very low budget method he termed \"post, shoring and polyethylene\". This involves buried wooden posts to act as a frame, shored up with planks, and with a waterproofing barrier of polyethylene sheet between the planks and the backfill, but no foundation and nothing on the floor except a plastic sheet and carpeting.\nUntreated wood in direct contact with earth rots within five years of use in earth shelter construction, but can be used for structural support construction in a well-insulated and water/moisture-proofed home. Reinforced concrete is the most commonly used structural material in earth shelter construction. It is strong and readily available. Steel can be used but needs to be encased by concrete to keep it from direct contact with the soil which corrodes the metal. Bricks and concrete masonry units are also possible options in earth shelter construction but must be reinforced to keep them from shifting under vertical pressure unless the building is constructed with arches and vaults.\nUnfortunately, reinforced concrete is not the most environmentally sustainable material. The concrete industry is working to develop products that are more environmentally friendly in response to consumer demands. Products like Grancrete and Hycrete are becoming more readily available. They claim to be environmentally friendly and either reduce or eliminate the need for additional waterproofing. However, these have not been extensively used in earth shelter construction yet.\nRoof.\nThe roof of an earth shelter may not be covered by earth (earth berm only), or the roof may support a green roof with only a minimal thickness of earth. Alternatively a larger mass of earth might cover the roof. Such roofs must deal with significantly greater dead load and live load (e.g. increased weight of water in the earth after rain, or snow). This requires stronger and more substantial roof support structure. Some advise to have just enough thickness of earth on the roof to maintain a green roof (approximately 6 inches / 15\u00a0cm), since this means less load on the structure. Increasing the amount of earth on the roof past this gives only modest increases in the benefits while increasing costs significantly.\nDespite being underground, drainage of water is still important. Therefore, earth shelters do not tend to have flat roofs. A flat roof is also less resistant to the weight of the earth. It is common for earth shelter designs to have arches and shallow domed roofs since this form resists vertical load well. One method uses finely meshed metal bent into the intended shape and welded to the supporting armature. Onto this mesh concrete is sprayed forming a roof. Terra-Dome (USA) is a company specializing in construction of earth-sheltered houses and sells a modular system of concrete domes intended to be covered by earth. Others advise the use of timber framed, gable roofs of pitch at least 1:12 to promote drainage. The roofs of Earthships tend to be mono-pitched, classically using vigas.\nWaterproofing.\nOn the outside of the concrete, a waterproofing system is applied. The most frequently used waterproofing system includes a layer of liquid asphalt onto which a heavy grade waterproof membrane is affixed, followed by a final liquid water sealant which may be sprayed on. It is very important to make sure that all of the seams are carefully sealed. It is very difficult to locate and repair leaks in the waterproofing system after the building is completed. Several layers are used for waterproofing in earth shelter construction. The first layer is meant to seal any cracks or pores in the structural materials, also working as an adhesive for the waterproof membrane. The membrane layer is often a thick flexible polyethylene sheeting called EPDM rubber. EPDM is the material usually used in a water garden, pond and swimming pool construction. This material also prevents roots from burrowing through the waterproofing. EPDM is very heavy to work with and can be chewed through by some common insects like fire ants. It is also made from petrochemicals, making it environmentally unsustainable.\nThere are various cement-like coatings that can be used as waterproofing. The product is sprayed directly onto the unprotected surface. It dries and acts like a huge ceramic layer between the wall and earth. The problem with this method is, if the wall or foundation shifts in any way, it cracks and water is able to penetrate through it easily.\nBituthene (registered name) is very similar to the three coat layering process only in one step. It comes already layered in sheets and has a self-adhesive backing. Applying it manually is the same as with the layering method, in addition, it is sun sensitive and must be covered very soon after application.\nEco-Flex is an environmentally friendly waterproofing membrane that seems to work very well on foundations, but not much is known about its effectiveness in earth sheltering. It is among a group of liquid paint-on waterproofing products. The main challenge with these products are they must be carefully applied, making sure that every area is covered to the right thickness, and that every crack or gap is tightly sealed.\nBentonite clay is an alternative that the most environmentally friendly. It is naturally occurring and self-healing. The drawback to this material is that it is very heavy, difficult for the owner/builder to install, and subject to termite damage.\nBi-membranes have been used extensively throughout Australia where 2 membranes are paired together\u2014typically 2 coats of water-based epoxy as a 'sealer' and stop the internal vapor pressure of the moist concrete exploding bubbles of vapor up underneath the membrane when exposed to hot sun. The bond strength of epoxy to concrete is stronger than the internal bond strength of concrete so the membranes won't 'blow' off the wall in the sun. Epoxies are very brittle so they are paired up with an overcoat of a high-build flexible water-based acrylic membrane in multiple coats of different colors to ensure film coverage\u2014this is reinforced with non-woven polypropylene textile in corners and changes in direction.\nInsulation.\nOne or more insulation board or foam layers are added outside the waterproofing. If the insulation chosen is porous, a top layer of waterproofing is added. Unlike the conventional building, earth shelters require the insulation on the exterior of the building rather than inside the wall. One reason for this is that it protects the waterproof membrane against freeze damage, another is that the earth shelter is able to better retain its desired temperature. There are two types of insulation used in earth shelter construction. The first is close-celled extruded polystyrene sheets. Two to three inches glued to the outside of the waterproofing is generally sufficient. The second type of insulation is a spray on foam (e.g. polyurethane solid foam insulation). This works very well where the structure's shape is unconventional, rounded or difficult to get to. Foam insulation requires an additional protective top coat such as foil or fleece filter to help it resist water penetration.\nIn some low budget earth shelters, insulation may not be applied to the walls. These methods rely on the earth's U factor or thermal heat storage capacity below the frost layer. These designs are the exception however and risk frost heave damage in colder climates. The theory behind no insulation designs relies on using the earth's thermal mass to store heat, rather than relying on a heavy masonry or cement inner structures that exist in a typical passive solar house. This is the exception to the rule and cold temperatures may extend down into the earth above the frost line making insulation necessary for higher efficiencies.\nBackfilling.\nAfter previous construction stages are complete, the earth is backfilled against the external walls to create the berm. Depending on the drainage characteristics of the earth may not be suitable to place in direct contact with the external wall. Some advise that topsoil and turf (sod) be put aside from the initial excavation and be used for the grass roof and to place as the topmost layer on the berm.\nFinishings.\nIn the earth houses designed by Vetsch, interior walls are furnished using loam rendering, providing superior humidity compensation. The loam rendering is finally coated with lime-white cement paint.\nTypes.\nThree main types of earth shelter are described. There is also great variation in the approach to earth sheltering in terms of materials used and expenditure. The \"low tech\" approach might involve natural building techniques, wooden posts and shed style roofs, recycling of materials, owner labor, hand excavation, etc. The relatively more high tech approach would be larger, using concrete and steel. While typically more energy efficient post construction, the high tech approach has higher embodied energy and significantly more costs.\nBermed.\nIn the earth bermed (also termed \"bunded\") type, earth is banked against the exterior walls, sloping down away from the building. The berm can be partial or total. The polar facing wall may be bermed, leaving the equator-facing wall un-bermed (in temperate regions). Usually this type of earth shelter is built on, or only slightly below the original grade. Due to the building being above the original ground level, fewer moisture problems are associated with earth berming in comparison to underground/fully-recessed construction, and it costs less to construct. According to one report, earth berming provided 90-95% of the energy advantage as a completely below grade structure.\nIn-hill.\nThe in-hill (also termed \"earth covered\", or \"elevational\") construction is where the earth shelter is set into a slope or hillside, and earth covers the roof in addition to the walls. The most practical application is using a hill facing towards the equator (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere), towards the aphelion (north) in the Tropics, or east just outside the Tropics. There is only one exposed wall in this type of earth sheltering, the wall facing out of the hill, all other walls are embedded within the earth/hill. This is the most popular and energy efficient form of earth shelter in cold and temperate climates.\nUnderground.\nThe true underground (also termed \"chambered\" or \"subterranean\") earth shelter describes a house where the ground is excavated, and the house is set in below grade. They can feature an atrium or courtyard constructed in the middle of the shelter to provide adequate light and ventilation. The atrium is not always fully enclosed by raised ground, sometimes a U-shaped atrium is used, which is open on one side.\nWith an atrium earth shelter, the living spaces tend to be located around the atrium. The atrium arrangement provides a much less compact plan than that of the one or two-story bermed/in hill design; therefore it is commonly less energy efficient, in terms of heating needs. Therefore, atrium designs are found mainly in warmer climates. However, the atrium does tend to trap air within it which is then heated by the sun and helps reduce heat loss. Atrium designs are well suited to flat sites, and are fairly common.\nOther types.\nDepending on what definition of earth sheltering is used, other types are sometimes included. In culvert homes (\"Cut and Cover\"), precast concrete containers and large diameter pipes are arranged into a connecting design to form a living space and then backfilled with earth. An experimental construction design from the 1980s of Japan, coined 'Alice City', proposed to use a wide and deep cylindrical shaft sunk into the earth, with a domed skylight roof. Artificial caves can be constructed by making a tunnel into the earth. Building greenhouses underground has also been speculated about. Schools, commercial centres, government buildings and other buildings could be built underground.\nApplications.\nActive and passive solar.\nEarth sheltering is often combined with solar heating systems. Most commonly, the utilization of passive solar design techniques is used in earth shelters. In most of the Northern Hemisphere, a south-facing structure with the north, east, and west sides covered with earth is the most effective application for passive solar systems. A large double glazed window, triple glazed, spanning most of the length of the south wall is critical for solar heat gain. It is helpful to accompany the window with insulated drapes to protect against heat loss at night. Also, during the summer months, providing an overhang, or some sort of shading device, is used to block out an excess solar gain.\nPassive annual heat storage.\nPassive annual heat storage is a building concept theorized to create a year-round constant temperature in an earth shelter by means of direct gain passive solar heating and a thermal battery effect lasting several months. It is claimed that an earth shelter designed according to these principles would store the sun's heat in the summer and release it slowly over the winter months without need for other forms of heating. This method was first described by inventor and physicist John Hait in his 1983 book. The main component of it is an insulated and waterproof \"umbrella\" which extends out from the earth shelter for several meters in all directions. Hence the term \"umbrella house\". The earth under this umbrella is kept warm and dry relative to surrounding earth, which is subject to constant daily and seasonal temperature changes. This creates a large heat storage area of earth, effectively a huge thermal mass. Heat is gained via passive solar in the earth shelter and transferred to the surrounding earth by conduction. Thus, when the temperature in the earth shelter dips below the temperature in the surrounding earth, heat will return to the earth shelter. After a time, a stable temperature is reached which is an average of annual heat changes in the external environment. Some criticize the technique (along with the earth sheltering technique as a whole), stating concerns including difficulty and expense of construction, moisture and lack of evidence.\nAnnualized geo solar.\nAnother design aimed at passive seasonal energy storage, annualized geo solar is sometimes applied to earth shelters.\nEarth tube ventilation.\nPassive cooling which pulls air with a fan or convection from a nearly constant temperature air into buried Earth cooling tubes and then into the house living space. This also provides fresh air to occupants and the air exchange required by ASHRAE.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nEarth sheltering is one of the oldest forms of building. It is thought that from about 15,000 BC migratory hunters in Europe were using turf and earth to insulate simple round huts that were also sunk into the ground. The use of some form of earth sheltered construction is found across many cultures in history, distributed widely across the world. Normally these examples of cultures using earth sheltered buildings occur without any knowledge of the construction method elsewhere. These structures have many different forms and are referred to by many different names. General terms include pit-house and dugout.\nOne of the oldest examples of berming, dating back some 5,000 years, can be found at Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands off northern Scotland. Another historical example of in-hill earth shelters would be Mesa Verde, in southwest USA. These building are constructed directly onto the ledges and caves on the face of the cliffs. The front wall is built up with local stone and earth to enclose the structure.\nIn North America, almost every native American group used earth sheltered structures to some extent. These structures have been called 'earth lodges' (see also: Barabara). When Europeans colonized North America, sod houses (\"soddies\") were common on the Great Plains.\nIn China, man-made cave dwellings have been used as a shelter since 2,000 BC. In certain areas of northern China, like the provinces of Shaanxi and Shanxi, since the loess earth is structurally uniform and compacted, providing easy access to good quality building material with stable structure, earth-sheltered homes have been in use for centuries.\n1970s\u20131980s heyday.\nThe 1973 Oil Crisis saw the price of oil dramatically increase, which influenced vast social, economic and political changes worldwide. Combined with growing interest in alternative lifestyles and the back-to-the-land movement, the public of the US and elsewhere were becoming more interested in saving energy and protecting the environment.\nAs early as the 1960s in the US, some innovators were designing contemporary earth shelters. After the oil crisis and until the early 1980s there was a new resurgence in interest earth shelter/underground home construction, which has been termed the first wave of earth-covered dwellings. Architect Arthur Quarmby finished an earth sheltered building in Holme, England in 1975. Named \"Underhill,\" It is recorded in the Guinness World Records as the \"first underground house\" in the UK.\nThe majority of publications about earth sheltering date to this period, with dozens of books dedicated to the topic being published in the years leading up to 1983. The first International Conference on Earth-Sheltered Buildings was hosted in Sydney, Australia in 1983. A second conference was planned for 1986 in Minneapolis, USA.\nOther notable proponents of earth sheltering active in this era include Mike Oehler, Rob Roy, John Hait, Malcolm Wells, Peter Vetsch, Ken Kern and others.\nModern times.\nSince the late 1980s, earth-sheltered homes have become increasingly popular. The technique is more common in Russia, China and Japan. It is possible that Northern China has more earth shelters than any other region. As of 1987, approximately 10 million people live in underground homes in the region.\nSome claim that thousands of people live underground in Europe and America. Notable European examples are the \"Earth Houses\" of Swiss architect Peter Vetsch. There are about 50 such earth shelters in Switzerland, including a residential estate of nine earth shelters (L\u00e4ttenstrasse in Dietikon). In other parts of Europe, such as the UK, earth sheltering is more uncommon. Possibly the most well known examples of modern earth sheltering in the English-speaking world are Earthships, the brand of passive solar earth shelters sold by Earthship Biotecture. Earthships are concentrated in New Mexico, US.\nOverall earth shelter construction is often viewed by architects, engineers, and the public as an unconventional method of building. Techniques of earth sheltering have not become common knowledge, and much of society is unaware of this type of building construction. Generally speaking, the cost of excavation, increased need for damp-proofing and the requirement for the structure to withstand greater weight relative to above grade houses means that earth sheltering remains relatively rare. In this respect, the Passive House (PassivHaus) energy performance standard applied to above grade airtight, superinsulated low carbon or zero carbon buildings has had much wider uptake in modern times. Over 20,000 buildings certified to PassivHaus standards have been constructed across Northern Europe. Some postulate that over time the reducing availability of building space, and the increasing need and interest for environmentally friendly housing will make earth shelters more common.\nThere are an estimated 30-40 million Chinese living in such earth homes today still, mostly along the Yellow River in Northern China. There are mainly two kinds of earth homes in the area. The first type is pit cave dwellings. Usually, people dig a sunken courtyard, which is a rectangular underground pit about 10 meters deep, then arrange rooms dug off the main courtyard. The second type is dwelling space carved out of earth cliffs which are often south-facing, and the facades are sometimes faced with bricks or stone. They usually come with larger courtyards since it doesn't bother to excavate.\nComparison with standard housing.\nAdvantages.\nIn 1981, Oehler promoted his low-budget building design (a simple hole in the ground with walls of wooden planks backed by plastic sheeting) by claiming it needed no foundation, used less building material and labour, had less maintenance, was aesthetically pleasing, had a lower taxation rate in the US at the time, cost less to regulate temperature, was less affected by stormy weather, had pipes which wouldn't freeze where they entered the house, were \"ecologically sound\", relatively fireproof, soundproof and had an increased garden space as compared to regular house on a similarly sized plot of land.\nHe also claimed the view from a window below the ground was better than that from other windows, and that the flooring he used in his an underground home (plastic sheeting over bare dirt) was \"superior\" to what is elsewhere available.\nHe claimed he would provide a built-in greenhouse in the design.\nHe claimed his homes could be used as fallout shelters in case of nuclear wars and also claimed that, in the case of complete societal collapse, his design would be more defensible than a regular house in the case of random attacks, as well as being better concealed from potential hostiles (without a map and unfamiliar with the area). He believed that underground, inhabitants would be better protected from \"atmospheric radiation\" (fallout). Because his design was not waterproofed, one would be \"closer to a source of water\", and could potentially simply dig a well in the middle of the room.\nHe furthermore claimed anyone could build one of his designs irrespective of skill or ability for only $50.\nPassive heating and cooling.\nDue to its density, compacted earth acts as thermal mass, meaning that it stores heat and releases it again slowly. Compacted soil is more of a conductor of heat than an insulator. Soil is stated as having an R-value of about 0.65-R per centimeter (0.08-R per 1 inch), or 0.25-R per 1 inch. Variations in R-value of soil may be attributed to different soil moisture levels, with lower R values as moisture level increases. The most superficial layer of earth typically is less dense and contains the root systems of many different plants, thereby acting more like thermal insulation, meaning, it reduces the rate of temperature flowing through it.\nApproximately 50% of the heat from the Sun is absorbed at the surface. Consequently, the temperature at the surface may vary considerably according to the day / night cycle, according to weather and particularly according to season. Underground, these temperature changes are blunted and delayed, termed thermal lag. The thermal properties of earth therefore mean that in winter the temperature below the surface will be higher than the surface air temperature, and conversely in summer the earth temperature will be lower than the surface air temperature.\nIndeed, at a deep enough point underground, the temperature remains constant year round, and this temperature is approximately the mean of summer and winter temperatures. Sources vary in their stated values for this deep earth constant temperature (also termed amplitude correction factor). Reported values include , , , for dry soil, and for wet soil. Below this level the temperature increases on average every due to heat rising from the interior of the Earth.\nDiurnal temperature changes between maximum and minimum temperatures can be modelled as a wave, as can seasonal temperature changes (see diagram). In architecture, the relationship between the maximum fluctuations of external temperature compared to internal temperature is termed amplitude dampening (or temperature amplitude factor). Phase shifting is the time taken for the minimum external temperature to reach the interior.\nPartially covering a building with earth adds to the thermal mass of the structure. Combined with insulation, this results in both amplitude dampening and phase shifting. In other terms, earth sheltered structures receive both a degree of cooling in summer and heating in winter. This reduces need for other measures of heating and cooling, saving energy. A potential disadvantage of a thermally massive building in cooler climates is that after a prolonged period of cold, when the external temperature increases again, the structures internal temperature tends to lag behind and take longer to warm up (assuming no other form of heating).\nThe reduction of air infiltration within an earth shelter can be advantageous. Because three walls of the structure are mainly surrounded by earth, very little surface area is exposed to the outside air. This alleviates the problem of warm air escaping the house through gaps around windows and door. Furthermore, the earth walls protect against cold winter winds which might otherwise penetrate these gaps. However, this can also become a potential indoor air quality problem. Healthy air circulation is key.\nAs a result of the increased thermal mass of the structure, the thermal lag of the earth, the protection against unwanted air infiltration and the combined use of passive solar techniques, the need for extra heating and cooling is minimal. Therefore, there is a drastic reduction in energy consumption required for the home compared to homes of typical construction.\nWind protection.\nThe unique architecture of earth houses protects them against severe windstorms. They cannot be torn away or tipped over by strong winds. Structural engineering and, above all, the lack of corners and exposed parts (roof), eliminate vulnerable surfaces which would otherwise suffer from storm damage.\nNatural resource saving.\nCompared with the material needs of standard buildings, earth-sheltered homes can greatly reduce the number of natural resources. Traditional wood structure home requires lumber for framing and interior finishes, which is quite a big demand. Soil as the main building material and blending in with the landscape, earth-sheltered houses drastically reduce the demand for lumber.\nBiological effects.\nEarth homes organically embrace animals and poultry as well as water, soil, and plants. Arcology studies the relationship between animals and plants and man-made buildings during ecological development. For example, raising poultry and domesticated animals is an important part of the traditional Chinese rural human settlements and these elements create a stable and sustainable ecological cycle that benefits the environment.\nLandscape protection and land use.\nCompared to conventional buildings, earth houses can fit into their surroundings. The soil-covered roofs hide the building within the landscape.\nSome claim that the construction method is advantageous to the nitrogen-fixation of the soil on the roof, because it would otherwise be covered by the foundation of a traditional house. Contrary to conventional roofs, earth-house roofs allow plants to grow semi-naturally on them.\nSuch houses can also be built as terraced structures on a slope in hilly terrain.\nFire protection.\nCompared to other building materials, such as wood, earth houses feature efficient fire protection owing both to the use of concrete and the insulation provided by the roof. Taking the example of Earthships, there is a reported case where the structure survived fire better compared to other types of buildings.\nEarthquake protection.\nWhile residents of earth sheltered homes report noticing more minor earthquakes, the homes are resilient against large earthquakes, as their subterranean nature allows them to move with the earth. Picture a small twig house sitting on top of a tub of dirt: Shake the dirt, and the house will dance and stress. But if you bury the house in the dirt, you can shake the tub without stressing the house as much.\nRoof planting.\nRoof covering is done using the excavated material, in which plants can be planted.\nNuclear bomb survivability.\nDue to the mass of the earth between the living area of an earth house and the surface grade, an earth home offers significant protection from impact/blast damage, or fallout associated with a nuclear bomb.\nSoundproof.\nEarth shelters may provide privacy from neighbors, as well as soundproofing. The ground provides acoustic protection against outside noise. This can be a major benefit in urban areas or near highways.\nArchitectural aesthetics.\nEarth sheltered dwelling express itself with the color harmony of soil and earth. Meanwhile, the material properties of soil and earth give earth homes the simplicity of geomatic masses. Also, earth homes blend in perfectly with the landscape and highlight the beauty of the surroundings, which is a significant basis of the arcology concept. For example, yaodong and pit cave dwellings in Northern China hide themselves underground and blend in perfectly within the Loess plateau environment. Salt Cathedral in a halite mountain near the city of Zipaquir\u00e1, Colombia hugs the contour and highlights the natural features.\nDisadvantages.\nFinancial cost.\nThree main factors influence overall cost of home construction, namely, design complexity, materials used, and whether the owner(s) carries out some or all of the construction or pays others to do it. Custom houses with complex designs tend to be more expensive and take longer to build than stock houses. Houses which use expensive materials will be more expensive than houses which use low cost materials. Owner labor can dramatically cut construction costs.\nBoth earth sheltered projects and construction of regular houses have significant variability in the design, materials and labor involved. As such it is difficult to make a precise comparison of cost between the two, however in general an earth shelter is much more expensive.\nA small \"underground home\" built in the style of Oehler, as only a simple, non-waterproofed hole in ground with simple planks and a plastic sheet to a wall, despite using free labour (ignoring the opportunity costs of not having time to go to work) and recycled materials, e.g. windows and planks for the wall, is estimated to be 30% cheaper to construct when compared to paying a contractor to build a regular house using new construction materials at standard prices, although Oehler's design will quickly rot and collapse after a few years.\nA particular factor that strongly influences the cost of an earth shelter is the amount of earth that covers it. The more earth covering the structure, the greater the expense is needed in having a structure capable of withstanding the load (see also: Roof). Another important cost factor that tends to be unique to earth shelters is site excavation and backfilling. The amount of waterproofing is also more costly. On the other hand, earth shelters should have lower maintenance costs since they are mostly covered with little exposed exterior.\nMany financial institutions outright exclude financing on earth-sheltered homes, or require this type of property to be common for the area.\nDesign complexity.\nOverall it is more technically challenging to design an earth shelter compared to a regular home. Because of the unorthodox design and construction of earth-sheltered homes, local building codes and ordinances may need to be researched and/or navigated. Many construction companies have limited or no experience with earth-sheltered construction, potentially compromising the physical construction of even the best designs. The specific architecture of earth houses usually leads to non-righted, round-shaped walls, which can cause problems concerning the interior decoration, especially regarding furniture and large paintings.\nRepairs to the walls are very difficult to service; and may require re-evaluating and rebuilding the house from scratch.\nAn earth shelter cannot be enlarged with an extra room - this will require breaking the waterproofing sealant cladding the concrete walls of the building.\nSustainability.\nIn \"green building\", four \"lifetime\" phases of a building are described, namely material sources, construction, in use, and deconstruction (life-cycle assessment). Terms carbon zero and negative carbon buildings refer to the net greenhouse gas emissions over these four phases. Questions therefore arise as to whether certain structures are truly environmentally friendly. For example, raw materials must be extracted from the earth, transported and then manufactured into building materials and transported again to be sold and finally transported to the build site. A lot of fossil fuels may be used during each of these stages.\nEarth sheltering often requires heavier construction materials to resist the weight of the earth against the walls and/or roof. Reinforced concrete in particular needs to be used in much larger quantities per building. The manufacture of concrete is a major source of greenhouse gases.\nThe materials involved tend to be non-biodegradable substances. Because the materials must keep water out, they are often made of plastics. The excavation of a site is also drastically time- and labor-consuming. Overall, the construction is comparable to conventional construction, because the building requires minimal finishing and significantly less maintenance.\nMoisture and indoor air quality.\nProblems of water seepage, internal condensation, bad acoustics, and poor indoor air quality can occur if an earth shelter has not been properly designed and ventilated. Very high humidity levels can allow mold or mildew growth, associated with a musty smell and potentially with health problems. The below-ground orientation of many earth-sheltered homes can allow accumulation of radon gas (which is known to increase the risk of lung cancer) or other undesirable materials (e.g. off gassing from construction materials).\nThe threat of water seepage occurs around areas where the waterproofing layers have been penetrated. Earth usually settles gradually. Vents and ducts emerging from the roof can cause specific problems due to the possibility of movement. Precast concrete slabs can have a deflection of 1/2\u00a0inch or more when the earth/soil is layered on top of them. If the vents or ducts are held rigidly in place during this deflection, the result is usually the failure of the waterproofing layer. To avoid this difficulty, vents can be placed on other sides of the building (besides the roof), or separate segments of pipes can be installed. A narrower pipe in the roof that fits snugly into a larger segment of the building can also be used. The threat of water seepage, condensation, and poor indoor air quality can all be overcome with proper waterproofing and ventilation.\nLimited natural light.\nDespite large windows (usually facing south in the Northern Hemisphere), many earth-sheltered homes have dark areas in the areas opposite the windows. All natural light coming from one side of the home can give a \"tunnel or cave effect\".\nRisk of collapse.\nReports of collapse seem to be rare. In one case, an author and proponent of earth sheltering died when an earth roof he designed collapsed on him.\nLimited escape routes.\nCompared to above ground house, earth-shelters may have limited escape routes in case of emergency, which can fail egress and fenestration building codes.\nLegal issues.\nAn earth shelter may not be able to be adapted to existing local building codes, and may not legally be lived in.\nSee also.\nTopics:\nTypes:\nApplications:\nProponents:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}
{"id": "72233", "revid": "8087765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72233", "title": "Krasnoyarsk", "text": "City in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia\nKrasnoyarsk is the largest city and administrative center of Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. It is situated along the Yenisey River, and is the second-largest city in Siberia after Novosibirsk, with a population of over 1.1 million. Krasnoyarsk is an important junction of the renowned Trans-Siberian Railway, and is one of the largest producers of aluminum in the country. The city is known for its natural landscape; author Anton Chekhov judged Krasnoyarsk to be the most beautiful city in Siberia. The Stolby Nature Sanctuary is located 10\u00a0km south of the city. Krasnoyarsk is a major educational centre in Siberia, and hosts the Siberian Federal University. In 2019, Krasnoyarsk was the host city of the 2019 Winter Universiade, the third hosted in Russia.\nEtymology.\nThe predecessor fort was named Krasny Yar () after the Yarin (a dialect of Khakas) name of the place where it was built, \"Kyzyl Char\" ('red steep-riverbank'), which was translated as Krasny (red) Yar.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded on 19 August 1628 as a Russian border fort when a group of service class people from Yeniseysk led by Andrey Dubenskiy arrived at the confluence of the Kacha and Yenisei Rivers and constructed fortifications intended to protect the frontier from attacks of native peoples who lived along the Yenisei and its tributaries. Along with Kansk to the east, it represented the southern limit of Russian expansion in the Yenisei basin during the seventeenth century. In a letter to Tsar Michael I the Cossacks reported:\n\"...The town of trunks (log buildings) we have constructed and around the place of fort, we the servants of thee, our Lord, have embedded posts and fastened them with double bindings and the place of fort have strengthened mightily...\"\nThe settlement was granted town status in 1690. An intensive growth of Krasnoyarsk began with the arrival of the Siberian Route (the road \"M53\" nowadays) in 1735 to 1741 which connected the nearby towns of Achinsk and Kansk with Krasnoyarsk and with the rest of Russia.\nIn 1749, a meteorite with a mass of about was found south of Krasnoyarsk. It was excavated by Peter Simon Pallas in 1772 and transported to Krasnoyarsk and subsequently to Saint Petersburg. The Krasnoyarsk meteorite was the first pallasite ever studied and the first meteorite ever etched.\nIn 1822 Krasnoyarsk became the administrative center of Yeniseysk Governorate. By the end of the 19th century, Krasnoyarsk had several manufacturing facilities and railroad workshops and an engine house. Growth continued with the discovery of gold and the arrival of a railroad in 1895.\nIn the Russian Empire, Krasnoyarsk was one of the places to which political exiles were banished. For example, eight Decembrists were deported from St.\u00a0Petersburg to Krasnoyarsk after the failure of the revolt.\nIn the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, during the Russian Civil War, Siberia east of Omsk was controlled by white forces under Alexander Kolchak, who in December 1919 retreated east to Irkutsk and the Bolsheviks took control of the city. On a plateau 7\u00a0km outside of town was a prisoner of war camp with 13,000 German and Austrian troops. Elsa Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m of the Swedish Red Cross spent almost a year there from July 1919 until May 1920.\nDuring the periods of centralized planning (Five Year Plans) numerous large plants and factories were constructed in Krasnoyarsk: Sibtyazhmash, the dock yard, the paper factory, the hydroelectric power station (now the fifth largest in the world and the second in Russia), and the river port.\nIn 1934, Krasnoyarsk Krai was formed, with Krasnoyarsk as its administrative center.\nDuring Stalinist times, Krasnoyarsk was a major center of the gulag system. The most important labor camp was the Kraslag or \"Krasnoyarsky ITL\" (1938-c.\u20091960) with the two units located in Kansk and Reshyoty. In the city of Krasnoyarsk itself, the Yeniseylag or \"Yeniseysky ITL\" labor camp was prominent as well during World War II (c.\u20091940\u201341).\nDuring World War II, dozens of factories were evacuated from Ukraine and Western Russia to Krasnoyarsk and nearby towns, stimulating the industrial growth of the city. After the war, additional large plants were constructed: the aluminum plant, the metallurgic plant, the plant of base metals and many others.\nIn the late 1970s, the Soviet Union began constructing a phased array radar station at Abalakova, near Krasnoyarsk, which violated the ABM Treaty. Beginning in 1983, the United States demanded its removal, until the Soviet Union admitted the radar station was a violation in 1989. Equipment was slowly removed from the site and by 1992 it was officially declared to be dismantled, though the equipment from the site was likely relocated to a new site near Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Krasnoyarsk was also home to Krasnoyarsk Northeast air base, which was turned into living blocks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union and beginning of privatization, many large plants and factories, such as the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Plant, became owned by alleged criminal authorities and oligarchs, while others were declared bankrupt. The economic transition resulted in a dramatic rise in unemployment and numerous strikes.\nThe best known financial scandal of the second half of the 1990s happened when ownership of the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Plant by a known Krasnoyarsk businessman Anatoliy Bykov had been canceled after he was accused of murdering his partner, Vilor Struganov. The accusation eventually turned out to be false. The Krasnoyarsk plant's ownership problems continue through the early 21st century since nearly all of them are owned either by monopolistic financial groups or by oligarchs.\nSince the election of Pyotr Pimashkov as the mayor of Krasnoyarsk in 1996, the appearance of the city gradually improved: the old historical buildings were restored, the asphalt walkways were replaced with paving-stone, and numerous squares and recreation areas with fountains were either restored or constructed from scratch. Now the majority of the city keeps only a few traces of its former, drab, post-collapse look.\nGeography.\nThe total area of the city, including suburbs and the river, is .\nThe river Yenisei flows from west to east through the city. Due to the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric dam upstream, the Yenisei never freezes in winter and never exceeds in summer through the city. Near the city center, its elevation is above sea level. There are several islands in the river, the largest of which are Tatyshev and Otdyha Isles, used mainly for recreation.\nTo the south and west, Krasnoyarsk is surrounded by forested mountains averaging in height above river level. The most prominent of them are Nikolayevskaya Sopka (notable for its ski jumping tracks), Karaulnaya Gora, and Chornaya Sopka, the latter being an extinct volcano. The gigantic rock cliffs of the Stolby Nature Reserve rise from the mountains of the southern bank of the Yenisei, the western hills from the Gremyachaya Griva crest extending westwards up to the Sobakina River, the north is generally plain, except for the Drokinskaya Sopka hill, with forests to the northwest and agricultural fields to the north and east.\nThe major rivers in and near Krasnoyarsk are the Yenisei, Mana, Bazaikha, and Kacha Rivers, the latter flowing throughout the historical center of the city. Due to the nature of the terrain, a few natural lakes exist in the vicinity of Krasnoyarsk.\nThe forests close to the city are mostly pine and birch; further afield, aspen becomes dominant in many areas. The moss-covered fir and Siberian pine replaces other wood in the mountains westward of the Karaulnaya River, in about to the west from the city, the forests to the south are mostly pine, fir and aspen.\nAdministrative and municipal status.\nKrasnoyarsk is the administrative center of the krai. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one rural locality (the village of Peschanka) incorporated as the \"krai city of Krasnoyarsk\"\u00a0\u2013 an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the krai city of Krasnoyarsk is incorporated as \"Krasnoyarsk Urban Okrug\".\nCity divisions.\nFor administrative purposes, Krasnoyarsk is divided into seven city districts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCoat of arms.\nThe first version was approved on March\u00a012, 1804. The coat of arms was divided horizontally into two parts, the upper part containing the coat of arms of Tomsk Governorate, and the lower part picturing the Krasny Yar cliff on a silver background. A revised coat of arms, approved on November\u00a023, 1851, had the golden figure of a lion placed on a red heraldic shield with a spade in the right fore paw and a sickle in the left fore paw, both made of the same metal. The shield was topped with the golden crown of the Russian Empire. The current coat of arms (as depicted here) was approved on November\u00a028, 2004. It contains the same red shield as in 1851 but with a slightly changed figure of the lion in the officially approved image. The shield is topped with a form of the mural crown, which is the golden five-tower coronet of rank of a federal subject administrative center.\nClimate.\nKrasnoyarsk experiences a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfb\"). Its climate is very similar to that of Novosibirsk in Russia, Fort McMurray and Winnipeg in Canada, the latter of which is a good deal further south geographically. Compared to Thompson, Manitoba, or Labrador City at similar latitudes, Krasnoyarsk's winters are relatively mild. Compared to European cities on a similar latitude, Krasnoyarsk has much warmer summers, but much colder and longer winters (for example, Aalborg, Denmark). The summer is also on average warmer than similar inland latitudes of Scandinavia, owing to Siberia's greater continentality. Krasnoyarsk has high differentials between summer and winter temperatures.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPopulation count by districts (2010 Census):\nThe population of Krasnoyarsk includes a number of peoples, the most numerous are Russians, followed by Tajiks, Kyrgyz and other Central Asian and Caucasian peoples, whose number has grown extensively because of the vast, often illegal immigration in search for work.\nAnother populous immigrant group is the Chinese who, unlike other foreign workers, are employed in much more lucrative areas and often form business partnerships with local companies. Many Chinese trade at the bazaars, and a special large Chinese bazaar named \"Sodruzhestvo\" (Russian for \"fellowship\"), and the \"Chinese Trading Town\" (known in Russian as \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434) or colloquially \"Kitai-gorod\" on Strelka.\nAs of the 2021 Census, the ethnic composition of Krasnoyarsk was:\nArchitecture.\nThere are a number of historical buildings in Krasnoyarsk, the oldest of them being the Intercession Cathedral (, 1785 to 1795, restored in 1977 to 1978). Other locally significant samples of Russian Orthodox architecture are the Annunciation Cathedral (, 1802\u201312), the Holy Trinity Cathedral (, 1802\u201312), John the Baptist Church (, 1899, former episcopal residence), and the new Michael the Archangel Church (, 1998 to 2003).\nOn the top of the Karaulnaya Hill, originally a pagan shrine, later occupied by the Krasnoyarsk fort watchtower, the Paraskeva Pyatnitsa Chapel (1804, rebuilt 1854\u201355) still stands. The chapel, displayed on the 10-ruble note, is one of the iconic images of the city. The chapel was abandoned and fell into disrepair during the Soviet era and only when Perestroyka came was it regained by the Yenisei bishopric.\nAnother unofficial symbol of Krasnoyarsk is the incomplete 24-story tower located at Strelka. Construction of the tower had been started just before Perestroyka and then frozen due to the administrative crisis. The outline of the tower is clearly seen from many places in the city.\nA bridge near Krasnoyarsk carries the Trans-Siberian Railway across the Yenisei. The original structure, one of the longest at the time, was constructed between 1893 and 1896 to an award-winning design by Lavr Proskuryakov. In 2003 it was rejected for emergency inscription on the World Heritage List. It was described at the time by ICOMOS \"an early representation of a typical parabolic polygonal truss bridge in Russia\" which became \"a testing ground for the application of engineering theories and the development of new innovative solutions, which had numerous successors\".&lt;ref name=\"WHC-03/27COM/INF.8A ADD\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was dismantled between 2002 and 2007.\nAmong other notable buildings are the mansions of the merchant Nikolay Gadalov (beginning of the 20th century), the Roman Catholic Transfiguration Chapel (, 1911, also known as the Krasnoyarsk Organ Hall), the Krasnoyarsk Krai Museum stylized as an Ancient Egyptian temple, the Krasnoyarsk Cultural/Historical Center and the triumphal arch at the Spit (2003), the flanked with two towers known as the \"Donkey Ears\".\nThere are a number of two-story wooden houses in the city built mostly in the middle of the 20th century as temporary habitations. Many urbanized villages located inside the city keep the remnants of the traditional Russian village architecture: wooden houses with backyards, many somewhat dilapidated now but still inhabited.\nCulture.\nThere are a number of local holidays celebrated annually in Krasnoyarsk. The most significant holiday is the Day of the City celebrated in June, usually with a carnival. Other holidays and cultural events are the Mana Festival (. The celebrations take place on the outside of town, on the bank of river Mana) usually held on the last weekend in June with the traditional bard contest, the International Museum Biennale traditionally held in the Krasnoyarsk Cultural/Historical Center, the avant-garde \"Museum Night\" festival dedicated to the International Museum Day (May 18), the Jazz on Yenisey festival, the Stolbist Day held many times a year celebrating the traditions of mountain climbing in the Stolby national reserve, and the Bikers' Rally.\nKrasnoyarsk has a number of local television companies and the highly developed telecommunications, many districts of the city have LAN-based broadband Internet access.\nThe city is also home to the Krasnoyarsk Children's Choir, a world-renowned choir that tours in many countries as The Little Eagles of Siberia.\nEducation and science.\nNext to Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk is a prominent scientific and educational center of Siberia, with over 30 higher education facilities, many of which are the branches of the Russian Academy of Science, and about 200 high schools. The most notable higher education institutes are:\nLike Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk has a special city district called Akademgorodok (\"Academic Town\"), where several scientific research institutes are located. Krasnoyarsk's Institute of Biophysics is known for a 1973\u20131985 experiment on ecological isolation of human beings (the \"Bios Experiment\"). Sukachev Institute of Forest, founded in 1944 at Moscow and relocated to Krasnoyarsk in 1959.\nThere are several museums in Krasnoyarsk. One is the Krasnoyarsk Regional Museum, containing historical items and exhibits of the region, including ancient history, native Siberians, and woolly rhinos.\nThe Krasnoyarsk zoo is also a major attraction for residents and tourists.\nTransportation.\nPublic transportation.\nThe transit system is dominated by buses, but there also are several trolleybus and tram routes.\nAn underground metro system (three lines) has been in planning and construction phases in Krasnoyarsk for decades. Subway construction was terminated in 2008. In 2021, a decision was made to use tunnels to create a light rail system, and construction resumed in 2023.\nRailway.\nKrasnoyarsk lies on the Yenisei River and historically has been an important junction on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Krasnoyarsk-Passazhirsky (, lit. Krasnoyarsk-Passenger) is the main railway station of Krasnoyarsk. Long-range trains of the Trans-Siberian Railway stop at this station. There are some stations served by Elektrichka and there is Krasnoyarsk-East goods station 26.3\u00a0km east of Krasnoyarsk-Passazhirsky.\nAirports.\nKrasnoyarsk was served by two airports: Yemelyanovo Airport is the main airport and handles both medium and long-haul domestic as well as international flights, and is northwest of the city. The secondary Cheremshanka Airport handled short-haul flights. Cheremshanka has lost its eminent role as the main base airport for an extensive network of local air services (MVL) in Krasnoyarsk Krai formerly served by the local Aeroflot Krasnoyarsk Directorate. In December 2011 a fire broke out at the Cheremshanka airport which destroyed the terminal building and the air traffic control tower.\nTourism.\nThe most popular place of attraction for tourists visiting Krasnoyarsk is the huge national nature reserve Stolby (\"pillars\"), which covers an area of with numerous giant granite rocks formations up to 100 meters high, many of very extraordinary shapes. Stolby is also a major rock climbing location. Many local climbers intentionally do not use any belaying equipment and call their extreme sport \"stolbizm\", known elsewhere as solo climbing.\nOther popular showplaces include the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station dam, the Karaulnaya Gora hill with the Paraskeva Pyatnitsa Chapel, museums, theaters, etc.\nSports.\nKrasnoyarsk is a center of Siberian sports. Areas, where Krasnoyarsk excels compared to other Russian cities, include rugby union, bandy, and freestyle wrestling.\nYenisey was the Soviet bandy champions every year in the 1980s as well as in 1991. The first Russian title came in 2001. In 2014 they became champions of the Bandy Super League and had the highest average attendance, 5 747. In 2015 the league title was won again as well as in 2016. At the 2019 Winter Universiade, bandy was due to feature as a demonstration sport for the first time and tournaments for both men and women were planned. An indoor stadium will be built for the occasion. It is planned to be ready for use by the end of 2018. The complexity of the construction is considered unique.\nThe city is considered a stronghold of rugby union in Russia, to the extent that the Rugby Union of Russia was headquartered locally for many years. Two Krasnoyarsk clubs, Krasny Yar and Enisey-STM, participate in the national Professional Rugby League, and European Rugby Challenge Cup, the second-tier pan-European club competition. Matches take precedence in the local media, and the city derby match can attract crowds of about 3000\u20135000. Many players of the Russian national rugby team hail from the area. Some of Russia's international rugby matches are played at the Central Stadium.\nFormer Carolina Hurricanes left winger Alexander Semin is from Krasnoyarsk.\nHost of the international wrestling tournament named after Ivan Yarygin.\nSport events.\nThe 2019 Winter Universiade was hosted by Krasnoyarsk in 2019.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nKrasnoyarsk is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCooperation agreements.\nKrasnoyarsk has cooperation agreements with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is inspired by the 1967 Formula One season and includes the teams Brabham, BRM, Eagle, Ferrari and Lotus. Two fictional teams called \"Murasama\" and \"Coventry\" replaced Honda and Cooper within the game.\nGameplay.\nThe game offers several modes in which the player can race alone or against AI opponents. The game also features multiplayer via LAN. Many parameters affecting the skill and aggressiveness of the AI drivers can be specified.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was in development for three years with a team of 25 to 30 people. Inspired by the 1966 film \"Grand Prix\", the developers chose to base the game on the 1967 Formula 1 Grand Prix season because during that period tracks were narrow and lined with trees, houses, and other elements that in a video game can serve as backgrounds to enhance the sensation of speed. In addition, the more primitive suspension of cars of the time meant that the car physics could be more visually dramatic.\nHowever, the amount of time that has passed since the 1967 Grand Prix season meant that some of the tracks the designers wanted to recreate no longer existed in their original form. The team visited town halls to get blueprints for defunct tracks. Papyrus co-founder Dave Kaemmer commented that the licensing for the game was difficult, but they had people who helped them during the development.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. \"GameSpot\" said that \"Grand Prix Legends\" has the most intense racing experience ever seen on a personal computer. \"Next Generation\" highly praised the graphics, gameplay, the recreation of 1967 Grand Prix season (in addition to its cars and tracks of its era), artificial intelligence and realistic driving model physics. The magazine ranked it at #47 in its list of the Fifty Best Games of All Time.\nSales.\nThe game was a commercial failure; Andy Mahood of \"PC Gamer US\" described its sales as \"abysmally poor\". In 2003, writer Mark H. Walker reported that \"the game sold only a few thousand copies\" in the United States, which he attributed to the general unpopularity of Formula One racing in the country. He noted that its \"steep learning curve kept many fans away\" in European markets. \"GameSpot\"'s Gord Goble attributed its performance to the \"combination of treacherous gameplay, sometimes glacial frame rates, and esoteric subject matter\". It ultimately totalled 200,000 sales by 2004.\nAwards.\nThe game was the runner-up for \"Computer Gaming World\"'s 1998 \"Best Driving\" award, and for \"GameSpot\"'s 1998 \"Driving Game of the Year\" award, both of which ultimately went to \"\". The staff of the former commented that \"Grand Prix Legends\" was the most ambitious and realistic driving simulation game of 1998, and the toughest to play.\nThe game won \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\"' 1998 \"Sports Game of the Year\" award. The staff wrote that a few racing games could come close to \"Grand Prix Racing\"'s level of sophistication and uncompromising detail. It also won the Best Racing Game award at the 1998 \"CNET Gamecenter\" Awards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is a distinction between the embedded energy of materials and constructing the landscape, and the energy consumed by the maintenance and operations of a landscape.\nTerminology and definition.\nLandscaping often refers to the practice of landscape design and gardening, which traditionally concern with designing sites with vegetation and craft for aesthetic, cultural, social, and religious purposes.\nLandscape architecture and landscape engineering, on the other hand, are multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary professions that integrate technical considerations, such as geography, ecology, biology, and engineering, into the design of landscape and the actualization of it.\nEnergy-efficient landscaping falls into the categories of the latter, and it stresses the energy conservation in site operation or the creation of the site. Among its various term usage, energy-efficient landscaping can refer to the reduction of energy usage in maintenance and operation of the landscape narrowly for the user/owner of the site, or broadly for the energy conservation of the global environment, such as mitigating urban heat island effect with reflective surface (increase albedo) or reducing the need of water treatment and sewage by using pervious pavement. Common methods of energy-efficient landscaping include reducing heat or cooling load of a building through shade, wind-blocking, and insulation; management of water; and using plants or construction material that cost less energy.\nMethods and techniques.\nDesign techniques include:\nShade with trees.\nPlanting trees for the purpose of providing shade, which reduces cooling costs. The mature height of the trees and their canopy shape need to be well studied. The locations of the trees should be chosen based on their height and the height of the building. Also, when trees are planted closer to the windows or walls, they will provide shade for a greater portion of the day as the Sun keep changing its relative position to the window and the trees. Planting the trees too close to the building, however, is also not desirable, as it might create the danger of touching above-ground or underground utility lines.\nThe type of leaves of the trees is also important. Broad-leaf evergreens like Southern magnolia can be used to provide dense year-round shade. However, needle-leaf evergreens like pines and cedars can provide more air circulation though their shade is sparser and more open.\nNot only can tree shade be used to reduce the cooling load in building, it can also be used in parking lot, driveways, and playgrounds.\nWindbreak.\nPlanting or building windbreaks to slow winds near buildings, which reduces heat loss. Homes loses heat through infiltration in the Winter. Windbreaks should be designed to intercept and redirect the Winter winds before they reach the house and outdoor areas with playgrounds or sensitive plants. The windbreak in the Winter should also be designed so that they would not block the sunlight in the Winter or block the wind in the Summer.\nWall sheltering with shrubbery or vines.\nPlanting shrubs near the wall creates an insulating air space around the wall. This is a similar idea to the use of a tree windbreak. Shrubs should be planted at least from the wall to prevent moisture and insect problems.\nTaking advantage of natural landform.\nEarth sheltering is an example of using natural landform and geological condition to save energy in building a structure. It is believed to save energy in multiple ways: by using the rock or strong \nsoil as wall and ground as the floor, construction cost is greatly reduced, because the structure will need less load bearing material and there is no need for excavation and foundation construction; the wall and the floor made of natural material likely will have better insulation than artificial wall and floors; Natural walls and floors can also reduce fire hazard, because they are hard to be ignited thus reduce the need for flame retardants.\nIn a study of simulating a structure with varying depth submerged in the ground to understand the insulating effect of natural wall and ground in cold climate, it was found that the thermal transmittance of the earth-sheltered walls and floor is 16% - 45% lower than that of the structure totally above ground.\nOther than Earth Sheltering, a simpler way of taking advantage of natural landform is using geology, such as mountains, for shade.\nGreen roofs.\nOften, landscape design and architecture refers to the design in ground surface; in many contexts, specifically, the design guidance and topics are for a typical residential landscape in suburban housing, where there is a yard (garden), a driveway, and a house. In the crowded urban area, however, there is not abundant ground surface for landscape design. Green roofs, then, become an appealing option to add some aesthetics and green to the crowded cities. Not limited to the cities, green roofs can be applied to wherever it will fit. Most of times, actually, the decision to build Green roofs is based on local climate and policy. It is because other than its aesthetics, green roofs are used often for their ability to conserve energy, such as increasing insulation of the building roof, retaining and infiltrating rainwater, and potentially reducing urban heat island effect when it was installed to a certain scale. In Germany, for example, partly because of EU's regulation, 17% of the new roof construction are green roofs. In Washington DC, green roofs are used as an alternative storm-water retention technique.\nBenefits.\nReducing building energy consumption by increasing the roof insulation: In total energy consumption reduction, green roof would have the best performance relative to a bare roof in a colder climate, which require nighttime heating. The reduction in heating load of the building increase as the soil depth of the green roof increase, though an increased soil depth would mean heavier roof. On the other hand, if a building is cooling-dominated, leaf area index is more important. In peak energy consumption reduction, green roof also has a notable effect, and the leaf area index and soil depth are both positively related to its performance.\nRainwater retention and evapotranspiration: 3-4 inches of soil can retain about 1 inch of rainwater. That is about 75% of precipitation in most areas in United States. By retaining the rainwater in soil, the water would not become runoff, instead they would result in evapotranspiration.\nControversies.\nWater runoff quality: When green roof is not able to hold the amount of the precipitation, the excessive rainwater will become runoff. In a field experiment where contaminated water is dripped into a green roof section to mimic rainfall in the green roof, the exfiltrate water was studied and analyzed. It was found that since the average level of suspended solid, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations in Green roof water outflow is significantly higher than that in conventional roof outflow, extensive green roofs will become a source of nutrient contamination in urban water environment.\nFire Hazard: Green roofs can be more easily ignited than conventional roofs; it is a concern that when the green roof caught fire, the high temperature would damage the roof structure itself. Not only the idea of damaging the roof is contradictory to energy conservation and sustainability, the fire and the roof damage could cause safety issue to the residents. It remains a matter of debate as to whether a green roof will exacerbate or mitigate the effects of a fire. Some argue that, because vegetation is about 95% water, the green roof actually reduces chances of a fire. On the other hand, some argue that during autumn and winter, when the vegetation is dry, fire hazard is increased. A recent study has found, through mathematical modelling, that when the vegetation itself caught fire, heat does penetrate downward (rather slowly as the thermal conductivity of soil is low), eventually damaging the roof itself. Thus the key to whether ignited vegetation will damage the roof or not depends on the thickness of the soil. The study also found that by installing a gypsum layer beneath the soil layer, the possibility of damaging the roof can be greatly reduced.\nAdditional structural load: Most old buildings were not designed for the extra roof dead load of the green roofs. If more energy is consumed in building the additional load bearing structure for the green roofs than the energy saved through insulation enhancement and water retention, it would be contradictory to the idea of energy conservation. By study, common green roofs types in the market would increase the load on the rood by 1.2 to 2.43 kilo-newton per square meter.\nPervious (porous/permeable) paving.\nA lot pavement in urban and suburban areas is impervious, this likely would result the contaminated stormwater runoff. In pre-development area, averagely 50% of storm-water would result in evapotranspiration, 5% in runoff, and 45% in infiltration, whereas in post-development area, only 35% storm-water result in evapotranspiration, and 50% in runoff, and 15% in infiltration. This change has caused various problem, such as flooding, infrastructural damage due to rapid movement of water, and water contamination.\nBy using pervious paving, however, the amount of infiltrated storm-water will be increased in post-development area, and the pollutants in the filtrated water can be reduced; thus the problem can be mitigated. In Low Impact Development 2008 Conference, ASCE performed two bench-scale study to examine the effectiveness of permeable interlocking concrete pavement in terms of water flow rate and the role of microbial colonies in pollutant removal in the micro-environment of porous pavement. The experiment shows 84% relative total suspended solids (TSS) removal on average, yet the increased relative removal over time suggests there is potentially solid buildup, and that may result system clogging and system failure. The evidence in pollutant removal proved the conclusion of the previous study that the annual pollutant runoff from the driveways was 86% lower for pervious driveways than impervious driveways.\nTypes of Pervious pavement include:\nPorous asphalt.\nAdvantage: Relatively low cost; Easy access to the material; Workers are experienced with it\nDisadvantage: Susceptible to water damage; Usually used for short-term only; Low relative strength\nPervious concrete.\nAdvantage: High structural strength; Easy access to the material\nDisadvantage: Slow construction process; High initial cost\nPermeable interlocking concrete paver.\nAdvantage: Ease of Construction, Aesthetics, Ease of maintenance and repair\nDisadvantage: High Cost; Only can be used for low speed road way \nGrid pavement.\nAdvantage: Wide variety of products; Relatively inexpensive; Ease of maintenance and repair\nDisadvantages: Typically limited to parking areas. Some grid pavements are not accessible to individuals who use mobility aids.\nThe decision among different permeable pavement types depends on the need of the project, available material and equipment, and budget.\nEffective and smart lighting.\nSite lighting with full cut off fixtures, light level sensors, and high efficiency fixtures.\nStructure orientation.\nThe sun rises from the East, moves South, and sets in the West. Thus, a rule of thumb for design is to avoid south-facing windows when trying to decrease cooling load of the building and increase south-facing windows when trying to decrease heating load of the building. The reality, however, is more complicated. The sun rises from East and sets in West perfectly only on the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, and during the vast majority of the year, Sun travels slightly southward and eastward depending on whether it is summer or winter and on whether the observer is in the Northern Hemisphere or the Southern Hemisphere.\nTo design for the best performance of the site, the designer needs to well understand the local climate and the site's location relative to equator.\nMore to include.\nEnergy-efficient landscaping techniques include using local materials, on-site composting and chipping to reduce green waste hauling, hand tools instead of gasoline-powered, and also may involve using drought-resistant plantings in arid areas, buying stock from local growers to avoid energy in transportation, and similar techniques.\nExample.\nIn agreement with the city to build a resilient and sustainable landscape, Massachusetts Institute of Technology has initiated several energy efficiency upgrade projects, these projects include:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
