{"id": "66964", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66964", "title": "Pittsburgh Penguins", "text": "National Hockey League team in Pennsylvania\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins (colloquially known as the Pens) are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh. The Penguins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team has played its home games at PPG Paints Arena since 2010, and has previously played at the Civic Arena, which was better known by its nickname \"the Igloo\". The Penguins are affiliated with two minor league teams \u2013 the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL.\nFounded during the 1967 expansion, the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Final, winning the Stanley Cup five times \u2013 in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017. Along with the Edmonton Oilers, the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non-Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the salary cap era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, including co-owner Mario Lemieux, who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, Sidney Crosby, and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1967\u20131984).\nPrior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League's Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz III, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967\u201368 season. The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($ million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($ million today) more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Penguins also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.\nA contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown, Ohio. (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with the Cleveland Barons in the mid-1970s.) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the \"Igloo\", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena), a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the \"Golden Triangle\" of downtown Pittsburgh. The Penguins' first general manager, Jack Riley, opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in Brantford, Ontario, on September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"Original Six\" teams hampered the Penguins, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate, all-star defenseman Leo Boivin (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and New York Rangers' veteran Earl Ingarfield, a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald, and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley. George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain.\nOn October 11, 1967, league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens. On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4\u20132. However, the Penguins went 27\u201334\u201313 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley, who recorded a 2.88 goals-against average and was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All-Star Game. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti.\nThe next season saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players \u2013 including longtime future Penguins star Jean Pronovost \u2013 making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains.\nTriumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969\u20131974).\nIn the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender Tony Esposito. Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semifinals, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game-winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native Quebec, suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001.\nIn the 1970\u201371 season, the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21\u201337\u201320 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in 1972, only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost, Syl Apps Jr., Keith McCreary, agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972.\nThe Penguins battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in 1974, when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by Jack Button. Button obtained Steve Durbano, Ab DeMarco, Bob \"Battleship\" Kelly and Bob Paradise through trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28\u201341\u20139 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth.\nHowever, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into bankruptcy. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate. Around the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the 1976\u201377 season. Through the intervention of a group that included former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair, the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.\nPlayoff runs and a uniform change (1974\u20131982).\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of Syl Apps, Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the semifinals in 1975, but were ousted from the playoffs by the New York Islanders in one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season. Baz Bastien, a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in 1977\u201378. Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the Buffalo Sabres before a second-round sweep at the hands of the Boston Bruins.\nThe Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980. On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman Randy Carlyle, and prolific scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard but little else.\nDuring the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the 1982 playoffs, the Penguins held a 3\u20131 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by John Tonelli, who had tied the game before. It would be the Penguins' final playoff appearance until 1989.\nLemieux\u2013Jagr era (1984\u20132005).\nThe team had the league's worst record in both the 1982\u201383 and 1983\u201384 seasons. With the team suffering financial problems, it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate. Mario Lemieux, one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the 1984 NHL entry draft. Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the New Jersey Devils, who were placed last, the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term. They posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils' management. Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, saying in an interview with the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted. Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers (after the Oilers' 1987 Stanley Cup win) and bringing in young talent like scorers Kevin Stevens, Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Penguins; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. In 1985\u201386, the Penguins missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In 1986\u201387, they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In 1987\u201388, for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game.\nIn 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game.\nBack-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989\u20131997).\nA herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his 1989\u201390 season, although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings (Bryan Trottier) and trades (Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy, Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL entry draft. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.\nThe roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Final in six games, punctuated by an 8\u20130 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the 1991 Stanley Cup Final, the Penguins met with President George H. W. Bush, the first NHL team ever to visit the White House. The following season, the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer, and Scotty Bowman took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in 1991\u201392.\nCancer diagnosis revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56\u201321\u20137 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the Presidents' Trophy. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of the success, the 1993 playoffs ended in the division finals when the New York Islanders eliminated the Penguins in seven games.\nThe Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards: Alexei Kovalev, Martin Straka, Aleksey Morozov, Robert Lang and Petr Nedved, and defensemen Sergei Zubov, Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the Washington Capitals in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games.\nLemieux's retirement and return (1997\u20132001).\nOn April 6, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin.\nThe Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4\u20131 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20132 in the second round.\nBy this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1998.\nLemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity \u2013 enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time.\nLemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player\u2013owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs, highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the conference finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils.\nRebuilding (2001\u20132005).\nThe Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998\u201399, the club had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year. Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in 2002, finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference. The following season they finished second-last. In the 2003 NHL entry draft, the Penguins selected goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury with the first overall pick.\nThe 2003\u201304 season was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average of any NHL team), with just one sellout. As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins' player and commentator) Eddie Olczyk and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL entry draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the 2004 NHL entry draft (Alexander Ovechkin), which went to the Washington Capitals. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center Evgeni Malkin, was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick. However, a transfer dispute between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) delayed his Pittsburgh debut.\nBy this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the Civic Arena, had become the oldest arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to Kansas City, Missouri. A lockout prompted the cancellation of the 2004\u201305 NHL season. One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the Ottawa Senators, which had filed for bankruptcy protection. During the lockout, the Penguins' players dispersed between the club's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and to European leagues.\nCrosby\u2013Malkin era (2005\u2013present).\nWith the lockout resolved in 2005, the NHL organized an unprecedented draft lottery to set the 2005 NHL entry draft selection order. The draft lottery, which was held behind closed doors in a \"secure location\", resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick. Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) superstar Sidney Crosby (who had been training with Lemieux over the summer) was the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as \"The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh.\nThe Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the Russian Superleague. The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 per game on average in the 2005\u201306 season. However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien. Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, after developing an irregular heartbeat, this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), and with the second-highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second to Wayne Gretzky's 1.92.\nDespite the team's struggles, Crosby established himself as a star in the league, amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top-scoring rookie in Penguin history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top-two pick in four years, in the 2006 NHL entry draft, and selected touted two-way forward Jordan Staal. The team announced on April 20 they would not renew the contract for general manager Craig Patrick, who had been the general manager since December 1989. On May 25, Ray Shero signed a five-year contract as general manager.\nResurgence and third Stanley Cup title (2006\u20132010).\nChange came for the Penguins on October 18, 2006, when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games. Malkin would record points in 16 consecutive games. The Penguins finished the 2006\u201307 season in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 47\u201324\u201311, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the 2007 playoffs the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators, defeated the Penguins 4\u20131. At the season's end, rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won.\nOn March 13, 2007, Pennsylvania's governor Ed Rendell, Allegheny County chief executive Dan Onorato, Pittsburgh's mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The completion of Consol Energy Center guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million bond was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year lease on September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040.\nAfter a mediocre start to the 2007\u201308 season, Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title \u2013 their first division title in 10 years \u2013 with a 4\u20132 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4\u20130, defeating the New York Rangers 4\u20131 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20131 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy. Pittsburgh lost the 2008 Stanley Cup Final to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14\u20136 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe Trophy-winner Henrik Zetterberg (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the conference finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing games 1 and 2 in Detroit, like the previous years, the Penguins won games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in games 5 and 6. In game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2\u20131 to win their third Stanley Cup title. Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive game 7, which the Penguins lost 5\u20132, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena.\nNew arena and injuries (2010\u20132015).\nIn 2010\u201311, the Penguins played their first game in Consol Energy Center. On February 11, 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins\u2013New York Islanders brawl took place. A season-ending concussion suffered by Crosby and a knee injury to Malkin marred the season. The team left early in the playoffs, blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to Tampa Bay Lightning, with Fleury's goaltending called into question. With Crosby still sidelined with post-concussion syndrome, at the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the 2012 playoffs with high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games. Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson award. Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the 2012 NHL entry draft for the upcoming 2012\u201313 season.\nDuring the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the conference finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5 million.\nIn the 2013\u201314 season, the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division, though the club struggled in the playoffs, requiring six games to defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets, then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3\u20131 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June 6 with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. Rutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the 2014\u201315 season, the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the mumps, the team fell to fourth in the division. The Penguins lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Rutherford traded several players and picks to acquire star winger Phil Kessel.\nBack-to-back Stanley Cups and 50th anniversary (2015\u20132017).\nAfter acquiring Kessel, the Penguins had high expectations for the 2015\u201316 season. However, by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15\u201310\u20133 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan, who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford.\nThe Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the playoffs, the Penguins defeated the Rangers in a 4\u20131 series, the Capitals 4\u20132 and the Lightning 4\u20133 to win the Eastern Conference championship, advancing to the Stanley Cup Final against the San Jose Sharks. On June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in a 4\u20132 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. Captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe Penguins opened their 50th anniversary season in the NHL as defending Stanley Cup champions, raising their commemorative banner on October 13, 2016, in a shootout victory over Washington. The Penguins faced the Columbus Blue Jackets in the opening round of the 2017 playoffs, defeating them in five games. In the second round, they played against their divisional rival, Washington, and faced them for the second-straight year in the same round, winning a seven-game series. In the conference finals, the Penguins eliminated the Ottawa Senators in seven games to advance to the Stanley Cup Final, where they faced the Nashville Predators. The Penguins won the first two games of the series and then lost the next two matchups before dominating the fifth and the sixth games of the series to win the Stanley Cup for the second straight year. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the 1997\u201398 Detroit Red Wings to defend their title and the first to do so in the salary cap era.\nPlayoff streak (2017\u20132023).\nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 NHL expansion draft to the Vegas Golden Knights. Nevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games. In the next season, the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the first round. In the following season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the team advanced to the 2020 playoffs, but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the qualifying round. On February 9, 2021, the Penguins named Ron Hextall as their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons. Brian Burke was hired as president of hockey operations. On February 21, Crosby became the first player to reach 1,000 NHL games for the team. The Penguins won the East Division title, extending their playoff streak to 15 seasons. This became the longest active streak in North American sports as a result of the San Antonio Spurs missing the 2020 NBA playoffs. The 2020\u201321 season came to an end in game 6 of the first round of the 2021 playoffs against the New York Islanders.\nOn November 29, 2021, Fenway Sports Group announced its intent to purchase a controlling stake in the Penguins. On December 31, 2021, they officially took over as majority owners of the Penguins. In the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Penguins lost in seven games to the New York Rangers despite having a 3\u20131 series lead. The game 7 loss marked the first time the Penguins lost a game 7 on the road in franchise history after going 6\u20130 the previous six instances.\nThe 2022\u201323 season was marked with two milestones for the Penguins. On November 23, 2022, Evgeni Malkin played his 1,000th NHL game, becoming the second player in franchise history to play his 1,000th game in a Penguins uniform. This would be followed up only months later, when teammate Kris Letang would play his 1,000th game as well, on April 2, 2023, despite missing 18 games during the season. However, despite being in a playoff position midway in the season, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since Crosby's rookie season in 2005\u201306, ending a 16-season playoff streak and resulting in dismissals of Burke and Hextall.\nDubas era and decline (2023\u2013present).\nOn June 1, 2023, Kyle Dubas was named the team's new president of hockey operations. On August 6, the Penguins traded for Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Erik Karlsson in a three-team deal also involving the Montreal Canadiens. On February 18, 2024, the Penguins retired the no. 68 of franchise legend Jaromir Jagr in a pregame celebration, with Jagr becoming just the third Penguin to receive the honor. Prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Penguins parted ways with longtime and fan favorite forward Jake Guentzel, trading him to the Carolina Hurricanes. Despite the trades, and a late season playoff push, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive year on the penultimate night of the season when the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Montreal Canadiens in overtime while the Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, clinching the final spot as the second wild card.\nOn September 16, 2024, Sidney Crosby signed a two-year $17.4 million extension to remain with the Penguins. The 2024\u201325 season was marked with many milestones by the Penguins' longtime dynastic duo. On October 10, Malkin recorded his 800th career assist on a goal by Erik Karlsson in a 6\u20133 win over the Detroit Red Wings, becoming the 34th player in league history to reach the mark. Two days later, Malkin recorded his 1,300th NHL point with an assist on a goal by Rickard Rakell, becoming the 37th player in league history to reach the mark. On October 16, Malkin scored his 500th career goal in a 6\u20135 overtime win over the Buffalo Sabres, to become the 48th player in league history to reach the mark and 24th player to do so with one franchise. On November 23, Crosby scored his 600th NHL goal against the Utah Hockey Club, becoming the 21st player in league history and second player in Penguins history to achieve the feat. On April 6, 2025, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the third consecutive season following a 3\u20131 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. This was the Penguins' first season finishing with a losing record since the 2005\u201306 season. On April 28, head coach Sullivan and the Penguins agreed to mutual contract termination, concluding his 10-season tenure with the team.\nDan Muse was subsequently hired as head coach on June 4, 2025.\nTeam information.\nCrest and sweater design.\nWhen the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed.\nThe team's colors were originally powder blue, navy blue, and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city.\nThe Penguins generally wore the black and gold \"skating penguin\" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983\u201384 season.\nIn the 1992\u201393 season, the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo, or \"Robopenguin\". The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second alternate jersey, featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the \"skating penguin\" logo, but with a \"Vegas gold\" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the \"skating penguin\" was readopted as the primary, though the \"flying penguin\" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995\u20132002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007\u201308 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the \"flying penguin\" logo from the shoulders.\nThe Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the 2003\u201304 NHL season. The team wore their powder blue, 1968\u20131972 \"throwbacks\" against the Buffalo Sabres in the 2008 Winter Classic. This throwback was supposedly retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that made its debut at the 2011 Winter Classic. For the 2011\u201312 season, the 2011 Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired. Called the \"Blue Jerseys of Doom\" by the \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\", the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when he suffered a concussion in the 2011 Winter Classic. Evgeni Malkin was also concussed during a game when the Penguins donned the alternate uniforms.\nIn 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform featured \"Pittsburgh gold\", the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002. The Penguins eventually brought back a white version of the black \"Pittsburgh gold\" alternates, thus retiring the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms they wore from 2000 to 2016. A commemorative patch was added to the uniforms throughout the 2016\u201317 season to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary. During the 2017 Stadium Series against the archrival Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins wore a special gold uniform featuring military-inspired lettering, a \"City of Champions\" patch and a variation of the \"skating penguin\" logo. This design served as the basis for the team's third uniform, which was unveiled in the 2018\u201319 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms. The Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the 2019 Stadium Series.\nIn 2021, the Penguins wore white \"Reverse Retro\" uniforms based on the 1992\u201397 uniforms. This set replaced the \"flying penguin\" with the alternate \"skating penguin\" logo minus the gold triangle on the shoulders. A black version served as the replacement for the gold alternate uniforms starting in the 2021\u201322 season. In the 2022\u201323 season, the Penguins unveiled their second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, this time featuring a black version of the white \"flying penguin\" uniform they wore from 1992 to 2002.\nFor the 2023 Winter Classic, the Penguins went with a vintage white uniform with black stripes, and added a gold \"P\" logo as a nod to the NHL Pirates of the late 1920s.\nOn their home opener of the 2025\u201326 season, the Penguins donned a new alternate uniform, returning to a gold base with the \"skating penguin\" minus the triangle and a bottom black stripe. The three black stripes on the sleeves represent the \"Three Rivers\" of Pittsburgh: the Allegheny River, the Monongahela River, and the Ohio River. The \"Three Rivers\" symbolism was also carried over into the black triangle shoulder patch, which contained three gold waves and an igloo as a nod to Civic Arena. Letters and number fonts were based on Pittsburgh's historic trolley system.\nArenas.\nThe Penguins called Civic Arena home for over 45 seasons from their inception in 1967. In September 2010, they completed the move to Consol Energy Center (now named PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two \"home\" games in the Cleveland suburb of Richfield, Ohio, in 1992 and 1993 at the Richfield Coliseum (this is not unlike the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh; the Philadelphia 76ers used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).\nFrom 1995 to 2015, the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University's 84 Lumber Arena has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home, and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training.\nIn August 2015, the Penguins and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228. The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.\nAs with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and Consol Energy Center.\nMinor league affiliates.\nThe Penguins have two minor league affiliates assigned to their team. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, their AHL affiliate, have played in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania, since 1999. The Penguins also have a secondary affiliate in the ECHL, the Wheeling Nailers, which they have been associated with since the start of the 2000\u201301 ECHL season.\nFanbase.\nDespite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat.\nWhile the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald, noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins. However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade.\nToday, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field. Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround) ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level.\nIn the community.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation conducts numerous community activities to support both youth and families through hockey education and charity assistance.\nSeason-by-season record.\nThis is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Penguins.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\"\nPlayers and personnel.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Navbar-header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHonored members.\nRetired numbers.\nThe NHL retired Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 for all its member teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins presently acknowledge an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Inductees affiliated with the Penguins include 15 former players and five builders of the sport. The four individuals recognized as builders by the Hockey Hall of Fame includes former head coaches, and general managers.\nIn addition to builders and players, broadcasters and sports journalists have also been recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame, however are not inductees. In 2001, radio play-by-play broadcaster Mike Lange, was awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hall of Fame. In 2009, Dave Molinari, a sports journalist for the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" was awarded the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hall of Fame.\nPlayers\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBuilders\nTeam captains.\nAll the players who have served as team captain with the Penguins franchise\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFranchise records.\nScoring leaders.\nThese are the top-ten point-scorers in franchise history.

The rivalry exists both due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in Pennsylvania. The Flyers lead the head-to-head record with a 153\u201398\u201330 record. However, the Penguins eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and were eliminated by them from the playoffs in 2012, strengthening the rivalry. Three years later, the Flyers won the sixth playoff meeting between the clubs to advance to the conference semifinals.\nThe franchises have met seven times in the playoffs, with the Flyers winning four series (1989 division finals, 4\u20133; 1997 conference quarterfinals, 4\u20131; 2000 conference semifinals, 4\u20132; and 2012 conference quarterfinals, 4\u20132) and the Penguins winning three (2008 conference finals, 4\u20131; 2009 conference quarterfinals, 4\u20132; and 2018 first round, 4\u20132).\nWashington Capitals.\nThe two teams have faced off 11 times in the playoffs, with the Penguins winning nine of the 11 matchups, their two series losses coming in the 1994 and 2018 playoffs. The Penguins defeated the Capitals en route to their five Stanley Cup victories. They have met in a decisive game 7 in the 1992, 1995, 2009 and 2017 playoffs. The NHL's fourth Winter Classic, played on January 1, 2011, at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh showcased this rivalry. The Capitals won the game 3\u20131. The rivalry can also be seen in the American Hockey League (AHL). Pittsburgh's top farm team is the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and their in-state and biggest rivals are the Capitals' top farm team, the Hershey Bears.\nMedia.\nRadio.\nThe Penguins have their radio home on WXDX-FM and their television home on SportsNet Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network consists of a total of 34 stations in four states. Twenty three of these are in Pennsylvania, four in West Virginia, three in Ohio, and three in Maryland. The network also features an FM high-definition station in Pittsburgh.\nBroadcasters.\nLocal ABC affiliate WTAE-TV broadcast the Penguins during the 1967\u201368 season, with station Sports Director Ed Conway handling the play-by-play during both the television and radio broadcasts. He remained the lone play-by-play broadcaster until the completion of the 1968\u201369 season. Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969\u201370 season, when WPGH-TV and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to broadcast the Penguins for the 1970\u201371 season, with Bill Hamilton handing the play-by-play duties. The 1970\u201371 season was also the first season where the Penguins introduced a color commentator to the broadcast team, with John MacDonald taking the position in the booth.\nMike Lange, who joined the Penguins' broadcast team as a play-by-play announcer on the radio side in 1974\u201375 became the play-by-play broadcaster for the team at the start of the 1979\u201380 season. At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover in 1972\u201373. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984\u201385, when Schiffauer was replaced by Paul Steigerwald. Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast booth from 1985 until 1999. \nWith Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast booth with former Penguins' defenseman Peter Taglianetti. Taglianetti remained in the position for one season before being replaced by Eddie Olczyk. Lange and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins' history following the firing of previous head coach Rick Kehoe after the 2002\u201303 season. With Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired Bob Errey as their new color commentator for the start of the 2003\u201304 season. Lange and Errey remained in the booth until 2005\u201306. After 26 seasons in the television broadcast booth, FSN Pittsburgh did not retain Mike Lange. Instead, he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remained the team's TV play-by-play broadcaster until the 2016\u201317 season. Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and holds the position of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he held with the team in the mid-1970s. Following the 2016\u201317 season, Steigerwald moved back to the Penguins front office and NHL Network personality Steve Mears was hired as the new television play-by-play announcer starting with the 2017\u201318 season. Lange retired in the 2021 off-season, with Josh Getzoff being named as his replacement. Phil Bourque serves as the radio color commentator. Before the 2023\u201324 season, Getzoff moved to the television booth with Mears replacing him on the radio. The Penguins did not retain TV analyst Bob Errey, choosing to go with a rotation of analysts featuring former Penguins Colby Armstrong, Mike Rupp and Phil Bourque. In 2024, Joe Brand replaced Steve Mears on the radio booth after Mears was hired by the Blue Jackets.\nEvery Penguins game is carried on the AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh network, which is carried by cable providers in most of two states and parts of four others. On October 2, 2023, the network will be purchased by the Penguins and rebranded to SportsNet Pittsburgh. In addition, Fox Sports Ohio simulcasts Penguins hockey in the Cleveland metro area, as well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and Direct TV each carry the Penguins games on their AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally. The Pittsburgh Penguins also receive monthly and sometimes weekly \"game of the week\" national exposure on American networks ESPN, ESPN+, ABC, and TNT, and Canadian networks Sportsnet and CBC. Previously, the Penguins received national TV exposure on Fox, NBC and NBCSN in the U.S., and TSN in Canada.\nIn-game announcers.\nRyan Mill has been the Penguins' public address announcer since 2009 when he succeeded John Barbero. Jeff Jimerson has been the team's official anthem singer since 1991 and also served in the same capacity in the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie \"Sudden Death\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "66966", "revid": "50076165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66966", "title": "Vascular plant", "text": "Clade of plants with xylem and phloem\nVascular plants (from la\u00a0'duct'), also called tracheophytes (, ) or collectively Tracheophyta (; from grc \" ' ()\"\u00a0'windpipe' and \" ' ()\"\u00a0'plants'), are plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. The group includes most land plants (c.\u2009300,000 accepted known species) excluding mosses.\nVascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers), and angiosperms (flowering plants). They are contrasted with nonvascular plants such as mosses and green algae. Scientific names for the vascular plants group include Tracheophyta, Tracheobionta and Equisetopsida \"sensu lato\". Some early land plants (the rhyniophytes) had less developed vascular tissue; the term eutracheophyte has been used for all other vascular plants, including all living ones.\nHistorically, vascular plants were known as \"higher plants\", as it was believed that they were further evolved than other plants due to being more complex organisms. However, this is an antiquated remnant of the obsolete scala naturae, and the term is generally considered to be unscientific.\nCharacteristics.\nBotanists define vascular plants by three primary characteristics:\nCavalier-Smith (1998) treated the Tracheophyta as a phylum or botanical division encompassing two of these characteristics defined by the Latin phrase \"facies diploida xylem et phloem instructa\" (diploid phase with xylem and phloem).\nOne possible mechanism for the presumed evolution from emphasis on haploid generation to emphasis on diploid generation is the greater efficiency in spore dispersal with more complex diploid structures. Elaboration of the spore stalk enabled the production of more spores and the development of the ability to release them higher and to broadcast them further. Such developments may include more photosynthetic area for the spore-bearing structure, the ability to grow independent roots, woody structure for support, and more branching.\nSexual reproduction in vascular land plants involves the process of meiosis. Meiosis provides a direct DNA repair capability for dealing with DNA damages, including oxidative DNA damages, in germline reproductive tissues.\nPhylogeny.\nA proposed phylogeny of the vascular plants after Kenrick and Crane 1997 is as follows, with modification to the gymnosperms from Christenhusz \"et al.\" (2011a), Pteridophyta from Smith \"et al.\" and lycophytes and ferns by Christenhusz \"et al.\" (2011b) The cladogram distinguishes the rhyniophytes from the \"true\" tracheophytes, the eutracheophytes.\nThis phylogeny is supported by several molecular studies. Other researchers state that taking fossils into account leads to different conclusions, for example that the ferns (Pteridophyta) are not monophyletic.\nHao and Xue presented an alternative phylogeny in 2013 for pre-euphyllophyte plants.\nNutrient distribution.\nWater and nutrients in the form of inorganic solutes are drawn up from the soil by the roots and transported throughout the plant by the xylem. Organic compounds such as sucrose produced by photosynthesis in leaves are distributed by the phloem sieve-tube elements.\nThe xylem consists of vessels in flowering plants and of tracheids in other vascular plants. Xylem cells are dead, hard-walled hollow cells arranged to form files of tubes that function in water transport. A tracheid cell wall usually contains the polymer lignin.\nThe phloem, on the other hand, consists of living cells called sieve-tube members. Between the sieve-tube members are sieve plates, which have pores to allow molecules to pass through. Sieve-tube members lack such organs as nuclei or ribosomes, but cells next to them, the companion cells, function to keep the sieve-tube members alive.\nTranspiration.\nThe most abundant compound in all plants, as in all cellular organisms, is water, which has an important structural role and a vital role in plant metabolism. Transpiration is the main process of water movement within plant tissues. Plants constantly transpire water through their stomata to the atmosphere and replace that water with soil moisture taken up by their roots. When the stomata are closed at night, water pressure can build up in the plant. Excess water is excreted through pores known as hydathodes. The movement of water out of the leaf stomata sets up transpiration pull or tension in the water column in the xylem vessels or tracheids. The pull is the result of water surface tension within the cell walls of the mesophyll cells, from the surfaces of which evaporation takes place when the stomata are open. Hydrogen bonds exist between water molecules, causing them to line up; as the molecules at the top of the plant evaporate, each pulls the next one up to replace it, which in turn pulls on the next one in line. The draw of water upwards may be entirely passive and can be assisted by the movement of water into the roots via osmosis. Consequently, transpiration requires the plant to expend very little energy on water movement. Transpiration assists the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil as soluble salts. Transpiration plays an important role in the absorption of nutrients from the soil as soluble salts are transported along with the water from the soil to the leaves. Plants can adjust their transpiration rate to optimize the balance between water loss and nutrient absorption.\nAbsorption.\nLiving root cells passively absorb water. Pressure within the root increases when transpiration demand via osmosis is low and decreases when water demand is high. No water movement towards the shoots and leaves occurs when evapotranspiration is absent. This condition is associated with high temperature, high humidity, darkness, and drought.\nConduction.\nXylem is the water-conducting tissue, and the secondary xylem provides the raw material for the forest products industry. Xylem and phloem tissues each play a part in the conduction processes within plants. Sugars are conveyed throughout the plant in the phloem; water and other nutrients pass through the xylem. Conduction occurs from a source to a sink for each separate nutrient. Sugars are produced in the leaves (a source) by photosynthesis and transported to the growing shoots and roots (sinks) for use in growth, cellular respiration or storage. Minerals are absorbed in the roots (a source) and transported to the shoots to allow cell division and growth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise in North America, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) considers it to be one of the \"most important championships available to the sport\". The trophy was commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup and is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the governor general of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. The entire Stanley family supported the sport, the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club, and winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the two main professional ice hockey organizations, reached an agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. It was established as the \"de facto\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \"de jure\" NHL championship prize in 1947.\nThere are actually three Stanley Cups: the original bowl of the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", the authenticated \"Presentation Cup\", and the spelling-corrected \"Permanent Cup\" on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame whenever the Presentation Cup is not available. While the NHL has maintained control over the trophy itself and its associated trademarks, the NHL does not actually own the trophy but uses it by agreement with the two Canadian trustees of the Cup. The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup, although there has been dispute as to whether the league has the right to own trademarks associated with a trophy that it does not own.\nThe original bowl was made of silver and is high and in diameter. The current Stanley Cup is topped with a copy of the original bowl, made of a silver and nickel alloy. It has a height of and weighs . Like the Grey Cup, and unlike the trophies awarded by the other major professional sports leagues of North America, a new Stanley Cup is not made every year. The winners originally kept it until a new champion was crowned, but winning teams currently get the Stanley Cup during the summer and a limited number of days during the season. Every year since 1924, a select portion of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff names are engraved on its bands, which is unusual among trophies. However, there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players, so some names must be omitted. Between 1924 and 1940, a new band was added almost every year that the trophy was awarded, earning the nickname \"Stovepipe Cup\" due to the unnatural height of all the bands. In 1947, the cup size was reduced, but not all the large rings were the same size. In 1958, the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band. Every 13 years when the bottom band of the Stanley Cup is filled with names of champions, the top band is removed and retired to be displayed in the vault of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. The four bands below it are slid up one place and a new blank band added to the bottom. The first winning team engraved on the newest band is thus, in theory \"(see Engraving section below)\", displayed on the trophy for the next 65 years. It has been referred to as The Cup, Lord Stanley's Cup, The Holy Grail, or facetiously as Lord Stanley's Mug. The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions, the oldest of which is the winning team drinking champagne from it.\nSince the 1914\u201315 season, the Cup has been won a combined 106 times by 21 current NHL teams and five teams no longer in existence. It was not awarded in 1919 because of the Spanish flu epidemic and in 2005 because of the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout. It was held by nine different teams between 1893 and 1914. The Montreal Canadiens have won it a record 24 times and are the most recent Canadian-based team to win it, doing so in 1993; the Detroit Red Wings have won it 11 times, the most of any United States\u2013based NHL team, most recently in 2008. The current holders of the Cup are the Florida Panthers after their victories in 2024 and 2025, the former being their first in franchise history. More than 3,000 different names, including the names of over 1,300 players, had been engraved on it by 2017.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAfter Frederick Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Preston (later the 16th Earl of Derby) was appointed by Queen Victoria as governor general of Canada on June 11, 1888, he and his family became highly enthusiastic about ice hockey. Stanley was first exposed to the game at Montreal's 1889 Winter Carnival, where he saw the Montreal Victorias play the Montreal Hockey Club. The \"Montreal Gazette\" reported that he \"expressed his great delight with the game of hockey and the expertise of the players\". During that time, organized ice hockey in Canada was still in its infancy and only Montreal and Ottawa had anything resembling leagues.\nStanley's entire family became active in ice hockey. Two of his sons, Arthur and Algernon, formed a new team called the \"Ottawa Rideau Hall Rebels\". Arthur also played a key role in the formation of what later became known as the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), and became the founder of ice hockey in Great Britain. Arthur and Algernon persuaded their father to donate a trophy to be \"an outward and visible sign of the hockey championship\". Stanley sent the following message to the victory celebration held on March 18, 1892, at Ottawa's Russell House Hotel for the three-time champion Ottawa Hockey Club:\nI have for some time been thinking that it would be a good thing if there were a challenge cup which should be held from year to year by the champion hockey team in the Dominion [of Canada].\nThere does not appear to be any such outward sign of a championship at present, and considering the general interest which matches now elicit, and the importance of having the game played fairly and under rules generally recognized, I am willing to give a cup which shall be held from year to year by the winning team.\nI am not quite certain that the present regulations governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, and it would be worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from.\nSoon afterwards, Stanley purchased what is frequently described as a decorative punch bowl, but which silver expert John Culme identified as a rose bowl, made in Sheffield, England, and sold by London silversmith G. R. Collis and Company (now Boodle and Dunthorne Jewellers), for ten guineas, equal to ten and a half pounds sterling, US$48.67, which is equal to $ in 2024 dollars. He had the words \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\" engraved on one side of the outside rim, and \"From Stanley of Preston\" on the other side. The name \"Stanley Cup\" was given to it as early as May 1, 1893, when an \"Ottawa Journal\" article used the name as a title.\nOriginally, Stanley intended that the Cup should be awarded to the top amateur hockey team in Canada, to be decided by the acceptance of a challenge from another team. He made five preliminary regulations:\nStanley appointed Sheriff John Sweetland and Philip D. Ross (who went on to serve an unsurpassed 56 years) as trustees of the Cup. Sweetland and Ross first presented the trophy in 1893 to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association on behalf of the affiliated Montreal Hockey Club, the champions of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC), since they \"defeated all comers during the late season, including the champions of the Ontario Association\" (Ottawa). Sweetland and Ross also believed that the AHAC was the top league, and as first-place finishers in the AHAC, Montreal was the best team in Canada. Naturally, the Ottawas were upset by the decision because there had been no challenge games scheduled and because the trustees failed to convey the rules on how the Cup was to be awarded prior to the start of the season.\nAs a result, the Cup trustees issued more specific rules on how the trophy should be defended and awarded:\nLord Stanley never saw a Stanley Cup championship game, nor did he ever present the Cup. Although his term as Governor General ended in September 1893, he was forced to return to England on July 15. In April of that year, his older brother Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby died without issue, and Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby.\nChallenge Cup era.\nDuring the challenge cup period, none of the leagues that played for the trophy had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions; whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title. However, in 1894, four teams out of the five-team AHAC tied for the championship with records of 5\u20133\u20130. The AHAC had no tie-breaking system. After extensive negotiations and Quebec's withdrawal from the championship competition, it was decided that a three-team tournament would take place in Montreal, with the Ottawa team receiving a bye to the final because they were the only road team. On March 17, in the first Stanley Cup playoff game, the Montreal Hockey Club (Montreal HC) defeated the Montreal Victorias, 3\u20132. Five days later, in the first Stanley Cup Final game, Montreal HC beat the Ottawa Hockey Club 3\u20131.\nIn 1895, Queen's University was the first official challenger for the Cup, although it was controversial. The Montreal Victorias had won the league title and thus the Stanley Cup, but the challenge match was between the previous year's champion, Montreal HC, and the university squad. The trustees decided that if the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreal HC won the match 5\u20131 and their cross-town rivals were crowned the champions. The first successful challenge to the Cup came the next year by the Winnipeg Victorias, the champions of the Manitoba Hockey League. On February 14, 1896, the Winnipeg squad defeated the champions 2\u20130 and became the first team outside the AHAC to win the Cup.\nAs the prestige of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution at the annual meeting of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) to allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. The Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams, because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time. The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17 goals to 5.\nThe smallest municipality to produce a Stanley Cup champion team is Kenora, Ontario; the town had a population of about 4,000 when the Kenora Thistles captured the Cup in January 1907. Led by future Hall of Famers Art Ross and \"Bad\" Joe Hall, the Thistles defeated the Montreal Wanderers in a two-game, total goals challenge series. The Thistles successfully defended the Cup once, against a team from Brandon, Manitoba. In March 1907, the Wanderers challenged the Thistles to a rematch. Despite an improved lineup, the Thistles lost the Cup to Montreal.\nIn 1908, the Allan Cup was introduced as the trophy for Canada's amateurs, and the Stanley Cup started to become a symbol of professional hockey supremacy. In that same year, the first all-professional team, the Toronto Trolley Leaguers from the newly created Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL), competed for the Cup. One year later, the Montreal HC and the Montreal Victorias, the two remaining amateur teams, left the ECAHA, and the ECAHA dropped \"Amateur\" from their name to become a professional league. In 1910, the National Hockey Association (NHA) was formed. The NHA soon proved it was the best in Canada, as it kept the Cup for the next four years.\nPrior to 1912, challenges could take place at any time or place, given the appropriate rink conditions, and it was common for teams to defend the Cup numerous times during the year. In 1912, Cup trustees declared that it was to be defended only at the end of the champion team's regular season.\nOrganized interleague competition.\nIn 1914, the Victoria Aristocrats from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) challenged the NHA and Cup champion Toronto Blueshirts. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.\nSeveral days later, trustee Foran wrote to NHA president Quinn that the trustees are \"perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA, and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup\". One year later, when the Maritime league folded, the NHA and the PCHA concluded a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the Cup, similar to baseball's World Series, which is played between the American League and National League champions. Under the new proposal, the Stanley Cup Final series alternated between the East and the West each year, with alternating games played according to NHA and PCHA rules. The PCHA's Vancouver Millionaires won the 1915 series three games to none in a best-of-five series.\nPrior to organized ice hockey expanding to any serious extent outside Canada, the concept that the Stanley Cup champion ought to be recognized as the \"world champion\" was already firmly established \u2013 Stanley Cup winners were claiming the title of \"world champions\" by no later than the turn of the century. After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, joined the PCHA in 1914, the trustees promptly issued a formal statement that the Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada, but now for the best team in the world. Ice hockey in Europe was still in its infancy at this time, so it was without much controversy that winners of the Stanley Cup continued styling themselves as the \"world champions\" just like in baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American-based team to play in the Stanley Cup Final, although all its players were Canadian. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American-based team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.\nThe Spanish influenza epidemic forced the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans to cancel the 1919 Stanley Cup Final after game five, marking the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded. The series was tied at 2\u20132\u20131, but the final game was never played because Montreal Manager George Kennedy and players Joe Hall, Billy Coutu, Jack McDonald, and Newsy Lalonde were hospitalized with influenza. Hall died four days after the cancelled game, and the series was abandoned.\nThe format for the Stanley Cup Final changed in 1922, with the creation of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). Three leagues competed for the Cup: two league champions faced each other for the right to challenge the third champion in the final series. This lasted three seasons as the PCHA and the WCHL later merged to form the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1925. In 1924\u201325 the Victoria Cougars won the Cup, the last team outside the NHL to do so.\nNHL takes over.\nThe WHL folded in 1926 and was quickly replaced by the Prairie Hockey League. However, in the meantime, the NHL (which had entered the U.S. only two years before) bought up the contracts of most of the WHL's players and largely used them to stock the rosters of three new U.S. teams. In what would turn out to be its most significant expansion of its pre-Original Six era, the Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Cougars (now called the Detroit Red Wings), and New York Rangers joined the NHL. With the NHL now firmly established in the largest markets of the Northeastern United States, and with the Western teams having been stripped of their best players, the PHL was deemed to be a \"minor league\" unworthy of challenging the NHL for hockey supremacy.\nThe PHL lasted only two seasons. Over the next two decades other leagues and clubs occasionally issued challenges, but none were accepted by the Cup's trustees. Since 1926, no non-NHL team has played for the Cup, leading it to become the \"de facto\" championship trophy of the NHL. In addition, with no major professional hockey league left to challenge it, the NHL began calling its league champions the \"world champions\", notwithstanding the lack of any interleague championship. In doing so, the NHL copied a policy that had been adopted by the then still-fledgling National Football League from its start in 1920 (and which the National Basketball Association also asserted upon its founding in 1946).\nFinally in 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustee J. Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the Cup to the NHL, allowing the league to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished to play for the Cup:\nThis agreement was amended on November 22, 1961, substituting the Governors of the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston, Ontario with the Committee of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario as the group to name the two Canadian trustees, if need be. In the 1970s, the World Hockey Association sought to challenge for the Cup. By this time, all Cup trustees were longtime NHL loyalists, and under the direction of NHL president Clarence Campbell the WHA's challenge for the Cup was blocked. However, notwithstanding the aforementioned legal obligation, the NHL (considering not only the WHA's presence but also the rising caliber of European ice hockey leagues) quietly stopped calling its champions the \"world champions\".\nNevertheless, the NHL came under pressure to allow its champion to play the WHA champion. Eventually, following the establishment of the Canada Cup as the first \"best-on-best\" international hockey tournament, NHL president Clarence Campbell (who was a vocal opponent of the tournament) made public overtures to establish a true world professional championship in ice hockey, \"just like the World Series\". Under Campbell's proposal, the NHL champion would have played the WHA champion for the right to face the European champion. In the end, Campbell's proposal went nowhere \u2013 eventually, the NHL resolved the WHA challenge by agreeing to merge with its rival, by which time the older league had quietly withdrawn its support for the idea. Neither the NHL nor any other professional hockey league makes a claim to its champions being the \"world champions.\"\nThe Cup was awarded every year until 2005, when a labour dispute between the NHL's owners and the NHL Players Association (the union that represents the players) led to the cancellation of the 2004\u201305 season. As a result, no Cup champion was crowned for the first time since the flu pandemic in 1919. The lockout was controversial among many fans, who questioned whether the NHL had exclusive control over the Cup. A website known as freestanley.com (since closed) was launched, asking fans to write to the Cup trustees and urge them to return to the original Challenge Cup format. Adrienne Clarkson, then governor general of Canada, alternately proposed that the Cup be presented to the top women's hockey team in lieu of the NHL season. This idea was so unpopular that the Clarkson Cup was created instead. Meanwhile, a group in Ontario, also known as the \"Wednesday Nighters\", filed an application with the Ontario Superior Court, claiming that the Cup trustees had overstepped their bounds in signing the 1947 agreement with the NHL, and therefore must award the trophy regardless of the lockout.\nOn February 7, 2006, a settlement was reached in which the trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams should the league not operate for a season. The dispute lasted so long that, by the time it was settled, the NHL had resumed operating for the 2005\u201306 season, and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004\u201305 season. Furthermore, when another NHL lockout commenced in 2012 the trustees stated that the 2006 agreement did not oblige them to award the Cup in the event of a lost season, and that they were likely to reject any non-NHL challenges for the Cup in the event the 2012\u201313 season were cancelled, which it was not.\nIn 2007, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) formalized the \"Triple Gold Club\", the group of players and coaches who have won an Olympic Games gold medal, a World Championship gold medal, and the Stanley Cup. The term had first entered popular use following the 2002 Winter Olympics, which saw the addition of the first Canadian members.\n125th anniversary.\nIn March 2017, to commemorate the Stanley Cup's 125th anniversary, the original Cup and the current Stanley Cup were the focus of a four-day tour of Ottawa, including a stop at Rideau Hall. The Royal Canadian Mint produced two commemorative coins to mark the anniversary. The first is a roll of Canadian quarters with an image of the Stanley Cup, the word \"Stanley Cup\" in English and in French with two ice hockey players and \"125 years/\" on the reverse and an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse using plated steel. The second coin was designed with the Stanley Cup on the reverse and an effigy of Elizabeth II, \"Stanley Cup\" in English and \"\" in French and \"50 dollars\" above the effigy. It was made using 99.9% silver.\nIn October 2017, the Lord Stanley's Gift Monument, commemorating the donation of the Stanley Cup, was erected in Ottawa at Sparks Street and Elgin Street, near the location of the dinner party announcing the Cup at the Russell House, which has since been demolished.\nEngraving.\nLike the Grey Cup, awarded to the winner of the Canadian Football League, the Stanley Cup is engraved with the names of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff. However, this was not always the case: one of Lord Stanley's original conditions was that each team could, at their own expense, add a ring to the Cup to commemorate their victory. Initially, there was only one base ring, which was attached to the bottom of the original bowl by the Montreal Hockey Club. Clubs engraved their team names, usually in the form , on that one ring until it was full in 1902. With no more room to engrave their names (and unwilling to pay for a second band), teams left their mark on the bowl itself. The 1907 Montreal Wanderers became the first club to record their name on the bowl's interior surface, and the first champion to record the names of 20 members of their team.\nIn 1908, for reasons unknown, the Wanderers, despite having turned aside four challengers, did not record their names on the Cup. The next year, the Ottawa Senators added a second band onto the Cup. Despite the new room, the 1910 Wanderers and the 1911 Senators did not put their names on the Cup. The 1915 Vancouver Millionaires became the second team to engrave players' names, this time inside the bowl along its sides.\nThe 1918 Millionaires eventually filled the band added by the 1909 Senators. The 1915 Ottawa Senators, the 1916 Portland Rosebuds and the 1918 Vancouver Millionaires all engraved their names on the trophy even though they did not officially win it under the new PCHA-NHA system. They had won the title of only the previous champion's league and would have been crowned as Cup champions under the old challenge rules. The winners in 1918 and 1920 to 1923 did not put their winning team name on it.\nNo further engraving occurred until 1924, when the Canadiens added a new band to the Cup. Since then, engraving the team and its players has been an unbroken annual tradition. Originally, a new band was added each year, causing the trophy to grow in size. The \"Stovepipe Cup\", as it was nicknamed because of its resemblance to the exhaust pipe of a stove, became unwieldy, so it was redesigned in 1948 as a two-piece cigar-shaped trophy with a removable bowl and collar. This Cup also properly honoured those teams that did not engrave their names on the Cup. Also included was the 1918\u201319 no decision between the Montreal Canadiens and Seattle Metropolitans.\nSince 1958, the Cup has undergone several minor alterations. The original collar and bowl were too brittle, and were replaced in 1963 and 1969, respectively. The modern one-piece Cup design was introduced in 1958, when the old barrel was replaced with a five-band barrel, each of which could contain 13 winning teams. Although the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial year in 1992, the names of the 1965 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13. When the bands were all filled in 1991, the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the Stanley Cup would not grow further.\nAnother new band was scheduled to be added to the bottom of the cup following the 2004\u201305 season, but was not added because of the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout. After the 2005\u201306 champion Carolina Hurricanes were crowned and the new bottom ring was finally added (along with the retiring of the band listing the 1940\u201341 to 1952\u201353 champions), the cancelled season was acknowledged with the words \"2004\u201305 season not played\".\nFollowing the crowning of the 2017\u201318 champions, the Washington Capitals, the band listing the 1953\u201354 to 1964\u201365 winners was removed in September 2018, with a new band for the 2017\u201318 to 2029\u201330 champions added to the bottom of the cup. Since the introduction of the five-band cup, each engraved team is displayed on the trophy between 52 and 65 years (though in practice, this was reduced by one year as a result of the 1953\u20131965 band only containing 12 teams prior to its removal), depending on the order they are engraved on the relevant band.\nThere have only been four official Stanley Cup engravers. The fourth and current one, Montreal silversmith Louise St. Jacques, has held the position since 1988.\nCurrently, the Cup stands at 89.5 centimetres (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;35+1\u20444 inches) tall and weighs &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;15+1\u20442 kilograms (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;34+1\u20442 lb). By its 125th anniversary in 2017, the Stanley Cup had had 3,177 names engraved on it; of those, 1,331 belong to players.\nName inscriptions.\nCurrently, to qualify for automatic engraving, a player:\nHowever, since 1994, teams have been permitted to petition the NHL Commissioner, to be considered on a case-by-case basis, to engrave a player's name on the cup if the player was unavailable to play due to \"extenuating circumstances\". For example, the Detroit Red Wings received special permission from the NHL to inscribe the name of Vladimir Konstantinov, whose career ended after a car accident on June 13, 1997, on the Stanley Cup after Detroit defended their title in 1998.\nWith the Montreal Canadiens having won by far the most Cup championships of any team, the list of the players who have been engraved on the Cup the most often is dominated by Montreal players. Henri Richard of the Canadiens, with his name engraved eleven times, played on more Stanley Cup champions than any other player. He is followed by Jean Beliveau and Yvan Cournoyer of the Canadiens with ten championships, Claude Provost of the Canadiens with nine, and three players tied with eight: Red Kelly (four with the Red Wings, four with the Leafs, the most for any player who was not a member of the Canadiens) and Canadiens players Jacques Lemaire, Maurice Richard. Beliveau's name appears on the Cup more than any other individual, ten times as a player and seven times as management for a total of seventeen times.\nTwenty women have had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup. The first woman to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup is Marguerite Norris, who won the Cup as the president of the Detroit Red Wings in 1954 and 1955. The only Canadian woman to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup is Sonia Scurfield who won the Cup as a co-owner of the Calgary Flames in 1989.\nIn 2001, Charlotte Grahame, the Colorado Avalanche's Senior Director of Hockey Administration, had her name engraved on the trophy. Her son John later had his name engraved as a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2004.\nEngraving errors.\nThere are several misspellings on the Cup. Many of them have never been corrected. Examples include:\nScratched-out names.\nThe following names were later scratched out with a series of \"X\"s:\nTraditions and anecdotes.\nThere are many traditions associated with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice by the NHL commissioner to the captain of the winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950 Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.\nThe tradition of the captain first hoisting the Cup has been \"breached\" a few times. In 1987 after the Edmonton Oilers defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, Wayne Gretzky handed the Cup to Steve Smith, a year after Smith made a costly gaffe that cost the Oilers the chance of making their fourth consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearance. The second occurred in 1993 after the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Los Angeles Kings, Guy Carbonneau handed the Cup to Denis Savard, as Savard had been the player that many fans had urged the Canadiens to draft back in 1980. The third was in 2001 involving Joe Sakic and Ray Bourque when the Colorado Avalanche won the Cup in 2001, as the seventh and deciding game of the Final was the last of Bourque's 22-year NHL career, having never been on a cup-winning team until that time (until being traded to the Avalanche on March 6, 2000, Bourque had played only for the Boston Bruins). When Sakic received the trophy, he did not hoist it, but instead immediately handed it to Bourque; Sakic then became the second player on the team to hoist the trophy.\nThe Stanley Cup championship team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1995 the New Jersey Devils started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. After the 1994\u201395 season, the NHL made it mandatory that one of the official Cup handlers always be present while the Cup is passed around among players in the off-season. This may have been related to Eddie Olczyk's handling of the Cup after the New York Rangers' 1994 win - Olczyk brought the Cup to the Belmont Stakes, where Kentucky Derby winner Go for Gin ate out of it.\nOn August 22, 2001, Colorado Avalanche Director of Finance Mark Waggoner carried the Stanley Cup to the summit of Mount Elbert, the highest point of Colorado.\nVictors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed their dogs to eat out of the Cup.\nOriginal, authenticated, and replica versions.\nThere are technically three versions of the \"Stanley Cup\": the original 1892 bowl or \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", 1963 authenticated \"Presentation Cup\", and the 1993 \"Permanent Cup\" at the Hall of Fame.\nThe original 1892 \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", purchased and donated by Lord Stanley, was physically awarded to the Champions until 1970, and is now displayed in the Vault Room at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario.\nThe authenticated version or \"Presentation Cup\" was created in 1963 by Montreal silversmith Carl Petersen. NHL president Clarence Campbell felt that the original bowl was becoming too thin and fragile, and thus requested a duplicate trophy as a replacement. The Presentation Cup is authenticated by the seal of the Hockey Hall of Fame on the bottom, which can be seen when winning players lift the Cup over their heads, and it is the one currently awarded to the champions of the playoffs and used for promotions. This version was made in secret, and first awarded in 1964.\nThe replica \"Permanent Cup\", was created in 1993 by Montreal silversmith Louise St. Jacques to be used as a stand-in at the Hockey Hall of Fame whenever the Presentation Cup is not available for display. It also serves as an understudy of sorts should the Presentation Cup be lost or damaged at any point.\nAs a morale booster.\nThe Stanley Cup has been brought to military bases for both American and Canadian troops, as well as their NATO allies. In 2004, the Cup was displayed at MacDill Air Force Base, near Tampa, Florida. The event was later touted by officials at MacDill as \"a huge morale booster for our troops\". In 2006, the Cup toured Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where wounded Marines were given the opportunity to view and be photographed with the Cup.\nIn 2007, the Stanley Cup made its first trip into a combat zone. During the trip to Kandahar, Afghanistan from May 2 to 6, organized by the NHL, the Hockey Hall of Fame, the NHL Alumni and the Canadian Department of National Defence, the Cup was put on display for Canadian and other NATO troops. The Cup was not damaged when its host base sustained a rocket attack on May 3.\nThe Stanley Cup was returned to Afghanistan as part of a \"Team Canada visit\" in March 2008. In the spring of 2010 the Stanley Cup made its fourth trip to Afghanistan, accompanied by ex-players.\nOn June 27, 2010, Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Brent Sopel paid tribute to his friend, former Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke and Burke's late son, Brendan, by accompanying the Cup to the 2010 Chicago Gay Pride Parade.\nIn 2018, the Cup was used to improve the spirits of those who were affected by either of two significant events which claimed the lives of multiple individuals: the Humboldt Broncos' bus crash on April 6, and the Capital Gazette shooting on June 28. For the former, the Stanley Cup was brought to the hospital where the crash survivors were recuperating on April 15, and for the latter, it was presented to Capital Gazette employees at their temporary office on July 3. Chandler Stephenson of the 2018 Washington Capitals also spent his day with the Stanley Cup with the Broncos that August.\nTrustees.\nThe regulations set down by Lord Stanley call for two trustees, who had the sole, joint right to govern the Cup and the conditions of its awarding until 1947 when they ceded control to the NHL. While the original regulations allow for a trustee to resign, to date, only Ian \"Scotty\" Morrison retired as trustee in 2023. All other trustees have served until their deaths. In the event of a vacancy, the remaining trustee names the replacement for the deceased or resigned trustee.\nTo date, eleven men have served as trustees of the Stanley Cup:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66970", "revid": "50975367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66970", "title": "Ofra Haza", "text": "Israeli singer (1957\u20132000)\nOfra Haza (; 19 November 1957 \u2013 23 February 2000) was an Israeli singer, songwriter, and actress, commonly known in the Western world as \"the Madonna of the East\", or \"the Israeli Madonna\". Her voice has been described as a \"tender\" mezzo-soprano. In 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked her at number 186 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\nOf Yemenite-Mizrahi descent, Haza performed music known as a mixture of traditional Middle Eastern and commercial singing styles, fusing elements of Eastern and Western instrumentation, orchestration and dance-beat, as well as lyrics from Mizrahi and Jewish folk tales and poetry. By the late 1980s, Haza was an internationally successful artist, achieving large success in Europe and the Americas and appearing regularly on MTV. During her singing career, she earned many platinum and gold discs and her music proved highly popular in the club scene. By the 1990s, at the peak of her career, she was regularly featured in movie soundtracks, such as that of \"Dick Tracy\" (1990) and famously in \"The Prince of Egypt\" (1998), and her vocals were popularly sampled in hip hop. Her death in 2000 from an AIDS-related illness shocked Israeli society.\nHaza was a highly influential cultural figure in Israel, and is considered one of the country's biggest cultural icons, who helped popularize Mizrahi culture.\nEarly life.\nBat-Sheva Ofra Haza was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, to Mizrahi Jewish parents from Yemen who had emigrated to Israel in 1949 with eight children. She was the youngest of nine children (six sisters and two brothers) born to Yefet and Shoshana Haza. They were raised in a Masorti household in the Hatikva Quarter, then an impoverished, working-class area of Tel Aviv. Although named Bat-Sheva by her parents, her sisters disliked the name, and preferred to call her by her middle name, Ofra, instead.\nHaza's earliest musical influences included her learning traditional Yemenite songs from her parents; Haza's mother in particular, Shoshana, proved a major influence on her musical direction. Shoshana had been a professional singer in Yemen and often performed at family celebrations, with Haza also recalling her mother singing to her children from an early age. Additionally early influences in her music came from Israeli folk songs, the Beatles, and Elvis Presley.\nHaza herself began to exhibit a similar musical inclination to that of her mother, and began singing at an early age, including at local weddings and as a soloist in her school choir. At the age of 12, Haza joined a local protest theatre troupe, named \u201cHatikva\u201d (The Hope) which had been recently founded by a neighbour of hers, Bezalel Aloni. Haza soon emerged as one of the most gifted performers in the troupe, and manager Bezalel Aloni soon noticed her singing talent. He featured her at front of stage in many of his productions, and later became her manager and mentor. At the age of 19, she was Israel's foremost pop star, and news articles have retrospectively described her as \"the Madonna of the East\".\nHaza served two years in the Israel Defense Forces.\nInternational artist.\nShe represented Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983, with the song \"Chai\", finishing second with 136 points. Her major international breakthrough came in the wake of the album \"Shirei Teiman\" (\"Yemenite songs\"), which she recorded in 1984. The album consisted of songs that Haza had heard in childhood, using arrangements that combined authentic Middle Eastern percussion with classical instruments. Further recognition came with the single \"Im Nin'alu\", taken from the album \"Shaday\" (1988), which won the New Music Award for Best International Album of the Year. The song topped the Eurochart for two weeks in June that year and was on heavy rotation on MTV channels across the continent. In the annals of classical hip-hop this song would be extensively re-released, re-mixed and sampled, for example on Coldcut's remix of Eric B. &amp; Rakim's \"Paid in Full\". The single reached the UK top twenty and became a dance floor favorite across Europe and the US, topping the German charts for nine weeks. Subsequent singles were also given the dance-beat / MTV-style video treatment, most notably, \"Galbi\", \"Daw Da Hiya\" and \"Mata Hari\", but none quite matched the runaway success of her first hit. In May 1990, Haza performed at the World Music Awards in Monaco, where she received an award for World's Best-Selling Israeli Artist. \"Im Nin'alu\" would go on to be featured on an in-game radio playlist of the video game \"\", released in 2005 and featured on Panjabi MC's album \"Indian Timing\" in 2009.\nHaza also received critical acclaim for the albums \"Fifty Gates of Wisdom\" (1984), \"Desert Wind\" (1989), \"Kirya\" (1992) and \"Ofra Haza\" (1997).\nIn 1992, \"Kirya\" (co-produced by Don Was) received a Grammy nomination.\nIn 1994, Haza released her first Hebrew album in seven years, \"Kol Haneshama\" (\"The Whole Soul\"). Though not an initial chart success, the album produced one of her biggest hits to date, \"Le'orech Hayam\" (\"Along The Sea\"), written by Ayala Asherov. The song did not have any substantial chart success upon its release to radio but became an anthem after Haza performed it on the assembly in memorial to deceased Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a week after he was assassinated. Radio stations around the country began to play it. Its lyrics became even more symbolic following Haza's own death in 2000.\nCollaborations and performances.\nHer collaborative work with internationally established acts included the single \"Temple of Love (Touched by the Hand of Ofra Haza)\", recorded with The Sisters of Mercy in 1992. Thomas Dolby co-produced \"Yemenite Songs\" and \"Desert Wind\", on which he was also a guest musician. Haza guested on Dolby's album \"Astronauts And Heretics\" (1992), singing on the track \"That's Why People Fall in Love\". She recorded \"My Love Is for Real\" with Paula Abdul in 1995 and on Sarah Brightman's album \"Harem\", Haza's vocals were included on \"Mysterious Days\", thanks to an idea by Brightman's partner Frank Peterson (ex-Enigma), who produced both \"Harem\" (2003) and the album \"Ofra Haza\" (1997). Haza also sang backing vocals on the song \"Friend of Stars\" by the German electro-pop band And One, from the \"Spot\" (1993) album.\nFor the \"Kirya\" album, Iggy Pop, a friend of Don Was, performed the narration on \"Daw Da Hiya\" and Haza joined him and a host of other stars for the video and single release \"Give Peace A Chance\" in 1991. She also sang on the soundtracks of \"Colors\" (1988), \"Dick Tracy\" (1990), \"Wild Orchid\" (1990), \"Queen Margot\" (1994) and \"The Prince of Egypt\" (1998). For \"Dick Tracy\", it was Madonna, who also participated in the movie, that wanted Ofra Haza to record for the movie's soundtrack and encouraged her to do so. Madonna would go on to sample Haza's 1988 hit, \"Im Nin'alu\", in her song \"Isaac\" from the \"Confessions On A Dance Floor\" (2005) album. \nIn \"The Prince of Egypt,\" she voiced the character Yocheved, singing \"Deliver Us\". When composer Hans Zimmer, who was working with Haza on the music for \"The Prince of Egypt\", introduced her to the film's character designers and animators, they thought she was so beautiful that they drew Yocheved to look like the singer. For the film's soundtrack, Haza sang the song \"Deliver Us\" in 19 languages, about half of which were sung phonetically, including:\nOn the soundtrack of \"The Governess\" (1998), Haza is the featured singer on seven of the twelve tracks and worked closely with film music composer Edward Shearmur. In 1999, she performed (together with late Pakistani artist Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan) the track \"Forgiveness\", on the contemporary symphony album \"The Prayer Cycle\" by Jonathan Elias. As a featured background vocalist, Haza's voice has been recorded, re-mixed or sampled for Black Dog's \"Babylon\" single, Eric B and Rakim's \"Paid in Full (Coldcut Remix)\", \"Temple of Love (1992)\" by The Sisters of Mercy, and for the M/A/R/R/S hit \"Pump Up The Volume\". The single \"Love Song\" has been re-mixed by DJs many times, its powerful vocal performance and comparatively sparse musical arrangement making it the perfect vehicle for a dance-rhythm accompaniment.\nCovers of songs by other artists included the Carole King/James Taylor song \"You've Got a Friend\", Madonna's \"Open Your Heart\", Gary Moore's \"Separate Ways\", and Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\".\nThere were many live performances and Haza spoke with fond memories of her visits to Japan and Turkey. She performed at the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, where she appeared alongside Irish singer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. \"Paint Box\" was written specially for the event. Her 1990 live recording, \"Ofra Haza at Montreux Jazz Festival\" was released in 1998.\nHaza shared duets and concert performances with Glykeria, Yehudit Ravitz, Paul Anka, Paula Abdul, Michael Jackson, Iggy Pop, Hoite, Buddha Bar, Ishtar, Gidi Gov, Whitney Houston, Tzvika Pick, Khaled, Prachim Yerushalaim, The Sisters of Mercy, Thomas Dolby, Stefan Waggershausen, Eric B and Rakim, Gila Miniha, Hans Zimmer, Hagashash Hachiver, Yaffa Yarkoni, Dana International, Shoshana Damari and posthumously with Sarah Brightman.\nIn late 1999, Haza recorded new material for a new album that she worked on with Ron Aviv, a music producer from Petah Tikva. At the time, she also worked with the Finnish violinist Linda Brava, who released a previously unreleased track called \"Tarab\" on her MySpace page on 14 May 2010. On the track, Haza sings in English, Arabic and Hebrew, while Brava plays the electric violin. The track is possibly Haza's last recording.\nIn 2023, Israeli producers teamed up in creating a collaboration between Haza and Zohar Argov, another famous deceased Israeli singer known as \"The king of Mizrahi music\". The song \"Kan Le Olam\" (\"Here Forever\") was created through artificial intelligence. The song was released on 13 April, 2023 and, according to the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation, is \"the first song in the Hebrew language whose voices have been reproduced using artificial intelligence technology. The song was produced in honor of the 75th Independence Day of the State of Israel at the initiative of the Israel Broadcasting Corporation here by the Session 42 company.\"\nMarriage.\nOn 15 July 1997, Haza married businessman Doron Ashkenazi. The couple had no children, but Ashkenazi had an adopted son, Shai, and a biological daughter from his first marriage.\nDeath.\nOfra Haza died on 23 February 2000, at the age of 42, of AIDS related complications. Her HIV-positive diagnosis is now generally known, but the decision by the Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\" to report it shortly after her death was controversial in Israel.\nAfter Haza's death was announced, Israeli radio stations played non-stop retrospectives of her music. Then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak praised her work as a cultural emissary, commenting that she also represented the Israeli success story \u2014 \"Ofra emerged from the Hatikvah slums to reach the peak of Israeli culture. She has left a mark on us all.\"\nHaza's death from an AIDS-related illness added another layer to the public mourning, bringing the disease into the spotlight. The revelation of Haza's illness caused much surprise among fans, along with debate about whether the media invaded her privacy by reporting it; Haza had hidden the disease even from the Tel Aviv hospital workers who first treated her in an emergency room two weeks prior. The managing director of \"Haaretz\", Yoel Esteron, commented at the time: { The Health Minister spokesman Yoram Malca said: {\nThere was also speculation about how she had acquired the virus. Immediately after her death, the media placed blame on her husband, Tel Aviv businessman Doron Ashkenazi, for infecting her with the disease. Haza's manager Bezalel Aloni supported this belief, writing in his book that Haza acquired AIDS through sex with her husband. Later, it was revealed that her husband believed Haza became infected because of a blood transfusion she received in a Turkish hospital following a miscarriage. Ashkenazi himself died of a drug overdose roughly one year later on 7 April 2001, leaving a daughter from a prior marriage and a 14-year-old adopted son, Shai Ashkenazi.\nDoctors who treated AIDS patients were reportedly \"horrified\" after learning of Haza's decision to hide her illness. Zvi Bentwich, head of the AIDS Center at the Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot, commented: {\nHaza is buried in the Artists section of Yarkon Cemetery in Petah Tikva.\nLegacy.\nBezalel Aloni, Haza's manager and producer of 28 years, published a book \"Michtavim L'Ofra\" (Letters to Ofra) in 2007. The book is partly Aloni's autobiography and partly a biography of Haza, and includes letters written by Aloni.\nOn 22 March 2007, on the seventh anniversary of her death, the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality and the Tel Aviv Development Fund renamed part of the public park in the Hatikva Quarter \"Gan Ofra\" (Ofra's Park) in her honor. The park is placed at the end of Bo'az street, in which Haza's childhood home stood. The park features a children's playground, symbolizing her love for children and the old quarter she grew up in and always came back to.\nOn 19 November 2014, Google celebrated her 57th birthday with a Google Doodle. Pakistani blogger Sarmad Iqbal who is known for his pro-peace stance, praised Ofra Haza enthusiastically in his blog post titled \"A Pakistani's love letter to Israeli pop music and cinema\" for \"The Times of Israel\" in 2017. Sarmad wrote \"She was more than just a cultural icon of Israel as she also tried to bridge the wide gap between Israel and her Arab neighbors as her songs spread to a wider Middle-Eastern audience defying all the barriers to peace and friendship between Arabs and Israel.\"\nIn the 2005 video game \"\", her track \"Im Nin'Alu\" is featured in a fictional radio station which plays Middle Eastern and Indian music.\nTributes\nDocumentaries\nDiscography.\nAlbums.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLive albums\nCompilations\nSoundtracks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66971", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66971", "title": "Shepton Mallet", "text": "Town in Somerset, England\nShepton Mallet is a market town and civil parish in Somerset, England, some southwest of Bath, south of Bristol and east of Wells. It had an estimated population of 10,810 in 2019. Mendip District Council was based there. The Mendip Hills lie to the north and the River Sheppey runs through the town, as does the route of the Fosse Way, the main Roman road between north-east and south-west England. There is evidence of Roman settlement. Its listed buildings include a medieval parish church. Shepton Mallet Prison was England's oldest, but closed in March 2013. The medieval wool trade gave way to trades such as brewing in the 18th century. It remains noted for cider production. It is the closest town to the Glastonbury Festival and nearby the Royal Bath and West of England Society showground.\nHistory.\nToponymy.\nThe name Shepton derives from the Old English \"scoep\" and \"tun\", meaning \"sheep farm\"; the Domesday Book of 1086 records a settlement known as \"Sceaptun\" in the hundred of Whitstone. The current spelling is recorded at least as far back as 1496, in a letter from Henry VII. The second part of the name derives from that of the Norman family of Malet. Gilbert Malet, son of William Malet, Honour of Eye, held a lease from Glastonbury Abbey around 1100. The second letter \"l\" appears to have been added to the spelling in the 16th century.\nPrehistoric settlement.\nArchaeological investigations have found evidence of prehistoric activity in the Shepton Mallet area, with large amounts of Neolithic flint and some pottery fragments of the late Neolithic period. Two barrows on Barren Down, to the north of the town centre, contained cremation burials from the Bronze Age; another Bronze Age burial site contained a skeleton and some pottery. The remains of Iron Age roundhouses and artefacts such as quernstones and beads were found at Cannard's Grave, as was a probable Iron Age farming settlement at Field Farm. Nearby countryside provides evidence of Iron Age cave dwellings in Ham Woods to the north-west, and several burial mounds at Beacon Hill, a short distance to the north.\nRoman occupation.\nShepton Mallet is about halfway between the Roman towns of Bath and Ilchester on the Fosse Way. Although there are no visible remains apart from the line of the Roman road, there is archaeological evidence for early military and later civilian settlement lasting into the 5th century. Domed pottery kilns, with pottery still present, were identified on the site of the Anglo-Bavarian Brewery in the mid-19th century, suggesting military activity in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Several hoards of Roman coins ranging from the 1st to 4th centuries have been found and more than 300 fibula brooches, potsherds and other artefacts. A few isolated burials near the Fosse Way were found in the 19th century.\nA lead coffin in a rock-cut grave was discovered at a site by the Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery and impending commercial development of the site by the landowner, Showerings, led archaeologists to excavate more extensively in the 1990s. The grave belonged to a cemetery containing 17 burials aligned roughly east and west, indicating probable Christian beliefs. Two smaller cemeteries had graves aligned north\u2013south, possibly signifying pagan religious practices. One burial was in a substantial stone coffin positioned beneath a mausoleum, whose foundations remained.\nOne find in the Fosse Way burials was a \"Chi-Rho\" amulet, thought then to be from the 5th century and considered among the earliest clear evidence of Christianity in England. A copy was presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, by the churches of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. The amulet is in the Museum of Somerset, but analysis by Liverpool University in 2008 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy showed it was a fake: its silver content dates from the 19th century or later.\nExcavations in the 1990s confirmed the presence of a linear settlement along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, with cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, workshop areas and a stone-lined well. The many artefacts found included local and imported pottery such as Samian ware, items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear scoops and nail cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines in the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman Empire were also found. The finds indicate occupation from the late 1st or early 2nd centuries to the late 4th or early 5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement was probably not a town.\nSaxon and Norman periods.\nEvidence of Saxon settlement includes some Saxon stonework in the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. A charter of King Ine of Wessex, from 706, witnessed by nine bishops including the Archbishop of Canterbury, records that the area where Shepton Mallet now stands was passed to Abbot Berwald of Glastonbury Abbey. According to some legends Indract of Glastonbury was buried in Shepton. The town was in the Whitstone Hundred; the hundred courts were held at Cannard's Grave, just south of the town.\nThe Exeter Domesday Book records that on the death of Edward the Confessor in 1066, the site was held (probably by lease from the Abbey) by one Uluert, and then by Roger de Corcella at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086. When Corcella died, sometime before or around 1100, the land passed to the Malets, a Norman family whose name was added to that of the settlement (and another of their holdings, Curi \u2013 now Curry Mallet).\nMiddle Ages.\nThe Malets retained the estate until the reign of King John, when on the death of William Malet (fl. 1192\u20131215) and the payment by his sons-in-law of a fine of 2000 marks for participating in a rebellion against the king) it passed through his daughter Mabel to her husband Hugh de Vivonne. Some generations later, the part of the estate containing Shepton Mallet was sold to a relative, Sir Thomas Gournay. His son, also Thomas, took part in the murder of Edward II. His estates were confiscated by Edward III in 1337, but returned some years later. When Mathew de Gournay died childless in 1406, the estate reverted to the Crown and was then granted to Sir John de Tiptoft. It was again confiscated from his son by Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses, when the family sided with Edward IV, but restored to Sir John's grandson, Edward Tiptoft, when Edward IV regained the throne. He died without issue, and there followed a succession of grants and reversions until Glastonbury Abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII, and its lands, including Shepton Mallet, were granted to the Duchy of Cornwall in 1536.\nCharters for markets and fairs were granted in 1235, but revoked in 1260 and 1318 after objections by the Bishop of Wells to the competition it represented to the market in his city. This shows that the town was developing and prospering in the 13th and early 14th centuries. The Black Death struck in 1348, reducing the population to about 300. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the population and economy were boosted by craftsmen and merchants arriving from France and the Low Countries, who were escaping wars and religious persecution. They introduced cloth-making, which together with the local wool trade, became a major industry in Shepton and other Somerset and Wiltshire towns. Wool became such a source of riches that when Henry VII needed money to fight the Scots in 1496, he called on the wool merchants of Shepton to contribute \u00a310.\nStuart era.\nIn the English Civil War, the town supported the Parliament side, although Shepton appears largely to have escaped conflict apart from a bloodless confrontation in the market place on 1 August 1642 between Royalists under Sir Ralph Hopton and Parliament led by Colonel William Strode. In 1645 Sir Thomas Fairfax led the New Model Army through the town on the way to capturing Bristol, and in 1646 the church organ was apparently destroyed by Cromwellian soldiers.\nIn 1675, a House of Correction was set up in Shepton Mallet.\nDuring the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, the Duke of Monmouth was welcomed when he passed through Shepton Mallet to stay at Longbridge House in Cowl Street on the night of 23 June, with his men quartered around the town, before setting out for Bristol next day. Many Shepton men joined the cause, but Monmouth failed to take Bath or Bristol and had to return to Shepton on 30 June. After the Battle of Sedgemoor, the Duke fled, spent the night of 6 July at Downside, a mile north of Shepton, and was captured two days later. After the Bloody Assizes, twelve local supporters of Monmouth were hanged and quartered in the market place.\nIn 1699 Edward Strode built almshouses, close to the rectory that his family had built, to house the town's grammar school, which lasted until 1900.\n18th\u201320th centuries.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries thriving wool and cloth industries were powered by the waters of the River Sheppey. There were said to be 50 mills in and around the town in the early 18th century, and a number of fine clothiers' houses survive, particularly in Bowlish, a hamlet on the western edge of Shepton Mallet. Although these industries still employed some 4,000 towards the end of the century, they were beginning to decline. Discontent at mechanisation of the mills resulted in the deaths of two men in a riot in the town in 1775. This apparently discouraged mill-owners from modernising further. The decision resulted in Shepton's cloth trade losing out to the steam-powered mills in the north of England in the early 19th century. The manufacture of silk and crepe revived the town's fortunes somewhat, and Shepton's mills made the silk used in Queen Victoria's wedding dress. However, these industries also died out eventually.\nWhile wool, cloth and silk declined, other industries grew. In the 19th and 20th centuries brewing became one of the major industries. The Anglo-Bavarian Brewery, built in 1864 and still a local landmark, was the first in England to brew lager. At its height, it was exporting 1.8 million bottles a year to Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, South America and the West Indies. It closed in 1921. However the town, home of Babycham, is still a centre for cider production.\nFor some of the Second World War, Shepton Mallet Prison was used to store national records from the Public Record Office, including the Magna Carta, the Domesday Book, the logbooks of , dispatches from the Battle of Waterloo and the \"scrap of paper\" signed by Hitler and British prime minister Neville Chamberlain at the Munich Conference of September 1938. The prison also became a US Army detention facility. Between 1943 and 1945, 18 US servicemen were executed within the prison walls, after convictions for murder, rape or both.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s many historic buildings were demolished to build Hillmead council estate in the north of the town and a retail development and theatre in the market place.\nThe population of Shepton Mallet was fairly stable through the 19th century and the first part of the 20th: 5,104 in 1801 and 5,117 in 1851, then 5,446 by 1901, falling back to 5,260 in 1951. By 2001, it had grown again to 8,981.\nGovernance.\nShepton Mallet is in the unitary authority area of Somerset Council. Prior to April 2023, it was the principal town in the Mendip local government district, which governed together with Somerset County Council. In the 80 years up to 1974, it lay in Shepton Mallet Urban District. \nThe civil parish of Shepton Mallet has adopted the style of a town. It has a town council of 16 members, split equally between the two wards: Shepton East and Shepton West. The most recent elections, in May 2015, left the council made up of five Conservatives, five Liberal Democrats, three Labour Party members and three independents.\nShepton Mallet falls within the Wells and Mendip Hills parliamentary constituency. Since the 2024 general election the MP has been Tessa Munt of the Liberal Democrats.\nBefore Brexit, the town was in the South West England European Parliamentary constituency, electing six MEPs.\nServices.\nThere are two medical surgeries in Shepton Mallet, a National Health Service community hospital formerly operated by Somerset Primary Care Trust, and an independent sector treatment centre, which carries out certain surgical procedures. The nearest general hospital is the Royal United Hospital in Bath.\nDevon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service has retained its fire station adjacent to the ambulance station of South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust.\nAvon and Somerset Constabulary closed the town police station in 2014, but reopened it in 2020, next to the Haskins retail park. The town belongs to Somerset East policing district.\nGeography.\nShepton Mallet lies in the southern foothills of the Mendip Hills. The area rests geologically on Forest Marble, Blue Lias and Oolitic limestone.\nNearby cave systems.\nTo the north of the town are several caves of the Mendip Hills, including Thrupe Lane Swallet, a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and the St. Dunstan's Well Catchment, a cave system with a series of spectacularly-decorated caves totalling about of mapped passage. The caves at Fairy Cave Quarry were formed mainly by the erosive action of water beneath the water-table at considerable pressure (\"phreatic\" development), but as the water table has fallen, many now lie well above it and the system contains a variety of cave formations (stalagmites, stalactites and calcite curtains) which in extent and preservation are among the best in Britain. Shatter Cave and Withyhill Cave are generally seen to be among the finest decorated caves in Britain in terms of sheer abundance of pure white and translucent calcite deposits. Small numbers of greater horseshoe bat (\"Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\"), lesser horseshoe bat (\"R. hipposideros\") and Natterer's bat (\"Myotis nattereri\") hibernate in the cave system. An area of nationally rare species-rich, unimproved calcareous grassland of the Sheep's-fescue-Meadow Oat-grass type lies in a field to the east of Stoke Lane Quarry.\nCountryside.\nThe countryside around Shepton is mostly farmed, although there are nearby areas of woodland. About to the north-east is Beacon Hill Wood, owned by the Woodland Trust), at the junction of the Fosse Way and a Roman road topping the Mendip Hills, which contain a number of tumuli. To the north-west of the town are Ham Woods, within which are the Windsor Hill railway tunnels and a viaduct, \u2013 remnants of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The East Mendip Way long-distance path passes round the northern edge of Shepton Mallet and through Ham Woods.\nSouth-west of the town is the Friar's Oven SSSI, site of herb-rich calcareous grassland classified as the Upright Brome (\"Bromus erectus\") type, and north-east is the Windsor Hill Quarry geological SSSI and the Windsor Hill Marsh biological SSSI, a marshy silted pond with adjacent damp, slightly acidic grassland of interest for its diverse flora, largely due to varied habitats present within a small area. Two species present are rare in Somerset: Flat-sedge (\"Blysmus compressus\") and Slender Spike-rush (\"Eleocharis uniglumis\"). Other marshland plants include Purple Loosestrife, Yellow Flag (\"Iris pseudacorus\"), Hard Rush (\"Juncus inflexus\"), Soft Rush (\"J. effusus\"), Flowering Rush (\"Butomus umbellatus\"), Devil's-bit Scabious (\"Succisa pratensis\"), three species of Horsetail \"Equisetum\" and seven sedges \"Carex\" spp.\nRiver Sheppey.\nThe centre and older parts of Shepton Mallet are adjacent to the River Sheppey, in a valley about above sea level. The edges of the town lie about higher. The river has cut a narrow valley, and between Shepton Mallet and the village of Croscombe, to the west, it is bounded by steeply sloping fields and woodland. However, it flows through much of Shepton Mallet itself in underground culverts. It occasionally floods after heavy rain, as on 20 October 2006, and again on 29 May 2008, when the rainfall was too heavy for the culverts. Some houses round Leg Square, Lower Lane and Draycott Road were submerged to a depth of . A study by the Environment Agency identified that the current standard of flood protection in these parts of the town is insufficient, as it was of a 5\u201310-year event-standard, whereas current guidelines require protection of a 50\u2013200-year standard. In the summer of 2010, the Agency began constructing a flood alleviation scheme at a cost of about \u00a31.3 million.\nTown areas.\nShepton Mallet has distinct areas that originated as separate communities around the central point of the church and Market Place. The town centre consists of two streets: High Street, running south from the Market Place towards the Townsend Retail Park, and the pedestrianised Town Street running north to Waterloo Bridge. To the east, separated from the Market Place by the academy complex, is the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. Lower Lane, under Waterloo Bridge along the bottom of the river valley to the north of the town centre, is one of the few parts where the River Sheppey runs above ground. At the eastern end is Leg Square, surrounded by three large houses originally built by owners of some of the town's mills. Close by is Cornhill, on which the former prison stands.\nRoughly eastwards, Garston Street, also in the valley-bottom, consists of a row of weavers' and other artisans' cottages dating from the 17th century. The eastern end of the area, adjacent to Kilver Street, is now occupied by cider breweries. Across Kilver Street (the A37) is Kilver Court, which in the 20th century was a factory, headquarters of a brewing business, and then headquarters of a leather-goods manufacturer. Behind are Kilver Court Gardens, originally built by Showerings for the recreation of its staff and set against a backdrop of part of the Charlton Viaduct. These are now open to the public. On the eastern edge of the town is Charlton, which has former breweries and mills, now converted into a trading estate. Right on the edge of the town is Charlton House, a luxury hotel and spa.\nOn the south side of the town is a triangle of land bounded on the east by the A37, on the north by the former East Somerset Railway, and on the west by Cannard's Grave Road: Tadley Acres is a modern housing development built on land partly belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall. The development has been praised for its design quality and use of local, natural building materials. North of the former railway is Collett Park. Across Cannard's Grave Road from Tadley Acres is the Mid-Somerset Showground. Just to the south-west of the town centre, on a site which at the start of the 20th century had been the grounds of the former Summerleaze House and then a shoe factory, is the Townsend Retail Park, built in 2006\u20132007.\nWest Shepton, the south-west corner of town, contains the former Shepton Mallet Union Workhouse, a Grade II listed building of 1848. Later serving as the Norah Fry mental hospital, it is now a housing development. On the nearby western edge is a modern community hospital. Down the valley are the hamlets of Darshill, once the site of several mills, and Bowlish, which contains several grand clothiers' houses. The sloping fields by the river between Bowlish and the rest of Shepton are known as The Meadows. To their east is Hillmead, a council estate of the 1960s.\nClimate.\nLike much of South West England, Shepton Mallet has a temperate climate wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about with seasonal and diurnal variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts. January is coldest, with mean minimum between . July and August are warmest, with mean daily maxima around . In general December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. South-west England is favoured, particularly in summer, as the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards to the UK.\nCloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to tie in with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface-heating sometimes forms shower clouds and much of the annual precipitation falls as showers and thunderstorms at that time of year. Average rainfall is . About 8\u201315 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, June to August the lightest. The prevailing wind is from the south-west.\nDemography.\nIn the 2001 census the population was 8,981: 4,482 (49.9%) male and 4,499 (50.1%) female, with 1,976 (22%) aged 16 or below, 5,781 (64.4%) between 16 and 65, and 1,224 (13.6%) 65 or over.\nOf those aged 16\u201374, 4,200 (66%) were employed and only 224 (3.5%) unemployed, the rest being economically inactive. About 69% of the employed were in service industries, the rest in manufacturing, while 1,459 people had managerial or professional occupations, 522 were self-employed, and 1,888 worked in routine and semi-routine occupations. Some 3,714 dwellings were recorded, of which 2,621 (70.6%) were owner-occupied, 515 (13.9%) rented privately and 578 (15.6%) from social landlords; 3,688 (99.3%) heads of households were white.\nEconomy.\nIt is felt locally that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time. Some 350 manufacturing jobs were lost in the late 1990s and early 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that despite the loss in manufacturing, on which Shepton Mallet historically depended, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services have been created, so creating a more balanced economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in town than the economically active, giving a small influx.\nThe town centre has a high proportion of empty premises in Market Place and the adjacent north end of High Street, but the pedestrianised Town Street north of the Market Place to Waterloo Bridge has had marked investment in its heritage, bringing almost full occupancy. Since 2010 a quarter of independent shops is emerging in Town Street and Market Place. Since 2004 town-centre buildings have enjoyed a Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme and a Townscape Heritage Initiative, which makes grants for building repair, reinstatement of architectural features and enhancement of public spaces, and for community involvement, education and training. As the body that bid for the funding, Mendip District Council has run both schemes, but decisions lie with a steering group of the main stakeholders in the town.\nFor centuries there has been a Friday market in the Market Place, but it has declined for some years. In 2010 there was initial interest in attempts to revitalise it, but the stallholder numbers still fell. In recent months a number of suitcase traders have supported the market on a regular basis, which has attracted local interest.\nThe furniture store Haskins, which originated in the town in 1938, has its main showroom in the High Street Haskins Retail Centre. This includes other shops: a supermarket, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home, Pavers Shoes and an outlet clothing store. Retail jobs rose in 2006\u20132007 with a new shopping development, including a Tesco supermarket, a clothes store and other retailers on a site just south of the town centre, once held by a footwear factory. This attracted national media attention when protesters occupied the site to try to block the felling of an avenue dating back to the 19th century. It also split opinion in the town between those awaiting revitalisation and those who feared that local traders would fail to compete, bringing further High Street decline. Kilver Street has a Mulberry Factory Shop near the old Mulberry headquarters.\nShepton Mallet housed three major alcoholic drinks producers. Gaymer Cider Company closed in 2016. Constellation Brands, former owners of Gaymers, still produces Babycham. Family-run Brothers Drinks produces Brothers Cider and runs a contract bottling operation for other drinks firms. In October 2016 it was announced that the cider factory and bottling plant would be taken over by Brothers Drinks.\nAs well as an annual Royal Bath and West Show and other agricultural shows, the Royal Bath &amp; West Showground near Evercreech, south-east of the town, hosts events such as New Wine Christian festival and the National Adventure Sports Show, fairs and markets including Shepton Mallet International Antiques &amp; Collectors' Fair, and exhibitions and trade shows such as the National Amateur Gardening Show. Until 2017, Royal Bath and West Show hosted the Soul Survivor Christian festivals.\nTransport.\nThe A37 runs north\u2013south through Shepton Mallet along the line of the Fosse Way between the south of the town and Ilchester. The A361 from Frome and Trowbridge skirts the eastern edge of Shepton on its way to Glastonbury and Taunton. The A371 from Castle Cary passes through on its way west to Wells; for some distance, both routes follow the line of the A37. The nearest motorway connections are at junction 23 of the M5 motorway via the A361 and A39 and at junction 1 of the M32 via the A37.\nShepton Mallet had railway stations on two lines, both now closed. The first, called Shepton Mallet (High Street) in British railways days, was on the East Somerset Railway branch line from Witham and opened in 1859. It was extended to Wells in 1862 and later connected to the Cheddar Valley line branch of the Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway from Yatton to Wells via Cheddar. Through services between Yatton and Witham started in 1870. The line was absorbed into the Great Western Railway in the 1870s.\nA second, Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) railway station, opened in 1874 with the building of a Bath extension to the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway. This station was some distance east of the town centre and approached over Charlton Viaduct.\nBoth stations closed in the 1960s under the Beeching cuts. Shepton Mallet (High Street) lost its passenger services on the Yatton to Witham line in 1963, though part of the old East Somerset line remains open for freight and as a heritage railway. Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) was lost in 1966 with the closure of the Somerset &amp; Dorset line. Today the nearest Network Rail station is at Castle Cary, south of Shepton Mallet. The nearest station on the East Somerset Railway is Mendip Vale, a mile and a half away. Proposals endorsed by Mendip District Council exist to restore passenger services in Shepton Mallet, endorsed by Mendip District Council and Wells MP James Heappey.\nA bus service to the town is provided by First West of England. It is served by Berrys Coaches' daily Superfast service to and from London.\nLandmarks.\nThere are 218 listed buildings in Shepton Mallet, which receives funding to restore chosen town-centre buildings from English Heritage \"Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme\" and the National Lottery \"Townscape Heritage Initiative\". The town centre and Bowlish, Darshill and Charlton form a conservation area.\nThe hexagonal town-centre market cross, high, dates from a \u00a320 bequest by Walter Buckland in 1520 and was re-erected in 1841. Also in the market place is the Shambles, a medieval market stall, though much restored. Former HM Prison Shepton Mallet, sometimes known as Cornhill, was built in 1610. It lies close to the town centre, next to the parish church. On 10 January 2013, the government announced it was one of seven English prisons to close. On 24 December 2014 it was announced that it had been sold to a housing development company and public consultations were taking place on its future use.\nThere are several fine houses in older parts of the town around Lower Lane and Leg Square, and in outlying suburbs such as Charlton and Bowlish. Old Bowlish House, which now offers pre-arranged tours, dates from the earlier 17th century and was remodelled in about 1720 in Palladian style. Bowlish House, also in Palladian style, is now a hotel and restaurant. It was built in 1732 by a prosperous clothier. A spring is reported to rise in the cellar. Park House in Forum Lane dates from about 1700 and was altered about 1750. Others of the 19 Grade II listed buildings in Bowlish include Coombe House, built about 1820, 14, 15 and 16 Combe Lane, from about 1700 with 18th-century alterations, 26\u201329 Combe Lane, a former mill from about 1700, enlarged in 1850, and 30\u201331 Combe Lane, two weaver's cottages from about 1850. What is now a stained glass studio in Ham Lane was once a coal store for a stable belonging to a pub next door, the \"Butcher's Arms\", which ceased trading in 1860. The studio has provided stained glass, among others for the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Ghost, Midsomer Norton. Due to its historic nature, Bowlish is included in Shepton Mallet's conservation area, as well as being a site of archaeological interest.\nThe hamlet of Darshill on the road from Shepton Mallet to Wells has a silk-drying shed, known locally as a handle house, three walls of which are full of holes to allow the passage of air to aid in the process of drying teasle heads, which were used to raise the nap on cloth in the textile process.\nThe Anglo-Bavarian Brewery built in the 1860s still dominates the western parts of Shepton Mallet; nearby is a workhouse that became the Norah Fry Hospital, built in 1848 and has now converted into housing. Two disused railway viaducts are to be found: Charlton Viaduct with 27 arches, each spanning is on a curve of 30 chains radius falling at 1 in 55 from each end to the midpoint.\nThe market cross, the prison and prison wall, The Merchants House (8 Market Place), Anglo-Bavarian Brewery, Charlton Viaduct, the former St Michael's Roman Catholic Church at Townsend, and Bowlish House, Old Bowlish House and Park House are the town's nine Grade II* listed buildings.\nThe town centre was remodelled in the 1970s with moneys from the cider-making Showering family. Included was a new library (a copy of a demolished inn, \"The Bunch of Grapes\"), and a concrete entertainment complex, \"The Centre\", on the east side of the market square. A probably Roman Chi Rho amulet was found in Fosse Lane in the 1990s \u2013 the complex was renamed The Amulet after it, but is now The Academy.\nShepton has a sizeable park on a gift of land from the local landowner John Kyte Collett. As a boy he was thrown out of the grounds of local estates for trespass. In later life he purchased and gave land to the town to provide a public space; Collett Park, named in his honour, opened in 1906.\nReligious sites.\nThe Grade I listed parish church of St Peter and St Paul dates from the 12th century, but the current building is largely from the 15th century, with further rebuilding in 1836. The oak wagon roof, made up of 350 panels of different designs separated by 396 carved foliage bosses (supposedly every one different) and with 36 carved angels along the sides, was described by British historian Nikolaus Pevsner as \"the finest 15th-century carved oak wagon-roof in England\". It was restored at a cost of \u00a35,000, in 1953\u20131954.\nSt Michael's Roman Catholic Church of 1804 is now a warehouse. A Catholic church of 1966 in Park Road, is served by the Community of Our Lady of Glastonbury. There was also in 1810\u20131831 a convent of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary (Salesian Sisters) in Draycott Road. The building, now Sales House, became a Freemasons' lodge, and now holds social housing.\nThe Salvation Army has meeting rooms, while the Methodists, who previously worshipped in a chapel in Paul Street (built in 1810, now a community centre), have agreed to share the parish church with the Anglican congregation. The Baptist Chapel in Commercial Road was built in 1801 as a Congregational Church. There were previously other non-conformist chapels in Shepton, the most notable being the Unitarian Chapel on Cowl Street, built in 1692 and enlarged in 1758, but now a dwelling.\nEducation.\nThere is one primary school in the town and two infant schools. St Paul's Junior School, the primary school, in Paul Street was assessed as good in 2014. Shepton Mallet Infants School in Waterloo Road was rated good by Ofsted in 2018, as was Bowlish Primary School in 2012.\nEducation for 11\u201316 year olds is provided by Whitstone School, a Technology College. In 2013, it was assessed by Ofsted as good.\nFor post-16 education, students travel to colleges such as Frome Community College, Strode College in Street, and Norton Radstock College in Midsomer Norton.\nCulture.\nA town fete called Collett Day is held in June in Collett Park. A free one-day agricultural Mid-Somerset Show is held in fields on the edge of Shepton Mallet in August.\nThe Glastonbury Festival, Europe's largest music festival, is held slightly west of the village of Pilton, some south-west of Shepton. The Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music 1970 was held at Shepton Mallet. The town hosts an annual Shepton Mallet Digital Arts Festival founded in 2009.\nThe town is holds a carnival featuring illuminated carts and masqueraders in November. It is the 5th Carnival in the West Country Carnival Circuit.\nIn 2007, \"The Amulet\" complex in the town centre became a base for the Bristol Academy of Performing Arts (BAPA) and was renamed \"The Academy\". In 2009, BAPA went into administration and was briefly replaced by the Musical Theatre School, before that also failed. The complex's auditorium has the only suspended seating system in the United Kingdom.\nThe town's weekly newspaper, part of the Mid Somerset Series, is the \"Shepton Mallet Journal\". Events are also covered by the \"Shepton Gazette\", \"Fosse Way Magazine\" and \"Mendip Times\".\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.\nLocal radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West and Radio Shepton, a community-based station that broadcasts online.\nIn 2007, Shepton Mallet came to international attention when Westcountry Farmhouse Cheesemakers broadcast the maturation of a round of Cheddar cheese called Wedginald. The event attracted over 1.5 million viewers.\nIn the summer of 2010, the television production company Wall to Wall filmed a series for BBC One in the town centre, broadcast from 2 November 2010. Called \"Turn Back Time \u2013 The High Street\", it features several families running traditional bakers, butchers, grocers, dressmakers and a tea room, as they would have been in Victorian and Edwardian times, in World War II, and in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThere was a museum in the town, started around 1903. In 1933 it was based at the town council offices.\nSport and leisure.\nShepton Mallet has a Non-League football club, Shepton Mallet F.C., which plays at the Playing Fields. It also has a hockey club, which play at the Leisure Centre.\nThe bowling green of the lawn bowls club is found in Frithfield Walk. The club plays in the Wessex Mixed Friendly League, the Mid Somerset Men's League and the Mid Somerset Mixed League. The ladies play in the Wild League. Shepton Mallet is also the home of a park-run, a free 5km event held weekly at 9:00 am on Saturdays in the towns Collett Park.\nTwin towns.\nShepton Mallet is twinned with Misburg in Germany, Bolln\u00e4s in G\u00e4vleborg County, Sweden, and Oissel sur Seine in Haute-Normandie, France.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With roots in pioneering hockey coverage on private radio stations as early as 1923, it gained its current name as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) formed in 1936, and by that time had solidified its focus on the National Hockey League (NHL). Transitioning to television in 1952, the program became a Canadian Saturday night cultural fixture and was an exclusive mainstay of CBC Sports through the 2013\u201314 NHL season. The program continued to be broadcast on CBC Television and expanded to several other outlets in a cross-licensing arrangement following Rogers Media's acquisition of exclusive NHL television rights in Canada beginning in 2014\u201315; the CBC maintains ownership of the Hockey Night in Canada brand itself.\nSaturday NHL broadcasts began in 1931 on the CNR Radio network, and debuted on television in 1952. Initially games were aired once a week, but doubleheader games had debuted in 1995 at 7:30 pm and 10:30 pm (ET) start times. Since 1998, the games begin at 7:00 pm and 10:00 pm (ET). The broadcast features various segments during the intermissions and between games, as well as pre-game and post-game coverage of games that day, and player interviews. It also shows the hosts' opinions on news and issues occurring in the league.\nAhead of the 2014\u201315 season, Rogers Media had secured exclusive national multimedia rights to NHL games and would sub-license Saturday night and playoff games to the CBC. In addition, the \"HNiC\" brand would be licensed to Rogers for Sportsnet-produced Saturday NHL broadcasts airing on CBC Television, as well as the Rogers-owned Citytv and Sportsnet outlets. This sub-license agreement runs through the end of the Rogers deal with the NHL.\nHistory.\nRadio.\nHockey broadcasting originated with play-by-play radio broadcasts from Toronto's Arena Gardens, which began on February 8, 1923, on Toronto station CFCA when Norman Albert announced the third period of play of an intermediate men's Ontario Hockey Association game. Foster Hewitt took over announcing duties within a month, and after several years of sporadic coverage that began to include National Hockey League games, the broadcasts went national in 1931 as the \"General Motors Hockey Broadcast\". The program began broadcasting Saturday-night Toronto Maple Leafs games on November 12, 1931, over the Canadian National Railway radio network, of which CFCA was an affiliate. The more-powerful CFRB replaced CFCA as the program's Toronto flagship station in 1932. The show was sponsored by General Motors Products of Canada and produced by MacLaren Advertising, which had acquired exclusive radio-broadcasting rights for Maple Leaf Gardens from Conn Smythe in 1931 and produced the TV broadcast that became \"Hockey Night in Canada\" from 1952 until 1988.\nThe Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) broadcast Montreal Canadiens and Maroons games on its Quebec stations in 1933. Imperial Oil took over sponsorship from General Motors the following year, and the broadcast became known as the \"Imperial Esso Hockey Broadcast\". The broadcasts began at 9\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time, around the start of the second period of play. The games began to be broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the CRBC's successor, in 1936. The program acquired what would become its permanent title\u2014\"Hockey Night in Canada\"\u2014around that time, which was coined by Foster Hewitt. It featured the Maple Leafs and was hosted by Gordon Calder, with play-by-play announcer Hewitt and colour commentary by Percy Lesueur, in much of Ontario and points west. Montreal Maroons broadcasts were hosted by Doug Smith and Elmer Ferguson in English, and Ren\u00e9 Lecavalier called Montreal Canadiens games in French. After the Maroons folded in 1938, Smith and Ferguson hosted Canadiens games in English. The popularity of the radio show (and Hewitt) across Canada made it an obvious choice for early Canadian network-television programming.\nAlthough it was never carried on a U.S. radio station, \"HNIC\" became popular with listeners in the northern United States; if a U.S.-based team (in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, or New York City) was playing in Toronto on a Saturday night, thousands of fans in the American city whose team faced the Leafs would listen to the CBC broadcast via skywave (usually via 50,000-watt flagships CBL or CBM); a game often attracted more listeners to \"HNIC\" than local stations did.\nCBC Radio aired Saturday-night \"HNIC\" broadcasts through 1965, followed by \"Sunday Night NHL Hockey\" through 1976 (when the program moved to national television). Toronto's CFRB (originally a CNR Radio affiliate) took over the broadcast from CFCA in 1932, and continued to broadcast Maple Leaf games for many years with CBC Radio's Toronto station CBL.\nTelevision.\n\"Hockey Night in Canada\" began airing on Saturday nights on CBC Television in 1952. According to the CBC, instant replay made its world debut on a 1955 \"HNIC\" broadcast; CBC director George Retzlaff made a kinescope of a goal, and replayed it for the television audience seconds later.\nRegular-season games were not broadcast in their entirety until 1968, and only one game was televised each Saturday night until the 1990s. From 1952 to 1964, the \"HNIC\" telecast followed the lead of the radio broadcast by beginning at 9\u00a0p.m. ET; games were typically joined in progress shortly before (or during) the second period. Its start time was moved up to 8:30\u00a0p.m. ET at the beginning of the 1963\u201364 season, allowing games to be joined in progress late in the first period. In the fall of 1968, regular-season games were shown in their entirety and the program began at 8\u00a0p.m. Although a handful of games were broadcast in colour during the 1966\u201367 regular season, all \"HNIC\" games began colour broadcasting during the 1967 Stanley Cup playoffs. From 1965 through 1975, \"HNIC\" also produced and broadcast a Wednesday-night game on CTV (the CBC's privately owned competitor); the midweek games began to be broadcast by local stations during the 1975\u201376 NHL season.\nThe Vancouver Canucks joined the NHL in 1970\u201371, increasing the number of \"HNIC\" venues from two to three. During the 1979\u201380 and 1980\u201381 seasons, four more Canadian teams (the Edmonton Oilers, Quebec Nordiques, Winnipeg Jets, and Calgary Flames) joined the NHL or relocated from the United States. The Oilers and Flames were featured frequently, since the teams were playoff contenders during the 1980s. The Nordiques, owned by Carling O'Keefe (a rival of \"HNIC\" sponsor Molson) with a small Anglophone fan base, were never broadcast from Quebec City during the regular season.\nThe CBC announced before the preliminary round of the 1976 playoffs that they would not televise any preliminary-round games, and the rights were sold back to the individual Canadian teams. Since Montreal earned a bye into the quarterfinals, this impacted Toronto and Vancouver's television coverage. While CHCH and CITY televised all three games of the Toronto-Pittsburgh series (with Bill Hewitt and Brian McFarlane), CHAN picked up the Vancouver-New York Islanders series. Game 1 of the Philadelphia-Toronto playoff series was televised locally to Southern Ontario by CHCH. Game 1 of the 1977 Pittsburgh-Toronto playoff series was seen regionally in southern Ontario on Hamilton's CHCH.\nDuring the 1978 playoffs, the NHL Network began simulcasting many games with \"Hockey Night in Canada\". Dan Kelly, the NHL Network's lead play-by-play announcer, covered play-by-play with \"HNIC\"'s colour commentators; in Game 7 of the quarterfinal series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Islanders on April 29, 1978, Kelly teamed up with Brian McFarlane. The 1978 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins and the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers were also simulcast.\n1980s and 1990s.\nOn April 9, 1980, the CBC carried the ACTRA Awards ceremony. Game 2 of the Hartford\u2013Montreal playoff series was televised in French and the Edmonton-Philadelphia and Toronto-Minnesota games were shown only on local stations CITV in Edmonton and CHCH in Hamilton, respectively. The Vancouver-Buffalo game was televised by the CBC regionally in British Columbia, since the ACTRA Awards show was tape-delayed into prime time on the west coast.\nExcept for the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals, the CBC's only other nationally televised postseason games that year were the April 23 Boston-Quebec game (Game 6), the April 25 Quebec-Boston game (Game 7), and the May 6 Vancouver-Chicago game (Game 5). All the other games were seen regionally.\nCTV had the national rights for the 1986 Calgary-St. Louis playoff series, except in the Calgary market (in which the CBC and Molson retained exclusive rights). CTV was unable to televise Games 2 and 3 of this series due to prior commitments. The CBC was allowed to televise Games 2 and 3 to Alberta and British Columbia, but not nationally.\nOn April 18, 1988 (during Game 1 of the Montreal\u2013Boston playoff series) at 8:08\u00a0p.m. local time, Quebec experienced a power outage. Darkness enveloped Montreal and the Forum; the Forum's reserve generators could only illuminate the rink enough to keep the game moving, and the CBC abandoned its coverage after the first period. Chris Cuthbert was assigned by the CBC to report and provide updates on Game 1 of the Washington-New Jersey playoff series. When Quebec blacked out, the CBC tasked Cuthbert with working the rest of the game. In Boston, WSBK-TV lost the picture but continued audio of the game with Fred Cusick and Derek Sanderson by telephone. Canwest/Global aired the 1988 Calgary-Edmonton playoff series nationally, except for the Edmonton and Calgary markets (where the CBC retained exclusive rights).\nAfter Wayne Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, the network began showing occasional double-headers when Canadian teams visited Los Angeles to showcase the sport's most popular player. The games were often joined in progress, since the start time for \"HNIC\" was still 8\u00a0p.m. ET, while Gretzky's Kings home games began at 7:30\u00a0p.m. Pacific (10:30\u00a0p.m. ET). Weekly double-headers became permanent during the 1994\u201395 season, with games starting at 7:30\u00a0p.m. ET (4:30 p.m. PT) and 7:30\u00a0p.m. PT (10:30 p.m. ET), respectively. The start times were moved up to 7\u00a0p.m. ET (4 p.m. ET) and PT (10 p.m. ET) in 1998, with a 30-minute pre-game show airing at 6:30\u00a0p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. PT).\nPaul Graham was the senior producer of \"Hockey Night in Canada\" from 1998 until 2009.\n2000\u20132014.\nOlympic women's ice hockey champion Cassie Campbell joined \"Hockey Night in Canada\" in 2006 as a rink-side reporter, becoming (on October 14, 2006) the first female colour commentator on an \"HNIC\" broadcast. Campbell substituted when Harry Neale was snowed in at his home in Buffalo. (Helen Hutchinson was the first woman to appear on \"HNIC\" telecasts in 1974, when she conducted between-period interviews on the Wednesday night CTV telecasts.)\nTrevor Pilling became \"HNIC\" executive producer on July 23, 2010, replacing Sherali Najak. In September 2012, Steve Sloan and Joel Darling became the show's executive producers when Pilling became the head of CBC Sports programming.\nThe CBC's deal with the NHL ran through the 2013\u201314 season, and was replaced in 2014\u201315 by a sublicensing deal with Rogers Communications. The deal included over-the-air broadcasts of games on the CBC Television network and digital broadcasts on CBCSports.ca. It was reached after controversy during the 2006\u201307 NHL season, when private broadcaster CTVglobemedia tried to acquire exclusive Canadian distribution rights to the NHL for its own networks (including broadcast network CTV and cable channels TSN and RDS).\nThe CBC also produced \"Hockey Night in Canada Radio\", a daily radio program which premiered on October 1, 2007, on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 122 (also known as Sports Play-by-Play 1). Although the broadcaster called \"HNIC Radio\" a return \"back to the radio airwaves\" for \"HNIC\", \"HNIC Radio\" was an NHL-oriented talk show with appearances by \"HNIC\" hosts and commentators; it did not cover games. After the merger of Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, the show moved to NHL Network Radio (Sirius channel 207 and XM channel 211). Rogers did not take over national radio rights to the NHL until the 2015\u201316 season, but the CBC ended production of \"HNIC Radio\" for the 2014\u201315 season due to high production costs and conflicts with Rogers.\n2014: Rogers takeover.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe close tonight with what I said back in '87, [my] first time around at the helm of this broadcast, \"Here's to an endless summer, and here's to an early fall\u00a0...\" We will leave you congratulating the Los Angeles Kings with the music of Queen, and [we] bid you a good \"Hockey Night\", for now.\n\u2014Ron MacLean, closing the last CBC-produced \"Hockey Night in Canada\" broadcast (June 13, 2014)\nNegotiating a new contract with the CBC, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman reportedly recognized the broadcaster's financial difficulties and offered a smaller package which would have consisted of a national doubleheader on Saturday nights (as opposed to regional coverage of multiple games), reduced playoff coverage, and the loss of digital rights and the All-Star Game. Rights to the remaining properties not covered under the CBC contract would have been offered to other broadcasters. However, CBC Sports' staff (including executive director Jeffrey Orridge) continued to insist on exclusivity for every Saturday-night game involving Canadian teams. The CBC was unable to reach a deal; the league reportedly aimed for its next round of Canadian television contracts to have a total value of at least $3.2 billion. BCE (owners of Bell Media and previous cable rights-holder TSN) bid for sole national rights to the NHL, and attempted to contact the CBC about a partnership; the CBC Sports staff did not respond. Rogers Communications also made a bid of its own.\nOn November 26, 2013, the NHL announced a 12-year deal with Rogers for exclusive Canadian television and digital media rights to all NHL broadcasts beginning with the 2014\u201315 season; the deal was valued at $5.2 billion, twice as much as what NBC paid for its 2011 long-term contract with the league. The CBC sub-licensed a package of games from Rogers, allowing the network to continue airing \"Hockey Night in Canada\" for at least the first four seasons of the agreement (2014\u201315 through 2017\u201318). The last CBC-produced \"Hockey Night\" broadcast aired on June 13, 2014, when the Los Angeles Kings clinched the Stanley Cup in a four-games-to-one final series over the New York Rangers, ending with a montage set to Queen's \"The Show Must Go On\" which included season and playoff highlights interspersed with images and sounds from the CBC's six decades of NHL coverage.\nThe new season had a significant change in format for \"Hockey Night\", with games no longer split by region. The CBC was joined by Rogers' over-the-air Citytv network, the Sportsnet family of specialty channels and (initially) FX Canada, who aired other games nationally with the CBC and shared the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" brand. Decisions on network assignments for the games were made on a week-by-week basis, ensuring that viewers have live on-air access to every \"Hockey Night\" game. The CBC continued to cover the NHL All-Star Game, Stanley Cup playoffs and Stanley Cup Finals, with the latter simulcast on a Rogers network if needed. The NHL Winter Classic aired in 2015 on the CBC, moving to Sportsnet the following year.\nThe CBC did not pay any rights fees to Rogers or the NHL, but Rogers assumed responsibility for production and advertising sales. Promotions for CBC programs are included on CBC simulcasts; Rogers paid the corporation for CBC production staff and rent for offices and Studio 41 of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre for \"Hockey Night\" and Sportsnet coverage. \"Hockey Night in Canada\" was a financial boon for CBC Television, which received half of its total estimated advertising revenue from the broadcasts. To assign responsibility for televised content, compliance with regulatory guidelines and advertising to Rogers, the \"HNIC\" broadcasts are broadcast on a part-time television network owned by Rogers' Sportsnet subsidiary and affiliated with the CBC's English-language television stations (although CBC Television branding and continuity is still used on air). A licence for the arrangement was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in April 2015.\nThe loss of NHL rights accompanied other reductions in CBC funding and revenue, leading the corporation to cut its budget, staff, and programming. In April 2014, the CBC decided not to compete for NHL or other professional-sports broadcast rights. Among staff members laid off were the advertising sales staff who handled \"Hockey Night\". In an internal staff notification of the Rogers deal, CBC president Hubert T. Lacroix wrote that the arrangement with Rogers \"may not be the ideal scenario\" for the CBC but the network would have suffered a major blow to its prestige if it was excluded from NHL broadcasts. Lacroix said that the deal \"is the right outcome for Canadian hockey fans\", allowing \"Hockey Night in Canada\" to remain on the CBC for a wider audience at a low cost before the 2015 Pan-American Games and 2016 Summer Olympics (whose broadcast rights were owned by the broadcaster). CBC staff called the agreement as a \"structured exit\" from NHL coverage if Rogers did not extend it.\nRogers' \"Hockey Night\" was initially guided by Scott Moore, appointed Rogers Media president of Sportsnet and NHL properties in January 2014; Moore, with Rogers Media since 2010, was a former CBC Sports president. Rogers reviewed on-air content and production of games and ancillary content, including announcers and other personnel. \"Hockey Night\"'s new look was revealed on March 10, 2014, when CBC personality George Stroumboulopoulos became studio host of \"Hockey Night\" and Citytv's Sunday night \"Hometown Hockey\" package with Sportsnet's Daren Millard and Jeff Marek. Stroumboulopoulos, an alumnus of Toronto sports radio station CJCL and host of a CBC talk show, was seen as an effort by Rogers to expand \"Hockey Night\"'s appeal to a younger demographic.\nAlthough Ron MacLean ceded hosting \"Hockey Night\" to Stroumboulopoulos, he remained with Don Cherry on the \"Coach's Corner\" segment and was the on-location host of Sportsnet's \"Hometown Hockey\" games. Cherry, called \"iconic\" by Rogers president Keith Pelley, remained under contract to the CBC until he was released on November 11, 2019. Several other CBC \"Hockey Night\" veterans continued in roles with \"HNIC\" and Rogers' NHL coverage, including game announcers Jim Hughson (who retired in 2021) and Bob Cole (who retired in 2019); reporters Elliotte Friedman, Scott Oake, and Cassie Campbell-Pascall; and analysts Glenn Healy, Kelly Hrudey, Craig Simpson, Garry Galley, and P. J. Stock. New hires included game announcers Dave Randorf and Paul Romanuk.\nThe CBC-Rogers agreement reduced the CBC's advertising revenue, which fell by 37 percent in the last quarter of 2014 from the previous year. Industry analysts reported that, despite the agreement's increased promotion of other CBC programming, the corporation might lose more advertising revenue during the Stanley Cup playoffs.\n2016\u2013present.\nIn June 2016, Rogers announced that George Stroumboulopoulos was leaving Sportsnet. Ron MacLean was reinstated as the studio host of \"Hockey Night\"'s early game, in addition to his on-location role on \"Hometown Hockey\". David Amber was the late-game studio host.\nBob Cole retired in April 2019, and Don Cherry was fired after a November 9 incident during his \"Coach's Corner\" for comments that suggested Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans but do not wear Remembrance poppies.\nOn June 5, 2020, Sportsnet announced that it had hired TSN commentator and former \"Hockey Night in Canada\" broadcaster Chris Cuthbert. Jim Hughson retired before the 2021\u201322 season. \"Hockey Night\" features, until 2019, included the \"Coach's Corner\" segment during the first intermission of the first game.\nCoverage overview.\nRegular season.\nPre-game show.\n\"Hockey Night in Canada\" typically begins at 6:30\u00a0p.m. Eastern time (a little more than 30 minutes before the first game's opening faceoff) with \"Hockey Central Saturday\", a pre-game show. Ron MacLean hosts \"Hockey Central Saturday\" with analysts Kelly Hrudey, Elliotte Friedman, Kevin Bieksa, and Jennifer Botterill.\nGame 1.\nThe first game of the Saturday night doubleheader typically originates in Eastern Canada, beginning at 7 p.m. ET (4 p.m. PT). Since 2021\u201322, Chris Cuthbert, Craig Simpson, and Kyle Bukauskas serve as the lead broadcast team, primarily calling the CBC Toronto Maple Leafs broadcast. Other Eastern Canada games aired on Citytv are called by the secondary team of John Bartlett, Garry Galley, and Shawn Mackenzie. When three or more early games involve Canadian teams, Sportsnet uses its regional announcers for those broadcasts. From 2008 to 2020, Jim Hughson was the lead play-by-play voice of \"Hockey Night in Canada\" until his retirement on September 21, 2021; Hughson only called national Vancouver Canucks home games during the previous season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the 2014\u201315 season, additional games involving Canadian teams were split to air regionally on CBC stations; Winnipeg Jets games were often seen in Central Canada, and Ottawa Senators games were seen in the Ottawa area and Eastern Canada.\nDuring the 2015\u201316 season, the second-most-important game (typically featuring either the Jets, the Senators or the Montreal Canadiens) was allocated to Citytv. Sportsnet also sometimes simulcast the CBC's or Citytv's featured games, and broadcasters (of teams) regionally contracted to Sportsnet as needed. Although second-tier games were shown on Citytv during the inaugural season, these games were later moved to Sportsnet (with Citytv sometimes airing all-U.S. games or simulcasting the CBC game) to encourage pay-television subscriptions.\nUntil the end of the first period on November 9, 2019, MacLean hosted \"Coach's Corner\"; the segment featured former NHL Coach of the Year Don Cherry. Cherry analyzed the first period(s) of the game(s) in progress, expressed his opinions about issues affecting the sport (or the league), and gave tips on various points of hockey; MacLean was Cherry's foil. \"Coach's Corner\" was followed by highlights of other evening games. MacLean also hosts \"Saturday Headlines\", the second-intermission segment, with Hrudey, Friedman, Bieska, and Botterill. The segment usually focuses on the previous week's NHL news, along with highlights and analysis of the games in progress.\nUntil November 9, 2019, after the \"three stars\" selection of the first game(s), and before the face-off of Game 2, MacLean and Cherry return to give updates on scores and highlights from around the league. The commentators for Game 2 preview the upcoming contest. Since then, the second-intermission crew return to give updates on scores and highlights from around the league.\nCherry's removal from \"Hockey Night in Canada\" and end of \"Coach's Corner\".\nOn the November 9, 2019 \"Coach's Corner\", Cherry suggested that Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans without wearing remembrance poppies: \"You people that come here\u00a0... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that! These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada! These guys paid the biggest price.\" The Royal Canadian Legion, Canada's poppy distributor, denounced Cherry's statement: \"Mr. Cherry's personal opinion was hurtful, divisive and in no way condoned by the Legion.\" Sportsnet apologized for his remarks, stating that they were discriminatory and offensive and \"do not represent our values and what we stand for as a network.\" His co-host, Ron MacLean, tweeted regret for giving a thumbs-up and for allowing Cherry to make the comments. The NHL released a statement on Cherry's comments: \"The comments made last night were offensive and contrary to the values we believe in.\" Cherry later told the \"Toronto Sun\" that he would not apologize: \"I have had my say.\"\nThe Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) said that its internal systems was overloaded by a high number of complaints. Two days later, on November 11, Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley announced that Cherry had been fired: \"Following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night's broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down.\" Cherry said to a \"Toronto Sun\" reporter, \"I know what I said and I meant it. Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honour our fallen soldiers\u00a0... I would have liked to continue doing 'Coach's Corner'. The problem is if I have to watch everything I say, it isn't 'Coach's Corner'\". He later said that if he had to do it again, he would have said \"everybody\". The following Saturday, MacLean reflected on the incident during \"Hockey Night in Canada\" (his first without Cherry) and announced the end of \"Coach's Corner\".\nGame 2.\nThe second game airs at 10 p.m. ET (7 p.m. PT, 8 p.m. MT) on the CBC and Sportsnet, originating from a Mountain or Pacific Time Zone city and usually featuring at least one of Western Canada's three teams: the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers or Vancouver Canucks. Regular-season games rarely last longer than three hours since the introduction of quicker faceoffs, and every double-header game is seen in its entirety.\nSince 2024\u201325, for Western Canada games, Jack Michaels, Louie DeBrusk, and Scott Oake are the lead broadcast team, while from 2016 to 2022, David Amber took over from MacLean as host. Like the early games, when at least two Western Canadian teams played, Sportsnet assigned regional announcers to call the games. From 2012\u201313 until early in the 2019\u201320 season, the first intermission of Game 2 contained a short analysis segment with Ron MacLean and Don Cherry followed by \"Inside the Game\" and \"Scoreboard Saturday\" with highlights of earlier games.\nGame 2 was followed on the CBC from 2000\u201301 to 2014\u201315 by \"After Hours\", a post-game show hosted by Oake and DeBrusk from the game's arena. The program featured a wrap-up of the night's games and a lengthy interview with (and viewer questions to) a player or coach, usually from one of the game's teams. \"After Hours\" was revived for 2016\u201317, and is shown on Sportsnet and the CBC.\nOnly on rare occasions has \"HNIC\" broadcast regular-season games involving two U.S.-based teams, and this has usually been due to exceptional circumstances. Special occasions have included Wayne Gretzky's final game in 1999 (which actually took place on a Sunday afternoon), the retirement of Steve Yzerman's jersey in 2007, Sidney Crosby's comeback game in Pittsburgh against the New York Islanders in 2011, and early editions of the league's major outdoor games (such as the Winter Classic). However, due to their decline in popularity, outdoor games are no longer shown on the CBC or branded \"HNIC\" unless a Canadian team is involved.\nPlayoffs.\nThe CBC provides extensive Stanley Cup playoff coverage every spring (focusing on Canadian teams), and has exclusive English-language rights to the Stanley Cup Finals. Its playoff coverage and rights to the Finals continue under the Rogers sublicensing agreement, with coverage shared with Sportsnet and all Canadian-based teams' series being shown on CBC. Due to rights agreements with Rogers, playoff games are not available to livestream on the CBC Gem or CBC Sports online platforms, even if the broadcast airs on CBC Television.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nIn 1972, \"Hockey Night in Canada\" moved playoff coverage from the CBC to CTV to avoid a lengthy NABET strike against the CBC. Bob Cole, Dan Kelly and Jim Robson shared the play-by-play for the CBC's 1980 coverage.\nIn 1986, the CBC televised games one and two of the Stanley Cup Finals in Montreal and Calgary; it televised games three, four and five nationally. When CTV televised games one and two, both games were blacked out in Montreal and Calgary.\nThe first game four (May 24) of the 1988 Stanley Cup Finals was hampered by fog before a power outage caused its cancellation with the Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins tied, 3\u20133. The CBC televised that game and the \"official\" fourth game (on May 26), which the Oilers won 6\u20133.\n\"Hockey Day in Canada\".\nSince 2000, the CBC has aired an annual \"Hockey Day in Canada\" to celebrate the game. The afternoon broadcast of hockey-related features leads up to a triple-header of NHL games with the seven Canadian teams: the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, and Winnipeg Jets. The 2008 edition featured four games which included two American teams (Detroit and Colorado) with the six Canadian teams, due to the NHL's schedule format. COVID-19 travel restrictions in 2021 led to the Edmonton Oilers missing out; seven teams (an odd number) were in the temporary North Division.\nThe broadcast includes live segments from smaller communities across the country, and features panel discussions on issues facing \"Canada's game\" at the amateur and professional levels. Usually telecast on a Saturday in mid-February, it was shown in early January due to the 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympics; the 2007 event was also held in January (January 13). The 2010 broadcast was on January 30 because of the February 2010 Winter Olympics, and the 2014 event was on January 18 due to the February 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\"Hockey Day in Canada\" has included world-record all-night pick-up games from Red Deer, Alberta (in 2001) and Windsor, Nova Scotia (2002). Viewers saw the games, without commentary, after the CBC ended regular programming for the night.\n\"HDIC\" continued under the Rogers agreement, with Scotiabank the sponsor. Since Sportsnet also holds national broadcast rights to the Canadian Hockey League, the 2015 edition included a prime-time Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) game between the hosting Halifax Mooseheads and the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles.\nBroadcast locations.\nWhen the 2005 edition was cancelled, TSN aired \"Hockey Lives Here: Canada's Game\". The telecast, based at the World Pond Hockey Championships in Plaster Rock, New Brunswick, featured NHL players playing an exhibition game to raise money for charities in Hamilton, Ontario.\nLockout programming.\nThe CBC replaced \"Hockey Night in Canada\" with \"Movie Night in Canada\", a block of Saturday-night movies hosted by Ron MacLean from junior-hockey venues, during the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout. A labour agreement was reached for the 2005\u201306 NHL season. \"Movie Night in Canada\" was revived in 2020, when league play was suspended by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 1994\u201395 and 2012\u201313 lockouts, the CBC aired classic \"Hockey Night in Canada\" games.\nOther languages.\n\"Hockey Night in Canada\" has occasionally aired alternate broadcasts of games in Canada's minority languages, primarily as part of \"Hockey Day in Canada\". \"HDIC\" simulcast a 2007 game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Vancouver Canucks on the TLN cable channel in Italian, with features and commentary by soccer host Alf De Blasis. It televised a 2010 game in the Inuit language Inuktitut, with commentary by CBC North's Charlie Panigoniak and Annie Ford, and games have been presented in Cree, Hindi, Punjabi, Tagalog, Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese.\nThe CBC broadcast one series per round during the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs in Mandarin, and added a regular-season schedule of games in Punjabi (Canada's third- and fifth-most-spoken languages, after English and French) on the network's website and some cable and satellite providers. It suspended the Punjabi broadcasts just before the 2010\u201311 season, but coverage was restored for the 2013 season with a new sponsorship deal. \nWith the transition to the Rogers contract, the Punjabi broadcasts moved to Rogers' multicultural Omni Television stations as \"Hockey Night in Canada: Punjabi Edition\".\nHarnarayan Singh's Punjabi call of the game-winning Pittsburgh Penguins goal by Nick Bonino during the first game of the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals went viral. Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan, who showed footage of the call to the team as part of a video recap before game two, called it \"entertaining\". Singh was invited to Pittsburgh to join the Penguins' Stanley Cup celebrations. On November 30, 2016, Singh began to also participate in English-language broadcasts for Sportsnet.\nIn 2022, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) began to air a package of selected \"Hockey Night in Canada\" games in Cree; the network had previously sub-licensed a package of games from the former \"Hometown Hockey\" package in 2019. In 2025, the channel also added Inuktitut broadcasts.\nFrench.\nThe CBC's French sister network, Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9 (then known as T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada), aired with Montreal Canadiens games on Saturday evenings. The network had also aired Quebec Nordiques and Ottawa Senators games occasionally during the regular season (if the Canadiens were not playing that night) and the Stanley Cup Finals.\nDuring the 2002\u201303 season, RDS secured exclusive French-language rights to the NHL. The deal, negotiated with the Canadiens rather than the NHL, was meant to ensure a consistent home for all Canadiens games. Radio-Canada did not bid for the rights, saying that it could not devote so much airtime to hockey. The announcement angered Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, who suggested that the network was violating its licence conditions by not airing . When Radio-Canada carried , play-by-play announcers included Ren\u00e9 Lecavalier, Richard Garneau, and Claude Quenneville.\nRadio-Canada reached an agreement to produce the Saturday-night games as , simulcast on Radio-Canada and RDS. The agreement was terminated after the 2004 playoffs, but the RDS-produced replacement () continued to be simulcast on Radio-Canada outside Quebec\u00a0\u2013 where RDS has limited distribution\u00a0\u2013 through the 2005\u201306 season. Radio-Canada stopped simulcasting RDS broadcasts in 2006\u201307, and Rogers sold the French-language rights to TVA Sports.\nAvailability outside Canada.\nWhen \"HNIC\" was on radio, it was broadcast over several powerful CBC clear-channel stations whose nighttime signals reached much of the northern United States; the games had a following in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, and New York, which also had NHL teams at the time. Foster Hewitt acknowledged the listeners in his opening greeting, \"Hello Canada, and hockey fans in the United States and Newfoundland\" (before Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949; the line is immortalized in the opening montage of today's \"Hockey Night\" telecasts). This continued into the television era, waning in recent years with the expansion of local-team TV coverage on regional sports networks; some C-band satellite dishes, however, can still receive CBC over-the-air feeds. U.S. cable television outlets near the international border (including Metro Detroit, Seattle, Buffalo, Burlington, Vermont and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan) typically carry a nearby CBC affiliate on their systems, although some systems carry a non-regional station). CBC stations are generally carried within about of the border, and are not blacked out.\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, \"Hockey Night\"'s main games were simulcast weekly in the United States on NHL Network with pre- and post-game shows. If U.S.-based teams appear in these games, the telecast is blacked out in the markets of the participating teams or is televised by the U.S. team's local broadcaster. During the 2009\u201310 season, only the first game of the \"HNIC\" doubleheader was simulcast live on NHL Network; the second game and the post-game \"After Hours\" program was shown Sunday on tape delay; the only exception was \"Hockey Day in Canada\". Since the Rogers takeover, \"HNIC\" on NHL Network carries games regardless of broadcaster (the CBC or a Rogers network).\n\"NHL Center Ice\" offers some \"Hockey Night in Canada\" games at the same time as the CBC broadcast, usually regional \"Hockey Night\" games from Ottawa or Montreal. \"Center Ice\" generally shows the 7\u00a0p.m. ET games, because the late games are usually national.\nFrom 2006 to 2021, the NBC networks (originally OLN and Versus) simulcast CBC coverage of some games (generally first- and second-round matchups from Western Canada) instead of using their own crews and announcers. During the early 1990s, SportsChannel America similarly covered the Stanley Cup playoffs. Versus and NBCSN, its later incarnation, continued to use CBC and Sportsnet feeds to augment its own playoff coverage. All regular season games broadcast under the HNIC brand not on NHL Network are now available on ESPN+ (in tandem with regional feeds involving games with U.S.-based teams), as part of parent company ESPN's 7-year agreement with the NHL. Blackout restrictions will apply for all games.\n\"Hockey Night in Canada\" is also broadcast live (and occasionally as-live) in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Viaplay. Although the pre- and post-game segments are not included, both games and the segments between periods are shown. \"Hockey Night in Canada\" was also seen in other European markets on ESPN America, distributed on cable and satellite platforms until 2013 (when ESPN America closed) Hockey Night in Canada is now broadcast in the UK and Ireland on Premier Sports now (Viaplay Sports in the UK). Until its closure in 2014, Canadian Forces Radio and Television rebroadcast \"HNIC\" games to Canadian Forces members overseas.\nAnnouncers.\nFoster Hewitt, who welcomed Canadians to the radio broadcast each week, demonstrated that his style could also work on television in 1952. Hewitt continued to work in television for many years (including the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet national team), and his style of play-by-play announcing remained the same on television as it was on radio. Hewitt was followed by Danny Gallivan, Hewitt's son, Bill Hewitt, Dan Kelly, Bob Cole, Dick Irvin Jr., Jim Robson, and Jim Hughson. Previous show hosts included Wes McKnight, Ward Cornell, Frank Selke Jr., Jack Dennett, Dan Kelly, Ted Darling, Dave Hodge, Brian McFarlane, Don Cherry, Dick Irvin Jr., and George Stroumboulopoulos.\nRon MacLean was the host from the 1986\u201387 to 2013\u201314 season, and has been the host since the 2016\u201317 season. Chris Cuthbert, John Bartlett, and Harnarayan Singh are the primary play-by-play announcers, and Craig Simpson, Garry Galley, and Louie DeBrusk are the primary colour commentators. Kyle Bukauskas, Shawn McKenzie, and Scott Oake serve as the primary reporters/hosts. Sportsnet's regional announcers from the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks make occasional appearances when the teams host \"Hockey Night\" games.\nOn June 5, 2020, Sportsnet announced that it had hired TSN commentator and former \"Hockey Night in Canada\" broadcaster Chris Cuthbert. Cuthbert joined \"HNIC\" in time for the NHL post-COVID return, calling games from Edmonton. Dave Randorf's contract was not renewed, and he joined the Tampa Bay Lightning as their play-by-play announcer. Hughson announced his retirement after the 2020\u201321 season, and Cuthbert assumed the lead play-by-play role.\nTheme music.\n1952\u20131968.\nThe television show's original theme song was \"Saturday's Game\", a march composed by Howard Cable. The CBC and MacLaren Advertising, the advertising agency responsible for the broadcasts at the time, later replaced it with the \"Esso Happy Motoring Song\".\n1968\u20132008: \"The Hockey Theme\".\nThe companies commissioned \"The Hockey Theme\", composed in 1968 by Dolores Claman and orchestrated by Jerry Toth. The CBC's most recent licence to use \"The Hockey Theme\" expired at the conclusion of the 2007\u201308 NHL season. Claman's publisher issued a statement on June 4, 2008, that the CBC would not be renewing its rights to the composition. CBC Sports head Scott Moore denied the reports, saying that the CBC wanted to keep the song and that negotiations on a new licence agreement for the song were ongoing.\n2008: The CBC loses rights to \"The Hockey Theme\".\nOn June 6, 2008, the CBC announced that it could not reach an acceptable agreement to renew its licence. Rights to \"The Hockey Theme\" were picked up by CTV, which began using it for hockey broadcasts on its TSN and RDS sports channels during the 2008\u201309 season. (The theme was also featured during the closing ceremonies of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, aired on CTV.) The CBC said that it had offered nearly $1 million for perpetual rights to Claman's theme, but Copyright Music was asking for $2.5 to $3 million. Copyright Music turned it down because it was \"\u00a0... a settlement that barely covered our legal bills, let alone losses.\" One proposed payment method would have allowed the CBC to continue using the theme at a cost of $500 per play ($65,000 annually) while not giving the corporation ownership of the music. Despite being contacted by five parties interested in buying Claman's theme, \"[Copyright Music] had no desire to start a bidding war.\"\nMoore said, \"We have no real idea why the deal fell apart. We're not sure why because the other side hasn't communicated with us.\" According to Copyright Music, Moore gave them an unrealistic deadline of 24 hours to meet him when his client was five time zones away.\nMoore also said that he did not think \"Hockey Night in Canada\" would lose viewers if he lost the theme song: \"Hockey's a game, not a song\". Mike Myers disagreed with Moore's ambivalence towards the song, calling it \"\u00a0... the second anthem [of Canada]\" Canadian jazz-fusion band the Shuffle Demons jokingly introduced it as \"\u00a0... [Canada's] national anthem\" during performances. In a CBC-website poll asking, \"Can Canada go on as we know it without the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" theme?\", 84 percent said no.\nFinding a new theme: Canada's Hockey Anthem Challenge.\nAfter the loss of \"The Hockey Theme\" to CTV, the CBC sponsored a nationwide search (powered by the Filemobile media platform) for a new theme in collaboration with the Nettwerk label. The contest began on June 10, 2008; by August 31, the end of the submissions period, the network received over 14,000 entries. They were reduced to five semi-finalists, whose themes were re-arranged by producer Bob Rock and presented for public voting:\n\"Hockey Scores\", one of the highest-rated submissions, was not chosen as a semi-finalist. Written by Logan Aub\u00e9 of Aurora, Ontario, the song is described by the \"National Post\" as \"an endearingly insane cacophony of screaming babies, screeching animals and gunshot blasts\", and by \"The Globe and Mail\" as sounding \"a lot like a baby riding an unco-operative sheep through an industrial grinder\". Aub\u00e9 originally posted the song on Something Awful, asking participants to vote for it on the CBC's contest website. \"Hockey Scores\" quickly became the most viewed and among the highest rated of the contest's\nsubmissions, though the CBC would not make the decision based on popularity alone.\nVoting began on October 4, 2008, with two finalists picked for a final one-day vote.\nOctober 11, 2008\u20132014: \"Canadian Gold\" arr. Oberst.\nThe two finalists\u2014Burke's \"Sticks to the Ice\" and Oberst's \"Canadian Gold\"\u2014were announced on October 9, 2008. On October 11, after a final round of voting, \"Canadian Gold\" was announced by Don Cherry on \"Scotiabank Hockey Tonight\" as the new \"HNIC\" theme. Oberst received $100,000 plus 50 percent of the song's royalties, the other half of which would be donated to minor hockey. The CBC received exclusive rights to the song for three years, and renewed its rights for the 2011\u20132012 season.\n2014\u2013present: \"Canadian Gold\" arr. Herberman.\nA re-orchestrated version of the theme was introduced for the 2014\u201315 season, arranged and orchestrated by John Herberman and recorded in Toronto by a 50-piece orchestra. Herberman also created an extensive library of new stings and bumpers derived from the main theme.\nAwards.\n\"Hockey Night in Canada\" has received four Gemini Awards from six nominations, mostly for Ron MacLean:\nCriticism.\nProgramming.\nCritics of \"HNIC\"'s programming allege that the program favours the Toronto Maple Leafs. The CBC did not air the March 11, 2006 pregame sweater-retirement ceremony for Canadiens legend (and slapshot inventor Bernard \"Boom Boom\" Geoffrion), continuing its planned broadcast of a Toronto Maple Leafs-Tampa Bay Lightning game; Geoffrion had died earlier in the day. The CBC devoted portions of its coverage to Geoffrion (including a pregame tribute and acknowledgements during the first intermission and on \"Coach's Corner\"), and the ceremony was broadcast in full by French-language outlets. A CBC spokesperson said that the network received a \"handful\" of complaints about the lack of coverage; if the broadcaster aired the ceremony in full, it would have preempted the Leafs game for 40 minutes. An \"Ottawa Citizen\" article considered the decision an example of perceived bias towards the Maple Leafs by the CBC, which did not want to \"offend\" their fans by not showing the full game.\nContent.\nCriticism of \"HNIC\"'s content often focused on Don Cherry, who made controversial statements during his live on-air segments. Cherry was criticized for insulting Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and European players, some of whom he called \"soft\". According to Cherry, Americans were ruining the NHL. Despite these controversies, Cherry's popularity among Canadians endured.\nThe Rogers-produced \"Coach's Corner\" was shortened from 10 minutes to five, which was criticized by Cherry and MacLean during the first segment of the new season. The following Monday, Scott Moore had a brief discussion with Cherry; he laughingly said, \"If you have more to talk about, all you need to do is make sure you tell the executive producer what you want to talk about and we'll make sure you have lots of time.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66973", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66973", "title": "Lycopodiopsida", "text": "Class of vascular plants\nLycopodiopsida is a class of vascular plants also known as lycopsids, lycopods, or lycophytes. Members of the class are also called clubmosses, firmosses, spikemosses and quillworts. They have dichotomously branching stems bearing simple leaves called microphylls and reproduce by means of spores borne in sporangia on the sides of the stems at the bases of the leaves. Although living species are small, during the Carboniferous, extinct tree-like forms (Lepidodendrales) formed huge forests that dominated the landscape and contributed to coal deposits.\nThe nomenclature and classification of plants with microphylls varies substantially among authors. A consensus classification for extant (living) species was produced in 2016 by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG\u00a0I), which places them all in the class Lycopodiopsida, which includes the classes Isoetopsida and Selaginellopsida used in other systems. (See Table 2.) Alternative classification systems have used ranks from division (phylum) to subclass. In the PPG\u00a0I system, the class is divided into three orders, Lycopodiales, Isoetales and Selaginellales.\nCharacteristics.\nClub-mosses (Lycopodiales) are homosporous, but the genera \"Selaginella\" (spikemosses) and \"Isoetes\" (quillworts) are heterosporous, with female spores larger than the male. As a result of fertilisation, the female gametophyte produces sporophytes. A few species of \"Selaginella\" such as \"S.\u00a0apoda\" and \"S.\u00a0rupestris\" are also viviparous; the gametophyte develops on the mother plant, and only when the sporophyte's primary shoot and root is developed enough for independence is the new plant dropped to the ground. Many club-moss gametophytes are mycoheterotrophic and long-lived, residing underground for several years before emerging from the ground and progressing to the sporophyte stage.\nLycopodiaceae and spikemosses (\"Selaginella\") are the only vascular plants with biflagellate sperm, an ancestral trait in land plants otherwise only seen in bryophytes. The only exceptions are \"Isoetes\" and \"Phylloglossum\", which independently has evolved multiflagellated sperm cells with approximately 20 flagella (sperm flagella in other vascular plants can count at least thousand at most, but the number is generally much lower, and flagella are completely absent in seed plants except for Ginkgo and cycads). Because only two flagella puts a size limit on the genome, we find the largest known genomes in the clade in \"Isoetes\", as multiflagellated sperm is not exposed for the same selection pressure as biflagellate sperm in regard of size.\nTaxonomy.\nPhylogeny.\nThe extant lycophytes are vascular plants (tracheophytes) with microphyllous leaves, distinguishing them from the euphyllophytes (plants with megaphyllous leaves). The sister group of the extant lycophytes and their closest extinct relatives are generally believed to be the zosterophylls, a paraphyletic or plesion group. Ignoring some smaller extinct taxa, the evolutionary relationships are as shown below.\nAs of 2019[ [update]], there was broad agreement, supported by both molecular and morphological evidence, that the extant lycophytes fell into three groups, treated as orders in PPG\u00a0I, and that these, both together and individually, are monophyletic, being related as shown in the cladogram below:\nClassification.\nThe rank and name used for the taxon holding the extant lycophytes (and their closest extinct relatives) varies widely. Table 1 below shows some of the highest ranks that have been used. Systems may use taxa at a rank lower than the highest given in the table with the same circumscription; for example, a system that uses Lycopodiophyta as the highest ranked taxon may place all of its members in a single subclass.\nSome systems use a higher rank for a more broadly defined taxon of lycophytes that includes some extinct groups more distantly related to extant lycophytes, such as the zosterophylls. For example, Kenrick &amp; Crane (1997) use the subdivision Lycophytina for this purpose, with all extant lycophytes falling within the class Lycopsida. Other sources exclude the zosterophylls from any \"lycophyte\" taxon.\nIn the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the three orders are placed in a single class, Lycopodiopsida, holding all extant lycophyte species. Older systems have used either three classes, one for each order, or two classes, recognizing the closer relationship between Isoetales and Selaginellales. In these cases, a higher ranked taxon is needed to contain the classes (see Table 1). As Table 2 shows, the names \"Lycopodiopsida\" and \"Isoetopsida\" are both ambiguous.\nSubdivisions.\nThe PPG I system divides up the extant lycophytes as shown below.\n*Order Lycopodiales (1 extant family)\n*Family Lycopodiaceae (16 extant genera)\n*Order Isoetales (1 extant family)\n*Family Isoetaceae (1 extant genus)\n*Order Selaginellales (1 extant family)\n*Family Selaginellaceae (1 extant genus)\nSome extinct groups, such as zosterophylls, fall outside the limits of the taxon as defined by the classifications in Table 1 above. However, other extinct groups fall within some circumscriptions of this taxon. Taylor et al. (2009) and Mauseth (2014) include a number of extinct orders in their division (phylum) Lycophyta, although they differ on the placement of some genera. The orders included by Taylor et al. are:\nMauseth uses the order \u2020Asteroxylales, placing \"Baragwanathia\" in the Protolepidodendrales.\nThe relationship between some of these extinct groups and the extant ones was investigated by Kenrick and Crane in 1997. When the genera they used are assigned to orders, their suggested relationship is:\nEvolution.\nThe Lycopodiopsida are distinguished from other vascular plants by the possession of microphylls and by their sporangia, which are lateral as opposed to terminal and which open (dehisce) transversely rather than longitudinally. In some groups, the sporangia are borne on sporophylls that are clustered into strobili. Phylogenetic analysis shows the group branching off at the base of the evolution of vascular plants and they have a long evolutionary history. Fossils are abundant worldwide, especially in coal deposits. Fossils that can be ascribed to the Lycopodiopsida first appear in the Silurian period, along with a number of other vascular plants. The Silurian \"Baragwanathia longifolia\" is one of the earliest identifiable species. \"Lycopodolica\" is another Silurian genus which appears to be an early member of this group. The group evolved roots independently from the rest of the vascular plants.\nFrom the Devonian onwards, some species grew large and tree-like. Devonian fossil lycopsids from Svalbard, growing in equatorial regions, raise the possibility that they drew down enough carbon dioxide to change the Earth's climate significantly. During the Carboniferous, tree-like plants (such as \"Lepidodendron\", \"Sigillaria\", and other extinct genera of the order \"Lepidodendrales\") formed huge forests that dominated the landscape. Unlike modern trees, leaves grew out of the entire surface of the trunk and branches, but fell off as the plant grew, leaving only a small cluster of leaves at the top. The lycopsids had distinctive features such as \"Lepidodendron\" lycophytes, which were marked with diamond-shaped scars where they once had leaves. Quillworts (order Isoetales) and \"Selaginella\" are considered their closest extant relatives and share some unusual features with these fossil lycopods, including the development of both bark, cambium and wood, a modified shoot system acting as roots, bipolar and secondary growth, and an upright stance. The remains of \"Lepidodendron\" lycopods formed many fossil coal deposits. In Fossil Grove, Victoria Park, Glasgow, Scotland, fossilized lycophytes can be found in sandstone.\nThe Lycopodiopsida had their maximum diversity in the Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous), particularly tree-like \"Lepidodendron\" and \"Sigillaria\" that dominated tropical wetlands. The complex ecology of these tropical rainforests collapsed during the Middle Pennsylvanian due to a change in climate. In Euramerica, tree-like species apparently became extinct in the Late Pennsylvanian, as a result of a transition to a much drier climate, giving way to conifers, ferns and horsetails. In Cathaysia (now South China), tree-like species survived into the Permian. Nevertheless, lycopodiopsids are rare in the Lopingian (latest Permian), but regained dominance in the Induan (earliest Triassic), particularly \"Pleuromeia\". After the worldwide Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, members of this group pioneered the repopulation of habitats as opportunistic plants. The heterogeneity of the terrestrial plant communities increased markedly during the Middle Triassic when plant groups like horsetails, ferns, pteridosperms, cycads, ginkgos and conifers resurfaced and diversified quickly.\nMicrobial associations.\nLycophytes form associations with microbes such as fungi and bacteria, including arbuscular mycorrhizal and endophytic associations.\nArbuscular mycorrhizal associations have been characterized in all stages of the lycophyte lifecycle: mycoheterotrophic gametophyte, photosynthetic surface-dwelling gametophyte, young sporophyte, and mature sporophyte. Arbuscular mycorrhizae have been found in \"Selaginella spp.\" roots and vesicles.\nDuring the mycoheterotrophic gametophyte lifecycle stage, lycophytes gain all of their carbon from subterranean glomalean fungi. In other plant taxa, glomalean networks transfer carbon from neighboring plants to mycoheterotrophic gametophytes. Something similar could be occurring in \"Huperzia hypogeae\" gametophytes which associate with the same glomalean phenotypes as nearby \"Huperzia hypogeae\" sporophytes.\nFungal endophytes have been found in many species of lycophyte, however the function of these endophytes in host plant biology is not known. Endophytes of other plant taxa perform roles such as improving plant competitive fitness, conferring biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, promoting plant growth through phytohormone production or production of limiting nutrients. However, some endophytic fungi in lycophytes do produce medically relevant compounds. \"Shiraia\" sp Slf14 is an endophytic fungus present in \"Huperzia serrata\" that produces Huperzine A, a biomedical compound which has been approved as a drug in China and a dietary supplement in the U.S. to treat Alzheimer's Disease. This fungal endophyte can be cultivated much more easily and on a much larger scale than \"H. serrata\" itself which could increase the availability of Huperzine A as a medicine.\nUses.\nThe spores of lycopods are highly flammable and so have been used in fireworks. Lycopodium powder, the dried spores of the common clubmoss, was used in Victorian theater to produce flame-effects. A blown cloud of spores burned rapidly and brightly, but with little heat. (It was considered safe by the standards of the time.)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66975", "revid": "45212408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66975", "title": "Apophatic theology", "text": "Way of describing the divine by explaining what God is not\nApophatic theology, also known as negative theology, is a form of theological thinking and religious practice which attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about God. It forms a pair together with cataphatic theology (also known as \"affirmative theology\"), which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God \"is\".\nThe apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of mysticism, which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of ordinary perception.\nEtymology and definition.\n\"Apophatic\", (noun); from \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 \"apoph\u0113mi\", meaning 'to deny'. From \"Online Etymology Dictionary\": \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;apophatic (adj.) \"involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation\", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek \"apophatikos\", from apophasis \"denial, negation\", from apophanai \"to speak off,\" from apo \"off, away from\" (see apo-) + phanai \"to speak,\" related to pheme \"voice,\" from PIE root *bha- (2) \"to speak, tell, say.\"\n or (Latin), 'negative way' or 'by way of denial'. The negative way forms a pair together with the \"kataphatic\" or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Pseudo Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the \"way of speech\": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say \"God is Love\", \"God is Beauty\", \"God is Good\". \n&lt;br&gt;The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both \"ways\" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.\nOrigins and development.\nAccording to Fagenblat, \"negative theology is as old as philosophy itself:\" elements of it can be found in Plato's unwritten doctrines, while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in Philo of Alexandria.\nAccording to Carabine, \"apophasis proper\" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus. Carabine writes that there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.\nThe Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo, and Meredith even states that Philo \"is the real founder of the apophatic tradition.\" Yet, it was with Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Maximus the Confessor, whose writings shaped both Hesychasm (the contemplative monastic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches) and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.\nElijah's hearing of a \"still, small voice\" at 1 Kings 19:11-13 has been proposed as a Biblical example of apophatic prayer.\nGreek philosophy.\nPre-Socratic.\nFor the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship. Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained. Epiphany played an essential role in attaining this knowledge. Xenophanes (c.\u2009570\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.\nAccording to Herodotus (484\u2013425 BC), Homer and Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods. The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his \"Theogony\" the birth of the gods and creation of the world, which became an \"ur-text for programmatic, first-person epiphanic narratives in Greek literature,\" but also \"explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine.\" According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods \"actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought.\"\nParmenides (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem \"On Nature\", gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. \"The way of conviction\" explores Being, true reality (\"what-is\"), which is \"What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect.\" \"The way of opinion\" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's allegory of the Cave. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God. Cook notes that Parmenides' poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the mystery cults, giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook. Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to \"attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom.\"\nPlato.\nPlato (428/427 or 424/423 \u2013 348/347 BC), \"deciding for Parmenides against Heraclitus\" and his theory of eternal change, had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.\nPlato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue \"Parmenides\", which is a treatment of the eternal forms, \"Truth, Beauty and Goodness\", which are the real aims for knowledge. The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem of how one fundamental reality or unchanging essence can admit of many changing phenomena, other than by dismissing them as being mere illusion.\nIn \"The Republic\", Plato argues that the \"real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,\" stating that the \"Form of the Good\" is the highest object of knowledge. His argument culminates in the Allegory of the Cave, in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the \"Form of the Good\". Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the \"first principles of all knowledge.\"\nAccording to Cook, the \"Theory of Forms\" has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus. The pursuit of \"Truth, Beauty and Goodness\" became a central element in the apophatic tradition, but nevertheless, according to Carabine \"Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way.\" Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with \"one transcendent source,\" an identification which his later interpreters made.\nMiddle Platonism.\nMiddle Platonism (1st century BC\u20133rd century AD) further investigated Plato's \"Unwritten Doctrines,\" which drew on Pythagoras' first principles of the Monad and the Dyad (matter). Middle Platonism proposed a hierarchy of being, with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's \"Form of the Good\". An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was Philo (c. 25 BC\u00a0\u2013 c. 50 AD), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity. According to Craig D. Allert, \"Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God.\" For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.\nNeo-Platonism.\nNeo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which \"developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism.\" It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5\u2013270 AD), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529\u00a0AD, when the pagan traditions were ousted. It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to Gnosticism. Proclus of Athens (*412\u2013485 AD) played a crucial role in the transmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages, serving as head or 'successor' (diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic 'Academy' for over 50 years. His student Pseudo-Dionysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.\nPlotinus.\nPlotinus (204/5\u2013270 AD) was the founder of Neo-Platonism. In the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute. For Plotinus, the \"One\" is the first principle, from which everything else emanates. He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the \"Republic\", as the cause of the other Forms, with the \"One\" of the first hypothesis of the second part of the \"Parmenides\". For Plotinus, the \"One\" precedes the Forms, and \"is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being.\" From the \"One\" comes the Intellect, which contains all the Forms. The \"One\" is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such. Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to itself. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of the \"One\", which unites all existents \"as a single, all-pervasive reality.\"\nThe \"One\" is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity. Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the \"presence of the intellect in the human soul,\" initiating an ascent of the soul by abstraction or \"taking away,\" culminating in a sudden appearance of the \"One\". In the \"Enneads\" Plotinus writes: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.\nCarabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of the \"One\", but a means to \"ecstasis\" and an ascent to \"the unapproachable light that is God.\" Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching \"henosis\", concludes that \"Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology.\" According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the \"non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul,\" by \"calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6).\" Pao-Shen Ho further notes that \"for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments.\" The argumentation about \"henosis\" is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when \"henosis\" has been attained. Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to \"bring his own soul and \"the souls of others\" by way of Intellect to union with the One.\" As such, the \"Enneads\" as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to \"The Cloud of Unknowing\", demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry. Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.\nProclus.\nProclus (412\u2013485) introduced the terminology used in apophatic and cataphatic theology. He did this in the second book of his \"Platonic Theology\", arguing that Plato states that the \"One\" can be revealed \"through analogy,\" and that \"through negations [\"dia ton apophaseon\"] its transcendence over everything can be shown.\" For Proclus, apophatic and cataphatic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from the \"One\", and cataphatic theology corresponding to the return to the \"One\". The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward the \"One\", while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to the \"One\". According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that \"Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single ineffable Name of God (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u200e) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle.\"\nChristianity.\nApostolic Age.\nThe Book of Revelation 8:1 mentions \"the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven.\" According to Dan Merkur:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term \"silence\" also alludes to the \"still small voice\" (1 Kings 19:12) whose revelation to Elijah on Mount Horeb rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.\nEarly Church Fathers.\nThe Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo (c.\u200925 BC \u2013 50 AD), who saw Moses as \"the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the 'luminous darkness' of God.\" His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.\nGod's appearance to Moses in the burning bush was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers, especially Gregory of Nyssa (c.\u2009335 \u2013 395), realizing the fundamental unknowability of God; an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition. Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since \"following Christ is the human way of seeing God.\"\nClement of Alexandria (c.\u2009150 \u2013 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology. Clement holds that God is unknowable, although God's unknowability, concerns only his essence, not his energies, or powers. According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term develops further from a mere intellectual \"seeing\" toward a spiritual form of contemplation. Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of and the \"mystic vision of the soul.\" For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent. According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven not by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition. His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective. According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach. and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.\nAccording to Tertullian (c.\u2009155\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009240):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]hat which is infinite is known only to itself. This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions\u00a0\u2013 our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is. He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.\nSaint Cyril of Jerusalem (313\u2013386), in his \"Catechetical Homilies\", states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For we explain not what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him. For in what concerns God to confess our ignorance is the best knowledge.\nAugustine of Hippo (354\u2013430) defined God , meaning 'other, completely other', in \"Confessions\" 7.10.16, wrote , meaning 'if you understand [something], it is not God', in \"Sermo 117.3.5\" (\"PL\" 38, 663), and a famous legend tells that, while walking along the Mediterranean shoreline meditating on the mystery of the Trinity, he met a child who with a seashell (or a little pail) was trying to pour the whole sea into a small hole dug in the sand. Augustine told him that it was impossible to enclose the immensity of the sea in such a small opening, and the child replied that it was equally impossible to try to understand the infinity of God within the limited confines of the human mind.\nThe Chalcedonian Christological dogma.\nThe Christological dogma, formulated by the Fourth Ecumenical Council held in Chalcedon in 451, is based on dyophysitism and hypostatic union, concepts used to describe the union of humanity and divinity in a single hypostasis, or individual existence, that of Jesus Christ. This remains transcendent to mankind's rational categories, a mystery which has to be guarded by apophatic language, as it is a personal union of a singularly unique kind.\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.\nApophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of Proclus (412\u2013485) who combined a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas. He is a constant factor in the contemplative tradition of the eastern Orthodox Churches, and from the 9th century onwards his writings also had a strong impact on western mysticism.\nDionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from Acts of the Apostles chapter 17, in which Paul gives a missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus in Athens. In Acts 17:23 Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the Unknown God, \"a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world.\" For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity. Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term \"unknown God\" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the \"unknown God.\"\nPseudo-Dionysius further explored apophasis within the context of Christian Philosophy, to him, that which is the transcendent cause in a stricter sense, does not possess all the positive attributes of the universe as it succeeds them all, wherein there ought to be no contradiction between affirmation and denial of such inasmuch as it precedes and surpasses all deprivation, being wholly beyond all positive (kataphic) and negative distinctions. In this sense, the One, that we may arise by unknowing is the realization that none can fully know the Infinite One, and therefore is only to be approached by \"agnosia\" or by that which is beyond and above all knowledge.\nAccording to Corrigan and Harrington, \"Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God[...] who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source.\" Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described human ascent to divinity as a process of purgation, illumination and union. Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.\nEastern Orthodox Christianity.\nIn Orthodox Christianity, apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century Cappadocian Fathers stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator transcends this existence, is uncreated. The essence of God is completely unknowable; mankind can acquire an incomplete knowledge of God in his attributes (), positive and negative, by reflecting upon and participating in his self-revelatory operations (). Gregory of Nyssa (c.\u2009335\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009395), John Chrysostom (c.\u2009349\u2013407), and Basil the Great (329\u2013379) emphasized the importance of negative theology to an orthodox understanding of God. John of Damascus (c.\u2009675/676\u2013749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal \"not the nature, but the things around the nature.\"\nMaximus the Confessor (580\u2013622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Gregory Palamas (1296\u20131359) formulated the definite theology of Hesychasm, the Eastern Orthodox practices of contemplative prayer and theosis, \"deification.\"\nInfluential 20th-century Orthodox theologians include the Neo-Palamist writers Vladimir Lossky, John Meyendorff, John S. Romanides, and Georges Florovsky. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology, which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation. This is expressed in the idea that mysticism is the expression of dogmatic theology \"par excellence\".\nAccording to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through Scripture and Sacred Tradition, such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in his essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even angels) can understand. He is transcendent in essence (). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or his indestructible energies through (vision of God). According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is immanent in his hypostasis or existences.\nWestern Christianity.\nNegative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian John Scotus Erigena wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen he says \"He is not anything\" and \"God is not\", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is \"other\".\nTheologians like Meister Eckhart and John of the Cross exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, \"The Cloud of Unknowing\" and John of the Cross' \"Dark Night of the Soul\" are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the Catholic Church, which, on the basis of Scripture and church tradition, during the Fourth Lateran Council formulated the following dogma:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying an even greater dissimilitude.\nThe.\nThomas Aquinas was born ten years later (1225\u20131274) and, although in his he quotes Pseudo-Dionysius 1,760 times, stating that \"Now, because we cannot know what God is, but rather what He is not, we have no means for considering how God is, but rather how He is not\" and leaving the work unfinished because it was \"like straw\" compared to what had been revealed to him, his reading in a neo-Aristotelian key of the conciliar declaration overthrew its meaning inaugurating the \"analogical way\" as between and : the . In this way, the believers see what attributes are common between them and God, as well as the unique, not human, properly divine and not understandable way in respect of which God possesses that attributes.\nAccording to Adrian Langdon:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the , , and . In Thomas Aquinas, for example, the undergirds the discussion of univocity, the the equivocal, and the the final defense of analogy.\nAccording to \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", the \"Doctor Angelicus\" and the scholastici declare that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSince then Thomism has played a decisive role in resizing the negative or apophatic tradition of the magisterium.\n20th century.\nApophatic statements are still crucial to many modern theologians, restarting in the 1800s by S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (see his concept of the infinite qualitative distinction) up to Rudolf Otto, Karl Barth (see their idea of \"Wholly Other\", i.e. or ), the Ludwig Wittgenstein of the , and Martin Heidegger after his .\nC. S. Lewis, in his book \"Miracles\" (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse one's mind of misconceptions. He goes on to advocate refilling the mind with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad analogies or false mind-pictures.\nThe mid-20th century Dutch philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd, who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding the impossibility of absolutely knowing God, and yet the possibility of truly knowing something of God. Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. He argues that most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, which involves reflection and attempts to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, for Dooyeweerd, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, exhibits a diverse range of aspects, and can grasp at least the law side. According to Dooyeweerd, knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature. The philosopher Leo Strauss considered that the Bible, for example, should be treated as pre-theoretical (everyday) rather than theoretical in what it contains.\nIvan Illich (1926\u20132002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called \"Why Philia?\".\n21st century.\nKaren Armstrong, in her book \"The Case for God\" (2009), notices a recovery of apophatic theology in postmodern theology.\nPhilosopher and literary scholar William Franke, particularly in his 2007 two-volume collection \"On What Cannot Be Said\" and his 2014 monograph \"A Philosophy of the Unsayable\", puts forth that negative theology's exploration and performance of language's limitations is not simply one current among many in religious thought, but is \"a kind of perennial counter-philosophy to the philosophy of Logos\" that persistently challenges central tenets of Western thought throughout its history. For Franke, literature demonstrates the \"infinitely open\" nature of language which negative theology and related forms of philosophical thought seek to draw attention to. Franke therefore argues that literature, philosophy, and theology begin to bleed into one another as they approach what he frames as the \"apophatic\" side of Western thought.\nIslam.\nVarious traditions and schools in Islam (see Islamic schools and branches) draw on sundry theologies in approaching God in Islam (Allah, Arabic ) or the ultimate reality. \"Negative theology\" involves the use of , , defined as 'setting aside', 'canceling out', 'negation', or 'nullification'. The followers of the Mu'tazili school of Kalam, the spread of which is often attributed to Wasil ibn Ata, are often called the ('cancelers' or 'negators'), a description, sometimes employed derogatorily, deriving from the school's descriptions of the Islamic God.\nRajab \u02bfAl\u012b Tabr\u012bz\u012b, an Iranian and Shi'ite philosopher and mystic of the 17th century, is credited with instilling an apophatic theology in a generation of philosophers and theologians whose influence extended into the Qajar period. Mulla Rajab affirmed the completely unknowable, unqualifiable, and attributeless nature of God and upheld a general view concerning God's attributes which can only be negatively 'affirmed' (that is, by affirmingly negating all that is not God about God).\nShia Islam largely adopts \"negative theology\". In the words of the Persian Ismaili missionary, Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani: \"There does not exist a [\"transcendence\"] more brilliant and more splendid than that by which we establish the absolute transcendence of our Originator through the use of these phrases in which a negative and a negative of a negative apply to the thing denied.\"\nLiteralists completely reject and condemn any negation that would clash with the wording of the Islamic Scriptures or with the narratives ascribed to the Islamic Prophet. They therefore hold that descriptors and qualifiers that occur in the Qur'\u0101n and in the canonized religious traditions, even if seeming or sounding humanlike such as \"hand\", \"finger, or \"foot\", are to be wholly affirmed as attributes of God (not limbs).\nMany Sunnites, like the Ash'aris and Maturidis, adhere to some middle path or synthesis between negation and anthropomorphism, though the kind of each combination of negation and affirmation varies greatly.\nJudaism.\nMaimonides (1135/1138\u20131204) was \"the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the .\" Maimonides \u2013 along with Samuel ibn Tibbon \u2013 draws on Bahya ibn Paquda, who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of his absolute unity. God, as the entity which is \"truly One\" (), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and indescribable. In \"The Guide for the Perplexed\", Maimonides states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive attribute[...] still less has He accidents (), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe[...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living \u2014 it is not dead;[...] it is the first \u2014 its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will \u2014 it is not feeble or ignorant; He is One \u2014 there are not more Gods than one[...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself \u2014 and not of His actions \u2014 the negation of the opposite.\nAccording to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that \"[God] is knowledge,\" and saw his essence, being, and knowledge as completely one, \"a perfect unity and not a composite at all.\" Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This [form of unity] wherein G\u2011d's knowledge and so on is one with G\u2011d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.\nAccording to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought. Yeshayahu Leibowitz (1903\u20131994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology. According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is their commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person's image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.\nJacques Derrida.\nThe work of Jewish philosopher Jacques Derrida, and in particular his critical method called deconstruction, has frequently been compared to negative theology, and led to renewed interest in apophaticism in the late 20th century, even among continental philosophers and literary scholars who may not have otherwise have been particularly invested in theological issues. Conversely, the perception that deconstruction resembled or essentially was a form of secular negative theology also \u2013 according to Derrida himself \u2013 took the form of an accusation from his critics, implicitly positing both negative theology and deconstruction as being elaborate ways of saying nothing of any substance or importance. However, Derrida strongly repudiated this comparison for much of his career, arguing that any resemblance between his thought and apophaticism is purely superficial. Derrida argued that the aims of negative theology \u2013 to demonstrate the ultimate, incomprehensible, transcendent reality of God \u2013 are a form of ontotheology which runs fundamentally counter to deconstruction's aim of purging Western thought of its pervasive metaphysics of presence.\nLater in his career, such in as his essay , Derrida comes to see apophatic theology as potentially but not necessarily a means through which the intractable inadequacies of language and the ontological difficulties which proceed from them can brought to our attention and explored:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is one apophasis that can in effect respond to, correspond to, correspond with the most insatiable desire of God, according to the history and the event of its manifestation or the secret of its non-manifestation.\nThe other apophasis, the other voice, can remain readily foreign to all desire, in any case to every anthropotheomorphic form of desire.\nScholars such as Stephen Shakespeare have noted that \u2013 despite Derrida's pervasive concern with many aspects of Jewish theology and identity \u2013 his writing on negative theology draws almost exclusively on Christian writing and couches the topic in the language of Christianity generally. Derrida's thought in general, but in particular his later writing on negative theology, was highly influential in the development of the Weak Theology movement, and of postmodern theology as a whole.\nDavid Wood and Robert Bernasconi have highlighted how Derrida explains what deconstruction is in an overwhelmingly negative, \"apophatic\" fashion.\nIndian parallels.\nEarly Indian philosophical works which have apophatic themes include the Principal Upanishads (800 BC to the start of the common era) and the Brahma Sutras (from 450 BC and 200 AD). An expression of negative theology is found in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, where Brahman is described as \"neti neti\" or \"neither this, nor that\". Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.\nBuddhist philosophy has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of anatta (not-atman, not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. Madhyamaka is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by Nagarjuna (2nd\u20133rd century AD), which is based on a four-fold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness (shunyata). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the praj\u00f1aparamita genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.\nApophatic movements in medieval Hindu philosophy are visible in the works of Shankara (8th century), a philosopher of Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism), and Bhart\u1e5bhari (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, Brahman, is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhart\u1e5bhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.\nIn Advaita, Brahman is defined as being Nirguna or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality. The Taittiriya hymn speaks of Brahman as \"one where the mind does not reach\". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same.\nNegative theology also figures in the Buddhist and Hindu polemics. The arguments go something like this \u2013 Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed's believe that God is an ultimately unknowable being (see God in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith) and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings state that \"there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true God with His creation, and no resemblance whatever can exist between the transient and the Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute.\"\nAccording to the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, the only way to grow nearer to God is to gain knowledge of the Manifestation of God, who is a reflection of God's reality in a similar way to how a mirror reflects an image of the sun. Stephen Lambden has written a paper entitled, \"The Background and Centrality of Apophatic Theology in B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Scripture\" and Ian Kluge has also looked into the Apophatic Theology and the Baha'i faith in the second part of his paper, \"Neoplatonism and the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Writings\".\nApophatic theology and atheism.\nEven though the \"via negativa\" essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality. Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of atheism or agnosticism, since it cannot truly say that God exists. \"The comparison is crude, however, for conventional atheism treats the existence of God as a predicate that can be denied (\"God is nonexistent\"), whereas negative theology denies that God has predicates\". \"God or the Divine is\" without being able to attribute qualities about \"what He is\" would be the prerequisite of positive theology in negative theology that distinguishes theism from atheism. \"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology\". Since religious experience\u2014or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value. In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the \"via negativa\" also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrinted sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \nWeb sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who in 1642 was the first known European to cross it. British explorer Lieutenant James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s during his three voyages of exploration.\nThe M\u0101ori people of New Zealand call this sea \"Te Moana-a-Rehua\" meaning 'the sea of Rehua' which clashes with the Pacific waters named \"Te Tai-o-Whitirea\" ('the sea of Whitirea') \u2013 after Whitirea, Rehua's lover \u2013 at Cape Reinga, the northernmost tip of North Island.\nClimate.\nThe south of the sea is passed over by depressions going from west to east. The northern limit of these westerly winds is near to 40\u00b0S. During the southern winter, from April to October, the northern branch of these winds from the west changes its direction toward the north and goes up against trade winds. Hence, the sea receives frequent winds from the southwest during this period. In the Australian summer (from November to March), the southern branch of the trade winds goes up against west winds and produces further wind activity in the area.\nGeography.\nThe Tasman Sea is wide and has an area of . The maximum depth of the sea is . \nThe base of the sea is made up of globigerina ooze. A small zone of pteropod ooze is found to the south of New Caledonia and to the southern extent of 30\u00b0S, siliceous ooze can be found.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Tasman Sea as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"On the West\" A line from Gabo Island (near Cape Howe, 37\u00b030'S) to the northeast point of East Sister Island (148\u00b0E), thence along the 148th meridian to Flinders Island; beyond this island a line running to the eastward of the Vansittart Shoals to [Cape] Barren Island, and from Cape Barren (the easternmost point of [Cape] Barren Island) to Eddystone Point (41\u00b0S) in Tasmania, thence along the east coast to South East Cape, the southern point of Tasmania.\n\"On the North\" The parallel of 30\u00b0S from the Australian coast eastward as far as a line joining the east extremities of Elizabeth Reef and South East Rock () then to the southward along this line to the South East Rock [an outlier of Lord Howe Island].\n\"On the Northeast\" From the South East Rock to the north point of Three Kings Islands (), thence to North Cape in New Zealand.\n\"On the East\"\n\"On the Southeast\" A line running from South West Cape, Stewart Island, through the Snares (48\u00b0S, 166\u00b030'E) to North West Cape, Auckland Island (), through this island to its southern point.\n\"On the South\" A line joining the southern point of Auckland Island () to South East Cape, the southern point of Tasmania.\nRidge.\nThe Tasman Sea's midocean ridge developed between 85 and 55 million years ago as Australia and Zealandia broke apart during the breakup of supercontinent Gondwana. It lies roughly midway between the continental margins of Australia and Zealandia. Much of Zealandia is submerged, so the ridge runs much closer to the Australian coast than New Zealand's.\nIslands.\nThe Tasman Sea features a number of midsea island groups, quite apart from coastal islands located near the Australian and New Zealand mainlands:\nCurrents.\nThe East Australian Current that commences its flow southwards in the tropics of the Coral Sea, near the eastern coast of Australia is the most energetic circulation feature in the south western Pacific Ocean and is a primary means of heat transport from the tropics to the middle latitudes between Australia and New Zealand.1458 The East Australian Current is a return of the westward-flowing Pacific Equatorial Current (Pacific South Equatorial Current). At the juncture between the Tasman and Coral seas while the East Australian Current continues south in the western Tasman a branch flows east called the Tasman Front towards the north of New Zealand with most continuing eastward above New Zealand into the South Pacific Ocean. It transpires that while predominantly the location of westerly wind stress is a factor in how far north the formation of the Tasman Front occurs, so is the presence of the New Zealand land mass, as the top of New Zealand defines the furtherest south that the Tasman Front can be split off by the westerly winds. A boundary current called the East Auckland Current goes down the west coast of the North Island and further south the East Cape Current, that has been diverted towards the South Island by the shapes of the Lord Howe Rise and southern east coast of the North island continues to the south. The East Australian Current south of Tasmania also is diverted west in the Subtropical Front which collides with the western moving Subantarctic front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The East Australian Current sheds eddies on its way south that move south-westward with some known as the Tasman Leakage making it as far westward as the Indian Ocean.\nAnimal and plant life.\nA deep-sea research ship, the RV \"Tangaroa\", explored the sea and found 500 species of fish and 1300 species of invertebrates. The tooth of a megalodon, an extinct shark, was also found by researchers.\nHistory.\nIn 1876, the first telegraph cable connecting Australia and New Zealand was laid in the Tasman Sea. The telegraph cable was made obsolete in 1963 when the Commonwealth Pacific Cable, New Zealand's first international telephone cable, was completed. Moncrieff and Hood were the first to attempt a trans-Tasman crossing by plane in January 1928. The aviators were never seen or heard of again. The first successful flight over the sea was accomplished by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm later that year. The first person to row solo across the sea was Colin Quincey in 1977. The next successful solo crossing was completed by his son, Shaun Quincey, in 2010.\nThe Tasman Sea has for many years been referred to colloquially as \"The Ditch\" by Australians and New Zealanders. The exact etymology for this term is uncertain.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, in meningococcal infections, an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic.\nEpidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population (e.g., increased stress or increase in the density of a vector species), a genetic change in the pathogen reservoir or the introduction of an emerging pathogen to a host population (by movement of pathogen or host). Generally, an epidemic occurs when host immunity to either an established pathogen or newly emerging novel pathogen is suddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded.\nAn epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed as a pandemic. The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline rate of incidence; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza, are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline. A few cases of a very rare disease may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the common cold) would not. An epidemic can cause enormous damage through financial and economic losses in addition to impaired health and loss of life.\nDefinition.\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines epidemic broadly: \"Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.\" The term \"outbreak\" can also apply, but is usually restricted to smaller events.\nAny sudden increase in disease prevalence may generally be termed an epidemic. This may include contagious disease (i.e. easily spread between persons) such as influenza; vector-borne diseases such as malaria; water-borne diseases such as cholera; and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS. The term can also be used for non-communicable health issues such as obesity.\nThe term \"epidemic\" derives from a word form attributed to Homer's \"Odyssey\", which later took its medical meaning from the \",\" a treatise by Hippocrates. Before Hippocrates, , , , and other variants had meanings similar to the current definitions of \"\" or \"endemic\". Thucydides' description of the Plague of Athens is considered one of the earliest accounts of a disease epidemic. By the early 17th century, the terms \"endemic\" and \"epidemic\" referred to contrasting conditions of population-level disease, with the endemic condition a \"\"common sicknesse\" and the epidemic \"hapning in some region, or countrey, at a certaine time, ... producing in all sorts of people, one and the same kind of sicknesse\"\".\nThe term \"epidemic\" is often applied to diseases in non-human animals, although \"epizootic\" is technically preferable.\nCauses.\nThere are several factors that may contribute (individually or in combination) to causing an epidemic. There may be changes in a pathogen, in the population that it can infect, in the environment, or in the interaction between all three. Factors include the following:\nAntigenic Change.\nAn antigen is a protein on the virus' surface that host antibodies can recognize and attack. Changes in the antigenic characteristics of the agent make it easier for the changed virus to spread throughout a previously immune population. There are two natural mechanisms for change - antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift arises over a period of time as an accumulation of mutations in the virus genes, possibly through a series of hosts, and eventually gives rise to a new strain of virus which can evade existing immunity. Antigenic shift is abrupt - in this, two or more different strains of a virus, coinfecting a single host, combine to form a new subtype having a mixture of characteristics of the original strains. The best known and best documented example of both processes is influenza. SARS-CoV2 has demonstrated antigenic drift and possibly shift as well.\nDrug resistance.\nAntibiotic resistance applies specifically to bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance in bacteria can arise naturally by genetic mutation, or by one species acquiring resistance from another through horizontal gene transfer. Extended use of antibiotics appears to encourage selection for mutations which can render antibiotics ineffective. This is especially true of tuberculosis, with increasing occurrence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) worldwide.\nChanges in transmission.\nPathogen transmission is a term used to describe the mechanisms by which a disease-causing agent (virus, bacterium, or parasite) spreads from one host to another. Common modes of transmission include: -\nThe first three of these require that pathogen must survive away from its host for a period of time; an evolutionary change which increases survival time will result in increased virulence.\nAnother possibility, although rare, is that a pathogen may adapt to take advantage of a new mode of transmission\nSeasonality.\nSeasonal diseases arise due to the change in the environmental conditions, especially such as humidity and temperature, during different seasons. Many diseases display seasonality, This may be due to one or more of the following underlying factors: -\nHuman behaviour.\nChanges in behaviour can affect the likelihood or severity of epidemics. The classic example is the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak, in which a cholera outbreak was mitigated by removing a supply of contaminated water - an event now regarded as the foundation of the science of epidemiology. Urbanisation and overcrowding (e.g. in refugee camps) increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. A factor which contributed to the initial rapid increase in the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic was ritual bathing of (infective) corpses; one of the control measures was an education campaign to change behaviour around funeral rites.\nChanges in the host population.\nThe level of immunity to a disease in a population - herd immunity - is at its peak after a disease outbreak or a vaccination campaign. In the following years, immunity will decline, both within individuals and in the population as a whole as older individuals die and new individuals are born. Eventually, unless there is another vaccination campaign, an outbreak or epidemic will recur.\nIt's also possible for disease which is endemic in one population to become epidemic if it is introduced into a novel setting where the host population is not immune. An example of this was the introduction European diseases such as smallpox into indigenous populations during the 16th century.\nZoonosis.\nA zoonosis is an infectious disease of humans caused by a pathogen that can jump from a non-human host to a human. Major diseases such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis are zoonoses. HIV was a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans in the early part of the 20th century, though it has now evolved into a separate human-only disease. Some strains of bird flu and swine flu are zoonoses; these viruses occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the 2009 swine flu.\nTypes.\nCommon source outbreak.\nIn a common source outbreak epidemic, the affected individuals had an exposure to a common agent. If the exposure is singular and all of the affected individuals develop the disease over a single exposure and incubation course, it can be termed as a point source outbreak. If the exposure was continuous or variable, it can be termed as a continuous outbreak or intermittent outbreak, respectively.\nPropagated outbreak.\nIn a propagated outbreak, the disease spreads person-to-person. Affected individuals may become independent reservoirs leading to further exposures.Many epidemics will have characteristics of both common source and propagated outbreaks (sometimes referred to as mixed outbreak).\nFor example, secondary person-to-person spread may occur after a common source exposure or an environmental vector may spread a zoonotic diseases agent.\nPreparation.\nPreparations for an epidemic include having a disease surveillance system; the ability to quickly dispatch emergency workers, especially local-based emergency workers; and a legitimate way to guarantee the safety and health of health workers.\nEffective preparations for a response to a pandemic are multi-layered. The first layer is a disease surveillance system. Tanzania, for example, runs a national lab that runs testing for 200 health sites and tracks the spread of infectious diseases. The next layer is the actual response to an emergency. According to U.S.-based columnist Michael Gerson in 2015, only the U.S. military and NATO have the global capability to respond to such an emergency. Still, despite the most extensive preparatory measures, a fast-spreading pandemic may easily exceed and overwhelm existing health-care resources. Consequently, early and aggressive mitigation efforts, aimed at the so-called \"epidemic curve flattening\" need to be taken. Such measures usually consist on non-pharmacological interventions such as social/physical distancing, aggressive contact tracing, \"stay-at-home\" orders, as well as appropriate personal protective equipment (i.e., masks, gloves, and other physical barriers to spread).\nMoreover, India has taken significant strides in its efforts to prepare for future respiratory pandemics through the development of the National Pandemic Preparedness Plan for Respiratory Viruses using a multisectoral approach.\nPreceding this national effort, a regional workshop on the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) initiative was organized by WHO's South-East Asia Regional Office on October 12\u201313, 2023. Recognizing that the same capacities and capabilities can be leveraged and applied for groups of pathogens based on their mode of transmission, the workshop aimed to facilitate pandemic planning efficiency for countries in the region. The participating countries, in the aftermath of the workshop, outlined their immediate next steps and sought support from WHO and its partners to bolster regional preparedness against respiratory pathogen pandemics.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It more immediately flows into the east-south channel around the Flevopolder, Flevoland which is kept at 3 metres below sea level. This body of water is then pumped up into the IJsselmeer.\nIt is sometimes called the Gelderse IJssel (; \"Gueldern IJssel\") to distinguish it from the Hollandse IJssel. It is in the provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel, the latter of which was named after this river. The Romans knew the river as Isala. It flows from Westervoort, on the east side of the city of Arnhem.\nSimilar to the Nederrijn which shares its short inflow, the Pannerdens Kanaal, it is a minor discharge of the Rhine. At the fork where the Kanaal is sourced the Rhine takes the name the Waal. This splitting-off is west of the German border. The Waal in turn interweaves with other rivers and the lower course of the Nederrijn, which altogether is known as the Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta.\nThe name contains the digraph \"ij\", used throughout modern Dutch orthography, which is why both letters appear capitalized (as in: IJmuiden and IJsselmeer).\nEtymology.\nThe name \"IJssel\" (older \"Isla\", \"Isala\", from *\"\u012asal\u014d\"), is thought to either have been derived from a Proto-Indo-European root \"*eis-\" \"to move quickly\" (Old Norse \"eisa\" \"to race forward\", Latin \"ira\" \"anger\") or a possible Old European stratum source.\nThe two earliest surviving Old Dutch attestations of the IJssel's name, from 797 and 814 AD, were of a \"Hisla\". The \"h\" disappeared over the next few centuries, with forms that included \"Ysola\", \"Ysla\", and \"Isla\" being attested over the next few centuries.\nHistory.\nBefore the Roman Warm Period, the Zuiderzee in highly glaciated times was a brackish, sometimes tidal, very broad set of mudflats, the \"Vlies\" (Latin: \"Flevo\"). The IJssel and Amstel kept a saline-freshwater balance, and northward flow, enabling islands and banks to build up. Among these are rare zones just above sea level: Kampen, Elburg and north-east bank once wooded strip from Nijemirdum to Stavoren.\nHowever, the North Sea, locally to form (or re-form) the Zuiderzee, reasserted itself \u2013 the so-called Dunkirk transgressions.\nBy the time these were tamed (terraformed) the IJssel had formed many of its new short distributaries to dissipate its flow. The submerged old delta is traceable out from its sea level elevation point at Zwolle throughout the broadest parts of the IJsselmeer; the lands of Emmeloord, Lelystad and south of Dronten are relatively recent reclamations. They were continuations of these old, broad troughs, and lie six metres below sea level.\nThe name Vlie refers to a strait between sea islands, Vlieland and Terschelling. It seems that the firmly below-sea-level excoriations in the far north (the \"Groote Vliet\") by Medemblik and the IJ (near Amsterdam) were all deep parts of the same body of water in the height of the Roman Warm Period and Medieval Dark Age sea rises (transgressions). Most of the surrounding basin of the vast harbour-like body of water of the Netherlands is reclaimed from it (nationally called polderisation; in England called the making of a fen).\nThe river was a natural barrier and in April 1945 was stormed by assault troops of the Allied armies liberating the Netherlands from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany.\nThe IJssel as the lower part of the Oude IJssel.\nMost of the IJssel was the lower part of the small river Oude IJssel (lit. \"Old IJssel\", German \"Issel\"), that rises in Germany and is now a 70\u00a0km tributary. The connection between the Rhine and IJssel was probably artificial, allegedly dug by men under the Roman general Nero Claudius Drusus c. 12 BCE as a defence against Germanic tribes and to let Roman ships carry troops along it.\nThe Oude IJssel is the second-largest contributor to the flow of the river, after the Rhine.\nThe source of the Oude IJssel is near Borken in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. First it flows south-west until it nearly reaches the Rhine near Wesel; then it turns west northwest. After skirting Isselburg it crosses the border with the Netherlands. The river then flows through Doetinchem and joins the IJssel at Doesburg.\nCharacteristics.\nThe average daily discharge can change greatly. It has been, over long periods, averaged as about 300 cubic meters per second. It can be as low as 140 and as high as 1800, depending on the velocity of the water arriving from upstream and the weirs west of Arnhem, which control the water taken in. These control the Pannerdens Kanaal, the sole inflow (shared with the Nederrijn).\nAs a lowland river in which velocity decreases, the IJssel meanders. Some bends (and spurs of land, \"hank\") have been cut off by man such as near Rheden and Doesburg, reducing the length from 146\u00a0 km to 125\u00a0km, but not as radically as the Meuse nor Great Ouse. Deposition of sediment to form islands in the outside of bends has been curtailed since the late nineteenth century.\nThe IJssel as a Rhine distributary.\nSince the connection between the Rhine and IJssel was dug, the Rhine became the main contributor to the flow of the IJssel \u2013 a small fraction of the former's flow makes up the upper IJssel. Various tributaries add a little or much water to the flow of the IJssel, such as the Berkel and Schipbeek streams from relatively local precipitation. The IJssel, if accepted as a branch of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta, is the only one that takes up tributary rivers rather than giving rise to distributaries. It has no contact with the Meuse, nor Scheldt, nor their resultant watercourses.\nIn the last few miles of the river's run, near the city of Kampen, distributaries form, resulting in a quite small delta. Some of these have been dammed up to lower the risk of flooding. Some have silted up. Others flow without interruption. Most of the damming-up was done before 1932, when the Zuiderzee was turned into the freshwater IJsselmeer lake. The whole delta had been prone to flooding in times of northwestern gales, pushing back the saline Zuiderzee water into the delta.\nThe modern-day names of the delta branches are, west to east, the:\nOf these, the first-stated two are the main navigations. The Noorddiep has been stopped up at both ends. Another branch, De Garste, had already completely silted up by the middle of the nineteenth century. Until about 1900, the Ganzendiep up to the Goot fork was known as IJssel proper as was the historical main channel. The present main channel was named the Regtediep or Rechterdiep until well into the twentieth century.\nThe IJssel, now mainly a Rhine branch as to its water, has retained most of the character of a distinct river in its own right. It has its own tributaries and, as to the Old IJssel (\"Oude IJssel\"), a former headstream.\nTributaries and connecting canals.\nThe following canals, long ditches and tributary streams feed the IJssel, in downstream order:\nRiver crossings.\nRoad bridges.\nRoad bridges across river IJssel (with nearest places on the left and right bank):\nRailroad bridges.\nRailroad bridges (with nearest train station on the left and right bank):\nCable ferries.\nOnly those ferries capable of carrying motorised vehicles are included.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66984", "revid": "50274877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66984", "title": "Reforestation", "text": "Method for land and forest regeneration\nReforestation is the practice of restoring previously existing forests and woodlands that have been destroyed or damaged. The prior forest destruction might have happened through deforestation, clearcutting or wildfires. Three important purposes of reforestation programs are for harvesting of wood, for climate change mitigation, and for ecosystem and habitat restoration purposes. One method of reforestation is to establish tree plantations, also called plantation forests. They cover about 131 million ha worldwide, which is 3% of the global forest area and 45% of the total area of planted forests.\nGlobally, planted forests increased from 4.1% to 7.0% of the total forest area between 1990 and 2015. Plantation forests made up 280 million ha (hectare) in 2015, an increase of about 40 million ha in the previous ten years. Of the planted forests worldwide, 18% of that area consists of exotic or introduced species while the rest consist of species native to the country where they are planted.\nThere are limitations and challenges with reforestation projects, especially if they are in the form of tree plantations. Firstly, there can be competition with other land uses and displacement risk. Secondly, tree plantations are often monocultures which comes with a set of disadvantages, for example biodiversity loss. Lastly, there is also the problem that stored carbon is released at some point.\nThe effects of reforestation will be farther in the future than those of proforestation (the conservation of intact forests). Instead of planting entirely new areas, it might be better to reconnect forested areas and restore the edges of forest. This protects their mature core and makes them more resilient and longer-lasting. It takes much longer \u2212 several decades \u2212 for the carbon sequestration benefits of reforestation to become similar to those from mature trees in tropical forests. Therefore, reducing deforestation is usually more beneficial for climate change mitigation than is reforestation.\nMany countries carry out reforestation programs. For example, in China, the \"Three Northern Protected Forest Development Program\" \u2013 informally known as the \"Great Green Wall\" \u2013 was launched in 1978 and scheduled to last until 2050. It aims to eventually plant nearly 90 million acres of new forest in a 2,800-mile stretch of northern China. Such programs often blur the boundaries between \"reforestation\" and \"afforestation\" (the latter being the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no forest before).&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefinition.\nReforestation according to the IPCC means the \"conversion to forest of land that has previously contained forests but that has been converted to some other use\".\nAccording to FAO terminology, reforestation is defined as the re-establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land classified as forest. \n\"Afforestation\" on the other hand means establishing new forest on lands that were not forest before (for example, abandoned agriculture). It is the process of restoring and recreating areas of woodlands or forests that may have existed long ago but were deforested or otherwise removed at some point in the past or lacked it naturally (for example, natural grasslands).\nPurposes.\nHarvesting of wood.\nReforestation is not solely used for recovery of accidentally destroyed forests. In some countries, such as Finland, many forests are \"managed\" by the wood products and pulp and paper industry. In such arrangements, trees are planted to replace those that have been cut, much like other crops. The Finnish Forest Act from 1996 requires that forest be replanted after felling. In such circumstances, the industry can cut the trees in a way to allow easier reforestation.\nReforestation, if several indigenous species are used, can provide other benefits in addition to financial returns, including restoration of the soil, rejuvenation of local flora and fauna, and the capturing and sequestering of 38 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare per year.\nClimate change mitigation.\nThere are four primary ways in which reforestation and reducing deforestation can increase carbon sequestration and thus help with climate change mitigation. First, by increasing the volume of existing forest. Second, by increasing the carbon density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale. Third, by expanding the use of forest products that will sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions. Fourth, by reducing carbon emissions that are caused from deforestation and degradation.\nEcosystem restoration.\nPlantation forests are intensively managed, composed of one or two species, even-aged, planted with regular spacing, and established mainly for productive purposes. Other planted forests, which comprise 55 percent of all planted forests, are not intensively managed, and they may resemble natural forests at stand maturity. The purposes of other planted forests may include ecosystem restoration and the protection of soil and water values.\nMethods.\nForest plantations.\nPlantation forests cover about 131 million ha, which is 3 percent of the global forest area and 45 percent of the total area of planted forests.\nOver 90% of the world's forests regenerate organically, and more than half are covered by forest management plans or equivalents.\nGlobally, planted forests increased from 4.1% to 7.0% of the total forest area between 1990 and 2015. Plantation forests made up 280 million ha (hectare) in 2015, an increase of about 40 million ha in the previous ten years. Of the planted forests worldwide, 18% of that planted area consists of exotic or introduced species while the rest consist of species native to the country where they are planted.\nUsing existing trees and roots.\nPlanting new trees often leads to up to 90% of seedlings failing. However, even in deforested areas, existing root systems often exist. Growth can be accelerated by pruning and coppicing where a few branches of new shoots are cut and often used for charcoal, itself a major driver of deforestation. Since new seeds are not planted, it is cheaper. Additionally, they are much more likely to survive as their root systems already exist and can tap into groundwater during harsher seasons with no rain. While this method has existed for centuries, it is now sometimes referred to as farmer-managed natural regeneration or assisted natural regeneration.\nFinancial incentives.\nPolicies that promote reforestation for incentives in return have shown promising results of being an effective and motivative concept to re-plant globally on a mass scale.\nSome incentives for reforestation can be as simple as a financial compensation. A compensated reduction of deforestation approach has been proposed which would reward developing countries that disrupt any further act of deforestation: Countries that participate and take the option to reduce their emissions from deforestation during a committed period of time would receive financial compensation for the carbon dioxide emissions that they avoided. To raise the payments, the host country would issue government bonds or negotiate some kind of loan with a financial institution that would want to take part in the compensation promised to the other country. The funds received by the country could be invested to help find alternatives to the extensive cutdown of forests. This whole process of cutting emissions would be voluntary, but once the country has agreed to lower their emissions they would be obligated to reduce their emissions. However, if a country was not able to meet their obligation, their target would get added to their next commitment period. The authors of these proposals see this as a solely government-to-government agreement; private entities would not participate in the compensation trades.\nAnother emerging revenue source to fund reforestation projects deals with the sale of carbon sequestration credits, which can be sold to companies and individuals looking to compensate their carbon footprint. This approach allows for private landowners and farmers to gain a revenue from the reforestation of their lands, while simultaneously benefiting from improved soil health and increased productivity.\nAlongside past financial incentive strategies, reforestation tax benefits have been another way the government has encouraged companies to promote reforestation tactics through the promises of a tax break.\nAs many landholders seek to earn carbon credits through sequestration, their participation also encourages biodiversity and provides ecosystem services for crops and livestock.\nChallenges.\nThere is often insufficient integration between the different purposes of reforestation, namely economic utilization, enhancement of biodiversity and carbon sequestration. This can lead to a range of different challenges.\nCompetition with other land uses and displacement risk.\nReforestation can compete with other land uses, such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space, for further economic growth. Reforestation can also divert large amounts of water from other activities. A map created by the World Resources Institute in collaboration with the IUCN identifies 2 billion hectares for potential forest restoration and is criticized for including 900 million hectares of grasslands. An assessment of the pledges of governments for reforestation found that the sum of global pledges translates to a required land area of 1.2bn hectares, until 2060, which is equal to a tenth of the global land area und thus deemed unrealistic without a significant encroachment on non-forest areas. Experts are calling for a better integration of social data, such as the dependence of livelihoods on specific land uses, into restoration efforts. Possible solutions include the integration of other land uses into forests through agroforestry, such as growing coffee plants under trees, reducing the delineation between forests and other land uses.\nA study found that almost 300 million people live on tropical forest restoration opportunity land in the Global South, constituting a large share of low-income countries' populations, and argues for prioritized inclusion of \"local communities\" in forest restoration projects.\nThere are calls for a more selective approach to identifying reforestation areas, taking into account the possible displacement of customary land uses.\nBiodiversity loss.\nReforesting sometimes results in extensive canopy creation that prevents growth of diverse vegetation in the shadowed areas and generating soil conditions that hamper other types of vegetation. Trees used in some reforesting efforts (for example, \"Eucalyptus globulus\") tend to extract large amounts of moisture from the soil, preventing the growth of other plants. The European Commission found that, in terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to allow for deforestation to subsequently reforest, as the former leads to irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation.\nThe effects reforestation has on biodiversity is not limited to just other forms of vegetation, it can affect all forms of living organisms all contained in the present ecosystem. Due to the major role trees have on ecosystems it is important to better understand components like the ecosystem, waterways, and species present in areas that are being re-planted.\u00a0Prior research helps limit the depletion of biodiversity which can hinder medicinal discoveries, and alter gene flow in organisms.\nA debated issue in managed reforestation is whether the succeeding forest will have the same biodiversity as the original forest. If the forest is replaced with only one species of tree and all other vegetation is prevented from growing back, a monoculture forest similar to agricultural crops would be the result. However, most reforestation involves the planting of different selections of seedlings taken from the area, often of multiple species.\nStored carbon being released.\nThere is also the risk that, through a forest fire or insect outbreak, much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere. Furthermore, the probability that legacy carbon will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forests. An example of this can be seen in the peatlands in Central Africa, which house an abundance of carbon in the mud called peat. Much like the forest fire or insect outbreak which can harm tropical rainforests, money can also be seen an incentive to harm forests and be paid off to protect it. The global greenhouse gas emissions caused by damage to tropical rainforests may be underestimated by a factor of six.\nAlso the possible harvesting and utilization of wood from reforested areas, limits the permanence of carbon sequestered through reforestation. For example, it was found that nearly half of the pledges under the Bonn Challenge were areas earmarked for commercial wood use.\nAdditionally the effects of afforestation and reforestation will be farther in the future than those of proforestation (the conservation of intact forests). It takes much longer \u2212 several decades \u2212 for the benefits for global warming to manifest to the same carbon sequestration benefits from mature trees in tropical forests and hence from limiting deforestation.\nSome researchers note that instead of planting entirely new areas, reconnecting forested areas and restoring the edges of forest, to protect their mature core and make them more resilient and longer-lasting, should be prioritized.\nImplementation challenges.\nThere are some implementation challenges:\nBy country.\nAsia.\nChina.\nAccording to China's government, the forest coverage of the country grew from 10% of the overall territory in 1949 to 25% in 2024.\nChina has introduced the Green Wall of China project, which aims to halt the expansion of the Gobi desert through the planting of trees. There has been a 47-million-hectare increase in forest area in China since the 1970s. The total number of trees amounted to be about 35 billion and 4.55% of China's land mass increased in forest coverage. The forest coverage was 12% in the early 1980s and had reached 16.55% by 2001.\nChina announced two large reforestation programs, the Natural Forest Protection Program and the Returning Farmland to Forest program, in late 1998.183 The programs were piloted in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu in 1999.183 They became widely implemented in 2000.183 The Natural Forest Protection Program called for major reductions in timber harvest, forest conservation, and instituted logging bans in most of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet.183 The program provided for alternative employment opportunities for former logging industry workers, including hiring them for reforestation work.183 The Returning Farmland to Forest program paid farmers to plant trees on less productive farmland and provided them with a yearly subsidy for lost income.183 In 2015 China announced a plan to plant 26 billion trees by the year 2025; that is, two trees for every Chinese citizen per year.\nBetween 2013 and 2018, China planted 338,000 square kilometres of forests, at a cost of $82.88 billion. By 2018, 21.7% of China's territory was covered by forests, a figure the government wants to increase to 26% by 2035. The total area of China is 9,596,961 square kilometres (see China), so 412,669 square kilometres more needs to be planted. According to the government's plan, by 2050, 30% of China's territory should be covered by forests.\nIn 2017, the Saihanba Afforestation Community won the UN Champions of the Earth Award in the Inspiration and Action category for their successful reforestation efforts, which began upon discovering the survival of a single tree.\nFrom 2016 to 2021, 3976 square kilometers of forests were planted in the Tibet Autonomous Region, with plans for 20 million trees to be planted before 2023.\nIn the years 2012\u20132022 China restored more than of forests. China committed to plant and conserve 70 billion trees by the year 2030 as part of the Trillion Tree Campaign.\nThe Jane Goodall Institute launched the Million Tree Project in Kulun Qi, Inner Mongolia to plant one million trees. China used 24 million hectares of new forest to offset 21% of Chinese fossil fuel emissions in 2000.\nThe Chinese government requires mining companies to restore the environment around exhausted mines by refilling excavated pits and planting crops or trees.53 Many mining companies use these recovered mines for ecotourism business.\nLaunched in 1978 and scheduled to last until 2050, the Three Northern Protected Forest Development Program \u2013 informally known as the \"Great Green Wall\" \u2013 aims to eventually plant nearly 90 million acres of new forest in a 2,800-mile stretch of northern China.\nOver 69.3 million hectares of forest were planted across China from 1999 to 2013. This large-scale reforestation contributed to China's forests sequestering 1.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38 Gt carbon per yr over the period 2010 to 2016. This amounted to about 45 percent of the yearly greenhouse gas emissions during that period in China.\nIndia.\nJadav Payeng had received national awards for reforestation efforts, known as the \"Molai forest\". He planted 1400 hectares of forest on the bank of river Brahmaputra alone. There are active reforestation efforts throughout the country. In 2016, India had more than 50\u00a0million trees planted in Uttar Pradesh and in 2017, more than 66\u00a0million trees planted in Madhya Pradesh. In addition to this and individual efforts, there are startup companies, such as Afforest, that are being created over the country working on reforestation.\nLots of plantation are being carried out in the Indian continent but the survivability is very poor especially for massive plantations, with less than 20% survivability rate. To improve the forest cover and to achieve the national mission of forest cover of 33%, there is a need to improve the methods of plantation. Rather than mass planting, there is a need to work on performance measurement &amp; tracking of trees growth. Taking this into consideration, a non-profit organization http:// in Jaipur is leading the development of a module of mass tracking for plantations. The pilot has been done successfully and the organization is hoping to implement nationwide by the end of 2021.\nJapan.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery explain that about two-thirds of Japanese land is covered with forests, and it was almost unchanged from 1966 to 2012. Japan needs to reduce 26% of greenhouse gas emission from 2013 by 2030 to accomplish Paris Agreement and is trying to reduce 2% of them by forestry.\nMass environmental and human-body pollution along with related deforestation, water pollution, smoke damage, and loss of soils caused by mining operations in Ashio, Tochigi became the first environmental social issue in Japan. Efforts by Sh\u014dz\u014d Tanaka had grown to large campaigns against the copper operation. This led to the creation of 'Watarase Yusuichi Pond', to settle the pollution which is a Ramsar site today. Reforestation was conducted as a part of afforestation due to inabilities of self-recovering by the natural land itself due to serious soil pollution and loss of woods consequence in loss of soils for plants to grow, thus needing artificial efforts involving introducing of healthy soils from outside. Starting from around 1897, about 50% of once bald mountains are now back to green.\nPakistan.\nThe Billion Tree Tsunami was launched in 2014 by planting 10 billion trees, by the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Imran Khan, as a response to the challenge of global warming. Pakistan's Billion Tree Tsunami restored 350,000 hectares of forests and degraded land to surpass its Bonn Challenge commitment.\nIn 2018, Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan declared that the country will plant 10 billion trees in the next five years.\nIn 2020, the Pakistani government launched an initiative to hire 63,600 laborers to plant trees in the northern Punjab region, with indigenous species such as acacia, mulberry and moringa. This initiative was meant to alleviate unemployment caused by lockdowns to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\nPhilippines.\nIn 2011, the Philippines established the National Greening Program as a priority program to help reduce poverty, promote food security, environmental stability, and biodiversity conservation, as well as enhance climate change mitigation and adaptation in the country. The program paved the way for the planting of almost 1.4 billion seedlings in about 1.66 million hectares nationwide during the 2011\u20132016 period. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ranked the Philippines fifth among countries reporting the greatest annual forest area gain, which reached 240,000 hectares during the 2010\u20132015 period.\nThailand.\nEfforts are being made in Thailand to restore the land after 800,000 hectares of forest have been destroyed in exchange for cash crop land to grow maize. Agroforestry has become part of the solution to fix the damage caused by deforestation. Agroforestry would affect the agriculture and atmosphere in Thailand in numerous ways. By planting a combination of different tree species, these trees are able to change the microclimatic conditions. Nutrient cycling also occurs when trees are incorporated in the agricultural system. It is also probable that the soil erosion that occurred as a result of deforestation can be mediated when these trees are planted.\nEurope.\nArmenia.\nThe Armenia Tree Project was founded in 1994 to address environmental and economic concerns related to Armenia's dwindling forests. Since its founding, the organization has planted more than 6.5 million trees in communities throughout Armenia.\nMy Forest Armenia was founded in 2019 and has since planted 910,000 trees in Armenia.\nIceland.\nPrior to the deforestation of Iceland in the Middle Ages, some 40% of the land was forested. Today, the country is about 2% forested, with the Icelandic Forest Service aiming to increase that share to 10% through reforestation and natural regrowth.\nIreland.\nIn 2019 the government of Ireland decided to plant 440\u00a0million trees by 2040. The decision is part of the government's plan to make Ireland carbon neutral by 2050 with renewable energy, land use change and carbon tax.\nIreland is also driven to increase sustainable timber consumption while also adding more eco friendly work positions. They also have taken efforts to limit the use of methane emissions by signing a pledge to draw back methane use by 30%.\nGermany.\nBy the 14th century, forests in heavily populated areas had been devastated by industry, many of which required wood for their activities. Peter Stromer (1310\u20131388), lord of the Stromer trading and commercial company, was spurred by this shortage to \"conduct forest culture experiments\". In 1368 he successfully sowed fir and pine seeds in the Nuremberg Reichswald, which over time ended the wood shortage and established the \"triumph of the pine in the Nuremberg Reichswald\" (at the expense of other deciduous trees). The \"doctrine of coniferous sowing\" spread widely through forestry regulations and other writing at the time.\nReforestation is required as part of the federal forest law. 31% of Germany is forested, according to the second forest inventory of 2001\u20132003. The size of the forest area in Germany increased between the first and the second forest inventory due to forestation of degenerated bogs and agricultural areas.\nUnited Kingdom.\nSince the 1980s, 8.5 million trees have been planted in the United Kingdom in an area of the Midlands around the villages of Moira and Donisthorpe, close to Leicester. The area is called The National Forest. An even larger reforestation project, called The Northern Forest, is beginning in South Yorkshire. It aims to plant 50 million trees. Despite this, the UK government has been criticized for not achieving its tree planting goals. There have also been concerns of non-native tree planting disturbing the ecological integrity and processes of what would be a native habitat restoration.\nMiddle East.\nIsrael.\nSince 1948, large reforestation and afforestation projects were accomplished in Israel. 240\u00a0million trees have been planted. The carbon sequestration rate in these forests is similar to the European temperate forests.\nIsrael and only one other country was documented to have a net increase of forestation in the 2000s. This type of progress could be attributed to the social practices that Israel incorporates into their society.\nLebanon.\nFor thousands of years Lebanon was covered by forests; one particular species of interest, \"Cedrus libani\" was exceptionally valuable and was almost eliminated due to lumbering operations. Many ancient cultures along the Mediterranean Sea harvested these trees including the Phoenicians who used cedar, pine and juniper for boat building, the Romans, who cut them down for lime-burning kilns, and the Ottomans, who used much of the remaining cedar forests of Lebanon as fuel in steam trains in the early 20th century. Despite two millennia of deforestation, forests in Lebanon still cover 13.6% of the country, and other wooded lands represent 11%.\nLaw No. 558, which was ratified by the Lebanese Parliament on April 19, 1996, aims to protect and expand existing forests, classifying all forests of cedar, fir, high juniper, evergreen cypress and other trees, whether diverse or homogeneous, whether state-owned or not as conserved forests.\nSince 2011 more than 600,000 trees, including cedars and other native species, have been planted throughout Lebanon as part of the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative, which aims to restore Lebanon's native forests. Projects financed locally and by international charity are performing extensive reforestation of cedar being carried out in the Mediterranean region, particularly in Lebanon and Turkey, where over 50\u00a0million young cedars are being planted annually.\nThe Lebanon Reforestation Initiative has been working with tree nurseries throughout Lebanon since 2012 to grow stronger seedlings with higher survival rates.\nTurkey.\nOf the country's 78\u00a0million hectares of land in total, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry aims to increase to 30% by 2023.\nFour thousand years ago, Anatolia was 60% to 70% forested. Although the flora of Turkey remains more biodiverse than many European countries, deforestation occurred during both prehistoric and historic times, including the Roman and Ottoman periods.\nSince the first forest code of 1937, the official government definition of 'forest' has varied. According to the current definition, 21\u00a0million hectares are forested, an increase of about 1\u00a0million hectares over the past thirty years, but only about half is 'productive'. However, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization definition of forest, about 12\u00a0million hectares was forested in 2015, about 15% of the land surface.\nThe amount of greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey removed by forests is very uncertain.As of 2019[ [update]], however, a new assessment is being made with the help of satellites and new soil measurements and better information should be available by 2020. According to the World Resources Institute \"Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities\", 50\u00a0million hectares are potential forest land, a similar area to the ancient Anatolian forest mentioned above. This could help limit climate change in Turkey. To help preserve the biodiversity of Turkey, more sustainable forestry has been suggested. Improved rangeland management is also needed.\nNational Forestation Day is on 11 November but, according to the agriculture and forestry trade union, although volunteers planted a record number of trees in 2019, most had died by 2020 in part due to lack of rainfall.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nNatural Resources Canada (The Department of Natural Resources) states that the national forest cover was decreased by 0.34% from 1990 to 2015, and Canada has the lowest deforestation rate in the world. The forest industry is one of the main industries in Canada, which contributes about 7% of Canadian economy, and about 9% of the forests on Earth are in Canada. Therefore, Canada has many policies and laws to commit to sustainable forest management. For example, 94% of Canadian forests are public land, and the government obligates planting trees after harvesting to public forests.\nUnited States.\nIt is the stated goal of the United States Forest Service (USFS) to manage forest resources sustainably. This includes reforestation after timber harvest, among other programs.\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) data shows that forest occupied about 46% of total U.S. land in 1630 (when European settlers began to arrive in large numbers), but had decreased to 34% by 1910. After 1910, forest area has remained almost constant although the U.S. population has increased substantially. In the late 19th century, the USFS was established in part to address the concern of natural disasters due to deforestation, and new reforestation programs and federal laws such as the Knutson-Vandenberg Act (1930) were implemented. The USFS states that human-directed reforestation is required to support natural regeneration and the agency engages in ongoing research into effective ways to restore forests.\nAs for the year 2020, the U.S. planted 2.5\u00a0billion trees per year. At the beginning of the year 2020, a bill that will increase the number to 3.3\u00a0billion, was proposed by the Republican Party, after President Donald Trump joined the Trillion Tree Campaign.\nLatin America.\nBolivia.\nTraining in reforestation for young people in Bolivia has been provided by Oxfam Interm\u00f3n.\nCosta Rica.\nThrough reforestation and environmental conservation, Costa Rica doubled its forest cover in 30 years between 1989 and 2019.\nCosta Rica has a long-standing commitment to the environment. The country is now one of the leaders of sustainability, biodiversity, and other protections. It wants to be completely fossil fuel free by 2050. The country has generated all of its electric power from renewable sources for three years as of 2019. It has committed to be carbon-free and plastic-free by 2021.\nAs of 2019, half of the country's land surface is covered with forests. They absorb a huge amount of carbon dioxide, combating climate change.\nIn the 1940s, more than 75% of the country was covered in mostly tropical rainforests and other indigenous woodlands. Between the 1940s and 1980s, extensive, uncontrolled logging led to severe deforestation. By 1983, only 26% of the country had forest cover. Realizing the devastation, policymakers took a stand. Through a continued environmental focus they were able to turn things around to the point that today forest cover has increased to 52%, two times more than 1983 levels.\nAn honorable world leader for ecotourism and conservation, Costa Rica has pioneered the development of payments for environmental services. Costa Rica's extensive system of environmental protection has been encouraging conservation and reforestation of the land by providing grants for environmental services. The system is not just advanced for its time but is also unparalleled in the world. It received great international attention.\nCosta Rica doubled its forest cover in 30 years using its system of grants and other payments for environmental services, including compensation for landowners. One of the main programs established in Costa Rica was the Forest Promotion Certificate in 1979 and is funded by international donations and nationwide taxes. The initiative is helping to protect the forests in the country, and is now helped pass both the Forest Law in 1986 and FONAFIFO in 1990 which insures the continuity of the conservation programs.\nCosta Rica's ambitious reforestation initiatives have transformed the landscape, fostering biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and sustainable land management practices.\nPeru.\nApproximately 59% of Peru is covered by forest. A history of political turmoil and the government's inability to enforce environmental regulations has led to the degradation of the forest and environment in Peru. A military coup in 1968 caused a loss of economic mobility in the Talara region and sparked a boom in illegal logging due to the lack of alternative economic opportunities. Illegal mining and logging operations are responsible for a great deal of Peru's deforestation and environmental damage. The Peruvian government has not been able to enforce an environmentally conscious mining formalization plan to protect the Amazon forest in the Madre de Dios region. The 1980s were known in Peru as the \"lost decade\" due to a nationwide internal conflict and severe economic crisis almost destroying the country and resulting in the state losing control over several regions. Many areas in Peru, including Madre de Dios, had no state presence until the government initiated a movement to 'conquer and populate the Amazon,' with the hopes of minimizing illegal and informal mining operations that had expanded in the region and were polluting the Amazonian rivers and the destroying of its forests.\nReforestation initiatives have expanded in the country since. In Peru, reforestation is essential to preserving the livelihoods of rural communities because much of the population relies on the forest in some way. Deforestation also disproportionally affects indigenous communities in Peru, which is why reforestation efforts are essential for the protection of many communities' livelihoods.\nSub-Saharan Africa.\nOne plan in this region, called Great Green Wall (Africa), involves planting a nine-mile width of trees on the Southern Border of the Sahara Desert for stopping its expansion to the south. However, this is more of an afforestation project than a reforestation one.\nIn 2019, Ethiopia begun a massive tree planting campaign \"Green Legacy\" with a target to plant 4\u00a0billion trees in one year. In one day only, over 350\u00a0million trees were planted.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some savannas may also be woodlands, such as \"savanna woodland\", where trees and shrubs form a light canopy.\nWoodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher-density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are often referred to as forests.\nExtensive efforts by conservationist groups have been made to preserve woodlands from urbanization and agriculture. For example, the woodlands of Northwest Indiana have been preserved as part of the Indiana Dunes.\nDefinitions.\nUnited Kingdom.\n\"Woodland\" is used in British woodland management to mean tree-covered areas which arose naturally and which are then managed. At the same time, forest is usually used in the British Isles to describe plantations, usually more extensive, or hunting forests, which are a land use with a legal definition and may not be wooded at all. The term \"ancient woodland\" is used in British nature conservation to refer to any wooded land that has existed since 1600, and often (though not always) for thousands of years, since the last Ice Age (equivalent to the American term old-growth forest)\nNorth America.\nIn ecosystem conservation, the term woodland refers to the plants, animals, and other biota that live in and under scattered trees that are spaced so that they produce more shade than a savanna but less than a forest. In central North America, the most numerous woodland trees are oaks. Woodlands typically require regular fire to maintain their biodiversity. Woodlands were historically among the most widespread ecosystem types but now are restricted to sites that receive regular prescribed burns or persist on very poor or dry soils. Details differ, as seen in definitions and examples given for Illinois, Wisconsin, and elsewhere in the Midwest.\nWoodlot is a closely related term in American forest management, which refers to a stand of trees generally used for firewood. While woodlots often technically have closed canopies, they are so small that light penetration from the edge makes them ecologically closer to woodland than forest. North American forests vary widely in their ecology and are greatly dependent on abiotic factors such as climate and elevation. Much of the old-growth deciduous and pine-dominated forests of the eastern United States was harvested for lumber, paper pulp, telephone poles, creosote, pitch, and tar.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, a woodland is defined as an area with a sparse (10\u201330%) cover of trees, and an open woodland has a very sparse (&lt;10%) cover. Woodlands are also subdivided into tall woodlands or low woodlands if their trees are over or under high, respectively. This contrasts with forests, which have more than 30% of their area covered by trees.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66988", "revid": "3019949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66988", "title": "Aksai Chin", "text": "Part of Kashmir administered by China\nAksai Chin is a region administered by China partly in He'an County and Hekang County of Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang, and partly in Rutog County of Ngari Prefecture, Tibet, and constituting the easternmost portion of the larger Kashmir region that has been the subject of a dispute between India and China since 1959. China administers the region and claims it as part of the Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous regions. India meanwhile claims it as part of Leh district in the union territory of Ladakh.\nName.\nAksai Chin was first mentioned by Muhammad Amin, the Yarkandi guide of the Schlagintweit brothers, who were contracted in 1854 by the British East India Company to explore Central Asia. Amin explained its meaning as \"the great white sand desert\". Linguist George van Driem states that the name intended by Amin was \"Aqsai Ch\u00f6l\" (; Cyrillic: \u0430\u049b\u0441\u0430\u0439 \u0447\u04e9\u043b) which could mean \"white ravine desert\" or \"white coomb desert\". The word \"ch\u00f6l\" for desert seems to have been corrupted in English transliteration into \"chin\".\nSome sources have interpreted \"Aksai\" to have the Uyghur meaning \"white stone desert\", including several British colonial, modern Western, Chinese, and Indian sources. Some modern sources interpret it to mean \"white brook\" instead. At least one source interprets \"Aksai\" to mean \"eastern\" in the Yarkandi Uyghur dialect.\nThe word \"Chin\" was taken to mean \"China\" by some Chinese, Western, and Indian sources. At least one source takes it to mean \"pass\". Other sources omit \"Chin\" in their interpretations. Van Driem states that there is no Uyghur word resembling \"chin\" for China.\nAmin's Aksai Chin was not a defined region, stretching indefinitely east into Tibet south of the Kunlun Mountains. In 1895, the British envoy to Kashgar told the Chinese Taotai that Aksai Chin was a \"loose name for an ill-defined, elevated tableland\", part of which lay in Indian and part in Chinese territory. \nThe current meaning of the term is the area under dispute between India and China, having evolved in repeated usage since Indian independence in 1947.\nHistory.\nBecause of its elevation, the desolation of Aksai Chin meant that it had no human importance. However, for military purposes the region was strategically important, as it lay on the only year-round passable route between the Tarim Basin and Tibet.\nLadakh was conquered in 1842 by the armies of Raja Gulab Singh (Dogra) under the suzerainty of the Sikh Empire. The British defeat of the Sikhs in 1846 resulted in the transfer of the Jammu and Kashmir region including Ladakh to the British, who then installed Gulab Singh as the Maharaja under their suzerainty. The British appointed a boundary commission headed by Alexander Cunningham to determine the boundaries of the state. Chinese and Tibetan officials were invited to jointly demarcate the border, but they did not show any interest. The British boundary commissioners fixed the southern part of the boundary up to the Chang Chenmo Valley, but regarded the area north of it as \"terra incognita\".\nThe Johnson Line.\nWilliam Johnson, a civil servant with the Survey of India proposed the \"Johnson Line\" in 1865, which put Aksai Chin in Kashmir. This was the time of the Dungan revolt, when China did not control most of Xinjiang, so this line was never presented to the Chinese. Johnson presented this line to the Maharaja of Kashmir, who then claimed the 18,000 square kilometres contained within, and by some accounts territory further north as far as the Sanju Pass in the Kun Lun Mountains. The Maharajah of Kashmir constructed a fort at Shahidulla (modern-day Xaidulla), and had troops stationed there for some years to protect caravans. Eventually, most sources placed Shahidulla and the upper Karakash River firmly within the territory of Xinjiang (see accompanying map). According to Francis Younghusband, who explored the region in the late 1880s, there was only an abandoned fort and not one inhabited house at Shahidulla when he was there \u2013 it was just a convenient staging post and a convenient headquarters for the nomadic Kirghiz. The abandoned fort had apparently been built a few years earlier by the Kashmiris. In 1878 the Chinese had reconquered Xinjiang, and by 1890 they already had Shahidulla before the issue was decided. By 1892, China had erected boundary markers at Karakoram Pass.\nIn 1897, a British military officer, Sir John Ardagh, proposed a boundary line along the crest of the Kun Lun Mountains north of the Yarkand River. At that time, Britain was concerned about the danger of Russian expansion as China weakened, and Ardagh argued that his line was more defensible. The Ardagh line was effectively a modification of the Johnson line, and became known as the \"Johnson-Ardagh Line\".\nThe Macartney\u2013Macdonald Line.\nIn 1893, Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at St. Petersburg, gave maps of the region to George Macartney, the British consul general at Kashgar, which coincided in broad details. In 1899, Britain proposed a revised boundary, initially suggested by Macartney and developed by the Governor General of India Lord Elgin. This boundary placed the Lingzi Tang plains, which are south of the Laktsang range, in India, and Aksai Chin proper, which is north of the Laktsang range, in China. This border, along the Karakoram Mountains, was proposed and supported by British officials for a number of reasons. The Karakoram Mountains formed a natural boundary, which would set the British borders up to the Indus River watershed while leaving the Tarim River watershed in Chinese control, and Chinese control of this tract would present a further obstacle to Russian advance in Central Asia. The British presented this line, known as the Macartney\u2013MacDonald Line, to the Chinese in 1899 in a note by Sir Claude MacDonald. The Qing government did not respond to the note. According to some commentators, China believed that this had been the accepted boundary.\n1899 to 1947.\nBoth the Johnson-Ardagh and the Macartney-MacDonald lines were used on British maps of India. Until at least 1908, the British took the Macdonald line to be the boundary, but in 1911, the Xinhai Revolution resulted in the collapse of central power in China, and by the end of World War I, the British officially used the Johnson Line. However they took no steps to establish outposts or assert actual control on the ground. In 1927, the line was adjusted again as the government of British India abandoned the Johnson line in favor of a line along the Karakoram range further south. However, the maps were not updated and still showed the Johnson Line.\nFrom 1917 to 1933, the \"Postal Atlas of China\", published by the Government of China in Peking had shown the boundary in Aksai Chin as per the Johnson line, which runs along the Kunlun Mountains. The \"Peking University Atlas\", published in 1925, also put the Aksai Chin in India. When British officials learned of Soviet officials surveying the Aksai Chin for Sheng Shih-tsai, warlord of Xinjiang in 1940\u20131941, they again advocated the Johnson Line. At this point the British had still made no attempts to establish outposts or control over the Aksai Chin, nor was the issue ever discussed with the governments of China or Tibet, and the boundary remained undemarcated at India's independence.\nSince 1947.\nAfter Jammu and Kashmir acceded to the newly independent India in October 1947, the government of India used the Johnson Line as the basis for its official boundary in the west, which included the Aksai Chin. From the Karakoram Pass (which is not under dispute), the Indian claim line extends northeast of the Karakoram Mountains through the salt flats of the Aksai Chin, to set a boundary at the Kunlun Mountains, and incorporating part of the Karakash River and Yarkand River watersheds. From there, it runs east along the Kunlun Mountains, before turning southwest through the Aksai Chin salt flats, through the Karakoram Mountains, and then to Panggong Lake.\nOn 1 July 1954, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru wrote a memo directing that the maps of India be revised to show definite boundaries on all frontiers. Up to this point, the boundary in the Aksai Chin sector, based on the Johnson Line, had been described as \"undemarcated.\"\nDespite this region being nearly uninhabitable and having no resources, it remains strategically important for China as it connects Tibet and Xinjiang. During the 1950s, the People's Republic of China built a 1,200\u00a0km (750\u00a0mi) China National Highway 219 connecting Xinjiang and western Tibet, of which 179\u00a0km (112\u00a0mi) ran south of the Johnson Line through the Aksai Chin region claimed by India. Aksai Chin was easily accessible to the Chinese, but was more difficult for the Indians on the other side of the Karakorams to reach. The Indians did not learn of the existence of the road until 1957, which was confirmed when the road was shown in Chinese maps published in 1958. The construction of this highway was one of the triggers for the Sino-Indian War of 1962.\nThe Indian position, as stated by Prime Minister Nehru, was that the Aksai Chin was \"part of the Ladakh region of India for centuries\" and that this northern border was a \"firm and definite one which was not open to discussion with anybody\".\nThe Chinese premier Zhou Enlai argued that the western border had never been delimited, that the Macartney-MacDonald Line, which left the Aksai Chin within Chinese borders was the only line ever proposed to a Chinese government, and that the Aksai Chin was already under Chinese jurisdiction, and that negotiations should take into account the status quo.\nIn June 2006, satellite imagery on the Google Earth service revealed a 1:500 scale terrain model of eastern Aksai Chin and adjacent Tibet, built near the town of Huangyangtan, about southwest of Yinchuan, the capital of the autonomous region of Ningxia in China. A visual side-by-side comparison shows a very detailed duplication of Aksai Chin in the camp. The model was surrounded by a substantial facility, with rows of red-roofed buildings, scores of olive-coloured trucks and a large compound with elevated lookout posts and a large communications tower. Such terrain models are known to be used in military training and simulation, although usually on a much smaller scale.\nLocal authorities in Ningxia claim that their model of Aksai Chin is part of a tank training ground, built in 1998 or 1999.\nIn August 2017, Indian and Chinese forces near Pangong Tso threw rocks at each other.\nOn 11 September 2019, People's Liberation Army troops confronted Indian troops on the northern bank of Pangong Lake.\nA continued face-off in the 2020 China\u2013India skirmishes of May and June 2020 between Indian and Chinese troops near Pangong Tso Lake culminated in a violent clash on 16 June 2020, with at least 20 deaths on the Indian side and no official reported deaths on the Chinese side. In 2021, Chinese state media reported four Chinese deaths. Both sides claimed provocation from the other.\nGeography.\nAksai Chin is one of the two large disputed border areas between India and China. India claims Aksai Chin as the easternmost part of the union territory of Ladakh. China claims that Aksai Chin is part of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibet Autonomous Region. The line that separates Indian-administered areas of Ladakh from Aksai Chin is known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and is concurrent with the Chinese Aksai Chin claim line.\nThe Aksai region is a sparsely populated region with few settlements such as Heweitan, Khurnak Fort, Tianshuihai and Dahongliutan and Kangxiwar which lays north of it, with the latter being the forward headquarters of the Xinjiang Military Command during the 1962 Sino-Indian War.\nAksai Chin covers an area of approximately . The area is largely a vast high-altitude desert with a low point (on the \"Karakash River\") at about above sea level. In the southwest, mountains up to extending southeast from the Depsang Plains form the \"de facto\" border (Line of Actual Control) between Aksai Chin and Indian-controlled Kashmir.\nIn the north, the Kunlun Range separates Aksai Chin from the Tarim Basin, where the rest of Hotan Prefecture is situated. As of 2008[ [update]], no roads crossed the Kunlun Range within Hotan Prefecture, and only one track does so, over the Hindutash Pass.\nAksai Chin area has number of endorheic basins with many salt or soda lakes. The major salt lakes are Surigh Yilganing Kol, Tso Tang, Aksai Chin Lake, Hongshan Lake, etc. Much of the northern part of Aksai Chin is referred to as the Soda Plains, located near Aksai Chin's largest river, the Karakash, which receives meltwater from a number of glaciers, crosses the Kunlun farther northwest, in Hekang County and enters the Tarim Basin, where it serves as one of the main sources of water for Karakax and Hotan Counties.\nThe western part of Aksai Chin region is drained by the Tarim River. The eastern part of the region contains several small endorheic basins. The largest of them is that of the Aksai Chin Lake, which is fed by the river of the same name. The region as a whole receives little precipitation as the Himalayas and the Karakoram block the rains from the Indian monsoon.\nThe nearby Trans-Karakoram Tract is also the subject of ongoing dispute between China and India in the Kashmir dispute.\nDemographics and economics.\nPrior to 1950, the visitors of Aksai Chin were, for the most part, the occasional explorers, hunters, and nomads who passed through the area.\nPrior to European exploration in the 1860s, there were some jade mining operations on the Xinjiang side of Aksai Chin. They were abandoned by the time European explorers reached the area. In the 1860s to 1870s, in order to facilitate trade between the Indian subcontinent and Tarim Basin, the British attempted to promote a caravan route via the western side of Aksai Chin as an alternative to the difficult and tariffed Karakoram Pass. The route, referred to as the Chang Chenmo line after the starting point in Chang Chenmo River valley, was discussed in the House of Commons in 1874. In addition of being longer and higher elevation than Karakoram Pass, it also goes through the desolate desert of Aksai Chin. By 1890s, traders had mostly given up on this route.\nIn the 1958, India collected salt from various lakes in Aksai Chin to study the economic feasibility of salt mining operations in the area.\nBy the end of the 1950s, in addition to having constructed a road, numerous PLA Ground Force outposts were constructed in a few locations, including at Tianwendian, Kongka Pass, Heweitan and Tianshuihai. The road was later upgraded to the China National Highway 219. In the modern day, there are a few businesses along the highway serving motorists.\nIn the 2010s, geological surveys were conducted in the Western Kunlun region, which Aksai Chin is part of. Huoshaoyun, a major lead-zinc deposit, and numerous smaller deposits were discovered in the region. Huoshaoyun is a mountain located in Aksai Chin near the Tibetan border. The mining development for Huoshaoyun started in 2017.\nTransportation.\nChina National Highway 219 runs through Aksai Chin connecting Tibet (Ngari Prefecture) and Xinjiang (Hotan Prefecture).\nIn July 2022, Ministry of Transport of China published updated \"China National Highway Network Plan\" that includes China National Highway 695 which will go from Lh\u00fcnz\u00ea Town, Lh\u00fcnz\u00ea County, Tibet to Mazar Township, Yining County, Xinjiang travelling through Aksai Chin.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66991", "revid": "46696839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66991", "title": "The Blind Watchmaker", "text": "Book by Richard Dawkins\nThe Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design is a 1986 book by Richard Dawkins, in which he presents an explanation of, and argument for, the theory of evolution by means of natural selection. He also presents arguments to refute certain criticisms made of his first book, \"The Selfish Gene\". (Both books espouse the gene-centered view of evolution.) It was illustrated by Liz Pyle. It won the \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Prize for Current interest. A computer program of the same name was released and it was the basis for a BBC documentary. An audiobook was released, read by Dawkins and Lalla Ward.\nBackground.\nThe title of the book refers to the watchmaker analogy made famous by William Paley in his 1802 book \"Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\". Paley, writing long before Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, held that the complexity of living organisms was evidence of the existence of a divine creator by drawing a parallel with the way in which the existence of a watch compels belief in an intelligent watchmaker. Dawkins, in contrasting the differences between human design and its potential for planning with the workings of natural selection, therefore dubbed evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker.\n 1. Explaining the Very Improbable\n Dawkins addresses the argument from design. He emphasizes that natural selection is nonrandom (since only adaptive traits are selected for) and cumulative (as adaptive traits accumulate). \n2. Good Design\n Dawkins discusses the evolution of echolocation in bats. Many animals have some ability to navigate by sound. Such abilities can be honed by natural selection to produce the sophisticated sonar seen in bats.\n 3. Accumulating Small Change\nDawkins writes that \"We have seen that living things are too improbable and too beautifully 'designed' to have come into existence by chance. How then, did they come into existence? The answer, Darwin's answer, is by gradual, step-by-step transformations from simple beginnings. ... Each successive change in the gradual evolutionary process was simple enough, \"relative to its predecessor\", to have arisen by chance. But the whole sequence of cumulative steps constitutes anything but a chance process. ... The cumulative process is directed by non-random survival.\"\nDawkins illustrates the difference between the potential for the development of complexity as a result of pure randomness, as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer simulation of artificial selection implemented in a program also called \"The Blind Watchmaker\", which was sold separately as a teaching aid.\nThe program displayed a two-dimensional shape (a \"biomorph\") made up of straight black lines, the length, position, and angle of which were defined by a simple set of rules and instructions (analogous to a genome). Adding new lines (or removing them) based on these rules offered a discrete set of possible new shapes (mutations), which were displayed on screen so that the user could choose between them. The chosen mutation would then be the basis for another generation of biomorph mutants to be chosen from, and so on. Thus, the user, by selection, could steer the evolution of biomorphs. This process often produced images which were reminiscent of real organisms, for instance beetles, bats, or trees. Dawkins speculated that the unnatural selection role played by the user in this program could be replaced by a more natural agent if, for example, colourful biomorphs could be selected by butterflies or other insects, via a touch-sensitive display set up in a garden.\n 4: Making Tracks Through Animal Space\n Dawkins looks at the evolution of the eye. Many animals have a patch of light-sensitive cells. Natural selection would favor the formation of a \"cup\" which can detect direction. From there you can get a pinhole camera eye, as seen in the chambered nautilus. The addition of a lens results in the cephalopod eye. \"For each of these types of eye, stages corresponding to evolutionary intermediates exist as working eyes among modern animals.\" Any improvements would be favored by natural selection. In fact, eyes have evolved several times independently, an example of convergent evolution. He returns to echolocation, noting that \"Any animal that can hear at all may hear echoes. Blind humans frequently learn to make use of these echoes. A rudimentary version of such a skill in ancestral mammals would have provide ample raw material for natural selection to build upon, leading by gradual degrees to the high perfection of bats.\" Echolocation also seems to have evolved several times independently, another example of convergent evolution.\n5. The power and the archives\n Dawkins looks at genetics. Gregor Mendel discovered that inheritance is particulate. R. A. Fisher united Darwin and Mendel in the modern synthesis. \n6. Origins and miracles \nDawkins looks at the origin of life, including the work of Graham Cairns-Smith.\n7. Constructive evolution\nDawkins looks at evolutionary arms races between predator and prey, and the Red Queen's hypothesis. Gene duplication is introduced as a means of increasing a species's genetic capacity.\n8. Explosions and spirals\nDawkins looks at Darwin's concept of sexual selection, revived by R. A. Fisher. It is thought that peacocks evolved colorful plumage to attract peahens. But the peahens are also passing along genes preferring plumage. This is an example of linkage disequilibrium, which can lead to runaway evolution. \n9. Puncturing punctualism\nDawkins examines the punctuated equilibrium theory of Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould.\n10. The one true tree of life\nDawkins examines molecular taxonomy. Neutral mutations serve as molecular clocks that allow us to tell when species diverged. \nSynopsis.\n11: Doomed rivals\nDawkins examines alternatives to natural selection, like Lamarckism, and finds them wanting. \nIn an appendix to the 1996 edition, Dawkins explains how his experiences \nwith computer models led him to a greater appreciation of the role of embryological constraints on natural selection. In particular, he recognised that certain patterns of embryological development could lead to the success of a related \"group\" of species in filling varied ecological niches, though he emphasised that this should not be confused with group selection. He dubbed this insight \"the evolution of evolvability\".\nReception.\nTim Radford, writing in \"The Guardian\", noted that despite Dawkins's \"combative secular humanism\", he had written \"a patient, often beautiful book... that begins in a generous mood and sustains its generosity to the end.\" 30 years on, people still read the book, Radford argues, because it is \"one of the best books ever to address, patiently and persuasively, the question that has baffled bishops and disconcerted dissenters alike: how did nature achieve its astonishing complexity and variety?\"\nPhilosopher and historian of biology Michael T. Ghiselin, writing in \"The New York Times\", comments that Dawkins \"succeeds admirably in showing how natural selection allows biologists to dispense with such notions as purpose and design\". He notes that analogies with computer programs have their limitations, but are still useful. Ghiselin observes that Dawkins is \"not content with rebutting creationists\" but goes on to press home his arguments against alternative theories to neo-Darwinism. He thinks the book fills the need to know more about evolution that creationists \"would conceal from them.\" He concludes that \"Readers who are not outraged will be delighted.\"\nKenneth R. Miller writes that Dawkins \"brilliantly explains how complex mechanisms and structures are put together by the process of evolution\" adding \"It is true that he makes certain theological points that I don\u2019t agree with.\"\nJerry Coyne also recommends the book: \"I\u2019ve always thought of Dawkins as an extremely smart child. He is not a child of course, he\u2019s a really brilliant man. But he looks at things with the eyes of a child, in a way that I don\u2019t think any scientist who wrote really well, including Stephen Jay Gould, ever could. He sees things with this fresh viewpoint that brings them alive.\"\nThe American philosopher of religion Dallas Willard, reflecting on the book, denies the connection of evolution to the validity of arguments from design to God: whereas, he asserts, Dawkins seems to consider the arguments to rest entirely on that basis. Willard argues that Chapter 6, \"Origins and Miracles\", attempts the \"hard task\" of making not just a blind watchmaker but \"a blind watchmaker watchmaker\", which he comments would have made an \"honest\" title for the book. He notes that Dawkins demolishes several \"weak\" arguments, such as the argument from personal incredulity. He denies that Dawkins's computer \"exercises\" and arguments from gradual change show that complex forms of life could have evolved. Willard concludes by arguing that in writing this book, Dawkins is not functioning as a scientist \"in the line of Darwin\", but as \"just a naturalist metaphysician\".\nInfluence.\nThe engineer Theo Jansen read the book in 1986 and became fascinated by evolution and natural selection. Since 1990 he has been building kinetic sculptures, the \"Strandbeest\", capable of walking when impelled by the wind.\nThe journalist Dick Pountain described Sean B. Carroll's 2005 account of evolutionary developmental biology, \"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\", as the most important popular science book since \"The Blind Watchmaker\", \"and in effect a sequel [to it].\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66996", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66996", "title": "Kin selection", "text": "Evolutionary strategy favoring relatives\nKin selection is a process whereby natural selection favours a trait due to its positive effects on the reproductive success of an organism's relatives, even when at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction. Kin selection can lead to the evolution of altruistic behaviour. It is related to inclusive fitness, which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others (weighted by the relatedness between individuals). A broader definition of kin selection includes selection acting on interactions between individuals who share a gene of interest even if the gene is not shared due to common ancestry.\nCharles Darwin discussed the concept of kin selection in his 1859 book, \"On the Origin of Species\", where he reflected on the puzzle of sterile social insects, such as honey bees, which leave reproduction to their mothers, arguing that a selection benefit to related organisms (the same \"stock\") would allow the evolution of a trait that confers the benefit but destroys an individual at the same time. J.B.S. Haldane in 1955 briefly alluded to the principle in limited circumstances (Haldane famously joked that he would willingly die for two brothers or eight cousins), and R.A. Fisher mentioned a similar principle even more briefly in 1930. However, it was not until 1964 that W.D. Hamilton generalised the concept and developed it mathematically (resulting in Hamilton's rule) that it began to be widely accepted. The mathematical treatment was made more elegant in 1970 due to advances made by George R. Price. The term \"kin selection\" was first used by John Maynard Smith in 1964.\nAccording to Hamilton's rule, kin selection causes genes to increase in frequency when the genetic relatedness of a recipient to an actor multiplied by the benefit to the recipient is greater than the reproductive cost to the actor. Hamilton proposed two mechanisms for kin selection. First, kin recognition allows individuals to be able to identify their relatives. Second, in viscous populations, populations in which the movement of organisms from their place of birth is relatively slow, local interactions tend to be among relatives by default. The viscous population mechanism makes kin selection and social cooperation possible in the absence of kin recognition. In this case, nurture kinship, the interaction between related individuals, simply as a result of living in each other's proximity, is sufficient for kin selection, given reasonable assumptions about population dispersal rates. Kin selection is not the same thing as group selection, where natural selection is believed to act on the group as a whole.\nIn humans, altruism is both more likely and on a larger scale with kin than with unrelated individuals; for example, humans give presents according to how closely related they are to the recipient. In other species, vervet monkeys use allomothering, where related females such as older sisters or grandmothers often care for young, according to their relatedness. The social shrimp \"Synalpheus regalis\" protects juveniles within highly related colonies.\nHistorical overview.\nCharles Darwin was the first to discuss the concept of kin selection (without using that term). In \"On the Origin of Species\", he wrote about the conundrum represented by altruistic sterile social insects that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the desired end. Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together. An animal thus characterised has been slaughtered, but the breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has succeeded.\u2014\u200a\nIn this passage \"the family\" and \"stock\" stand for a kin group. These passages and others by Darwin about kin selection are highlighted in D.J. Futuyma's textbook of reference \"Evolutionary Biology\" and in E. O. Wilson's \"\".\nKin selection was briefly referred to by R.A. Fisher in 1930 and J.B.S. Haldane in 1932 and 1955. J.B.S. Haldane grasped the basic quantities in kin selection, famously writing \"I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins\". Haldane's remark alluded to the fact that if an individual loses its life to save two siblings, four nephews, or eight cousins, it is a \"fair deal\" in evolutionary terms, as siblings are on average 50% identical by descent, nephews 25%, and cousins 12.5% (in a diploid population that is randomly mating and previously outbred). But Haldane also joked that he would truly die only to save more than a single identical twin of his or more than two full siblings. In 1955 he clarified:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let us suppose that you carry a rare gene that affects your behaviour so that you jump into a flooded river and save a child, but you have one chance in ten of being drowned, while I do not possess the gene, and stand on the bank and watch the child drown. If the child's your own child or your brother or sister, there is an even chance that this child will also have this gene, so five genes will be saved in children for one lost in an adult. If you save a grandchild or a nephew, the advantage is only two and a half to one. If you only save a first cousin, the effect is very slight. If you try to save your first cousin once removed the population is more likely to lose this valuable gene than to gain it. \u2026 It is clear that genes making for conduct of this kind would only have a chance of spreading in rather small populations when most of the children were fairly near relatives of the man who risked his life.\nW. D. Hamilton, in 1963 and especially in 1964 generalised the concept and developed it mathematically, showing that it holds for genes even when they are not rare, deriving Hamilton's rule and defining a new quantity known as an individual's inclusive fitness. He is widely credited as the founder of the field of social evolution. A more elegant mathematical treatment was made possible by George Price in 1970.\nJohn Maynard Smith may have coined the actual term \"kin selection\" in 1964:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These processes I will call kin selection and group selection respectively. Kin selection has been discussed by Haldane and by Hamilton. \u2026 By kin selection I mean the evolution of characteristics which favour the survival of close relatives of the affected individual, by processes which do not require any discontinuities in the population breeding structure.\nKin selection causes changes in gene frequency across generations, driven by interactions between related individuals. This dynamic forms the conceptual basis of the theory of sociobiology. Some cases of evolution by natural selection can only be understood by considering how biological relatives influence each other's fitness. Under natural selection, a gene encoding a trait that enhances the fitness of each individual carrying it should increase in frequency within the population; and conversely, a gene that lowers the individual fitness of its carriers should be eliminated. However, a hypothetical gene that prompts behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the behaviour, may nonetheless increase in frequency, because relatives often carry the same gene. According to this principle, the enhanced fitness of relatives can at times more than compensate for the fitness loss incurred by the individuals displaying the behaviour, making kin selection possible. This is a special case of a more general model, \"inclusive fitness\". This analysis has been challenged, Wilson writing that \"the foundations of the general theory of inclusive fitness based on the theory of kin selection have crumbled\" and that he now relies instead on the theory of eusociality and \"gene-culture co-evolution\" for the underlying mechanics of sociobiology. Inclusive fitness theory is still generally accepted however, as demonstrated by the publication of a rebuttal to Wilson's claims in \"Nature\" from over a hundred researchers.\nKin selection is contrasted with group selection, according to which a genetic trait can become prevalent within a group because it benefits the group as a whole, regardless of any benefit to individual organisms. All known forms of group selection conform to the principle that an individual behaviour can be evolutionarily successful only if the genes responsible for this behaviour conform to Hamilton's Rule, and hence, on balance and in the aggregate, benefit from the behaviour.\nHamilton's rule.\nFormally, genes for a particular behavior should increase in frequency when\nformula_1\nwhere\n\"r\" = the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the actor, often defined as the probability that a gene picked randomly from each at the same locus is identical by descent.\n\"B\" = the additional reproductive benefit gained by the recipient of the altruistic act,\n\"C\" = the reproductive cost to the individual performing the act.\nThis inequality is known as Hamilton's rule after W. D. Hamilton who in 1964 published the first formal quantitative treatment of kin selection.\nThe relatedness parameter (\"r\") in Hamilton's rule was introduced in 1922 by Sewall Wright as a coefficient of relationship that gives the probability that at a random locus, the alleles there will be identical by descent. Modern formulations of the rule use Alan Grafen's definition of relatedness based on the theory of linear regression.\nA 2014 review of many lines of evidence for Hamilton's rule found that its predictions were confirmed in a wide variety of social behaviours across a broad phylogenetic range of birds, mammals and insects, in each case comparing social and non-social taxa. Among the experimental findings, a 2010 study used a wild population of red squirrels in Yukon, Canada. Surrogate mothers adopted related orphaned squirrel pups but not unrelated orphans. The cost of adoption was calculated by measuring a decrease in the survival probability of the entire litter after increasing the litter by one pup, while benefit was measured as the increased chance of survival of the orphan. The degree of relatedness of the orphan and surrogate mother for adoption to occur depended on the number of pups the surrogate mother already had in her nest, as this affected the cost of adoption. Females always adopted orphans when \"rB\" was greater than \"C\", but never adopted when \"rB\" was less than \"C\", supporting Hamilton's rule.\nMechanisms.\nAltruism occurs where the instigating individual suffers a fitness loss while the receiving individual experiences a fitness gain. The sacrifice of one individual to help another is an example.\nHamilton outlined two ways in which kin selection altruism could be favoured:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKin recognition and the green beard effect.\nFirst, if individuals have the capacity to recognise kin and to discriminate (positively) on the basis of kinship, then the average relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough for kin selection. Because of the facultative nature of this mechanism, kin recognition and discrimination were expected to be unimportant except among 'higher' forms of life. However, as molecular recognition mechanisms have been shown to operate in organisms such as slime moulds kin recognition has much wider importance than previously recognised. Kin recognition may be selected for inbreeding avoidance, and little evidence indicates that 'innate' kin recognition plays a role in mediating altruism. A thought experiment on the kin recognition/discrimination distinction is the hypothetical 'green beard', where a gene for social behaviour is imagined also to cause a distinctive phenotype that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene. Due to conflicting genetic similarity in the rest of the genome, there should be selection pressure for green-beard altruistic sacrifices to be suppressed, making common ancestry the most likely form of inclusive fitness. This suppression is overcome if new phenotypes -other beard colours- are formed through mutation or introduced into the population from time to time. This proposed mechanism goes by the name of 'beard chromodynamics'.\nViscous populations.\nSecondly, indiscriminate altruism may be favoured in \"viscous\" populations, those with low rates or short ranges of dispersal. Here, social partners are typically related, and so altruism can be selective advantageous without the need for kin recognition and kin discrimination faculties\u2014spatial proximity, together with limited dispersal, ensures that social interactions are more often with related individuals. This suggests a rather general explanation for altruism. Directional selection always favours those with higher rates of fecundity within a certain population. Social individuals can often enhance the survival of their own kin by participating in and following the rules of their own group.\nHamilton later modified his thinking to suggest that an innate ability to recognise actual genetic relatedness was unlikely to be the dominant mediating mechanism for kin altruism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees.\nHamilton's later clarifications often go unnoticed. Stuart West and colleagues have countered the long-standing assumption that kin selection requires innate powers of kin recognition. Another doubtful assumption is that social cooperation must be based on limited dispersal and shared developmental context. Such ideas have obscured the progress made in applying kin selection to species including humans, on the basis of cue-based mediation of social bonding and social behaviours.\nSpecial cases.\nEusociality.\nEusociality (true sociality) occurs in social systems with three characteristics: an overlap in generations between parents and their offspring, cooperative brood care, and specialised castes of non-reproductive individuals. The social insects provide good examples of organisms with what appear to be kin selected traits. The workers of some species are sterile, a trait that would not occur if individual selection was the only process at work. The relatedness coefficient \"r\" is abnormally high between the worker sisters in a colony of Hymenoptera due to haplodiploidy. Hamilton's rule is presumed to be satisfied because the benefits in fitness for the workers are believed to exceed the costs in terms of lost reproductive opportunity, though this has never been demonstrated empirically. Competing hypotheses have been offered to explain the evolution of social behaviour in such organisms.\nThe eusocial shrimp \"Synalpheus regalis\" protects juveniles in the colony. By defending the young, the large defender shrimp can increase its inclusive fitness. Allozyme data demonstrated high relatedness within colonies, averaging 0.50. This means that colonies represent close kin groups, supporting the hypothesis of kin selection.\nAllomothering.\nVervet monkeys utilise allomothering, parenting by group members other than the actual mother or father, where the allomother is typically an older female sibling or a grandmother. Individuals act aggressively toward other individuals that were aggressive toward their relatives. The behaviour implies kin selection between siblings, between mothers and offspring, and between grandparents and grandchildren.\nIn humans.\nWhether or not Hamilton's rule always applies, relatedness is often important for human altruism, in that humans are inclined to behave more altruistically toward kin than toward unrelated individuals. Many people choose to live near relatives, exchange sizeable gifts with relatives, and favour relatives in wills in proportion to their relatedness.\nExperimental studies, interviews, and surveys.\nInterviews of several hundred women in Los Angeles showed that while non-kin friends were willing to help one another, their assistance was far more likely to be reciprocal. The largest amounts of non-reciprocal help, however, were reportedly provided by kin. Additionally, more closely related kin were considered more likely sources of assistance than distant kin. Similarly, several surveys of American college students found that individuals were more likely to incur the cost of assisting kin when a high probability that relatedness and benefit would be greater than cost existed. Participants' feelings of helpfulness were stronger toward family members than non-kin. Additionally, participants were found to be most willing to help those individuals most closely related to them. Interpersonal relationships between kin in general were more supportive and less Machiavellian than those between non-kin.\nIn one experiment, the longer participants (from both the UK and the South African Zulus) held a painful skiing position, the more money or food was presented to a given relative. Participants repeated the experiment for individuals of different relatedness (parents and siblings at r=.5, grandparents, nieces, and nephews at r=.25, etc.). The results showed that participants held the position for longer intervals the greater the degree of relatedness between themselves and those receiving the reward.\nObservational studies.\nA study of food-sharing practices on the West Caroline islets of Ifaluk determined that food-sharing was more common among people from the same islet, possibly because the degree of relatedness between inhabitants of the same islet would be higher than relatedness between inhabitants of different islets. When food was shared between islets, the distance the sharer was required to travel correlated with the relatedness of the recipient\u2014a greater distance meant that the recipient needed to be a closer relative. The relatedness of the individual and the potential inclusive fitness benefit needed to outweigh the energy cost of transporting the food over distance.\nHumans may use the inheritance of material goods and wealth to maximise their inclusive fitness. By providing close kin with inherited wealth, an individual may improve his or her kin's reproductive opportunities and thus increase his or her own inclusive fitness even after death. A study of a thousand wills found that the beneficiaries who received the most inheritance were generally those most closely related to the will's writer. Distant kin received proportionally less inheritance, with the least amount of inheritance going to non-kin.\nA study of childcare practices among Canadian women found that respondents with children provide childcare reciprocally with non-kin. The cost of caring for non-kin was balanced by the benefit a woman received\u2014having her own offspring cared for in return. However, respondents without children were significantly more likely to offer childcare to kin. For individuals without their own offspring, the inclusive fitness benefits of providing care to closely related children might outweigh the time and energy costs of childcare.\nFamily investment in offspring among black South African households also appears consistent with an inclusive fitness model. A higher degree of relatedness between children and their caregivers was correlated with a higher degree of investment in the children, with more food, health care, and clothing. Relatedness was also associated with the regularity of a child's visits to local medical practitioners and with the highest grade the child had completed in school, and negatively associated with children being behind in school for their age.\nObservation of the Dolgan hunter-gatherers of northern Russia suggested that there are larger and more frequent asymmetrical transfers of food to kin. Kin are more likely to be welcomed to non-reciprocal meals, while non-kin are discouraged from attending. Finally, when reciprocal food-sharing occurs between families, these families are often closely related, and the primary beneficiaries are the offspring.\nViolence in families is more likely when step-parents are present, and that \"genetic relationship is associated with a softening of conflict, and people's evident valuations of themselves and of others are systematically related to the parties' reproductive values\". Numerous studies suggest how inclusive fitness may work amongst different peoples, such as the Ye'kwana of southern Venezuela, the Gypsies of Hungary, and the doomed Donner Party of the United States.\nHuman social patterns.\nEvolutionary psychologists, following early human sociobiologists' interpretation of kin selection theory initially attempted to explain human altruistic behaviour through kin selection by stating that \"behaviors that help a genetic relative are favored by natural selection.\" However, many evolutionary psychologists recognise that this common shorthand formulation is inaccurate:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many misunderstandings persist. In many cases, they result from conflating \"coefficient of relatedness\" and \"proportion of shared genes\", which is a short step from the intuitively appealing\u2014but incorrect\u2014interpretation that \"animals tend to be altruistic toward those with whom they share a lot of genes.\" These misunderstandings don't just crop up occasionally; they are repeated in many writings, including undergraduate psychology textbooks\u2014most of them in the field of social psychology, within sections describing evolutionary approaches to altruism.\nAs with the earlier sociobiological forays into the cross-cultural data, typical approaches are not able to find explanatory fit with the findings of ethnographers insofar that human kinship patterns are not necessarily built upon blood-ties. However, as Hamilton's later refinements of his theory make clear, it does not simply predict that genetically related individuals will inevitably recognise and engage in positive social behaviours with genetic relatives: rather, indirect context-based mechanisms may have evolved, which in historical environments have met the inclusive fitness criterion. Consideration of the demographics of the typical evolutionary environment of any species is crucial to understanding the evolution of social behaviours. As Hamilton himself put it, \"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start\".\nUnder this perspective, and noting the necessity of a reliable context of interaction being available, the data on how altruism is mediated in social mammals is readily made sense of. In social mammals, primates and humans, altruistic acts that meet the kin selection criterion are typically mediated by circumstantial cues such as shared developmental environment, familiarity and social bonding. That is, it is the context that mediates the development of the bonding process and the expression of the altruistic behaviours, not genetic relatedness as such. This interpretation is compatible with the cross-cultural ethnographic data and has been called nurture kinship.\nIn plants.\nObservations.\nThough originally thought unique to the animal kingdom, evidence of kin selection has been identified in the plant kingdom.\nCompetition for resources between developing zygotes in plant ovaries increases when seeds had been pollinated with male gametes from different plants. How developing zygotes differentiate between full siblings and half-siblings in the ovary is undetermined, but genetic interactions are thought to play a role. Nonetheless, competition between zygotes in the ovary is detrimental to the reproductive success of the (female) plant, and fewer zygotes mature into seeds. As such, the reproductive traits and behaviors of plants suggests the evolution of behaviors and characteristics that increase the genetic relatedness of fertilized eggs in the plant ovary, thereby fostering kin selection and cooperation among the seeds as they develop. These traits differ among plant species. Some species have evolved to have fewer ovules per ovary, commonly one ovule per ovary, thereby decreasing the chance of developing multiple, differently fathered seeds within the same ovary. Multi-ovulated plants have developed mechanisms that increase the chances of all ovules within the ovary being fathered by the same parent. Such mechanisms include dispersal of pollen in aggregated packets and closure of the stigmatic lobes after pollen is introduced. The aggregated pollen packet releases pollen gametes in the ovary, thereby increasing likelihood that all ovules are fertilized by pollen from the same parent. Likewise, the closure of the ovary pore prevents entry of new pollen. Other multi-ovulated plants have evolved mechanisms that mimic the evolutionary adaption of single-ovulated ovaries; the ovules are fertilized by pollen from different individuals, but the mother ovary then selectively aborts fertilized ovules, either at the zygotic or embryonic stage.\nAfter seeds are dispersed, kin recognition and cooperation affects root formation in developing plants. Studies have found that the total root mass developed by \"Ipomoea hederacea\" (morning glory shrubs) grown next to kin is significantly smaller than those grown next to non-kin; shrubs grown next to kin thus allocate less energy and resources to growing the larger root systems needed for competitive growth. When seedlings were grown in individual pots placed next to kin or non-kin relatives, no difference in root growth was observed. This indicates that kin recognition occurs via signals received by the roots. Further, groups of \"I. hederacea\" plants are more varied in height when grown with kin than when grown with non-kin. The evolutionary benefit provided by this was further investigated by researchers at the Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier. They found that the alternating heights seen in kin-grouped crops allowed for optimal light availability to all plants in the group; shorter plants next to taller plants had access to more light than those surrounded by plants of similar height.\nThe above examples illustrate the effect of kin selection in the equitable allocation of light, nutrients, and water. The evolutionary emergence of single-ovulated ovaries in plants has eliminated the need for a developing seed to compete for nutrients, thus increasing its chance of survival and germination. Likewise, the fathering of all ovules in multi-ovulated ovaries by one father, decreases the likelihood of competition between developing seeds, thereby also increasing the seeds' chances of survival and germination. The decreased root growth in plants grown with kin increases the amount of energy available for reproduction; plants grown with kin produced more seeds than those grown with non-kin. Similarly, the increase in light made available by alternating heights in groups of related plants is associated with higher fecundity.\nKin selection has also been observed in plant responses to herbivory. In an experiment done by Richard Karban et al., leaves of potted \"Artemisia tridentata\" (sagebrushes) were clipped with scissors to simulate herbivory. The gaseous volatiles emitted by the clipped leaves were captured in a plastic bag. When these volatiles were transferred to leaves of a closely related sagebrush, the recipient experienced lower levels of herbivory than those that had been exposed to volatiles released by non-kin plants. Sagebrushes do not uniformly emit the same volatiles in response to herbivory: the chemical ratios and composition of emitted volatiles vary from one sagebrush to another. Closely related sagebrushes emit similar volatiles, and the similarities decrease as relatedness decreases. This suggests that the composition of volatile gasses plays a role in kin selection among plants. Volatiles from a distantly related plant are less likely to induce a protective response against herbivory in a neighboring plant, than volatiles from a closely related plant. This fosters kin selection, as the volatiles emitted by a plant will activate the herbivorous defense response in related plants only, thus increasing their chance of survival and reproduction.\nKin selection may play a role in plant-pollinator interactions, especially because pollinator attraction is influenced not only by floral displays, but by the spatial arrangement of plants in a group, which is referred to as the \"magnet effect\". For example, in an experiment performed on \"Moricandia moricandioides\", Torices et al. demonstrated that focal plants in the presence of kin show increased advertising effort (defined as total petal mass of plants in a group divided by the plant biomass) compared to those in the presence of non-kin, and that this effect is greater in larger groups. \"M. moricandioides\" is a good model organism for the study of plant-pollinator interactions because it relies on pollinators for reproduction, as it is self-incompatible. The study design for this experiment included planting establishing pots of \"M. moricandioides\" with zero, three or six neighbors (either unrelated or half-sib progeny of the same mother) and advertising effort was calculated after 26 days of flowering. The exact mechanism of kin recognition in \"M. moricandioides\" is unknown, but possible mechanisms include above-ground communication with volatile compounds, or below-ground communication with root exudates.\nMechanisms in plants.\nThe ability to differentiate between kin and non-kin is not necessary for kin selection in many animals. However, because plants do not reliably germinate in close proximity to kin, it is thought that, within the plant kingdom, kin recognition is especially important for kin selection there, but the mechanism remains unknown.\nOne proposed mechanism for kin recognition involves communication through roots, with secretion and reception of root exudates. This would require exudates to be actively secreted by roots of one plant, and detected by roots of neighboring plants. The root exudate allantoin produced by rice plants, \"Oryza sativa\", has been documented to be in greater production when growing next to cultivars that are largely unrelated. High production levels of Allantoin correlated to up regulation of auxin and auxin transporters, resulting in increased lateral root development and directional growth of their roots towards non kin, maximizing competition. This is mainly not observed in \"Oryza Sativa\" when surrounded by kin, invoking altruistic behaviors to promote inclusive fitness. However the root receptors responsible for recognition of kin exudates, and the pathway induced by receptor activation, remain unknown. The mycorrhiza associated with roots might facilitate reception of exudates, but again the mechanism is unknown.\nAnother possibility is communication through green leaf volatiles. Karban et al. studied kin recognition in sagebrushes, \"Artemisia tridentata\". The volatile-donating sagebrushes were kept in individual pots, separate from the plants that received the volatiles, finding that plants responded to herbivore damage to a neighbour's leaves. This suggests that root signalling is not necessary to induce a protective response against herbivory in neighbouring kin plants. Karban et al. suggest that plants may be able to differentiate between kin and non-kin based on the composition of volatiles. Because only the recipient sagebrush's leaves were exposed the volatiles presumably activated a receptor protein in the plant's leaves. The identity of this receptor, and the signalling pathway triggered by its activation, both remain to be discovered.\nObjections.\nThe theory of kin selection has been criticised by W. J. Alonso (in 1998) and by Alonso and C. Schuck-Paim (in 2002). They argue that the behaviours which kin selection attempts to explain are not altruistic (in pure Darwinian terms) because: (1) they may directly favour the performer as an individual aiming to maximise its progeny (so the behaviours can be explained as ordinary individual selection); (2) these behaviours benefit the group (so they can be explained as group selection); or (3) they are by-products of a developmental system of many \"individuals\" performing different tasks (like a colony of bees, or the cells of multicellular organisms, which are the focus of selection). They also argue that the genes involved in sex ratio conflicts could be treated as \"parasites\" of (already established) social colonies, not as their \"promoters\", and, therefore the sex ratio in colonies would be irrelevant to the transition to eusociality. Those ideas were mostly ignored until they were put forward again in a series of controversial papers by E. O. Wilson, Bert H\u00f6lldobler, Martin Nowak and Corina Tarnita. Nowak, Tarnita and Wilson argued that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Inclusive fitness theory is not a simplification over the standard approach. It is an alternative accounting method, but one that works only in a very limited domain. Whenever inclusive fitness does work, the results are identical to those of the standard approach. Inclusive fitness theory is an unnecessary detour, which does not provide additional insight or information.\nThey, like Alonso and Schuck-Paim, argue for a multi-level selection model instead. This aroused a strong response, including a rebuttal published in \"Nature\" from over a hundred researchers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review). Epidemiology has helped develop methodology used in clinical research, public health studies, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in the biological sciences.\nMajor areas of epidemiological study include disease causation, transmission, outbreak investigation, disease surveillance, environmental epidemiology, forensic epidemiology, occupational epidemiology, screening, biomonitoring, and comparisons of treatment effects such as in clinical trials. Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like biology to better understand disease processes, statistics to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions, social sciences to better understand proximate and distal causes, and engineering for exposure assessment.\n\"Epidemiology\", literally meaning \"the study of what is upon the people\", is derived from gre \" epi\"\u00a0'upon, among' \" demos\"\u00a0'people, district' and \" logos\"\u00a0'study, word, discourse', suggesting that it applies only to human populations. However, the term is widely used in studies of zoological populations (veterinary epidemiology), although the term \"epizoology\" is available, and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations (botanical or plant disease epidemiology).\nThe distinction between \"epidemic\" and \"endemic\" was first drawn by Hippocrates, The term \"epidemiology\" appears to have first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician Joaqu\u00edn de Villalba in \"Epidemiolog\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola\". Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a syndemic.\nThe term epidemiology is now widely applied to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic, infectious disease, but of disease in general, including related conditions and, especially since the 20th century, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Some examples of topics examined through epidemiology include as high blood pressure, mental illness and obesity. Therefore, this epidemiology is based upon how the pattern of the disease causes change in the function of human beings.\nHistory.\nThe Greek physician Hippocrates, taught by Democritus, was known as the father of medicine, sought a logic to sickness; he is the first person known to have examined the relationships between the occurrence of disease and environmental influences. Hippocrates believed sickness of the human body to be caused by an imbalance of the four humors (black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). The cure to the sickness was to remove or add the humor in question to balance the body. This belief led to the application of bloodletting and dieting in medicine. He coined the terms \"endemic\" (for diseases usually found in some places but not in others) and \"epidemic\" (for diseases that are seen at some times but not others).\nModern era.\nIn the middle of the 16th century, a doctor from Verona named Girolamo Fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that the very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted Galen's miasma theory (poison gas in sick people). In 1543 he wrote a book \"De contagione et contagiosis morbis\", in which he was the first to promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.\nDuring the Ming dynasty, Wu Youke (1582\u20131652) developed the idea that some diseases were caused by transmissible agents, which he called \"Li Qi\" (\u623e\u6c14 or pestilential factors) when he observed various epidemics rage around him between 1641 and 1644. His book \"Wen Yi Lun\" (\u761f\u75ab\u8bba, Treatise on Pestilence/Treatise of Epidemic Diseases) can be regarded as the main etiological work that brought forward the concept. His concepts were still being considered in analysing SARS outbreak by WHO in 2004 in the context of traditional Chinese medicine.\nAnother pioneer, Thomas Sydenham (1624\u20131689), was the first to distinguish the fevers of Londoners in the later 1600s. His theories on cures of fevers met with much resistance from traditional physicians at the time. He was not able to find the initial cause of the smallpox fever he researched and treated.\nJohn Graunt, a haberdasher and amateur statistician, published \"Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality\" in 1662. In it, he analysed the mortality rolls in London before the Great Plague, presented one of the first life tables, and reported time trends for many diseases, new and old. He provided statistical evidence for many theories on disease, and also refuted some widespread ideas on them.\nJohn Snow is famous for his investigations into the causes of the 19th-century cholera epidemics, and is also known as the father of (modern) Epidemiology. He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the Broad Street pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is considered the classic example of epidemiology. Snow used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and removed the handle; this ended the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of public health and regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology, having helped shape public health policies around the world. However, Snow's research and preventive measures to avoid further outbreaks were not fully accepted or put into practice until after his death due to the prevailing Miasma Theory of the time, a model of disease in which poor air quality was blamed for illness. This was used to rationalize high rates of infection in impoverished areas instead of addressing the underlying issues of poor nutrition and sanitation, and was proven false by his work.\nOther pioneers include Danish physician Peter Anton Schleisner, who in 1849 related his work on the prevention of the epidemic of neonatal tetanus on the Vestmanna Islands in Iceland. Another important pioneer was Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who in 1847 brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by instituting a disinfection procedure. His findings were published in 1850, but his work was ill-received by his colleagues, who discontinued the procedure. Disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister, aided by his college, chemist Thomas Anderson, was able to \"discover\" antiseptics in 1865 based on the earlier work of Louis Pasteur.\nIn the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by Ronald Ross, Janet Lane-Claypon, Anderson Gray McKendrick, and others. In a parallel development during the 1920s, German-Swiss pathologist Max Askanazy and others founded the International Society for Geographical Pathology to systematically investigate the geographical pathology of cancer and other non-infectious diseases across populations in different regions. After World War II, Richard Doll and other non-pathologists joined the field and advanced methods to study cancer, a disease with patterns and mode of occurrences that could not be suitably studied with the methods developed for epidemics of infectious diseases. Geography pathology eventually combined with infectious disease epidemiology to make the field that is epidemiology today.\nAnother breakthrough was the 1954 publication of the results of a British Doctors Study, led by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill, which lent very strong statistical support to the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer.\nIn the late 20th century, with the advancement of biomedical sciences, a number of molecular markers in blood, other biospecimens and environment were identified as predictors of development or risk of a certain disease. Epidemiology research to examine the relationship between these biomarkers analyzed at the molecular level and disease was broadly named \"molecular epidemiology\". Specifically, \"genetic epidemiology\" has been used for epidemiology of germline genetic variation and disease. Genetic variation is typically determined using DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes.\n21st century.\nSince the 2000s, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been commonly performed to identify genetic risk factors for many diseases and health conditions.\nWhile most molecular epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease diagnosis and classification systems, it is increasingly recognized that disease progression represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual (\"the unique disease principle\"), considering uniqueness of the exposome (a totality of endogenous and exogenous / environmental exposures) and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges, including lack of research guidelines and standardized statistical methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs. Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular precision medicine, \"molecular pathology\" and \"epidemiology\" was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of \"molecular pathological epidemiology\" (MPE), defined as \"epidemiology of molecular pathology and heterogeneity of disease\". In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis will further contribute to elucidate etiologies of disease. The MPE approach can be applied to not only neoplastic diseases but also non-neoplastic diseases. The concept and paradigm of MPE have become widespread in the 2010s.\nBy 2012, it was recognized that many pathogens' evolution is rapid enough to be highly relevant to epidemiology, and that therefore much could be gained from an interdisciplinary approach to infectious disease integrating epidemiology and molecular evolution to \"inform control strategies, or even patient treatment.\" Modern epidemiological studies can use advanced statistics and machine learning to create predictive models as well as to define treatment effects. There is increasing recognition that a wide range of modern data sources, many not originating from healthcare or epidemiology, can be used for epidemiological study. Such digital epidemiology can include data from internet searching, mobile phone records and retail sales of drugs.\nTypes of studies.\nEpidemiologists employ a range of study designs from the observational to experimental and generally categorized as descriptive (involving the assessment of data covering time, place, and person), analytic (aiming to further examine known associations or hypothesized relationships), and experimental (a term often equated with clinical or community trials of treatments and other interventions). In observational studies, nature is allowed to \"take its course\", as epidemiologists observe from the sidelines. Conversely, in experimental studies, the epidemiologist is the one in control of all of the factors entering a certain case study. Epidemiological studies are aimed, where possible, at revealing unbiased relationships between exposures such as alcohol or smoking, biological agents, stress, or chemicals to mortality or morbidity. The identification of causal relationships between these exposures and outcomes is an important aspect of epidemiology. Modern epidemiologists use informatics and infodemiology as tools.\nObservational studies have two components, descriptive and analytical. Descriptive observations pertain to the \"who, what, where and when of health-related state occurrence\". However, analytical observations deal more with the 'how' of a health-related event. Experimental epidemiology contains three case types: randomized controlled trials (often used for a new medicine or drug testing), field trials (conducted on those at a high risk of contracting a disease), and community trials (research on social originating diseases).\nThe term 'epidemiologic triad' is used to describe the intersection of \"Host\", \"Agent\", and \"Environment\" in analyzing an outbreak.\nCase series.\nCase-series may refer to the qualitative study of the experience of a single patient, or small group of patients with a similar diagnosis, or to a statistical factor with the potential to produce illness with periods when they are unexposed.\nThe former type of study is purely descriptive and cannot be used to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to a formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case-control studies or prospective studies. A case-control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.\nThe latter type, more formally described as self-controlled case-series studies, divide individual patient follow-up time into exposed and unexposed periods and use fixed-effects Poisson regression processes to compare the incidence rate of a given outcome between exposed and unexposed periods. This technique has been extensively used in the study of adverse reactions to vaccination and has been shown in some circumstances to provide statistical power comparable to that available in cohort studies.\nCase-control studies.\nCase-control studies select subjects based on their disease status. It is a retrospective study. A group of individuals that are disease positive (the \"case\" group) is compared with a group of disease negative individuals (the \"control\" group). The control group should ideally come from the same population that gave rise to the cases. The case-control study looks back through time at potential exposures that both groups (cases and controls) may have encountered. A 2\u00d72 table is constructed, displaying exposed cases (A), exposed controls (B), unexposed cases (C) and unexposed controls (D). The statistic generated to measure association is the odds ratio (OR), which is the ratio of the odds of exposure in the cases (A/C) to the odds of exposure in the controls (B/D), i.e. OR = (AD/BC).\nIf the OR is significantly greater than 1, then the conclusion is \"those with the disease are more likely to have been exposed\", whereas if it is close to 1 then the exposure and disease are not likely associated. If the OR is far less than one, then this suggests that the exposure is a protective factor in the causation of the disease.\nCase-control studies are usually faster and more cost-effective than cohort studies but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and selection bias). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should be representative of the distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.\nA major drawback for case control studies is that, in order to be considered to be statistically significant, the minimum number of cases required at the 95% confidence interval is related to the odds ratio by the equation:\nformula_1\nwhere N is the ratio of cases to controls.\nAs the odds ratio approaches 1, the number of cases required for statistical significance grows towards infinity; rendering case-control studies all but useless for low odds ratios. For instance, for an odds ratio of 1.5 and cases = controls, the table shown above would look like this:\nFor an odds ratio of 1.1:\nCohort studies.\nCohort studies select subjects based on their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation at the beginning of the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2\u00d72 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, \"P\"e\u00a0=\u00a0\"A\"\u00a0/\u00a0(\"A\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"B\") over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, \"P\"\"u\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"C\"\u00a0/\u00a0(\"C\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"D\"), i.e. \"RR\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"P\"e\u00a0/\u00a0\"P\"u.\nAs with the OR, a RR greater than 1 shows association, where the conclusion can be read \"those with the exposure were more likely to develop the disease.\"\nProspective studies have many benefits over case control studies. The RR is a more powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, and there is a greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.\nCohort studies also are limited by the same equation for number of cases as for cohort studies, but, if the base incidence rate in the study population is very low, the number of cases required is reduced by\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442.\nCausal inference.\nAlthough epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering \"causal\" relationships.\n\"Correlation does not imply causation\" is a common theme for much of the epidemiological literature. For epidemiologists, the key is in the term inference. Correlation, or at least association between two variables, is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for the inference that one variable causes the other. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal.\nEpidemiologists emphasize that the \"one cause \u2013 one effect\" understanding is a simplistic mis-belief. Most outcomes, whether disease or death, are caused by a chain or web consisting of many component causes. Causes can be distinguished as necessary, sufficient or probabilistic conditions. If a necessary condition can be identified and controlled (e.g., antibodies to a disease agent, energy in an injury), the harmful outcome can be avoided (Robertson, 2015). One tool regularly used to conceptualize the multicausality associated with disease is the causal pie model.\nBradford Hill criteria.\nIn 1965, Austin Bradford Hill proposed a series of considerations to help assess evidence of causation, which have come to be commonly known as the \"Bradford Hill criteria\". In contrast to the explicit intentions of their author, Hill's considerations are now sometimes taught as a checklist to be implemented for assessing causality. Hill himself said \"None of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypothesis and none can be required \"sine qua non\".\"\nLegal interpretation.\nEpidemiological studies can only go to prove that an agent could have caused, but not that it did cause, an effect in any particular case:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Epidemiology is concerned with the incidence of disease in populations and does not address the question of the cause of an individual's disease. This question, sometimes referred to as specific causation, is beyond the domain of the science of epidemiology. Epidemiology has its limits at the point where an inference is made that the relationship between an agent and a disease is causal (general causation) and where the magnitude of excess risk attributed to the agent has been determined; that is, epidemiology addresses whether an agent can cause disease, not whether an agent did cause a specific plaintiff's disease.\nIn United States law, epidemiology alone cannot prove that a causal association does not exist in general. Conversely, it can be (and is in some circumstances) taken by US courts, in an individual case, to justify an inference that a causal association does exist, based upon a balance of probability.\nThe subdiscipline of forensic epidemiology is directed at the investigation of specific causation of disease or injury in individuals or groups of individuals in instances in which causation is disputed or is unclear, for presentation in legal settings.\nPopulation-based health management.\nEpidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population-based health management frameworks.\nPopulation-based health management encompasses the ability to:\nModern population-based health management is complex, requiring a multiple set of skills (medical, political, technological, mathematical, etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward-looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.\nExamples of organizations that use population-based health management that leverage the work and results of epidemiological practice include Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control, Health Canada Tobacco Control Programs, Rick Hansen Foundation, Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative.\nEach of these organizations uses a population-based health management framework called Life at Risk that combines epidemiological quantitative analysis with demographics, health agency operational research and economics to perform:\nApplied field epidemiology.\nApplied epidemiology is the practice of using epidemiological methods to protect or improve the health of a population. Applied field epidemiology can include investigating communicable and non-communicable disease outbreaks, mortality and morbidity rates, and nutritional status, among other indicators of health, with the purpose of communicating the results to those who can implement appropriate policies or disease control measures.\nHumanitarian context.\nAs the surveillance and reporting of diseases and other health factors become increasingly difficult in humanitarian crisis situations, the methodologies used to report the data are compromised. One study found that less than half (42.4%) of nutrition surveys sampled from humanitarian contexts correctly calculated the prevalence of malnutrition and only one-third (35.3%) of the surveys met the criteria for quality. Among the mortality surveys, only 3.2% met the criteria for quality. As nutritional status and mortality rates help indicate the severity of a crisis, the tracking and reporting of these health factors is crucial.\nVital registries are usually the most effective ways to collect data, but in humanitarian contexts these registries can be non-existent, unreliable, or inaccessible. As such, mortality is often inaccurately measured using either prospective demographic surveillance or retrospective mortality surveys. Prospective demographic surveillance requires much manpower and is difficult to implement in a spread-out population. Retrospective mortality surveys are prone to selection and reporting biases. Other methods are being developed, but are not common practice yet.\nCharacterization, validity, and bias.\nEpidemic wave.\nThe concept of waves in epidemics has implications especially for communicable diseases. A working definition for the term \"epidemic wave\" is based on two key features: 1) it comprises periods of upward or downward trends, and 2) these increases or decreases must be substantial and sustained over a period of time, in order to distinguish them from minor fluctuations or reporting errors. The use of a consistent scientific definition is to provide a consistent language that can be used to communicate about and understand the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, which would aid healthcare organizations and policymakers in resource planning and allocation.\nValidities.\nDifferent fields in epidemiology have different levels of validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). In genetic epidemiology, candidate-gene studies may produce over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives. This ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology, as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast, other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.\nRandom error.\nRandom error is the result of fluctuations around a true value because of sampling variability. Random error is just that: random. It can occur during data collection, coding, transfer, or analysis. Examples of random errors include poorly worded questions, a misunderstanding in interpreting an individual answer from a particular respondent, or a typographical error during coding. Random error affects measurement in a transient, inconsistent manner and it is impossible to correct for random error. There is a random error in all sampling procedures \u2013 sampling error.\nPrecision in epidemiological variables is a measure of random error. Precision is also inversely related to random error, so that to reduce random error is to increase precision. Confidence intervals are computed to demonstrate the precision of relative risk estimates. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the relative risk estimate.\nThere are two basic ways to reduce random error in an epidemiological study. The first is to increase the sample size of the study. In other words, add more subjects to your study. The second is to reduce the variability in measurement in the study. This might be accomplished by using a more precise measuring device or by increasing the number of measurements.\nNote, that if sample size or number of measurements are increased, or a more precise measuring tool is purchased, the costs of the study are usually increased. There is usually an uneasy balance between the need for adequate precision and the practical issue of study cost.\nSystematic error.\nA systematic error or bias occurs when there is a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of systematic error is if, unknown to you, the pulse oximeter you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).\nA mistake in coding that affects \"all\" responses for that particular question is another example of a systematic error.\nThe validity of a study is dependent on the degree of systematic error. Validity is usually separated into two components:\nSelection bias.\nSelection bias occurs when study subjects are selected or become part of the study as a result of a third, unmeasured variable which is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest. For instance, it has repeatedly been noted that cigarette smokers and non smokers tend to differ in their study participation rates. (Sackett D cites the example of Seltzer et al., in which 85% of non smokers and 67% of smokers returned mailed questionnaires.) Such a difference in response will not lead to bias if it is not also associated with a systematic difference in outcome between the two response groups.\nInformation bias.\nInformation bias is bias arising from systematic error in the assessment of a variable. An example of this is recall bias. A typical example is again provided by Sackett in his discussion of a study examining the effect of specific exposures on fetal health: \"in questioning mothers whose recent pregnancies had ended in fetal death or malformation (cases) and a matched group of mothers whose pregnancies ended normally (controls) it was found that 28% of the former, but only 20% of the latter, reported exposure to drugs which could not be substantiated either in earlier prospective interviews or in other health records\". In this example, recall bias probably occurred as a result of women who had had miscarriages having an apparent tendency to better recall and therefore report previous exposures.\nDesign-related bias.\nNext to sample- and variable-related bias, bias can also arise from an imperfect study design. One example is immortal time bias, where during study period, there is some interval during which the outcome event cannot occur (making these individual \"immortal\").\nConfounding.\nConfounding has traditionally been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with the main effect(s) of interest. A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of \"counterfactual\" effects. According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure \"X\"\u00a0=\u00a01 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be \"R\"A1. The counterfactual or unobserved risk \"R\"A0 corresponds to the risk which would have been observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. \"X\"\u00a0=\u00a00 for every unit of the population). The true effect of exposure therefore is: \"R\"A1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"R\"A0 (if one is interested in risk differences) or \"R\"A1/\"R\"A0 (if one is interested in relative risk). Since the counterfactual risk \"R\"A0 is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: \"R\"A1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"R\"B0 or \"R\"A1/\"R\"B0. In this situation, confounding occurs when \"R\"A0\u00a0\u2260\u00a0\"R\"B0. (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.)\nSome epidemiologists prefer to think of confounding separately from common categorizations of bias since, unlike selection and information bias, confounding stems from real causal effects.\nThe profession.\nFew universities have offered epidemiology as a course of study at the undergraduate level. An undergraduate program exists at Johns Hopkins University in which students who major in public health can take graduate-level courses\u2014including epidemiology\u2014during their senior year at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. In addition to its master's and doctoral degrees in epidemiology, the University of Michigan School of Public Health has offered undergraduate degree programs since 2017 that include coursework in epidemiology. \nAlthough epidemiologic research is conducted by individuals from diverse disciplines, variable levels of training in epidemiologic methods are provided during pharmacy, medical, veterinary, social work, podiatry, nursing, physical therapy, and clinical psychology doctoral programs in addition to the formal training master's and doctoral students in public health fields receive. \nAs public health practitioners, epidemiologists work in a number of different settings. Some epidemiologists work \"in the field\" (i.e., in the community; commonly in a public health service), and are often at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals, or larger government entities (e.g., state and local health departments in the United States), ministries of health, Doctors without Borders, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Protection Agency, the World Health Organization (WHO), or the Public Health Agency of Canada. Epidemiologists can also work in for-profit organizations (e.g., pharmaceutical and medical device companies) in groups such as market research or clinical development.\nCOVID-19.\nAn April 2020 University of Southern California article noted that, \"The coronavirus epidemic... thrust epidemiology \u2013 the study of the incidence, distribution and control of disease in a population \u2013 to the forefront of scientific disciplines across the globe and even made temporary celebrities out of some of its practitioners.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Donaldson", "text": "American novelist (born 1947)\nStephen Reeder Donaldson (born May 13, 1947) is an American fantasy, science fiction and mystery novelist, most famous for \"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\", his ten-novel fantasy series. His work is characterized by psychological complexity, conceptual abstractness, moral bleakness, and the use of an arcane vocabulary, and has attracted critical praise for its \"imagination, vivid characterizations, and fast pace\". Donaldson earned his bachelor's degree from The College of Wooster and a master's degree from Kent State University. He currently resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nPersonal life.\nDonaldson spent part of his youth in India, where his father, a medical missionary, worked with lepers. Donaldson attended what is now the Kodaikanal International School. He was attending Kent State University as a graduate student at the time of the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970. Though he was not on campus at the time of the shootings, his apartment was one and a half blocks away, and he was forced to live under martial law for three days afterwards. Donaldson does not like to discuss the incident, as he finds the memories disturbing.\nDonaldson is a fan of opera, and has said that he \"love[s] that direct expression of passionate emotion in beautiful sound\". In 1994, he gained a black belt in Shotokan karate.\nMajor influences.\nDonaldson is part of the generation of fantasy authors which came to prominence in the 1970s and early 1980s. Like that of many of his peers, his writing is heavily influenced by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. However, Donaldson's stories show a wide range of other influences, including Mervyn Peake, C. S. Lewis, Robert E. Howard, and the operas of Richard Wagner. Donaldson is also a great fan of Roger Zelazny's \"Amber\" novels, which were a direct inspiration for his own \"Mordant's Need\" series. Also, in the \"Gradual Interview\" section of his website, Donaldson mentions his extensive study of Joseph Conrad, Henry James and William Faulkner to further develop his narrative style.\nIdeas.\nIn \"Creative Cognition, Conceptual Combination, and the Creative Writing of Stephen R. Donaldson,\" Thomas Ward quotes Donaldson's note in \"The Gap into Conflict: The Real Story\": \"... a fair number of my best stories arise, not from one idea, but from two.\" Donaldson has said, \"two inert elements combine to produce something of frightening potency.\" For the Thomas Covenant books, when he put unbelief and leprosy together, \"... my brain took fire.\"\n\"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\".\nDonaldson's most celebrated series is \"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\", which centers on a cynical leper, shunned by society, who is destined to become the heroic savior of another world. Covenant struggles against the tyrannical Lord Foul, who intends to break the physical universe in order to escape his bondage and wreak revenge upon his arch enemy, The Creator.\nThe \"Chronicles\" were originally published as two trilogies of novels between 1977 and 1983. According to his current publisher, Putnam's, those two series sold more than 10 million copies. A third series, \"The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\", began publication in 2004 with the novel \"The Runes of the Earth\". With the second book of that series, \"Fatal Revenant\", Donaldson again attained bestseller status when the book reached number 12 on the \"New York Times\" Bestseller List in October 2007.\nThe Gap Cycle.\nA science fiction epic set in a future where humans have pushed far out into space in the attempt to replace depleted resources, \"The Gap Cycle\" follows two concurrent story arcs. The first concerns an ensign in the United Mining Companies Police (UMCP), Morn Hyland, who is attempting simply to stay alive after being captured by a marauder named Angus Thermopyle. The second follows the Byzantine political maneuvering of the head of the UMCP, Warden Dios, as he attempts to thwart the machinations of his boss, Holt Fasner, who is the CEO of United Mining Companies (UMC) and the most powerful man in human space.\nEach of the epics takes place against the backdrop of a threat to human survival itself from an alien species called the Amnion who use genetic mutation as a way to assimilate and overcome. Trade in raw materials (mostly ores) is carried out with the Amnion in exchange for technology, by both the UMC and illegals. Some illegals trade in Amnion territorial space, referred to as \"forbidden space\", out of bounds to the UMCP by treaty.\nDonaldson wrote the series in part to be a reworking of Wagner's Ring Cycle. The \"Gap\" of the title refers to the faster-than-light drives used by the space vessels in order to cross great distances, an instantaneous occurrence similar to the notion of \"folding\" space.\nThe Gap series.\nThe 2008 reprinting of the series combines \"The Real Story\" and \"Forbidden Knowledge\" into a single volume. According to Donaldson's website, this was done at his request.\nOther works.\nEarly work.\nDonaldson has stated that, when he was younger, he wrote two fan-fiction novellas: one based on Marvel Comics' Thor, and the other based on Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\". These have never been published. As Donaldson grew older, he discovered that the sensation that he was \"making it all up\" himself was necessary for his imagination to work well. He now regards these early novellas as failed experiments in the process of discovering himself as a writer. He feels the same way about a play he wrote, whose performance at Kent State University convinced him that he was \"not cut out to be a playwright\".\n\"The Man Who\".\n\"The Man Who\" is a series of mystery novels written by Donaldson and published under the pseudonym Reed Stephens, derived from his full name, \"Stephen Reeder Donaldson\". The books focus on the partnership of private detectives Mick Axbrewder and Ginny Fistoulari. Donaldson \"always hated\" writing under a false name, but was forced to do so by his publisher, Ballantine Books, who had a firm belief in \"category publishing\" and thought that readers would feel betrayed if books of such different genres were published under the name of a single author. However, the books sold poorly even when they were re-printed under Donaldson's name by Tor/Forge Books.\nDonaldson once indicated that he intended to write at least one more \"The Man Who\" novel after completion of \"The Last Chronicles\".\n\"The Great God's War\".\nThe \"Seventh Decimate\", the first book in \"The Great God's War\" trilogy, features fantasy kingdoms Amika and Belleger, who fight \"against each other in a sorcery-saturated battle of mutual destruction, with a charismatic prince searching for a legendary conjuror's library.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Set in the town of Chamberlain, Maine, the plot revolves around Carrie White, a friendless high school girl from an abusive religious household who has telekinetic powers. After a cruel prank pulled by one of her bullies on prom night, Carrie decides to take revenge.\nKing wrote \"Carrie\" with the intention of submitting it to be published originally as a short story for the men's magazine \"Cavalier\" following the suggestion of a friend that he write a story about a female character. Though King initially gave up on \"Carrie\" due to discomfort and apathy, and felt it would never be successful, his wife Tabitha convinced him to continue writing, and rescued the first three pages of the story from the trash. He followed her advice and expanded it into a novel. King based the character of Carrie on two girls he knew in high school and enjoyed fabricating the documents for the narrative. After Doubleday accepted \"Carrie\" to be published, King worked with editor Bill Thompson to revise the novel.\n\"Carrie\" was published on April 5, 1974, with a print run of 30,000 copies, and a paperback edition was published by New American Library in April 1975. The paperback edition became a best seller, particularly after the release of the 1976 film adaptation, reaching four million sales. The novel received generally positive reviews, both contemporaneously and retrospectively. \"Carrie\", King's debut novel, helped launch his career and achieve him mainstream success. It has also been credited with reviving mainstream interest in horror fiction and being influential among contemporary horror writers. Three film adaptations have been released, with one getting a sequel, while a musical adaptation premiered in 1988, and a television miniseries is in production.\nPlot.\nIn 1979, Carietta \"Carrie\" White, a 16-year-old girl in Chamberlain, Maine, is ridiculed for her weight, her clothes and the unusual religious beliefs instilled by her fanatical mother Margaret. One day while showering after physical education class, Carrie has her first period. As Margaret has never taught her about menstruation, Carrie panics, believing she is bleeding to death. Her classmates, led by a popular girl named Chris Hargensen, mock her and throw tampons and sanitary napkins at the hysterical Carrie. The gym teacher, Rita Desjardin, intervenes and attempts to comfort Carrie before sending her home for the day.\nWhile walking home, Carrie unconsciously uses telekinesis to push a taunting child from his bicycle. Realizing what she has done, Carrie recalls childhood incidents in which other unusual events occurred, including a time when stones fell from the sky as a response to abuse from her mother. Carrie wonders if she can make such things happen at will.\nArriving home, Carrie tells her mother that her menses have started and blames Margaret for never explaining menstruation to her. Margaret believes that Carrie's sinfulness caused her to begin menstruating and locks her in a closet as punishment.\nThe next day, Desjardin reprimands the girls who bullied Carrie and gives them a week's detention. Chris refuses to comply and is punished with suspension and exclusion from the prom. After her influential father fails to reinstate her, Chris decides to take revenge on Carrie. Another girl involved in the incident, Sue Snell, asks her boyfriend Tommy to invite Carrie to the prom as a way of atoning for the locker room bullying. Carrie is suspicious at first, but accepts. Learning that Carrie will be attending prom, Chris persuades her boyfriend Billy and his gang of greasers to gather pig's blood while she prepares to rig the prom queen election in Carrie's favor. Her plan is to humiliate Carrie in front of the whole school by rigging buckets of blood to fall on her during the coronation of prom queen.\nCarrie begins preparing for prom night, all while secretly learning to control her telekinetic powers. Margaret realizes that her daughter has inherited the same telekinetic abilities Margaret's grandmother possessed and attributes them to witchcraft, but is initially too frightened to address the issue directly. Instead she begs Carrie not to attend the prom, considering it an occasion of sin. Carrie uses her powers to thwart Margaret's attempts to stop her.\nAt prom, Carrie finds herself accepted by her peers for the first time and loses some of her self-consciousness as she interacts with them. Tommy finds himself curiously drawn to Carrie and realizes he is falling in love with her. Surprised to see her name on the ballots for Prom King and Queen, Carrie has a premonition that she should not vote for herself, but Tommy convinces her that she deserves to win. Carrie and Tommy are elected prom queen and king by a single vote. At the moment of the coronation, Chris, who is hiding in the wings, releases the buckets, covering Carrie in blood. Tommy is hit by a falling bucket and knocked unconscious. In shock, Carrie flees the building amid the laughter of the other students, unaware that many of them are reacting out of horror.\nOutside, Carrie grows angry and decides to use her powers to humiliate them as she herself was humiliated. She seals the gym and activates the sprinkler system, inadvertently sparking some ungrounded wires that electrocute several of her classmates. The wiring sparks a fire that eventually ignites the school's fuel tanks, destroying the building in a massive explosion. Only a few staff and students, including Desjardin, narrowly escape. Tommy dies in the blaze, having never regained consciousness.\nRealizing what she has done, Carrie's sanity snaps. She begins to make her way home, causing destruction as she goes. She opens a gas main, resulting in explosions that level Chamberlain's downtown, then tears down live electrical lines that kill those who have left their homes to investigate. Her powers cause many townsfolk, including Sue, to instinctively sense Carrie's presence as she approaches. Sue leaves her home to find Carrie in hopes of stopping her.\nCarrie returns home to kill Margaret, who in turn lies in wait to murder Carrie. Margaret rambles about the night of Carrie's conception, a sin she believes is the root of Carrie's evil. She stabs Carrie with a kitchen knife, but Carrie uses her powers to stop Margaret's heart. Mortally wounded, Carrie makes her way to the roadhouse, where she sees Chris and Billy leaving town. After Billy attempts to run over Carrie, she takes control of his car and sends it into a wall, killing both him and Chris.\nFollowing Carrie's psychic signal, Sue finds the dying Carrie in the woods. Carrie believes Sue set up the prank at the prom. Sue invites Carrie to search her mind via telepathy, and Carrie sees that Sue wished her no ill will. Sue, still tethered to Carrie's mind, experiences Carrie's final moments before death. \nThe incident in Chamberlain, labeled the \"Black Prom,\" makes national news with 440 reported casualties, including the majority of the graduating seniors. The rest of the town, unable to recover financially or emotionally from the tragedy, begins to shut down, with many survivors relocating. Desjardin and the school's principal blame themselves for not reaching out to Carrie sooner and resign from teaching. A congressional commission investigates the Black Prom to discover what truly happened, concluding they must prepare for future incidents.\nSue Snell is scapegoated and blamed for triggering Carrie. In response, she writes a memoir recounting her experience and expressing sympathy for Carrie, while haunted by experiencing Carrie's death.\nThe novel ends with a letter from an Appalachian woman about her four-year-old daughter, who has begun to exhibit telekinetic powers. She compares the child to her grandmother, who also possessed these powers, and concludes that the child is destined to be even more powerful.\nStyle and themes.\n\"Carrie\" is a horror novel as well as an example of supernatural and gothic fiction. It is in part an epistolary novel: the narrative is organized around a framing device consisting of multiple narrators, and a collection of reports and excerpts in approximate chronological order. It has been argued that this structure is used to indicate that no particular viewpoint, scientific or otherwise, can explain Carrie and the prom night event.\n\"Carrie\" deals with themes of ostracism, bullying, coming-of-age and the consequences of not conforming to societal norms. A driving force of the novel is Carrie's first period in the shower. Following the massacre, Sue is subject to the same exclusion as Carrie, despite her altruistic motives. John Kerrigan and Victoria Madden have both observed that throughout the novel, Carrie is often associated with the pig, which are considered \"disgusting\" animals.\nAnother theme is vengeance. Kerrigan considers \"Carrie\" to be an example of a revenge tragedy. Ray B. Browne argues that the novel serves as a \"revenge fantasy\", while novelist Charles L. Grant has stated that \"[Stephen] King uses the evil/victim device for terror\". Some scholars have argued that \"Carrie\" is a social commentary. Linda J. Holland-Toll has stated that \"\"Carrie\" is about disaffirmation because society makes the human monster, cannot control the monster, yet still denies the possibility of actual monster existence while simultaneously defining humans as monsters\".\nBackground.\nBy the time of writing \"Carrie\", King lived in a trailer in Hermon, Maine with his wife Tabitha and two children. He had a job teaching English at Hampden Academy, and wrote short stories for men's magazines such as \"Cavalier\". \"Carrie\" was originally a short story intended for \"Cavalier\". King had started conceptualizing the story after a friend suggested writing a story about a female character.\nThe basis of the story was King imagining a scene of a girl menstruating for the first time in the shower similar to the opening scene of \"Carrie\" and an article from \"Life\" about telekinesis. As he wrote the opening shower scene, King experienced discomfort due to not being female and not knowing how he would react to the scene if he were female. He also felt apathy toward Carrie when writing the scene. After three pages, King eventually threw away the manuscript of the story. The next day, Tabitha retrieved the pages from the trash and convinced King to continue writing the story with input from her. King was ultimately able to emotionally connect to Carrie through the influence of two girls he knew. One was constantly abused at school due to her family's poverty forcing her to wear only one outfit to school. The other was a timid girl from a devoutly religious family.\nKing believed \"Carrie\" would not be successful, thinking it would not be marketable in any genre or to any audience. He also found writing it to be a \"waste of time\" and found no point in sending out what he perceived as a failed story. King only continued writing it in order to please his wife and because he was unable to think of anything else to write. When King finished the first draft, \"Carrie\" was a 98-page-long novella that he detested. In December 1972, King decided to rewrite \"Carrie\" and strive for it to become novel-length. He wrote in fabricated documents that were purported to be from periodicals such as \"Esquire\" and \"Reader's Digest\", imitating their style accordingly, a process that King found entertaining. After \"Carrie\" was accepted by the publisher Doubleday, King revised the novel with editor and friend Bill Thompson. The original ending of \"Carrie\" had Carrie growing demon horns and destroying an airplane thousands of miles above her. Thompson convinced King to rewrite the ending to be more subtle.\nPublication.\nKing's manuscript for \"Carrie\" was given to editor Bill Thompson in November 1973. Seeing potential in the novel, Thompson convinced Lee Barker, executive editor of Doubleday, to accept it. In 1973, after much revision, advanced copies of \"Carrie\" were sent to salesmen to secure an advance. Eventually, the novel was approved for an advance of $1,500. Thompson convinced Doubleday to boost the advance to $2,500, moderately high for a debut novel at the time, and it was announced to King via telegram. With a print run of 30,000 copies, the hardback edition of \"Carrie\" was ultimately published on April 5, 1974. Although \"Carrie\" was marketed as an \"occult\" novel, trade reviewers called it a horror novel, unusual for the time.\nOn May 3, 1974, \"Carrie\" was received by the publishing company New English Library and was read overnight by president Bob Tanner. Tanner sent a copy to the parent company, New American Library, which then offered Doubleday $400,000 for rights to mass-market paperback publication of \"Carrie\", of which King received $200,000. New English Library published \"Carrie\" in May 1974, and New American Library published \"Carrie\" under its Signet Books imprint in April 1975. With the goal of persuading the reader to buy the book, New American Library designed the novel to be \"double-covered\". The original cover of the paperback edition did not feature the title or the author's name; it consisted of the face of a girl in front of a silhouette. Behind the cover was a two-page picture of New England on fire, with the title and author's name on the far right. New American Library planned for the girl's silhouette to be scored to allow the reader to see the burning New England picture. The printers refused to produce the technique, and the edition was published without the scoring. Since initial publication, \"Carrie\" has remained in continual print and has been published throughout Europe. On March 26, 2024, a British publishing company Hodder &amp; Stoughton published the 50th anniversary edition of \"Carrie\", which included a new introduction by Margaret Atwood.\nReception.\nThe hardback edition of \"Carrie\" sold modestly; it was not an instant best seller. Sources of the number of sales for the hardback edition vary, ranging from 13,000 copies to 17,000 copies. In contrast, the paperback edition sold well. In its first year, the edition sold one million copies. The sales were bolstered by the 1976 film adaptation, totaling four million sales.In 1976 \"Carrie\" became a \"New York Times\" best seller, debuting on the list in December and remaining on it for 14 weeks, peaking at number 3.\n\"Carrie\" received generally positive reviews and has become a fan favorite. Several critics considered it an impressive literary debut. Harold C. Schonberg, writing as Newgate Callendar for \"The New York Times\", stated that despite being a debut novel, \"King writes with the kind of surety normally associated only with veteran writers\". The \"Daily Times-Advocate\"'s Ina Bonds called \"Carrie\" an \"admirable achievement\" for a first novel, and \"Kirkus Reviews\" wrote that \"King handles his first novel with considerable accomplishment and very little hokum\". Bob Cormier from the \"Daily Sentinel &amp; Leominster Enterprise\" wrote that the novel could have failed because of the subject matter, but did not, and thus found King to be \"no ordinary writer\".\nVarious critics wrote that the plot will scare readers, with \"Library Journal\" declaring the novel \"a terrifying treat for both horror and parapsychology fans\". Mary Schedl of \"The San Francisco Examiner\" wrote that \"Carrie\" \"goes far beyond the usual limitations of the [horror] genre\" to deliver a message about humanity. \"Publishers Weekly\" praised the novel for its sympathetic portrayal of Carrie. Both Joy Antos of \"Progress Bulletin\" and Gary Bogart of \"Wilson Library Journal\" wrote of enjoying \"Carrie\" despite the foregone conclusion. Nonetheless, \"Booklist\" stated that reading the novel required a \"willing suspension of disbelief and taste\".\nRetrospectively, \"Carrie\" has received appraisal. Michael R. Collings and Adam Nevill declared that the plot holds up decades after publication. Collings attributed it to focus and conciseness, and Nevill attributed it to the characterization and structure. In his literary analysis, Rocky Wood called the plot \"remarkably short but compelling\". Michael Berry of Common Sense Media lauded the characterization and said that the epistolary structure \"lend[s] a sense of realism to the outlandish proceedings\". While both Grady Hendrix and James Smythe similarly praised the story, Hendrix felt that the writing was awkward much of the time, and Smythe found the epistolary-style extracts to be the \"worst [and slowest] parts of the novel\". Although Harold Bloom found the characterization and style to be unremarkable, he thought the novel had strong imagery and said that \"Carrie at the prom scene... is a marvelous culmination of melodrama.\"\nLegacy.\n\"Carrie\" launched King's career as an author; the $200,000 King received when \"Carrie\" was accepted for mass-market publication allowed King to quit his job as a teacher and become a full-time author. The novel established King as a horror writer who wrote about \"the supernatural, the dark, and the bizarre\". Following \"Carrie\"'s publication, King underwent a six-month period of prolific writing. During this period, King wrote rough drafts for \"Blaze\" and \"'Salem's Lot\", the latter of which became his second published novel, being published in 1975. Both \"Carrie\" and its 1976 film adaptation brought King into the mainstream, and he has since become one of the most successful authors in the modern era, with his novels consistently becoming best sellers.\nFor decades prior to the 1970s, horror literature had not been in the mainstream; \"Carrie\" is credited as one of four novels to create a contemporary mainstream interest in horror literature. This interest was especially bolstered by the subsequent adaptation. \"Carrie\" has been influential among contemporary writers, with writers such as Sarah Pinborough, James Smythe, and Sarah Lotz claiming to be influenced by \"Carrie\". Joanne Harris refers to her 2023 novel, \"Broken Light\", as \"an homage to \"Carrie\"\". The prom scene when Carrie is covered in pig blood has been referenced in pop culture, with examples including \"Monsters University\", \"My Little Pony\" comics, and horror media such as \"It Follows\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", and \"Treehouse of Horror\". Author Jeff VanderMeer said of \"Carrie\"'s influence:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Carrie\" changed the paradigm by announcing a very American form of horror that broke with the past. That process might've been ongoing anyway, but a lot of horror and weird fiction was still in a kind of post-MR James/Lovecraft mode of parchment and shadowy alleys and half-seen horrors, and here was King dropping buckets of blood over everything and making characterisation both more relaxed and more contemporary. But just as sophisticated, if more naturalistic, less stylised.\n\"Carrie\" has received three film adaptations and a musical adaptation. The first film adaptation, directed by Brian De Palma and starring Sissy Spacek in the title role, was released on November 3, 1976, to critical acclaim and commercial success, and is considered a noteworthy example of 1970s horror films and a major contributing factor to King's success. A sequel to the 1976 film adaptation titled \"\" was released in 1999 to mixed reviews. From May 12 to 15, 1988, a musical adaptation was performed five times by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Virginia Theater before closing. It was a commercial and critical failure, losing more than $7 million, among the most expensive failures by Broadway theatre. A 2002 film adaptation received negative reviews, and a 2013 film adaptation received mixed reviews. An off-Broadway revival of the musical was performed from March 1 to April 8, 2012. The television series \"Riverdale\" aired an episode titled \"\" in 2018 based on the musical. In 2024, Mike Flanagan was announced to be helming a television adaptation of the novel with Amazon MGM Studios.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tolkien's fictional legendarium, Beleriand () was a region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age. Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in his work \"The Silmarillion\": It tells the story of the early Ages of Middle-earth, in a style similar to that of the epics of Nordic literature\u2014stories pervaded by a tone of impending doom. Beleriand also appears in the works \"The Book of Lost Tales\", \"The Children of H\u00farin\", and \"The Lays of Beleriand\".\nIn Tolkien's early writing, he coined many prospective names for the region. Among them were \"Broceliand\", the name of an enchanted forest in medieval romance, and \"Ingolond\u00eb\"\u2014a play on the name \"England\"\u2014when he hoped to root a mythology for England in the region. The scholar Gergely Nagy looked at the prose of the \"Silmarillion\" and found what may be evidence of the structure and syntax of Beleriand's poetry.\nFictional history.\nEvents in Beleriand are described chiefly in the second half of the \"Quenta Silmarillion\", which tells the story of the early ages of Middle-earth in a style similar to the epic hero tales of Norse mythology. Beleriand also appears in the works \"The Book of Lost Tales\", \"The Children of H\u00farin\", and in the epic poems of \"The Lays of Beleriand\".\nThe land is occupied by Teleri Elves of King Thingol from the east, who founded the city of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Menegroth in the forest realm of Doriath. Other Elves, the Vanyar and Noldor, cross the Belegaer sea to Valinor. Some of the Noldor return to Beleriand to retrieve the Silmarils from the evil Vala Morgoth, but they are resented by the Teleri. Later, Men arrive from the east. Morgoth gathers an army of Orcs, Balrogs and other monsters in his fortress of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Angband beneath the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Thangorodrim mountains in the north of Beleriand, and attacks the Elves repeatedly. Despite the threat, Thingol refuses to fight alongside the Noldor. One by one, the realm of Doriath as well as the Noldor kingdoms Nargothrond and Gondolin fall to assaults, assisted by betrayals and disputes among Elves, Men, and Dwarves. Finally, Earendil crosses the Belegaer Sea to ask the Valar to stop Morgoth. They send an army to overcome Morgoth in the War of Wrath. This ends the First Age of Middle-earth: Angband is destroyed, and Morgoth is banished to the void. Beleriand's inhabitants flee, and much of Beleriand sinks into the sea. Only a small section of the eastern edge of Beleriand survives, including part of the Ered Luin (Blue Mountain) range and the land of Lindon, which became part of the far northwestern shore of Middle-earth.\nFictional geography.\nBeleriand is a region in the far northwest of Middle-earth, bordering the great sea, Belegaer. It is bounded to the north by the Ered Engrin, the Iron Mountains, and to the east by the Ered Luin, the Blue Mountains.\nAnalysis.\nNaming.\nBeleriand had many different names in Tolkien's early writings, including Broceliand, the name of an enchanted forest in medieval romance, Golodhinand, Nold\u00f3rinan (\"valley of the Noldor\"), Geleriand, Bladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, and Ossiriand (later used for the easternmost part of Beleriand).\nOne of Beleriand's early names was Ingolond\u00eb, a play on \"England\", part of Tolkien's long-held but ultimately unsuccessful aim to create what Shippey calls \"a mighty patron for his country, a foundation-myth more far-reaching than Hengest and Horsa, one to which he could graft his own stories.\" Tolkien's aim had been to root his mythology for England in the scraps of names and myths that had survived, and to situate it in a land in the northwest of the continent, by the sea.\nA sense of doom.\nShippey writes that the \"Quenta Silmarillion\" has a tightly-woven plot, each part leading ultimately to tragedy. There are three Hidden Elvish Kingdoms in Beleriand, founded by relatives, and they are each betrayed and destroyed. The Kingdoms are each penetrated by a mortal Man, again all related to each other; and the sense of doom, which Shippey glosses as \"future disaster\", hangs heavy over all of the characters in the tale.\nShippey writes that the human race seen in Beleriand in the First Age did not \"originate 'on stage' in Beleriand, but drifts into it, already sundered in speech, from the East [the main part of Middle-earth]. There something terrible has happened to them of which they will not speak: 'A darkness lies behind us... and we have turned our backs upon it'\". He comments that the reader is free to assume that the Satanic Morgoth has carried out the Biblical serpent's temptation of Adam and Eve, and that \"the incoming Edain and Easterlings are all descendants of Adam flying from Eden and subject to the curse of Babel.\"\n\"Lost\" poetry.\nThe Tolkien scholar Gergely Nagy, writing in 2004, notes that \"The Silmarillion\" does not contain explicitly embedded samples of Beleriand's poetry in its prose, as Tolkien had done with his many poems in \"The Lord of the Rings\". Instead, the prose of \"The Silmarillion\" hints repeatedly at the structure and syntax of its \"lost\" poetry. Nagy notes David Bratman's description of the book as containing prose styles that he classifies as \"the Annalistic, [the] Antique, and the Appendical\". The implication of the range of styles is that \"The Silmarillion\" is meant to represent, in Christopher Tolkien's words, \"a compilation, a compendious narrative, made long afterwards from sources of great diversity (poems, and annals, and oral tales)\". Nagy infers from verse-like fragments of text in \"The Silmarillion\" that the poetry of Beleriand used alliteration, rhyme, and rhythm including possibly iambics.\nThis applies to the Ainulindal\u00eb, Tolkien's account of the godlike Ainur:\nIt applies, too, to the narrative of Elves and Men in the Beleriand landscape, in the \"Quenta Silmarillion\":\nIn a few places, it is possible to relate the adapted verse in the prose to actual verse in Tolkien's legendarium. This can be done, for instance, in parts of the story of T\u00farin. Here, he realizes he has just killed his friend Beleg:\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, the mother to King John, notes that Philip looks very similar to her late son King Richard the Lionheart. Queen Eleanor accordingly suggests that Philip renounce his claim to the Faulconbridge estates in exchange for a non-inheriting position within the House of Plantagenet and a knighthood. After mocking Robert Faulconbridge's ugliness at length, Philip enthusiastically agrees and Queen Eleanor praises Philip as possessing \"the very spirit of Plantagenet\". King John knights Philip as Sir Richard the Plantagenet. Afterwards, learning Philip has renounced his inheritance, Lady Faulconbridge reluctantly confirms Queen Eleanor's suspicions about her son's secret parentage to him.\nAs part of his efforts to back regime change in the Angevin Empire, King Philip and his forces besiege the Angevin walled city of Angers, threatening to put them to the sack unless the citizens accept Prince Arthur as their King. Philip is supported by the Duke of Austria, who is alleged to have killed Richard the Lionheart. The English Army arrives. Queen Eleanor then trades insults with Constance, Arthur's mother. Kings Philip and John argue their claims in front of Angers' citizens, but to no avail: their representative says that they will support the rightful king, whoever that turns out to be upon the battlefield.\nThe French and English armies clash, but no clear victor emerges. Each army dispatches a herald claiming victory, but Angers' citizens continue to refuse to recognize either claimant because neither army has proven victorious.\nPhilip the Bastard proposes that the armies of England and France unite against Angers. The citizens suggest an alternative proposal: that Philip's son, Louis the Lion, marry John's niece Blanche of Castile. The proposal would give John a stronger claim to the throne while Louis would gain territory for France. Though a furious Constance denounces King Philip for abandoning the claims of Prince Arthur, Louis and Blanche are married offstage.\nCardinal Pandolf arrives from Pope Innocent III bearing a formal accusation. As the latest salvo of the Investiture Controversy, King John is blocking the Pope's chosen Archbishop, Stephen Langton, from the Diocese of Canterbury and has further imposed Caesaropapism upon the Catholic Church in England. John defies the Holy See and vows that \"No Italian priest shall tithe or toll in our dominions\", whereupon the Cardinal declares him excommunicated and invokes the Papal deposing power to remove him as King. Pandolf demands that the French king renounce the new treaty, though Philip is hesitant, having just established familial ties to King John. Cardinal Pandolf points out that Philip's links to the Vatican are older and firmer.\nBattle breaks out; the Duke of Austria is slain and beheaded by the Bastard in revenge for his father's death; and both Angers and Prince Arthur are captured by John's army. Queen Eleanor is left in charge of the Angevin Empire in France, while the Bastard is sent to extort funds from English monasteries. John secretly orders Hubert to kill Arthur. Pandolf informs Louis that he now has as strong a claim to the English throne as Arthur or John, and Louis agrees to invade England.\nHubert is reluctant to blind and kill Prince Arthur and spares him in secret. The English nobility demand Arthur's release. John agrees, but Hubert then tells him that Arthur is dead. The nobles, believing the Prince was murdered by his own uncle, defect to Louis' side. Equally upsetting, and more heartbreaking to John, is the news of his mother's death, along with that of Lady Constance. The Bastard reports that the monasteries are unhappy about John's attempt to steal their lands and gold. Hubert has a furious argument with John, during which he reveals that Arthur is still alive. John, delighted, sends him to report the news to the nobles.\nArthur dies after jumping from a castle wall during an escape attempt. The nobles find his body, believe he was murdered by John, and refuse to believe Hubert's entreaties. A defeated John surrenders his crown to Pandolf, who reverses John's excommunication and gives the crown back in return for the restored independence of the English Church from control by the State. John orders the Bastard, one of his few remaining loyal subjects, to lead the English army against the invading forces from France.\nWhile the English nobility swears allegiance to Louis, Pandolf arrives and explains that John has renounced his claims of supreme authority over the English Church, but Prince Louis vows to continue his invasion anyway and seize the Crown of England for himself. Pandolf excommunicates the Prince and the Bastard arrives with an English army and also threatens Louis, but to no avail. The First Barons' War breaks out with substantial losses on each side, including Louis' reinforcements, who are shipwrecked and drowned during the sea crossing. Many English nobles return to John's side after a dying French nobleman, Melun, warns them that Louis plans to kill them in a political purge after his victory.\nJohn is poisoned offstage by a monk, whose loyalties and motivations are left unexplained. His nobles gather around him as he dies. The Bastard plans a second assault on Louis' forces, until he learns that Cardinal Pandolf has ended the invasion by forcing Louis to sign the Treaty of Lambeth. Starting with his cousin, Philip the Bastard, the English nobility all swear allegiance to John's son Prince Henry, who decrees that his father shall be buried in Worcester, as he himself had wished. Before the curtain falls, Philip the Bastard reflects:\n\"O, let us pay the time but needful woe,\nSince it hath been beforehand with our griefs.\nThis England never did and never shall,\nLie at the proud foot of a conqueror,\nBut when it first did help to wound itself. \nNow these her princes are come home again,\nCome the three corners of the world in arms, \nAnd we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,\nIf England to itself do rest but true.\"\nSources.\n\"King John\" is closely related to an anonymous history play, \"The Troublesome Reign of King John\" (c. 1589), the \"masterly construction\" the infelicitous expression of which led Peter Alexander to argue that Shakespeare's was the earlier play. E. A. J. Honigmann elaborated these arguments, both in his preface to the second Arden edition of \"King John\", and in his 1982 monograph on Shakespeare's influence on his contemporaries. The majority view, however, first advanced in a rebuttal of Honigmann's views by Kenneth Muir, holds that the \"Troublesome Reign\" antedates \"King John\" by a period of several years; and that the skilful plotting of the \"Troublesome Reign\" is neither unparalleled in the period, nor proof of Shakespeare's involvement.\nShakespeare derived from \"Holinshed's Chronicles\" certain verbal collocations and points of action. Honigmann discerned in the play the influence of John Foxe's \"Acts and Monuments\", Matthew Paris' \"Historia Maior\", and the Latin \"Wakefield Chronicle\", but Muir demonstrated that this apparent influence could be explained by the priority of the \"Troublesome Reign\", which contains similar or identical matter.\nDate and text.\nThe date of composition is unknown, but must lie somewhere between 1587, the year of publication of the second, revised edition of \"Holinshed's Chronicles\", upon which Shakespeare drew for this and other plays, and 1598, when \"King John\" was mentioned among Shakespeare's plays in the \"Palladis Tamia\" of Francis Meres. The editors of the Oxford Shakespeare conclude from the play's incidence of rare vocabulary, use of colloquialisms in verse, pause patterns, and infrequent rhyming that the play was composed in 1596, after \"Richard II\" but before \"Henry IV, Part I\".\n\"King John\" was first printed in 1623 as part of the First Folio. A play titled \"The Troublesome Reign of King John\" attributed to Shakespeare first printed in 1591 exists, but modern scholars dismiss the attribution as extremely unlikely to be legitimate.\n\"King John\" is one of only two plays by Shakespeare that are entirely written in verse, the other being \"Richard II\".\nPerformance history.\nThe earliest documented performance dates from 1737, when John Rich staged a production at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 1745, the year of the Jacobite rebellion, competing productions were staged by Colley Cibber at Covent Garden and David Garrick at Drury Lane. Charles Kemble's 1823 production made a serious effort at historical accuracy, inaugurating the 19th century tradition of striving for historical accuracy in Shakespearean production. Other successful productions of the play were staged by William Charles Macready (1842) and Charles Kean (1846). Twentieth century revivals include Robert B. Mantell's 1915 production (the last production to be staged on Broadway) and Peter Brook's 1945 staging, featuring Paul Scofield as the Bastard.\nIn the Victorian era, \"King John\" was one of Shakespeare's most frequently staged plays, in part because its spectacle and pageantry were congenial to Victorian audiences. \"King John\", however, has decreased in popularity: it is now one of Shakespeare's least-known plays and stagings of it are very rare. It has been staged four times on Broadway, the last time in 1915. It has also been staged five times from 1953 to 2014 at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival.\nHerbert Beerbohm Tree made a silent film version in 1899 entitled \"King John\". It is a short film consisting of the King's death throes in Act\u00a0V, Scene\u00a0vii and is the earliest surviving film adaptation of a Shakespearean play. \"King John\" has been produced for television twice: in 1951 with Donald Wolfit and in 1984 with Leonard Rossiter as part of the BBC Television Shakespeare series of adaptations.\nGeorge Orwell specifically praised the play in 1942 for its view of politics: \"When I had read it as a boy it seemed to me archaic, something dug out of a history book and not having anything to do with our own time. Well, when I saw it acted, what with its intrigues and doublecrossings, non-aggression pacts, quislings, people changing sides in the middle of a battle, and what-not, it seemed to me extraordinarily up to date.\"\nSelected recent revivals.\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company's 1974\u20135 production was heavily rewritten by director John Barton, who included material from \"The Troublesome Reign of King John\", John Bale's \"King Johan\" (thought to be Shakespeare's own sources) and other works. It has also presented three productions of \"King John\" this century: in 2006 directed by Josie Rourke as part of their Complete Works Festival, in 2012 directed by Maria Aberg who cast a woman, Pippa Nixon, in the role of the Bastard, and in 2020, directed by Eleanor Rhode and with a woman, Rosie Sheehy, cast in the role of King John. \nThe Oregon Shakespeare Festival has staged the play several times, most recently in 2022 in a production with a cast of women and non-binary actors.\nThe Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier presented the play in its 1990-1991 season and again in 2003-2004.\nIn 2008, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey produced \"King John\" as part of their annual Shakespeare in the Parks series. Director Tony White set the action in the medieval era but used a multi-ethnic and gender swapping cast.\nNew York's Theater for a New Audience presented a \"remarkable\" in-the-round production in 2000, emphasising Faulconbridge's introduction to court realpolitik to develop the audience's own awareness of the characters' motives. The director was Karin Coonrod.\nIn 2012, Bard on the Beach in Vancouver, British Columbia put on a production. It was also performed as part of the 2013 season at the Utah Shakespeare Festival, recipient of America's Outstanding Regional Theatre Tony Award (2000), presented by the American Theatre Wing and the League of American Theatres and Producers.\nThe play was presented at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by James Dacre, as part of the summer season 2015 in the 800th anniversary year of Magna Carta. A co-production with Royal &amp; Derngate, this production also played in Salisbury Cathedral, Temple Church and The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton.\nThe Rose Theatre, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey hosted Sir Trevor Nunn's direction of the play during May and June 2016, in the quatercentenary year of Shakespeare's death and the 800th anniversary year of King John's death.\nThe Worcester Repertory Company staged a production of the play (directed by Ben Humphrey) in 2016 around the tomb of King John in Worcester Cathedral on the 800th anniversary of the king's death. King John was played by Phil Leach.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It follows the King of Navarre and his three companions as they attempt to swear off the company of women for three years in order to focus on study and fasting. Their subsequent infatuation with the Princess of France and her ladies makes them forsworn (break their oath). In an untraditional ending for a comedy, the play closes with the death of the Princess's father, and all weddings are delayed for a year. The play draws on themes of masculine love and desire, reckoning and rationalisation, and reality versus fantasy.\nThough first published in quarto in 1598, the play's title page suggests a revision of an earlier version of the play. There are no obvious sources for the play's plot. The use of apostrophes in the play's title varies in early editions, though it is most commonly given as \"Love's Labour's Lost\".\nShakespeare's audiences were familiar with the historical personages portrayed and the political situation in Europe relating to the setting and action of the play. Scholars suggest the play lost popularity as these historical and political portrayals of Navarre's court became dated and less accessible to theatergoers of later generations. The play's sophisticated wordplay, pedantic humour and dated literary allusions may also be causes for its relative obscurity, as compared with Shakespeare's more popular works. \"Love's Labour's Lost\" was rarely staged in the 19th century, but it has been seen more often in the 20th and 21st centuries, with productions by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre, and the Stratford Festival of Canada, among others. It has also been adapted as a musical, an opera, for radio and television and as a musical film.\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSynopsis.\nFerdinand, King of Navarre, and his three noble companions, the Lords Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville, take an oath not to give in to the company of women. They devote themselves to three years of study and fasting; Berowne agrees somewhat more hesitantly than the others. The King declares that no woman should come within a mile of the court. Don Adriano de Armado, a Spaniard visiting the court, writes a letter to tell the King of a tryst between Costard and Jaquenetta. After the King sentences Costard, Don Armado confesses his own love for Jaquenetta to his page, Moth. Don Armado writes Jaquenetta a letter and asks Costard to deliver it.\nThe Princess of France and her ladies arrive, wishing to speak to the King regarding the cession of Aquitaine, but must ultimately make their camp outside the court due to the decree. In visiting the Princess and her ladies at their camp, the King falls in love with the Princess, as do the lords with the ladies. Berowne gives Costard a letter to deliver to the lady Rosaline, which Costard switches with Don Armado's letter that was meant for Jaquenetta. Jaquenetta consults two scholars, Holofernes and Sir Nathaniel, who conclude that the letter is written by Berowne and instruct her to tell the King.\nThe King and his lords lie in hiding and watch one another as each subsequently reveals his feelings of love. The King ultimately chastises the lords for breaking the oath, but Berowne reveals that the King is likewise in love with the Princess. Jaquenetta and Costard enter with Berowne's letter and accuse him of treason. Berowne confesses to breaking the oath, explaining that the only study worthy of mankind is that of love, and he and the other men collectively decide to relinquish the vow. Arranging for Holofernes to entertain the ladies later, the men then dress as Muscovites and court the ladies in disguise. The Queen's courtier Boyet, having overheard their planning, helps the ladies trick the men by disguising themselves as each other. When the lords return as themselves, the ladies taunt them and expose their ruse.\nImpressed by the ladies' wit, the men apologize, and when all identities are righted, they watch Holofernes, Sir Nathaniel, Costard, Moth and Don Armado present the Nine Worthies. The four lords and Boyet heckle the play, saving their sole praise for Costard. Don Armado and Costard almost come to blows when Costard reveals mid-pageant that Don Armado has got Jaquenetta pregnant. Their spat is interrupted by news that the Princess's father has died. The Princess makes plans to leave at once, and she and her ladies, readying for mourning, declare that the men must wait a year and a day to prove their loves lasting. Don Armado announces he will swear a similar oath to Jaquenetta and then presents the nobles with a song.\nSources.\n\"Love's Labour's Lost\" may be found to have a number of sources for various aspects, but a primary source for the story is not extant. It has this in common with two other Shakespeare plays \u2013 \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"The Tempest\". Some possible influences on \"Love's Labour's Lost\" can be found in the early plays of John Lyly, Robert Wilson's \"The Cobbler's Prophecy\" (c. 1590) and Pierre de La Primaudaye's \"L'Academie fran\u00e7aise\" (1577). Michael Dobson and Stanley Wells comment that it has often been conjectured that the plot derives from \"a now lost account of a diplomatic visit made to Henry in 1578 by Catherine de' Medici and her daughter Marguerite de Valois, Henry's estranged wife, to discuss the future of Aquitaine, but this is by no means certain.\"\nThe four main male characters are all loosely based on historical figures; Navarre is based on Henry of Navarre (who later became Henry IV of France), Berowne on Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron, Dumain on Charles, duc de Mayenne and Longaville on Henri I d'Orl\u00e9ans, duc de Longueville. Biron in particular was well known in England because Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, had joined forces with Biron's army in support of Henry in 1591. Albert Tricomi states that \"the play's humorous idealization could remain durable as long as the French names of its principal characters remained familiar to Shakespeare's audiences. This means that the witty portrayal of Navarre's court could remain reasonably effective until the assassination of Henry IV in 1610. ... Such considerations suggest that the portrayals of Navarre and the civil-war generals presented Elizabethan audiences not with a mere collection of French names in the news, but with an added dramatic dimension which, once lost, helps to account for the eclipse \"Love's Labour's Lost\" soon underwent.\"\nCritics have attempted to draw connections between notable Elizabethan English persons and the characters of Don Armado, Moth, Sir Nathaniel, and Holofernes, with little success.\nDate and text.\nMost scholars believe the play was written in 1594\u20131595, but not later than 1598. \"Love's Labour's Lost\" was first published in quarto in 1598 by the bookseller Cuthbert Burby. The title page states that the play was \"Newly corrected and augmented by W. Shakespere,\" which has suggested to some scholars a revision of an earlier version.\nDating to 1598, Edinburgh University's manuscript is one of the earliest known copies of the work and according to its title page, is the same version as that which was presented to Queen Elizabeth I the previous Christmas, in 1597. It is in quarto format and was donated to Edinburgh University between 1626 and 1636 by former student William Drummond of Hawthornden, making it part of the university's first literature collection.\nThe play next appeared in print in the First Folio in 1623, with a later quarto in 1631. \"Love's Labour's Won\" is considered by some to be a lost sequel.\nThe speech given by Berowne at 4.3.284\u2013361 is potentially the longest in all of Shakespeare's plays, depending on editorial choices. Shakespeare critic and editor Edward Capell has pointed out that certain passages within the speech seem to be redundant and argues that these passages represent a first draft which was not adequately corrected before going to print. Specifically, lines 291\u2013313 are \"repeated in substance\" further in the speech and are sometimes omitted by editors. With no omissions, the speech is 77 lines and 588 words.\nAnalysis and criticism.\nTitle.\nThe title is normally given as \"Love's Labour's Lost\". The use of apostrophes varies in early editions. In its first 1598 quarto publication it appears as \"Loues labors lo\u017ft\". In the 1623 First Folio it is \"Loues Labour's Lost\" and in the 1631 quarto it is \"Loues Labours Lost\". In the Third Folio it appears for the first time with the modern punctuation and spelling as \"Love's Labour's Lost\". Historian John Hale notes that the title could be read as \"love's labour is lost\" or \"the lost labours of love\" depending on punctuation. Hale suggests that this parallel nature of product and process was intended and is derived from existing Latin idioms. Hale suggests that the witty alliteration of the title is in keeping with the pedantic nature of the play. In 1935 Frances Yates asserted that the title derived from a line in John Florio's \"His firste Fruites\" (1578): \"We neede not speak so much of loue, al books are ful of lou, with so many authours, that it were labour lost to speake of Loue\", a source from which Shakespeare also took the untranslated Venetian proverb \"Venetia, Venetia/Chi non ti vede non ti pretia\" (LLL 4.2.92\u201393) (\"Venice, Venice, Who does not see you cannot praise you\").\nReputation.\n\"Love's Labour's Lost\" abounds in sophisticated wordplay, puns, and literary allusions and is filled with clever pastiches of contemporary poetic forms. Critic and historian John Pendergast states that \"perhaps more than any other Shakespearean play, it explores the power and limitations of language, and this blatant concern for language led many early critics to believe that it was the work of a playwright just learning his art.\" In \"The Western Canon\" (1994), Harold Bloom lauds the work as \"astonishing\" and refers to it as Shakespeare's \"first absolute achievement\". It is often assumed that the play was written for performance at the Inns of Court, whose students would have been most likely to appreciate its style. It has never been among Shakespeare's most popular plays, probably because its pedantic humour and linguistic density are extremely demanding of contemporary theatregoers. The satirical allusions of Navarre's court are likewise inaccessible, \"having been principally directed to fashions of language that have long passed away, and [are] consequently little understood, rather than in any great deficiency of invention.\"\nThemes.\nMasculine desire.\nMasculine desire structures the play and helps to shape its action. The men's sexual appetite manifests in their desire for fame and honour; the notion of women as dangerous to masculinity and intellect is established early on. The King and his Lords' desires for their idealized women are deferred, confused, and ridiculed throughout the play. As the play comes to a close, their desire is deferred yet again, resulting in an increased exaltation of the women.\nCritic Mark Breitenberg commented that the use of idealistic poetry, popularized by Petrarch, effectively becomes the textualized form of the male gaze. In describing and idealizing the ladies, the King and his Lords exercise a form of control over women they love. Don Armado also represents masculine desire through his relentless pursuit of Jacquenetta. The theme of desire is heightened by the concern of increasing female sexuality throughout the Renaissance period and the consequent threat of cuckoldry. Politics of love, marriage, and power are equally forceful in shaping the thread of masculine desire that drives the plot.\nReckoning and rationalization.\nThe term 'reckoning' is used in its multiple meanings throughout the Shakespeare canon. In \"Love's Labour's Lost\" in particular, it is often used to signify a moral judgement; most notably, the idea of a final reckoning as it relates to death. Though the play entwines fantasy and reality, the arrival of the messenger to announce the death of the Princess's father ultimately brings this notion to a head. Scholar Cynthia Lewis suggested that the appearance of the final reckoning is necessary in reminding the lovers of the seriousness of marriage. The need to settle the disagreement between Navarre and France likewise suggests an instance of reckoning, though this particular reckoning is settled offstage. This is presented in stark contrast to the final scene, in which the act of reckoning cannot be avoided. In acknowledging the consequences of his actions, Don Armado is the only one to deal with his reckoning in a noble manner. The Lords and the King effectively pass judgement on themselves, revealing their true moral character when mocking the players during the representation of the Nine Worthies.\nSimilar to reckoning is the notion of rationalization, which provides the basis for the swift change in the ladies' feelings for the men. The ladies are able to talk themselves into falling in love with the men due to the rationalization of the men's purported flaws. Lewis concluded that \"the proclivity to rationalize a position, a like, or a dislike, is linked in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" with the difficulty of reckoning absolute value, whose slipperiness is indicated throughout the play.\"\nReality versus fantasy.\nCritic Joseph Westlund wrote that \"Love's Labour's Lost\" functions as a \"prelude to the more extensive commentary on imagination in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\" There are several plot points driven by fantasy and imagination throughout the play. The Lords and the King's declaration of abstinence is a fancy that falls short of achievement. This fantasy rests on the men's idea that the resulting fame will allow them to circumvent death and oblivion, a fantastical notion itself. Within moments of swearing their oath, it becomes clear that their fantastical goal is unachievable given the reality of the world, the unnatural state of abstinence itself, and the arrival of the Princess and her ladies. This juxtaposition ultimately lends itself to the irony and humour in the play.\nThe commoners represent the theme of reality and achievement versus fantasy via their production regarding the Nine Worthies. Like the men's fantastical pursuit of fame, the play within a play represents the commoners' concern with fame. The relationship between the fantasy of love and the reality of worthwhile achievement, a popular Renaissance topic, is also utilized throughout the play. Don Armado attempts to reconcile these opposite desires using Worthies who fell in love as model examples. Time is suspended throughout the play and is of little substance to the plot. The Princess, though originally \"craving quick dispatch,\" quickly falls under the spell of love and abandons her urgent business. This suggests that the majority of the action takes place within a fantasy world. Only with the news of the Princess's father's death are time and reality reawakened.\nMusic.\nUnlike many of Shakespeare's plays, music plays a role only in the final scene of \"Love's Labour's Lost\". The songs of spring and winter, titled \"Ver and Hiems\" and \"The Cuckoo and the Owl\", respectively, occur near the end of the play. Given the critical controversy regarding the exact dating of \"Love's Labour's Lost\", there is some indication that \"the songs belong to the 1597 additions.\"\nDifferent interpretations of the meaning of these songs include: optimistic commentary for the future, bleak commentary regarding the recent announcement of death, or an ironic device by which to direct the King and his Lords towards a new outlook on love and life. In keeping with the theme of time as it relates to reality and fantasy, these are seasonal songs that restore the sense of time to the play. Due to the opposing nature of the two songs, they can be viewed as a debate on the opposing attitudes on love found throughout the play. Catherine McLay comments that the songs are functional in their interpretation of the central themes in \"Love's Labour's Lost\". McLay also suggests that the songs negate what many consider to be a \"heretical\" ending for a comedy. The songs, a product of traditional comedic structure, are a method by which the play can be \"[brought] within the periphery of the usual comic definition.\"\nCritic Thomas Berger states that, regardless of the meaning of these final songs, they are important in their contrast with the lack of song throughout the rest of the play. In cutting themselves off from women and the possibility of love, the King and his Lords have effectively cut themselves off from song. Song is allowed into the world of the play at the beginning of Act III, after the Princess and her ladies have been introduced and the men begin to fall in love. Moth's song \"Concolinel\" indicates that the vows will be broken. In Act I, Scene II, Moth recites a poem but fails to sing it. Don Armado insists that Moth sing it twice, but he does not. Berger infers that a song was intended to be inserted at this point, but was never written. Had a song been inserted at this point of the play, it would have followed dramatic convention of the time, which often called for music between scenes.\nPerformance history.\nThe earliest recorded performance of the play occurred at Christmas in 1597 at the Court before Queen Elizabeth. A second performance is recorded to have occurred in 1605, either at the house of the Earl of Southampton or at that of Robert Cecil, Lord Cranborne. The first known production after Shakespeare's era was not until 1839, at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, with Madame Vestris as Rosaline. \"The Times\" was unimpressed, stating: \"The play moved very heavily. The whole dialogue is but a string of brilliant conceits, which, if not delivered well, are tedious and unintelligible. The manner in which it was played last night destroyed the brilliancy completely, and left a residuum of insipidity which was encumbered rather than relieved by the scenery and decorations.\" The only other performances of the play recorded in England in the 19th century were at Sadler's Wells in 1857 and the St. James's Theatre in 1886.\nNotable 20th-century British productions included a 1936 staging at the Old Vic featuring Michael Redgrave as Ferdinand and Alec Clunes as Berowne. In 1949, the play was given at the New Theatre with Redgrave in the role of Berowne. The cast of a 1965 Royal Shakespeare Company production included Glenda Jackson, Janet Suzman and Timothy West. In 1968, the play was staged by Laurence Olivier for the National Theatre, with Derek Jacobi as the Duke and Jeremy Brett as Berowne. The Royal Shakespeare Company produced the play again in 1994. The critic Michael Billington wrote in his review of the production: \"The more I see \"Love's Labour's Lost\", the more I think it Shakespeare's most beguiling comedy. It both celebrates and satisfies linguistic exuberance, explores the often painful transition from youth to maturity, and reminds us of our common mortality.\"\nIn late summer 2005, an adaptation of the play was staged in the Dari language in Kabul, Afghanistan by a group of Afghan actors, and was reportedly very well received.\nA 2009 staging by Shakespeare's Globe theatre, with artistic direction by Dominic Dromgoole, toured internationally. Ben Brantley, in \"The New York Times\", called the production, seen at Pace University, \"sophomoric\". He postulated that the play itself \"may well be the first and best example of a genre that would flourish in less sophisticated forms five centuries later: the college comedy.\"\nIn 2014, the Royal Shakespeare Company completed a double-feature in which \"Love's Labour's Lost\", set on the eve of the First World War, is followed by \"Much Ado About Nothing\" (re-titled \"Love's Labour's Won\"). Dominic Cavendish of the \"Telegraph\" called it \"the most blissfully entertaining and emotionally involving RSC offering I've seen in ages\" and remarked that \"Parallels between the two works \u2013 the sparring wit, the sex-war skirmishes, the shift from showy linguistic evasion to heart-felt earnestness \u2013 become persuasively apparent.\"\nAdaptations.\nLiterature.\nAlfred Tennyson's poem \"The Princess\" (and, by extension, Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera \"Princess Ida\") is speculated by Gerhard Joseph to have been inspired by \"Love's Labour's Lost\".\nThomas Mann in his novel \"Doctor Faustus\" (1943) has the fictional German composer Adrian Leverk\u00fchn attempt to write an opera on the story of the play.\nMusical theatre, opera, and plays.\nAn opera of the same title as the play was composed by Nicolas Nabokov, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, and first performed in 1973.\nIn the summer of 2013, The Public Theater in New York City presented a musical adaptation of the play as part of their Shakespeare in the Park programming. This production marked the first new Shakespeare-based musical to be produced at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park since the 1971 mounting of \"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\" with music by Galt MacDermot. The adaptation of \"Love's Labour's Lost\" featured a score by \"Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\" collaborators Michael Friedman and Alex Timbers. Timbers also directed the production, which starred Daniel Breaker, Colin Donnell, Rachel Dratch, and Patti Murin, among others.\nThe 2004 ska musical \"The Big Life\" is based on \"Love's Labour's Lost\", reworked to be about the Windrush generation arriving in London.\nMarc Palmieri's 2015 play \"The Groundling\", a farce the \"New York Times\" referred to as \"half comedy and half tragedy\", was billed as a \"meditation on the meaning of the final moments of \"Love's Labour's Lost\"\".\nFilm, television and radio.\nKenneth Branagh's 2000 film adaptation relocated the setting to the 1930s and attempted to make the play more accessible by turning it into a musical. The film was a box office disappointment.\nThe play was one of the last works to be recorded for the BBC Television Shakespeare project, broadcast in 1985. The production set events in the eighteenth century, the costumes and sets being modeled on the paintings of Jean-Antoine Watteau. This was the only instance in the project of a work set in a period after Shakespeare's death. The play is featured in an episode of the British TV show, \"Doctor Who\". The episode, entitled \"The Shakespeare Code\", focuses on Shakespeare himself and a hypothetical follow-up play, \"Love's Labour's Won\", whose final scene is used as a portal for alien witches to invade Earth. All copies of this play disappear along with the witches.\nBBC Radio 3 aired a radio adaptation on 16 December 1946, directed by Noel Illif, with music by Gerald Finzi scored for a small chamber orchestra. The cast included Paul Scofield. The music was subsequently converted into an orchestral suite. BBC Radio 3 aired another radio adaptation on 22 February 1979, directed by David Spenser, with music by Derek Oldfield. The cast included Michael Kitchen as Ferdinand; John McEnery as Berowne; Anna Massey as the Princess of France; Eileen Atkins as Rosaline; and Paul Scofield as Don Adriano.\nA modern-language adaptation of the play, titled \"Groups of Ten or More People\", was released online by Chicago-based company Littlebrain Theatre in July 2020. This adaptation, set during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, was filmed entirely over the digital conferencing program Zoom.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67018", "revid": "5386750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67018", "title": "Eugene O'Neill", "text": "American playwright (1888\u20131953)\nEugene Gladstone O'Neill (October 16, 1888 \u2013 November 27, 1953) was an American playwright. His poetically titled plays were among the first to introduce into the U.S. the drama techniques of realism, earlier associated with Chekhov, Ibsen, and Strindberg. The tragedy \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" is often included on lists of the finest American plays in the 20th century, alongside Tennessee Williams's \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\". He was awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature. O'Neill is also the only playwright to win four Pulitzer Prizes for Drama.\nO'Neill's plays were among the first to include speeches in American English vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society. They struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations, ultimately sliding into disillusion and despair. Of his very few comedies, only one is well known (\"Ah, Wilderness!\"). Nearly all of his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism.\nEarly life.\nO'Neill was born on October 16, 1888, in a hotel, the Barrett House, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square) in New York City. A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, shops, and the ABC Studios.\nHe was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. His father suffered from alcoholism; his mother from an addiction to morphine, prescribed to relieve the pains of the difficult birth of her third son Eugene. Because his father was often on tour with a theatrical company accompanied by his mother, in 1895 O'Neill was sent to St. Aloysius Academy for Boys, a Catholic boarding school in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. In 1900 he became a day student at the De La Salle Institute on 59th Street in Manhattan.\nThe O'Neill family reunited for summers at the Monte Cristo Cottage in New London, Connecticut. He also briefly attended Betts Academy in Stamford. He attended Princeton University for one year. Accounts vary as to why he left. He may have been dropped for attending too few classes, been suspended for \"conduct code violations\", or \"for breaking a window\", or according to a more concrete but possibly apocryphal account, because he threw \"a beer bottle into the window of Professor Woodrow Wilson\", the future president of the United States.\nO'Neill spent several years at sea, during which he suffered from depression, alcoholism, and despair. Despite this, he had a deep love for the sea and it became a prominent theme in many of his plays, several of which are set on board ships like those on which he worked. O'Neill joined the Marine Transport Workers Union of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which was fighting for improved living conditions for the working class using quick 'on the job' direct action. O'Neill's parents and elder brother Jamie (who drank himself to death at the age of 45) died within three years of one another, not long after he had begun to make his mark in the theater.\nCareer.\nAfter returning to New York and living in poverty, O'Neill attempted suicide in 1912 in his room at Jimmy-the-Priest's boarding house and saloon, which \u2014 together with the Hell Hole \u2014 would one day become the setting for his play \"The Iceman Cometh\". That same year, he and his first wife Kathleen divorced, and he contracted tuberculosis. It was during his recovery at a sanatorium \u2014 which he came to regard as his \"rebirth\" \u2014 that he determined he would become a playwright. \"I want to be an artist or nothing,\" he said.\nAfter recovering from tuberculosis, he decided to devote himself full time to writing plays (the events immediately prior to entering the sanatorium are dramatized in his masterpiece, \"Long Day's Journey into Night\"). O'Neill had previously been employed by the \"New London Telegraph\", writing poetry as well as reporting. In the fall of 1914, O'Neill studied at Harvard University with George Pierce Baker, who ran a famous course called \u201cWorkshop 47\u201d that taught the fundamentals of playwriting, but left after one year.\nDuring the 1910s, O'Neill was a regular on the Greenwich Village literary scene, where he also befriended many radicals, most notably Communist Labor Party of America founder John Reed. O'Neill also had a brief romantic relationship with Reed's wife, writer Louise Bryant. O'Neill was portrayed by Jack Nicholson in the 1981 film \"Reds\", about the life of John Reed; Louise Bryant was portrayed by Diane Keaton.\nHis involvement with the Provincetown Players began in mid-1916. Terry Carlin reported that O'Neill arrived for the summer in Provincetown with \"a trunk full of plays\", but this was an exaggeration. Susan Glaspell describes a reading of \"Bound East for Cardiff\" that took place in the living room of Glaspell and her husband George Cram Cook's home on Commercial Street, adjacent to the wharf (pictured) that was used by the Players for their theater: \"So Gene took \"Bound East for Cardiff\" out of his trunk, and Freddie Burt read it to us, Gene staying out in the dining-room while reading went on. He was not left alone in the dining-room when the reading had finished.\" The Provincetown Players performed many of O'Neill's early works in their theaters both in Provincetown and on MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. Some of these early plays, such as \"The Emperor Jones\", began downtown and then moved to Broadway.\nIn an early one-act play, \"The Web\", written in 1913, O'Neill first explored the darker themes that he later thrived on. Here he focused on the brothel world and the lives of prostitutes, which also play a role in some fourteen of his later plays. In particular, he memorably included the birth of an infant into the world of prostitution. At the time, such themes constituted a huge innovation, as these sides of life had never before been presented with such success.\nO'Neill's first published play, \"Beyond the Horizon\", opened on Broadway in 1920 to great acclaim and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. His first major hit was \"The Emperor Jones\", which ran on Broadway in 1920 and obliquely commented on the U.S. occupation of Haiti that was a topic of debate in that year's presidential election. His best known plays include \"Anna Christie\" (Pulitzer Prize 1922), \"Desire Under the Elms\" (1924), \"Strange Interlude\" (Pulitzer Prize 1928), \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" (1931), and his only well known comedy, \"Ah, Wilderness!\", a wistful re-imagining of his youth as he wished it had been.\nO'Neill was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1935. In 1936 O'Neill received the Nobel Prize in Literature after he had been nominated that year by Henrik Sch\u00fcck, member of the Swedish Academy. O'Neill was profoundly influenced by the work of Swedish writer August Strindberg, and, upon receiving the Nobel Prize, dedicated much of his acceptance speech to him. In conversation with Russel Crouse, O'Neill said that \"the Strindberg part of the speech is no 'telling tale' to please the Swedes with a polite gesture. It is absolutely sincere. [...] And it's absolutely true that I am proud of the opportunity to acknowledge my debt to Strindberg thus publicly to his people\". Before the speech was sent to Stockholm, O'Neill read it to his friend Sophus Keith Winther. As he was reading, he suddenly interrupted himself with the comment: \"I wish immortality were a fact, for then some day I would meet Strindberg\". When Winther objected that \"that would scarcely be enough to justify immortality\", O'Neill answered quickly and firmly: \"It would be enough for me\".\nAfter a ten-year pause, O'Neill's now renowned play \"The Iceman Cometh\" was produced in 1946. The following year's \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\" failed, and it was decades before the piece came to be considered as among his best works.\nHe was also part of the modern movement to partially revive the classical heroic mask from ancient Greek theatre and Japanese Noh theatre in some of his plays, such as \"The Great God Brown\" and \"Lazarus Laughed.\"\nFamily life.\nO'Neill was married to Kathleen Jenkins from October 2, 1909, to 1912, during which time they had one son, Eugene O'Neill, Jr. (1910\u20131950). In 1917 O'Neill met Agnes Boulton, a successful writer of commercial fiction, and they married on April 12, 1918. They lived in a home owned by her parents in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. The years of their marriage\u2014during which the couple lived in Connecticut and Bermuda and had two children, Shane and Oona\u2014are described vividly in her 1958 memoir \"Part of a Long Story\". They divorced on July 2, 1929, after O'Neill abandoned Boulton and the children for the actress Carlotta Monterey. O'Neill and Monterey married less than a month after he officially divorced his previous wife.\nIn 1929 O'Neill and Monterey moved to the Loire Valley in central France, where they lived in the Ch\u00e2teau du Plessis in Saint-Antoine-du-Rocher, Indre-et-Loire. During the early 1930s they returned to the United States and lived in Sea Island, Georgia, at a house called Casa Genotta. He moved to Danville, California, in 1937 and lived there until 1944. His house there, \"Tao House\", is today the Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site.\nIn their first years together, Monterey organized O'Neill's life, enabling him to devote himself to writing. She later became addicted to potassium bromide, and the marriage deteriorated, resulting in a number of separations, although they never divorced.\nIn 1943 O'Neill disowned his daughter Oona for marrying the English actor, director, and producer Charlie Chaplin when she was 18 and Chaplin was 54. He never saw Oona again. Through his daughter, O'Neill had eight grandchildren whom he never met.\nHe also had distant relationships with his sons. Eugene O'Neill Jr., a Yale classicist, suffered from alcoholism and committed suicide in 1950 at the age of 40. Shane O'Neill became a heroin addict and moved into the family home in Bermuda, \"Spithead,\" with his new wife, where he supported himself by selling off the furnishings. He was also disowned by his father before committing suicide (by jumping out of a window) a number of years later. Oona ultimately inherited Spithead and the connected estate (subsequently known as the Chaplin Estate). In 1950 O'Neill joined The Lambs, the famed theater club.\nIllness and death.\nAfter suffering from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O'Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinson's-like tremor in his hands that made it impossible for him to write during the last ten years of his life; he tried dictation but found himself unable to compose that way. While at Tao House, O'Neill had intended to write a collection of works he called \"the Cycle\", chronicling American life spanning from 1755 to 1932. Only two of the eleven plays O'Neill proposed, \"A Touch of the Poet\" and \"More Stately Mansions\", were completed. As his health worsened, O'Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, \"The Iceman Cometh\", \"Long Day's Journey into Night\", and \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\", which he completed in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. The book \"\"Love and Admiration and Respect\": The O'Neill-Commins Correspondence\"\" includes an extended account written by Saxe Commins, O'Neill's publisher, in which he talks of \"snatches of dialogue\" between Carlotta and O'Neill over the disappearance of a group of manuscripts that O'Neill had brought with him from San Francisco. \"When the table was cleared I learned the cause of the tension; the manuscripts were lost. They had disappeared mysteriously during the day and there was no clue to their whereabouts.\"\nO'Neill died at the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University's Kilachand Hall) on Bay State Road in Boston on November 27, 1953, at age 65. As he was dying, he whispered: \"I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.\" He is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.\nIn 1956 Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. It is widely considered his finest play. Other posthumously published works include \"A Touch of the Poet\" (1958) and \"More Stately Mansions\" (1967).\nIn 1967 the United States Postal Service honored O'Neill with a Prominent Americans series (1965\u20131978) $1 postage stamp.\nIn 2000 a team of researchers studying O'Neill's autopsy report concluded that he died of cerebellar cortical atrophy, a rare form of brain deterioration unrelated to either alcohol use or Parkinson's disease.\nLegacy.\nIn Warren Beatty's 1981 film \"Reds\", O'Neill is portrayed by Jack Nicholson, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.\nGeorge C. White founded the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut in 1964.\nEugene O'Neill is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.\nO'Neill is referenced by Upton Sinclair in \"The Cup of Fury\" (1956), by Dianne Wiest's character in \"Bullets Over Broadway\" (1994), by J.K. Simmons' character in \"Whiplash\" (2014), by Tony Stark in \"\" (2015), specifically \"Long Day's Journey into Night\", and \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" is also referenced by Patrick Wilson's character in \"Purple Violets\" (2007).\nO'Neill is referred to in Moss Hart's 1959 book \"Act One\", later a Broadway play.\nMuseums and collections.\nO'Neill's home in New London, Monte Cristo Cottage, was made a National Historic Landmark in 1971. His home in Danville, California, near San Francisco, was preserved as the Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site in 1976.\nConnecticut College maintains the Louis Sheaffer Collection, consisting of material collected by the O'Neill biographer. The principal collection of O'Neill papers is at Yale University. The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut, fosters the development of new plays under his name.\nThere is also a theatre in New York City named after him located at 230 West 49th Street in midtown-Manhattan.

{"id": "67019", "revid": "12845131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67019", "title": "SSM-N-8 Regulus", "text": "US Navy cruise missile\nThe SSM-N-8A Regulus, also known as the Regulus I and RGM-6, is a nuclear-capable turbojet-powered second generation cruise missile operated by the US Navy between 1955 and 1964. Its development was an outgrowth of U.S. Navy tests conducted with the German V-1 missile at Naval Air Station Point Mugu in California. Its barrel-shaped fuselage resembled that of numerous fighter aircraft designs of the era, but without a cockpit. Test articles of the Regulus were equipped with landing gear and could take off and land like an airplane. When the missiles were deployed they were launched from a rail launcher, and equipped with a pair of Aerojet JATO bottles on the aft end of the fuselage.\nHistory.\nDesign and development.\nBackground.\nNazi Germany's use of the V-1 flying bomb during World War II marked the first combat deployment of a cruise missile, highlighting the potential of a new class of weapon. Even before Germany's surrender, the United States captured, reverse-engineered, and mass-produced its own version of the V-1, the Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon, intended for use against Japan. With the war's end and the onset of the Cold War, the U.S. sought new ways to deploy nuclear warheads. One proposal, put forward by Captain Thomas Klakring, was to launch nuclear missiles from submarines. He argued that submarines would be far more difficult to detect and attack than surface ships, such as aircraft carriers, while also introducing a new method of warhead delivery beyond aircraft. At the time, bombers were the U.S. military's only means of delivering nuclear warheads, a reliance that threatened to diminish the Navy's role and overemphasize a single approach to nuclear strategy.\nKlakring proposed launching the Loon from submarines to test his concept. Work began in 1946, and by 1947, USS \"Cusk\" became the first U.S. submarine to fire a guided missile. Testing continued for several years, but significant issues arose. \"Cusk\" nearly sank when a Loon exploded on deck, and the missile itself was slow, had limited range and payload, and was impractical for military use. Despite these shortcomings, the tests successfully demonstrated how a submarine could surface, launch a missile, and submerge again, making it difficult for an enemy to retaliate. The Navy acknowledged the concept\u2019s potential but recognized the need for a missile specifically designed for submarine deployment.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment of such a missile began with Grumman's SSM-N-6 Rigel and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory's SSM-N-2 Triton. However, work did not begin in earnest until August of 1947, days after the United States Army Air Force awarded a contract for the ground-based MGM-1 Matador cruise missile. The Navy, not wanting to lose its edge in missile development, began Project Regulus with the same equipment used in the Matador. On 17 November 1947, a contract was awarded to Chance Vought, which previously investigated a similar project as part of a study on \"pilotless missiles\". The company, desperate for government contracts as the money-making F4U Corsair production line was nearing an end, focused on a practical design that could be brought into service quickly. With its survival at stake, the company invested heavily in research and development, drawing from experience with jet fighter projects such as the broadly similar F6U Pirate. The Navy initially planned on having each missile be operational in a sequential order, starting with the simple Regulus and ending with the more complex but capable Triton in 1960. However, both the Rigel and Triton were powered by ramjets, which presented a significant challenge as the technology was too immature for immediate use, eventually leading to both programs' cancellation.51114, 117\nDesign.\nThe contract required the missile to have a range of at Mach 0.85, a warhead, and a circular error probable (margin of error) of .114 Regulus was designed to be long, in wingspan, in diameter, and would weigh between . The missile somewhat resembled the contemporary F-84 Thunderjet fighter aircraft, but without a cockpit, and test versions were equipped with landing gear so that they could be recovered and re-used. After launch, Regulus would be guided toward its target by control stations, typically by submarines or surface ships equipped with guidance equipment. It could also be flown remotely by chase aircraft. (Later, with the \"Trounce\" system (Tactical Radar Omnidirectional Underwater Navigational Control Equipment), one submarine could guide it). Army-Navy competition complicated both the Matador's and the Regulus' developments. The missiles looked alike and used the same engine. They had nearly identical performances, schedules, and costs. Under pressure to reduce defense spending, the United States Department of Defense ordered the Navy to determine if Matador could be adapted for their use. The Navy concluded that the Navy's Regulus could perform the Navy mission better.\nRegulus had some advantages over Matador. It required only two guidance stations while Matador required three. It could also be launched quicker, as Matador's boosters had to be fitted while the missile was on the launcher while Regulus was stowed with its boosters attached. Finally, Chance Vought built a recoverable version of the missile, designated KDU-1 and also used as a target drone, so that even though a Regulus test vehicle was more expensive to build, Regulus was cheaper to use over a series of tests. The Navy program continued, and the first Regulus flew in March 1951.\nDue to its size and regulations concerning oversize loads on highways, Chance Vought collaborated with a firm that specialized in trucking oversize loads to develop a special tractor trailer combination which could move a Regulus I missile.\nShips and submarines deployed with Regulus I.\nThe first launch from a submarine occurred in July 1953 from the deck of , a World War II fleet boat modified to carry Regulus. \"Tunny\" and her sister boat were the United States's first nuclear deterrent patrol submarines. They were joined in 1958 by two purpose-built Regulus submarines, and , and, later, by the nuclear-powered . \"Halibut\", with its extremely large internal hangar could carry five missiles and was intended to be the prototype of a whole new class of cruise missile firing SSG-N submarines.\nThe Navy strategy called for four Regulus missiles to be at sea at any given time. Thus, \"Barbero\" and \"Tunny\", each of which carried two Regulus missiles, patrolled simultaneously. \"Growler\" and \"Grayback\", with four missiles each, or \"Halibut\", with five, could patrol alone. Operating from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the five Regulus submarines made 40 nuclear deterrent patrols in the Northern Pacific Ocean between October 1959 and July 1964, including during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. According to the documentary \"Regulus: The First Nuclear Missile Submarines\" by Nick T. Spark, their primary task in the event of a nuclear exchange would be to eliminate the Soviet naval base at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. These deterrent patrols represented the first by the Navy's submarines and preceded those made by the Polaris missile submarines.\nThe Regulus firing submarines were relieved by the s carrying the Polaris missile system. \"Barbero\" also earned the distinction of launching the only delivery of missile mail.\nAdditional submarines including USS \"Cusk\" and USS \"Carbonero\" were equipped with control systems that allowed them to take control of a Regulus in flight, thus extending its range in a tactical situation.\nRegulus was also deployed by the U.S. Navy in 1955 in the Pacific on board the cruiser . In 1956, three more followed: , , and . These four s each carried three Regulus missiles on operational patrols in the Western Pacific. \"Macon\"'s last Regulus patrol was in 1958, \"Toledo\"'s in 1959, \"Helena\"'s in 1960, and \"Los Angeles\"'s in 1961.\nTen aircraft carriers were configured to operate Regulus missiles (though only six ever launched one). did not deploy with the missile but conducted the first launch of a Regulus from a warship. also did not deploy but was involved in two demonstration launches. and each conducted one test launch. deployed to the Mediterranean carrying three Regulus missiles. deployed once to the Western Pacific with four missiles in 1955. \"Lexington\", \"Hancock\", , and were involved in the development of the Regulus Assault Mission (RAM) concept. RAM converted the Regulus cruise missiles into an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV): Regulus missiles would be launched from cruisers or submarines, and once in flight, guided to their targets by carrier-based pilots with remote control equipment.\nReplacement and legacy.\nDespite being the U.S. Navy's first underwater nuclear capability, the Regulus missile system had significant operational drawbacks. In order to launch, the submarine had to surface and assemble the missile in whatever sea conditions it was in. Because it required active radar guidance, which only had a range of , the ship had to stay stationary on the surface to guide it to the target while effectively broadcasting its location. This guidance method was susceptible to jamming and since the missile was subsonic, the launch platform remained exposed and vulnerable to attack during its flight duration; destroying the ship would effectively disable the missile in flight.\nProduction of Regulus was phased out in January 1959 with delivery of the 514th missile; in 1962, it was redesignated RGM-6. It was removed from service in August 1964. Some of the obsolete missiles were expended as targets at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Regulus not only provided the first nuclear strategic deterrence force for the United States Navy during the first years of the Cold War and especially during the Cuban Missile Crisis, preceding the Polaris missiles, Poseidon missiles, and Trident missiles that followed, but it was also the forerunner of the Tomahawk cruise missile.Following retirement, a number of Regulus I missiles were converted for target drone usage under the designation BQM-6C.\nRegulus II.\nA second generation supersonic Vought SSM-N-9 Regulus II cruise missile with a range of and a speed of Mach 2 was developed and successfully tested, including a test launch from \"Grayback\", but the program was canceled in favor of the UGM-27 Polaris nuclear ballistic missile.\nThe Regulus II missile was a completely new design with improved guidance and double the range, and was intended to replace the Regulus I missile. Regulus II-equipped submarines and ships would have been fitted with the Ships Inertial Navigation System (SINS), allowing the missiles to be aligned accurately before take-off.\nForty-eight test flights of Regulus II prototypes were carried out, 30 of which were successful, 14 partially successful and four failures. A production contract was signed in January 1958 and the only submarine launch was carried out from \"Grayback\" in September 1958.\nDue to the high cost of the Regulus II (approximately one million dollars each), budgetary pressure, and the emergence of the UGM-27 Polaris SLBM (submarine-launched ballistic missile), the Regulus II program was canceled on 18 December 1958. At the time of cancellation Vought had completed 20 Regulus II missiles with 27 more on the production line. Production of Regulus I missiles continued until January 1959 with delivery of the 514th missile, and it was withdrawn from service in August 1964.\nBoth Regulus I and Regulus II were used as target drones after 1964.\nSurviving examples.\nThe following museums in the United States have Regulus missiles on display as part of their collections:\nRegulus I missile in launch position at the Carolinas Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina.

He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in \"A Free Soul\" (1931) and is known to modern audiences for the role of villainous Mr. Potter in Frank Capra's 1946 film \"It's a Wonderful Life\".\nHe is also particularly remembered as Ebenezer Scrooge in annual broadcasts of \"A Christmas Carol\" during his last two decades. He is also known for playing Dr. Leonard Gillespie in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's nine Dr. Kildare films, a role he reprised in a further six films focusing solely on Gillespie and in a radio series titled \"The Story of Dr. Kildare\". He was a member of the theatrical Barrymore family.\nEarly life.\nLionel Barrymore was born Lionel Herbert Blyth in Philadelphia, the son of actors Georgiana Drew Barrymore and Maurice Barrymore (born Herbert Arthur Chamberlayne Blyth). He was the elder brother of Ethel and John Barrymore, the uncle of John Drew Barrymore and Diana Barrymore and the great-uncle of Drew Barrymore, among other members of the Barrymore family. He attended private schools as a child, including the Art Students League of New York. While raised a Roman Catholic, Barrymore attended the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. Barrymore graduated from Seton Hall Preparatory School, the Roman Catholic college prep school, in the class of 1891.\nCareer.\nStage.\nReluctant to follow his parents' career, Barrymore appeared together with his grandmother Louisa Lane Drew on tour and in a stage production of \"The Rivals\" in 1893 at the age of 15. He later recounted that \"I didn't want to act. I wanted to paint or draw. The theater was not in my blood, I was related to the theater by marriage only; it was merely a kind of \"in-law\" of mine I had to live with.\" Nevertheless, he soon found success on stage in character roles and continued to act, although he still wanted to become a painter and also to compose music. He appeared on Broadway in his early twenties with his uncle John Drew Jr. in such plays as \"The Second in Command\" (1901) and \"The Mummy and the Hummingbird\" (1902), the latter of which won him critical acclaim. \"The Other Girl\" in 1903\u201304 was a long-running success for Barrymore. In 1905, he appeared with John and Ethel in a pantomime, starring as the title character in \"Pantaloon\" and playing another character in the other half of the bill, \"Alice Sit-by-the-Fire\".\nIn 1906, after a series of disappointing appearances in plays, Barrymore and his first wife, the actress Doris Rankin, left their stage careers and travelled to Paris, where he trained as an artist. Lionel and Doris were in Paris in 1908 when their first baby, Ethel, was born. Lionel confirms in his autobiography, \"We Barrymores\", that he and Doris were in France when Bleriot flew the English Channel on July 25, 1909. He did not achieve success as a painter and in 1909 he returned to the US. In December of that year he returned to the stage in \"The Fires of Fate\", in Chicago, but left the production later that month after suffering an attack of nerves about the forthcoming New York opening. The producers gave appendicitis as the reason for his sudden departure. Nevertheless, he was soon back on Broadway in \"The Jail Bird\" in 1910 and continued his stage career with several more plays. He also joined his family troupe, from 1910, in their vaudeville act, where he was happy not to worry as much about memorizing lines.\nFrom 1912 to 1917 Barrymore was away from the stage again while he established his film career, but after the First World War he had several successes on Broadway, where he established his reputation as a dramatic and character actor, often performing with his wife. He returned to the stage in \"Peter Ibbetson\" (1917) with his brother, John, and achieved star billing in \"The Copperhead\" (1918) (with Doris). He retained star billing for the next 6 years in plays such as \"The Jest\" (1919) (again with John) and \"The Letter of the Law\" (1920). Lionel gave a short-lived performance as MacBeth in 1921 opposite veteran actress Julia Arthur as Lady MacBeth, but the production encountered strongly negative criticism. His last stage success was in \"Laugh, Clown, Laugh\", in 1923, with his second wife, Irene Fenwick; they met while acting together in \"The Claw\" the previous year, and after they fell in love he divorced his first wife. He also received negative notices in three productions in a row in 1925. After appearing in \"Man or Devil\" in 1926, he signed a film contract with MGM and after the advent of sound films in 1927, he never again appeared on stage.\nFilm.\nBarrymore joined Biograph Studios in 1909 and began to appear in leading roles by 1911 in films directed by D. W. Griffith. Barrymore made \"The Battle\" (1911), \"The New York Hat\" (1912), \"Friends\", and \"Three Friends\" (1913). In 1915, he co-starred with Lillian Russell in a movie called \"Wildfire\", one of the legendary Russell's few film appearances. He also was involved in writing and directing at Biograph. The last silent film he directed, \"Life's Whirlpool\" (Metro Pictures, 1917), starred his sister, Ethel. He acted in more than 60 silent films with Griffith.\nIn 1920, Barrymore reprised his stage role in the film adaptation of \"The Copperhead\". Also in 1920, he starred in the lead role of \"The Master Mind\", with Gypsy O'Brien co-starring.\nBefore the formation of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924, Barrymore forged a good relationship with Louis B. Mayer early on at Metro Pictures. He made several silent features for Metro, some of which are now lost. In 1923, Barrymore and Fenwick went to Italy to film \"The Eternal City\" for Metro Pictures in Rome, combining work with their honeymoon. He occasionally freelanced, returning to Griffith in 1924 to film \"America\". In 1925, he left New York for Hollywood.\nPrior to his marriage to Irene, Barrymore and his brother John engaged in a dispute over the issue of Irene's chastity in the wake of her having been one of John's lovers. The brothers didn't speak again for two years and weren't seen together until the premiere of John's film \"Don Juan\" in 1926, by which time they had patched up their differences. Barrymore signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1926 and his first picture there was \"The Barrier\". His first talking picture was \"The Lion and the Mouse\"; his stage experience allowed him to excel in delivering the dialogue in sound films.\nOn the occasional loan-out, Barrymore had a big success with Gloria Swanson in 1928's \"Sadie Thompson\" and the aforementioned Griffith film, \"Drums of Love\". In 1929, he returned to directing films. During this early and imperfect sound film period, he directed the controversial \"His Glorious Night\", with John Gilbert; \"Madame X\", starring Ruth Chatterton; and \"The Rogue Song\", Laurel and Hardy's first color film. He was credited with being the first director to move a microphone on a sound stage. Barrymore returned to acting in front of the camera in 1931. In the following year, he won an Academy Award for his role as an alcoholic lawyer in \"A Free Soul\" (1931), after being considered in 1930 for Best Director for \"Madame X\". He played alongside Greta Garbo in the 1931 film \u201cMata Hari\u201d. He could play many characters, like the evil Rasputin in the 1932 \"Rasputin and the Empress\" (in which he co-starred for the only time with siblings John and Ethel) and the ailing Oliver Jordan in \"Dinner at Eight\" (1933 \u2014 also with John, although they had no scenes together). He played Professor Zelen, the Occultist expert, in the classic horror \"Mark of the Vampire\" (1935).\nOn April 27, 1939, Louis B. Mayer threw Barrymore a 61st birthday party (the day before his actual birthday), broadcast live on \"Good News of 1939\", and required all MGM employees to attend. This was likely intended to distract from, and prevent MGM attendance of, the \"Confessions of a Nazi Spy\" premiere that occurred simultaneously. The film was highly controversial due to its anti-Nazi message.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, he became stereotyped as a grouchy but sweet elderly man in such films as \"The Mysterious Island\" (1929), \"Grand Hotel\" (1932, with John Barrymore), Little Colonel (1935, with Shirley Temple and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson), \"Captains Courageous\" (1937), \"Saratoga\" (1937, with Jean Harlow), \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938), \"On Borrowed Time\" (1939, with Cedric Hardwicke), \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946), \"Three Wise Fools\" (1946), and \"Key Largo\" (1948).\nIn a series of Doctor Kildare movies in the 1930s and 1940s, he played the irascible Doctor Gillespie, a role he repeated in an MGM radio series that debuted in New York in 1950 and was later syndicated. Barrymore had broken his hip in an accident, hence he played Gillespie in a wheelchair. Later, his worsening arthritis kept him in the chair. The injury also precluded his playing Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1938 MGM film version of \"A Christmas Carol\", a role Barrymore played every year but two (replaced by brother John Barrymore in 1936 and replaced by Orson Welles in 1938) on the radio from 1934 through 1953. He also played the title role in the 1940s radio series \"Mayor of the Town\".\nHe is well known for his role as Mr. Potter, the miserly and mean-spirited banker in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946) opposite James Stewart.\nHe had a role with Clark Gable in \"Lone Star\" in 1952. His final film appearance was a cameo in \"Main Street to Broadway\", an MGM musical comedy released in 1953. His sister Ethel also appeared in the film.\nPersonal life.\nBarrymore was married twice, to actresses Doris Rankin and Irene Fenwick, a one-time lover of his brother, John. Doris's sister Gladys was married to Lionel's uncle Sidney Drew, which made Gladys both his aunt and sister-in-law. Doris Rankin bore Lionel two daughters, Ethel Barrymore II and Mary Barrymore. Neither child survived infancy. Barrymore never truly recovered from the deaths of his girls and their loss undoubtedly strained his marriage to Doris Rankin, which ended in 1922. Years later Barrymore developed a fatherly affection for Jean Harlow, who was born about the same time as his daughters. When Harlow died in 1937, Barrymore and Clark Gable mourned her as though she had been family.\nPolitics.\nBarrymore was a Republican. In 1944, he attended the massive rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket as well as Governor Earl Warren of California, who would become Dewey's running mate in 1948 and later the Chief Justice of the United States. The gathering drew 93,000, with Cecil B. DeMille as the master of ceremonies and with short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney. Among the others in attendance were Ann Sothern, Ginger Rogers, Randolph Scott, Adolphe Menjou, Gary Cooper, Edward Arnold, William Bendix, and Walter Pidgeon.\nBarrymore registered for the draft during World War II, despite his age and disability, to encourage others to enlist in the military.\nHe loathed the income tax, and by the time he was appearing on \"Mayor of the Town\", MGM withheld a sizable portion of his paychecks, paying back the IRS the amount he owed.\nMedical issues.\nSeveral sources argue that arthritis alone confined Barrymore to a wheelchair. Film historian Jeanine Basinger says that his arthritis was serious by at least 1928, when Barrymore made \"Sadie Thompson\". Film historian David Wallace says it was well known that Barrymore was addicted to morphine due to arthritis by 1929. A history of Oscar-winning actors, however, says Barrymore was only suffering from arthritis, not crippled or incapacitated by it. Marie Dressler biographer Matthew Kennedy notes that when Barrymore won his Best Actor Oscar award in 1931, the arthritis was still so minor that it only made him limp a little as he went on stage to accept the honor. Barrymore can be seen being quite physical in late silent films like \"The Thirteenth Hour\" and \"West of Zanzibar\", where he can be seen climbing out of a window.\nPaul Donnelly says Barrymore's inability to walk was caused by a drawing table falling on him in 1936, breaking Barrymore's hip. Barrymore tripped over a cable while filming \"Saratoga\" in 1937 and broke his hip again. (Film historian Robert Osborne says Barrymore also suffered a broken kneecap.) The injury was so painful that Donnelly, quoting Barrymore, says that Louis B. Mayer bought $400 worth of cocaine for Barrymore every day to help him cope with the pain and allow him to sleep. Author David Schwartz says the hip fracture never healed, which was why Barrymore could not walk, and MGM historian John Douglas Eames describes the injury as \"crippling\". Barrymore himself said in 1951, that it was breaking his hip twice that kept him in the wheelchair. He said he had no other problems, and that the hip healed well, but it made walking exceptionally difficult. Film historian Allen Eyles reached the same conclusion.\nLew Ayres biographer Lesley Coffin and Louis B. Mayer biographer Scott Eyman argue that it was the combination of the broken hip and Barrymore's worsening arthritis that put him in a wheelchair. Barrymore family biographer Margot Peters says Gene Fowler and James Doane said Barrymore's arthritis was caused by syphilis, which they say he contracted in 1925. Eyman, however, explicitly rejects this hypothesis.\nWhatever the cause, Barrymore's performance in \"Captains Courageous\" in 1937 was one of the last times he would be seen standing and walking unassisted. On his next picture, \"Saratoga\", Barrymore tripped over a cable on set, breaking his hip for the second time in two years and reportedly breaking his knee cap. Afterward, Barrymore was able to get about for a short period of time on crutches even though he was in great pain. During the filming of 1938's \"You Can't Take It With You\", the pain of standing with crutches was so severe that Barrymore required hourly shots of painkillers. By 1938, Barrymore's disability forced him to relinquish the role of Ebenezer Scrooge (a role he made famous on the radio) to British actor Reginald Owen in the MGM film version of \"A Christmas Carol\". From then on, Barrymore used a wheelchair exclusively and never walked again. He could, however, stand for short periods of time such as at his brother's funeral in 1942.\nComposer, artist, novelist.\nBarrymore also composed music. His works ranged from solo piano pieces to large-scale orchestral works, such as \"Tableau Russe,\" which was performed twice in \"Dr. Kildare's Wedding Day\" (1941) as Cornelia's Symphony, first on piano by Nils Asther's character and later by a full symphony orchestra. His piano compositions, \"Scherzo Grotesque\" and \"Song Without Words\", were published by G. Schirmer in 1945. Upon the death of his brother John in 1942, he composed a work \"In Memoriam\", which was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. His orchestral Partita was given multiple performances. He also composed the theme song of the radio program \"Mayor of the Town\".\nBarrymore had attended art school in New York and Paris and was a skillful illustrator, creating etchings and drawings and was a member of the Society of American Etchers, now known as the Society of American Graphic Artists. For years, he maintained an artist's shop and studio attached to his home in Los Angeles. Some of his etchings were included in the \"Hundred Prints of the Year\".\nHe wrote a historical novel, \"Mr. Cantonwine: A Moral Tale\" (1953).\nHe was also a horticulturalist, growing roses on his Chatsworth Ranch.\nDeath.\nBarrymore died on November 15, 1954, aged 76, from a heart attack in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was entombed in the Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles.\nTributes.\nBarrymore received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960\u2014a motion pictures star and a radio star. The stars are located at 1724 Vine Street for motion pictures, and 1651 Vine Street for radio. He was also inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame, along with his siblings, Ethel and John.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their self-declared goal was to demonstrate to leftist groups in Peru that sought change through the current government the viability of radical revolution. The MRTA also aimed to provide an alternative to another militant group, the Shining Path, which placed them in direct competition. The group was led by V\u00edctor Polay Campos until he was sentenced to 32 years' imprisonment in 1992 and by N\u00e9stor Cerpa Cartolini (\"Comrade Evaristo\") until his death in 1997.\nThe MRTA took its name in homage to T\u00fapac Amaru II, an 18th-century rebel leader who was himself named after his claimed ancestor T\u00fapac Amaru, the last indigenous leader of the Inca people. The MRTA was designated as a terrorist organization by the Peruvian government, the US Department of State, and the European Parliament but was later removed from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations on 8 October 2001.\nAt the height of its strength, the movement had several hundred active members. Its stated goals were to establish a socialist state and rid the country of all imperialist elements.\nIdeology.\nThe ideology of the MRTA is informed by both Peruvian nationalism and Marxism-Leninism. The MRTA takes its name from Sapa Inca Tupac Amaru, the last Inca emperor who led a failed rebellion against the Spanish colonial government and was executed in 1572. One of his descendants, Jose Gabriel Condorcanqui, took the name Tupac Amaru II and led another popular revolt against the Spanish (1780\u20131782). The MRTA considered itself the vanguard of ideas that already had popular support among oppressed groups, much like the indigenous leader. In their official statements, the MRTA drew a connection to the anti-colonial struggle against the Spanish to the twentieth century, arguing that Peru was still a subordinate economy to the west especially the United States. Despite the inspiration from the past struggles of Indigenous peoples of Peru, MRTA was not founded by Indigenous leaders, it was not an ethnically focused Indigenous organization, and it was not primarily focused on Indigenous rights.\nThe MRTA argues that globalization is the mechanism of neo-colonialism, even that there is no real difference. The MRTA sees the IMF and World Bank as important instruments of neo-colonialism, and argues that the policies enforced by these organizations on Peru have caused unemployment and stalled development. In their first radio transmission, the MRTA said, \"the war which we begin today is a continuation of the open and clandestine war we Peruvians have waged against foreign and internal oppressors (for centuries).\" Drawing upon the works of Jose Carlos Mariategui's \"Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality\", the MRTA combines an appreciation for Peru's indigenous history with the works of Karl Marx. Peruvian Marxists differ from traditional Marxists in a few ways. Notably, the Peruvian Marxist tradition holds that non-industrial workers could become politically conscious and begin a popular uprising, a notion dismissed by European Marxists in Mariategui's time. Peruvian Marxists are less concerned with achieving the key precursors of traditional Marxist revolutions, and instead focus on the daily experiences of Peruvians. Revolution, they argue, is the only way to improve the conditions of the Peruvian people.\nPeruvian Marxists also valorize Indigenous societies for their communal organization, which is seen as a precursor to socialism. Effectively, Peruvian Marxists equate the establishment of a socialist state in Peru with a return of an Indigenous state, which is considered more just and representative of Peruvian peoples and interests.\nIn order to achieve their vision, the MRTA declared the necessity of forgoing legal reform in favor of violent revolution. Accordingly, the MRTA aimed to escalate preexisting conflicts and create new ones to demonstrate the feasibility of revolution to a critical mass of Peruvians. Conflict would further deteriorate conditions in Peru, hopefully leading to a transition from a pre-revolutionary state to revolutionary state. The MRTA believed that political organization would be important to a successful revolution, but criticized preexisting leftist groups as naive for believing in a peaceful reform movement. The MRTA believes that \"reformism\" in general has stalled the progress towards global socialist revolution by preventing the rise of class consciousness.\nThe MRTA simultaneously preached Peruvian nationalism while arguing they were part of a larger Latin American effort to remove North American interference on the continent. The prominence of Peru's Indigenous past in the MRTA's rhetoric meant they never aspired to fully merge with a global movement, only that they wished to aid like-minded allies.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe MRTA formed between 1980 and 1982 with merging of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) (PSR-ML) and the militant faction of the Revolutionary Left Movement, \"MIR El Militante\" (MIR-EM). The former gathered several ex-members of the Peruvian armed forces that participated in the leftist government of Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968\u20131975), and the latter represented a subdivision of the Revolutionary Left Movement, a Castroist guerrilla faction which was defeated in 1965.\nThe MRTA attempted to ally with other leftist organizations following the first democratic elections in Peru after a military government period (1968\u20131980). in the Period of 1982\u20131984, the MRTA continued to organize its military and political structures internally.\nThe MRTA maintained an alliance with MIR until 1987.\nOperations.\nThe first action by the MRTA occurred on 31 May 1982, when five of its members, including Victor Polay Campos and Jorge Talledo Feria (members of the Central Committee) robbed a bank in La Victoria, Lima. During the hold up, Talledo was killed by friendly fire.\nOn the midnight of 28 September 1984, members of the MRTA fired on the United States Embassy, causing damage but no casualties. The MRTA members were disguised as police, and fled after receiving returning fire from Peruvian guards. The MRTA claimed responsibility for the attack in a message sent to the United States embassy. The group was also linked to further attacks to the Embassy premises in late 1985, April 1986 (protesting US' Operation Eldorado Canyon) and in February 1990, as well as to a series of attacks to USIS Binational Centers.\nPeru's counterterrorist program diminished the group's ability to carry out guerrilla attacks, and the MRTA suffered from infighting as well as violent clashes with Maoist rival Shining Path, the imprisonment or deaths of senior leaders, and loss of leftist support. The MRTA's attempt to expand in to rural areas put them in conflict with the Shining Path, where they failed to compete with the more radical group. Shining Path's strength in the countryside forced the MRTA to largely remain in their urban and middle-class base.\nOn 6 July 1992, MRTA fighters staged a raid on the town of Jaen, Peru, a jungle town located in the northern department of Cajamarca. Two policemen including, Eladio Garcia Tello, responded to the calls for help. After an intense shootout, the guerrillas were driven out of the town. Eladio Garcia Tello perished, after a bullet to the chest.\nMRTA's last major action resulted in the 1997 Japanese embassy hostage crisis. In December 1996, 14 MRTA members occupied the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima, holding 72 hostages for more than four months. Under orders from then-President Alberto Fujimori, armed forces stormed the residence in April 1997, rescuing all but one of the remaining hostages and killing all 14 MRTA militants. Fujimori was publicly acclaimed for the decisive action, but the affair was later tainted by subsequent revelations that at least three, and perhaps as many as eight, of the MRTistas were summarily executed after they surrendered. The Japanese embassy hostage crisis marked the end of MRTA as any threat to the Peruvian state and effectively dissolved the group.\nIn 2001, several MRTA members remained imprisoned in Bolivia.\nTrials and convictions.\nIn September 2003, four Chilean defendants, including Jaime Castillo Petruzzi, were retried and convicted of membership in the T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and participation in an attack on the Peruvian North American Cultural Institute and a kidnapping-murder in 1993.\nOn 22 March 2006, V\u00edctor Polay, the guerrilla leader of the MRTA, was found guilty by a Peruvian court on nearly 30 crimes committed during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nIn a case that attracted international attention, Lori Berenson, a former MIT student and U.S. socialist activist living in Lima, was arrested on 30 November 1995, by the police and accused of collaborating with the MRTA. She was subsequently sentenced by a military court to life imprisonment (later reduced to 20 years by a civilian court).\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission.\nPeru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission determined that the group was responsible for 1.5% of the deaths investigated. In its final findings published in 2003, the Commission observed:\nUnlike Shining Path, and like other armed Latin American organizations with which it maintained ties, the MRTA claimed responsibility for its actions, its members used uniforms or other identifiers to differentiate themselves from the civilian population, it abstained from attacking the unarmed population and at some points showed signs of being open to peace negotiations. Nevertheless, MRTA also engaged in criminal acts; it resorted to assassinations, such as in the case of General Enrique L\u00f3pez Alb\u00fajar, the taking of hostages and the systematic practice of kidnapping, all crimes that violate not only personal liberty but the international humanitarian law that the MRTA claimed to respect.\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission goes on to note one of the MRTA's goals was to legitimize politically motivated violence in Peru. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission both condemns this justification of violence, and argues it contributed to the ability of other organizations to inflict greater violence then they might have otherwise. Further, the existence of groups like MRTA, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission argues, legitimized the authoritarian, \nmilitaristic, and repressive policies of the government of Alberto Fujimori.\nPeople's Democratic Front.\nThe People's Democratic Front (, FDP) is a far-left political organisation formed by former members of the group, as well as sympathisers. It is headed by Luis Gordon Iglesias (convicted of terrorism in 1991 and sentenced to 20 years), Bernardo Roque (coordinator of \"Revista T\u00fapac Amaru\"), and Gabriel V\u00e1squez. Its members follow Marxism\u2013Leninism, also showing admiration for Che Guevara's ideology and T\u00fapac Amaru's figure.\nThe FDP has claimed responsibility for the actions and figures of the MRTA. On December 17, 2016, the FDP, together with the \"Chilean Guevarist Left\" collective, paid tribute to the militants who died during Operation Chav\u00edn de Hu\u00e1ntar. On April 24, 2017, the FDP paid tribute to N\u00e9stor Cerpa Cartolini. During the 2021 presidential elections, the FDP announced its support for Pedro Castillo's candidacy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was among the first modernists who transformed the practice of harmony in 20th-century classical music, and a central element of his music was its use of motives as a means of coherence. He propounded concepts like developing variation, the emancipation of the dissonance, and the \"unity of musical space\".\nSchoenberg's early works, like \"Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht\" (1899), represented a Brahmsian\u2013Wagnerian synthesis on which he built. Mentoring Anton Webern and Alban Berg, he became the central figure of the Second Viennese School. They consorted with visual artists, published in \"Der Blaue Reiter\", and wrote atonal, expressionist music, attracting fame and stirring debate. In his String Quartet No. 2 (1907\u20131908), \"Erwartung\" (1909), and \"Pierrot lunaire\" (1912), Schoenberg visited extremes of emotion; in self-portraits he emphasized his intense gaze. While working on \"Die Jakobsleiter\" (from 1914) and \"Moses und Aron\" (from 1923), Schoenberg confronted popular antisemitism by returning to Judaism and substantially developed his twelve-tone technique. He systematically interrelated all notes of the chromatic scale in his twelve-tone music, often exploiting combinatorial hexachords and sometimes admitting tonal elements.\nSchoenberg resigned from the Prussian Academy of Arts (1926\u20131933), emigrating as the Nazis took power; they banned his (and some of his students') music, labeling it \"degenerate\". He taught in the US, including at the University of California, Los Angeles (1936\u20131944), where facilities are named in his honor. He explored writing film music (as he had done idiosyncratically in \"Begleitungsmusik zu einer Lichtspielscene\", 1929\u20131930) and wrote more tonal music, completing his Chamber Symphony No. 2 in 1939. With citizenship (1941) and US entry into World War II, he satirized fascist tyrants in \"Ode to Napoleon\" (1942, after Byron), deploying Beethoven's fate motif and the . Post-war Vienna beckoned with honorary citizenship, but Schoenberg was ill as depicted in his String Trio (1946). As the world learned of the Holocaust, he memorialized its victims in \"A Survivor from Warsaw\" (1947). The Israel Conservatory and Academy of Music elected him honorary president (1951).\nHis innovative music was among the most influential and polemicized of 20th-century classical music. At least three generations of composers extended its somewhat formal principles. His aesthetic and music-historical views influenced musicologists Theodor W. Adorno and Carl Dahlhaus. The Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg Center collects his archival legacy.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nArnold Schoenberg was born into a lower middle-class Jewish family in the Leopoldstadt district (in earlier times a Jewish ghetto) of Vienna, at Obere Donaustra\u00dfe 5. His father Samuel, a native of Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny, Hungary, later moved to Pozsony (Pressburg, at that time part of the Kingdom of Hungary, now Bratislava, Slovakia) and then to Vienna, was a shoe-shopkeeper. He was married to Pauline Nachod, a Prague native whose family belong to the Altneuschul synagogue. Arnold was largely self-taught. He took only counterpoint lessons with the composer Alexander Zemlinsky, who was to become his first brother-in-law.\nIn his twenties, Schoenberg earned a living by orchestrating operettas, while composing his own works, such as the string sextet \"Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht\" (\"Transfigured Night\") (1899). He later made an orchestral version of this, which became one of his most popular pieces. Both Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler recognized Schoenberg's significance as a composer; Strauss when he encountered Schoenberg's \"Gurre-Lieder\", and Mahler after hearing several of Schoenberg's early works.\nStrauss turned to a more conservative idiom in his own work after 1909, and at that point dismissed Schoenberg. Mahler adopted him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and continued to support him, even after Schoenberg's style reached a point Mahler could no longer understand. Mahler worried about who would look after him after his death. Schoenberg, who had initially despised and mocked Mahler's music, was converted by the \"thunderbolt\" of Mahler's \"Third Symphony\", which he considered a work of genius. Afterward he \"spoke of Mahler as a saint\".\nIn 1898 Schoenberg converted to Christianity in the Lutheran church. According to MacDonald (2008, 93) this was partly to strengthen his attachment to Western European cultural traditions, and partly as a means of self-defence \"in a time of resurgent anti-Semitism\". In 1933, after long meditation, he returned to Judaism, because he realised that \"his racial and religious heritage was inescapable\", and to take up an unmistakable position on the side opposing Nazism. He would self-identify as a member of the Jewish religion later in life.\n1901\u20131914: experimenting in atonality.\nIn October 1901, Schoenberg married Mathilde Zemlinsky, the sister of the conductor and composer Alexander von Zemlinsky, with whom Schoenberg had been studying since about 1894. Schoenberg and Mathilde had two children, Gertrud (1902\u20131947) and Georg (1906\u20131974). Gertrud would marry Schoenberg's pupil Felix Greissle in 1921.\nDuring the summer of 1908, Schoenberg's wife Mathilde left him for several months for a young Austrian painter, Richard Gerstl (who committed suicide in that November after Mathilde returned to her marriage). This period marked a distinct change in Schoenberg's work. It was during the absence of his wife that he composed \"You lean against a silver-willow\" (), the thirteenth song in the cycle \"Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten\", Op.\u00a015, based on the collection of the same name by the German mystical poet Stefan George. This was the first composition without any reference at all to a key.\nAlso in this year, Schoenberg completed one of his most revolutionary compositions, the String Quartet No.\u00a02. The first two movements, though chromatic in color, use traditional key signatures. The final two movements, again using poetry by George, incorporate a soprano vocal line, breaking with previous string-quartet practice, and daringly weaken the links with traditional tonality. Both movements end on tonic chords, and the work is not fully non-tonal.\nDuring the summer of 1910, Schoenberg wrote his \"Harmonielehre\" (\"Theory of Harmony\", Schoenberg 1922), which remains one of the most influential music-theory books. From about 1911, Schoenberg belonged to a circle of artists and intellectuals who included Lene Schneider-Kainer, Franz Werfel, Herwarth Walden, and Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler.\nIn 1910 he met Edward Clark, an English music journalist then working in Germany. Clark became his sole English student, and in his later capacity as a producer for the BBC he was responsible for introducing many of Schoenberg's works, and Schoenberg himself, to Britain (as well as Webern, Berg and others). Clark assisted Schoenberg to relocate from Vienna to Berlin in 1911.\nAnother of his most important works from this atonal or pantonal period is the highly influential \"Pierrot lunaire\", Op.\u00a021, of 1912, a novel cycle of expressionist songs set to a German translation of poems by the Belgian-French poet Albert Giraud. Utilizing the technique of \"Sprechstimme\", or melodramatically spoken recitation, the work pairs a female vocalist with a small ensemble of five musicians. The ensemble, which is now commonly referred to as the Pierrot ensemble, consists of flute (doubling on piccolo), clarinet (doubling on bass clarinet), violin (doubling on viola), violoncello, speaker, and piano.\nWilhelm Bopp, director of the Vienna Conservatory from 1907, wanted a break from the stale environment personified for him by Robert Fuchs and Hermann Graedener. Having considered many candidates, he offered teaching positions to Schoenberg and Franz Schreker in 1912. Although now living in Berlin, he was not completely cut off from the Vienna Conservatory, having taught a private theory course a year earlier. He seriously considered the offer, but he declined. Writing afterward to Alban Berg, he cited his \"aversion to Vienna\" as the main reason for his decision, while contemplating that it might have been the wrong one financially, but having made it he felt content. A couple of months later he wrote to Schreker suggesting that it might have been a bad idea for him as well to accept the teaching position.\nWorld War I.\nWorld War I brought a crisis in his development. Military service disrupted his life when at the age of 42 he was in the army. He was never able to work uninterrupted or over a period of time, and as a result he left many unfinished works and undeveloped \"beginnings\".\nOn one occasion, a superior officer demanded to know if he was \"this notorious Schoenberg, then\"; Schoenberg replied: \"Beg to report, sir, yes. Nobody wanted to be, someone had to be, so I let it be me\". According to Norman Lebrecht, this is a reference to Schoenberg's apparent \"destiny\" as the \"Emancipator of Dissonance\".\nSchoenberg drew comparisons between Germany's assault on France and his assault on decadent bourgeois artistic values. In August 1914, while denouncing the music of Bizet, Stravinsky, and Ravel, he wrote: \"Now comes the reckoning! Now we will throw these mediocre kitschmongers into slavery, and teach them to venerate the German spirit and to worship the German God\". Alex Ross described this as an \"act of war psychosis\".\nThe deteriorating relation between contemporary composers and the public led him to found the Society for Private Musical Performances ( in German) in Vienna in 1918. He sought to provide a forum in which modern musical compositions could be carefully prepared and rehearsed, and properly performed under conditions protected from the dictates of fashion and pressures of commerce.\nFrom its inception until its dissolution amid Austrian hyperinflation, the Society presented 353 performances to paying members, sometimes weekly. During the first year and a half, Schoenberg did not let any of his own works be performed. Instead, audiences at the Society's concerts heard difficult contemporary compositions by Scriabin, Debussy, Mahler, Webern, Berg, Reger, and other leading figures of early 20th-century music.\nDevelopment of the twelve-tone method.\nLater, Schoenberg was to develop the most influential version of the dodecaphonic (also known as twelve-tone) method of composition, which in French and English was given the alternative name serialism by Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz and Humphrey Searle in 1947. This technique was taken up by many of his students, who constituted the so-called Second Viennese School. They included Anton Webern, Alban Berg, and Hanns Eisler, all of whom were profoundly influenced by Schoenberg. He published a number of books, ranging from his famous \"Harmonielehre\" (\"Theory of Harmony\") to \"Fundamentals of Musical Composition\", many of which are still in print and used by musicians and developing composers.\nSchoenberg viewed his development as a natural progression, and he did not deprecate his earlier works when he ventured into serialism. In 1923 he wrote to the Swiss philanthropist Werner Reinhart:\nFor the present, it matters more to me if people understand my older works ... They are the natural forerunners of my later works, and only those who understand and comprehend these will be able to gain an understanding of the later works that goes beyond a fashionable bare minimum. I do not attach so much importance to being a musical bogey-man as to being a natural continuer of properly-understood good old tradition!\nHis first wife died in October 1923, and in August of the next year Schoenberg married Gertrud Kolisch (1898\u20131967), sister of his pupil, the violinist Rudolf Kolisch. They had three children: Nuria Dorothea (born 1932), Ronald Rudolf (born 1937), and Lawrence Adam (born 1941). Gertrude Kolisch Schoenberg wrote the libretto for Schoenberg's one-act opera \"Von heute auf morgen\" under the pseudonym Max Blonda. At her request Schoenberg's (ultimately unfinished) piece, \"Die Jakobsleiter\" was prepared for performance by Schoenberg's student Winfried Zillig. After her husband's death in 1951 she founded Belmont Music Publishers devoted to the publication of his works. Arnold used the notes G and E\u266d (German: Es, i.e., \"S\") for \"Gertrud Schoenberg\", in the \"Suite\", for septet, Op.\u00a029 (1925). (see musical cryptogram).\nFollowing the death in 1924 of composer Ferruccio Busoni, who had served as Director of a Master Class in Composition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, Schoenberg was appointed to this post the next year, but because of health problems was unable to take up his post until 1926. Among his notable students during this period were the composers Robert Gerhard, Nikos Skalkottas, and Josef Rufer.\nAlong with his twelve-tone works, 1930 marks Schoenberg's return to tonality, with numbers 4 and 6 of the Six Pieces for Male Chorus Op.\u00a035, the other pieces being dodecaphonic.\nNazi regime and emigration to the United States.\nSchoenberg continued in his post until the Nazis seized power in 1933. While on vacation in France, he was warned that returning to Germany would be dangerous. Schoenberg formally reclaimed membership in the Jewish religion at a Paris synagogue, then emigrated to the United States with his family. He subsequently gave brief consideration to moving again, either to England or the Soviet Union.\nHis first teaching position in the United States was at the Malkin Conservatory (Boston University). He moved to Los Angeles, where he taught at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles, both of which later named a music building on their respective campuses Schoenberg Hall. He was appointed visiting professor at UCLA in 1935 on the recommendation of Otto Klemperer, music director and conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra; and the next year was promoted to professor at a salary of $5,100 per year, which enabled him in either May 1936 or 1937 to buy a Spanish Revival house at 116 North Rockingham in Brentwood Park, near the UCLA campus, for $18,000. This address was directly across the street from Shirley Temple's house, and there he befriended fellow composer (and tennis partner) George Gershwin. The Schoenbergs were able to employ domestic help and began holding Sunday afternoon gatherings that were known for excellent coffee and Viennese pastries. Frequent guests included Otto Klemperer (who studied composition privately with Schoenberg beginning in April 1936), Edgard Var\u00e8se, Joseph Achron, Louis Gruenberg, Ernst Toch, and, on occasion, well-known actors such as Harpo Marx and Peter Lorre. Composers Leonard Rosenman and George Tremblay and the Hollywood orchestrator Edward B. Powell studied with Schoenberg at this time.\nAfter his move to the United States, where he arrived on 31 October 1933, the composer used the alternative spelling of his surname \"Schoenberg\", rather than \"Sch\u00f6nberg\", in what he called \"deference to American practice\", though according to one writer he first made the change a year earlier.\nHe lived there the rest of his life, but at first he was not settled. In 1934, he applied for a teacher of harmony and theory position at the New South Wales State Conservatorium in Sydney. Vincent Plush discovered his application in the 1970s. It bore two notes in different handwriting: \"Jewish\" in one and \"Modernist ideas and dangerous tendencies\" in another marked E.B. (Edgar Bainton). Schoenberg also explored the idea of emigrating to New Zealand. His secretary and student Richard Hoffmann, the nephew of Schoenberg's mother-in-law Henriette Kolisch, lived in New Zealand in 1935\u20131947. Schoenberg had since childhood been fascinated with islands and with New Zealand in particular, possibly because of its postage stamps. He abandoned the idea of moving to New Zealand after his health began to decline in 1944.\nDuring this final period, he composed several notable works, including the difficult Violin Concerto, Op.\u00a036 (1934/36), the \"Kol Nidre\", Op.\u00a039, for chorus and orchestra (1938), the \"Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte\", Op.\u00a041 (1942), the haunting Piano Concerto, Op.\u00a042 (1942), and his memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, \"A Survivor from Warsaw\", Op.\u00a046 (1947). He was unable to complete his opera \"Moses und Aron\" (1932/33), which was one of the first works of its genre written completely using dodecaphonic composition. Along with twelve-tone music, Schoenberg also returned to tonality with works during his last period, like the Suite for Strings in G major (1935), the Chamber Symphony No. 2 in E\u266d minor, Op.\u00a038 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939), the Variations on a Recitative in D minor, Op.\u00a040 (1941). During this period his notable students included John Cage and Lou Harrison.\nIn 1941, he became a citizen of the United States. He was the first composer in residence at the Music Academy of the West summer conservatory in Montecito, California.\nSuperstition and death.\nSchoenberg's superstitious nature may have triggered his death. The composer had triskaidekaphobia, and according to friend Katia Mann, he feared he would die during a year that was a multiple of 13. This possibly began in 1908 with the composition of the thirteenth song of the song cycle \"Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten\" Op.\u00a015. He dreaded his sixty-fifth birthday in 1939 so much that a friend asked the composer and astrologer Dane Rudhyar to prepare Schoenberg's horoscope. Rudhyar did this and told Schoenberg that the year was dangerous, but not fatal.\nBut in 1950, on his 76th birthday, an astrologer wrote Schoenberg a note warning him that the year was a critical one: 7 + 6 = 13. This stunned and depressed the composer, for up to that point he had only been wary of multiples of 13 and never considered adding the digits of his age. He died on Friday, 13 July 1951, shortly before midnight. Schoenberg had stayed in bed all day, sick, anxious, and depressed. His wife Gertrud reported in a telegram to her sister-in-law Ottilie the next day that Arnold died at 11:45\u00a0pm, 15 minutes before midnight. In a letter to Ottilie dated 4 August 1951, Gertrud explained, \"About a quarter to twelve I looked at the clock and said to myself: another quarter of an hour and then the worst is over. Then the doctor called me. Arnold's throat rattled twice, his heart gave a powerful beat and that was the end\".\nSchoenberg's ashes were later interred at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna on 6 June 1974.\nMusic.\nSchoenberg's significant compositions in the repertory of modern art music extend over a period of more than 50 years. Traditionally they are divided into three periods though this division is arguably arbitrary as the music in each of these periods is considerably varied. The idea that his twelve-tone period \"represents a stylistically unified body of works is simply not supported by the musical evidence\", and important musical characteristics\u2014especially those related to motivic development\u2014transcend these boundaries completely.\nThe first of these periods, 1894\u20131907, is identified in the legacy of the high-Romantic composers of the late nineteenth century, as well as with expressionist movements in poetry and art. The second, 1908\u20131922, is typified by the abandonment of key centers, a move often described (though not by Schoenberg) as \"free atonality\". The third, from 1923 onward, commences with Schoenberg's invention of dodecaphonic, or \"twelve-tone\" compositional method. Schoenberg's best-known students, Hanns Eisler, Alban Berg, and Anton Webern, followed Schoenberg faithfully through each of these intellectual and aesthetic transitions, though not without considerable experimentation and variety of approach.\nFirst period: Late Romanticism.\nBeginning with songs and string quartets written around the turn of the century, Schoenberg's concerns as a composer positioned him uniquely among his peers, in that his procedures exhibited characteristics of both Brahms and Wagner, who for most contemporary listeners, were considered polar opposites, representing mutually exclusive directions in the legacy of German music. Schoenberg's \"Zwei Ges\u00e4nge\", Op. 1, first performed in 1903, set two contemporary poems to expressive music bordering the limits of the Lied genre. Schoenberg's Six Songs, Op.\u00a03 (1899\u20131903), for example, exhibit a conservative clarity of tonal organization typical of Brahms and Mahler, reflecting an interest in balanced phrases and an undisturbed hierarchy of key relationships. However, the songs also explore unusually bold incidental chromaticism and seem to aspire to a Wagnerian \"representational\" approach to motivic identity.\nThe synthesis of these approaches reaches an apex in his \"Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht\", Op.\u00a04 (1899), a programmatic work for string sextet that develops several distinctive \"leitmotif\"-like themes, each one eclipsing and subordinating the last. The only motivic elements that persist throughout the work are those that are perpetually dissolved, varied, and re-combined, in a technique, identified primarily in Brahms's music, that Schoenberg called \"developing variation\". Schoenberg's procedures in the work are organized in two ways simultaneously; at once suggesting a Wagnerian narrative of motivic ideas, as well as a Brahmsian approach to motivic development and tonal cohesion.\nCiting Berg and Webern on Schoenberg's String Quartet No. 1, Op. 7 (1904\u20131905), Joseph N. Straus emphasized the importance of \"motivic coherence\" in the three's more generally. \"Every smallest turn of phrase, even accompanimental figuration is significant\", Berg asserted, parenthetically praising Schoenberg's \"excess unheard-of since Bach\". Webern marveled at how \"Schoenberg creates an accompaniment figure from a motivic particle\", proclaiming \"everything is thematic! There is ... not a single note ... that does not have a thematic basis.\"\nSecond period: Free atonality.\nThe urgency of musical constructions lacking in tonal centers or traditional dissonance-consonance relationships can be traced as far back as Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op.\u00a09 (1906). This work is remarkable for its tonal development of whole-tone and quartal harmony, and its initiation of dynamic and unusual ensemble relationships, involving dramatic interruption and unpredictable instrumental allegiances. Many of these features would typify the timbre-oriented chamber-music aesthetic of the coming century.\nSchoenberg's music from 1908 onward experiments in a variety of ways with the absence of traditional keys or tonal centers. His first explicitly atonal piece was the second string quartet, Op.\u00a010, with soprano. The last movement of this piece has no key signature, marking Schoenberg's formal divorce from diatonic harmonies. Other important works of the era include his song cycle \"Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten\", Op.\u00a015 (1908\u20131909), his Five Orchestral Pieces, Op.\u00a016 (1909), the influential \"Pierrot lunaire\", Op.\u00a021 (1912), as well as his dramatic \"Erwartung\", Op.\u00a017 (1909). Surveying Schoenberg's Opp.\u00a010,\u00a015\u201316, and\u00a019, Webern argued: \"It creates entirely new expressive values; therefore it also needs new means of expression. Content and form cannot be separated.\"\nAnalysts (most prominently Allen Forte) so emphasized motivic shapes in Schoenberg's (and Berg's and Webern's) \"free atonal\" music that Benjamin Boretz and William Benjamin suggested referring to it as \"motivic\" music. Schoenberg himself described his use of a motivic unit \"varied and developed in manifold ways\" in Four Orchestral Songs, Op. 22 (1913\u20131916), writing that he was \"in the preliminary stages of a procedure ... which allows for a motif to be a constant basis\". Straus considered that the designation \"'motivic' music\" might apply \"in a modified way\" to twelve-tone music more generally.\nThird period: Twelve-tone and tonal works.\nIn the aftermath of World War I, Schoenberg sought an ordering principle that would make his musical texture simpler and clearer. Thus he arrived at his \"method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another\". All twelve pitches of the octave (usually unrealized compositionally) are regarded as equal, and no one note or tonality is given the emphasis it occupied in classical harmony. Schoenberg regarded the twelve-tone system as the equivalent in music of Albert Einstein's discoveries in physics. Schoenberg told Josef Rufer, \"I have made a discovery which will ensure the supremacy of German music for the next hundred years\".\nAmong Schoenberg's twelve-tone works are the \"Variations for Orchestra\", Op.\u00a031 (1928); \"Begleitungsmusik zu einer Lichtspielscene\", Op.\u00a034 (1930); Piano Pieces, Opp.\u00a033a &amp; b (1931), and the Piano Concerto, Op.\u00a042 (1942). Contrary to its reputation for doctrinaire strictness, Schoenberg's technique varied according to the musical demands of each composition. Thus the musical structure of his unfinished opera \"Moses und Aron\" is fundamentally different from that of his Phantasy for Violin and Piano, Op.\u00a047 (1949).\nTen features of Schoenberg's mature twelve-tone practice are generally characteristic, interdependent, and interactive according to Ethan Haimo:\nReception and legacy.\nFirst works.\nAfter some early difficulties, Schoenberg began to win public acceptance with works such as the tone poem \"Pelleas und Melisande\" at a Berlin performance in 1907. At the Vienna premi\u00e8re of the \"Gurre-Lieder\" in 1913, he received an ovation that lasted a quarter of an hour and culminated with Schoenberg's being presented with a laurel crown.\nNonetheless, much of his work was not well received. His Chamber Symphony No. 1 premi\u00e8red unremarkably in 1907. However, when it was played again in the \"Skandalkonzert\" on 31 March 1913, (which also included works by Berg, Webern and Zemlinsky), \"one could hear the shrill sound of door keys among the violent clapping, and in the second gallery the first fight of the evening began.\" Later in the concert, during a performance of the \"Altenberg Lieder\" by Berg, fighting broke out after Schoenberg interrupted the performance to threaten removal by the police of any troublemakers.\nTwelve-tone period.\nAccording to Ethan Haimo, the general understanding of Schoenberg's twelve-tone work has been difficult to achieve because of the \"truly revolutionary nature\" of his new system, misinformation disseminated by some early writers about the system's \"rules\" and \"exceptions\" that bear \"little relation to the most significant features of Schoenberg's music\", the composer's secretiveness, and the widespread unavailability of his sketches and manuscripts until the late 1970s. During his life, Schoenberg was \"subjected to a range of criticism and abuse that is shocking even in hindsight\".\nSchoenberg criticized Igor Stravinsky's new neoclassical trend in the poem \"Vielseitigkeit\" (in which he derogates neoclassicism, and obliquely refers to Stravinsky as \"Der kleine Modernsky\"), which he used as text for the second of his \"Drei Satiren\", Op.\u00a028. The third of the \"Drei Satiren\", \"Der neue Klassizismus\", also takes aim at the neoclassical trend in general.\nSchoenberg's serial technique of composition with twelve notes became one of the most central and polemical issues among American and European musicians during the mid- to late-twentieth century. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing to the present day, composers such as Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono and Milton Babbitt have extended Schoenberg's legacy in increasingly radical directions. The major cities of the United States (e.g., Los Angeles, New York, and Boston) have had historically significant performances of Schoenberg's music, with advocates such as Babbitt in New York and the Franco-American conductor-pianist Jacques-Louis Monod. Schoenberg's students have been influential teachers at major American universities: Leonard Stein at USC, UCLA and CalArts; Richard Hoffmann at Oberlin; Patricia Carpenter at Columbia; and Leon Kirchner and Earl Kim at Harvard. Musicians associated with Schoenberg have had a profound influence on contemporary music performance practice in the US (e.g., Louis Krasner, Eugene Lehner and Rudolf Kolisch at the New England Conservatory of Music; Eduard Steuermann and Felix Galimir at the Juilliard School). In Europe, the work of Hans Keller, Luigi Rognoni, and Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz has had a measurable influence in spreading Schoenberg's musical legacy outside of Germany and Austria. His pupil and assistant Max Deutsch, who later became a professor of music, was also a conductor. who made a recording of three \"master works\" Schoenberg with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, released posthumously in late 2013. This recording includes short lectures by Deutsch on each of the pieces.\nCriticism.\nIn the 1920s, Ernst Krenek criticized a certain unnamed brand of contemporary music (presumably Schoenberg and his disciples) as \"the self-gratification of an individual who sits in his studio and invents rules according to which he then writes down his notes\". Schoenberg took offense at this remark and answered that Krenek \"wishes for only whores as listeners\".\nAllen Shawn has noted that, given Schoenberg's living circumstances, his work is usually \"defended\" rather than listened to, and that it is difficult to experience it \"apart\" from the ideology that surrounds it. Richard Taruskin asserted that Schoenberg committed what he terms a \"poietic fallacy\", the conviction that what matters most (or all that matters) in a work of art is the making of it, the maker's input, and that the listener's pleasure must not be the composer's primary objective. Taruskin also criticizes the ideas of measuring Schoenberg's value as a composer in terms of his influence on other artists, the overrating of technical innovation, and the restriction of criticism to matters of structure and craft while derogating other approaches as vulgarian.\nRelationship with the general public.\nWriting in 1977, Christopher Small observed, \"Many music lovers, even today, find difficulty with Schoenberg's music\". Small wrote his short biography a quarter of a century after the composer's death. According to Nicholas Cook, writing some twenty years after Small, Schoenberg had thought that this lack of comprehension\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;was merely a transient, if unavoidable phase: the history of music, they said, showed that audiences always resisted the unfamiliar, but in time they got used to it and learned to appreciate it ... Schoenberg himself looked forward to a time when, as he said, grocers' boys would whistle serial music in their rounds.\nIf Schoenberg really believed what he said (and it is hard to be quite sure about this), then it represents one of the most poignant moments in the history of music. For serialism did not achieve popularity; the process of familiarization for which he and his contemporaries were waiting never occurred.\nBen Earle (2003) found that Schoenberg, while revered by experts and taught to \"generations of students\" on degree courses, remained unloved by the public. Despite more than forty years of advocacy and the production of \"books devoted to the explanation of this difficult repertory to non-specialist audiences\", it would seem that in particular, \"British attempts to popularize music of this kind\u00a0 ... can now safely be said to have failed\".\nIn his 2018 biography of Schoenberg's near contemporary and similarly pioneering composer, Debussy, Stephen Walsh takes issue with the idea that it is not possible \"for a creative artist to be both radical and popular\". Walsh concludes, \"Schoenberg may be the first 'great' composer in modern history whose music has not entered the repertoire almost a century and a half after his birth\".\nThomas Mann's novel \"Doctor Faustus\".\nAdrian Leverk\u00fchn, the protagonist of Thomas Mann's novel \"Doctor Faustus\" (1947), is a composer whose use of twelve-tone technique parallels the innovations of Arnold Schoenberg. Leverk\u00fchn, who may be based on Nietzsche, sells his soul to the Devil and is rewarded with superhuman talent. Schoenberg was unhappy about this and initiated an exchange of letters with Mann following the novel's publication. Writer Sean O'Brien comments that \"written in the shadow of Hitler, \"Doktor Faustus\" observes the rise of Nazism, but its relationship to political history is oblique\". Thomas Mann was always primarily interested in classical music, which also plays a role in many of his works. He sought and received advice from Theodor W. Adorno on the technical compositional details of Schoenberg's new music, and revised the chapters accordingly.\nDestruction of archive.\nIn 2025, hundreds of Schoenberg's scores were destroyed in the Palisades Fire, one of the January 2025 Southern California wildfires; at the time of the fire they were being stored at the house of his son, Larry.\nPersonality and extramusical interests.\nSchoenberg was a painter of considerable ability, whose works were considered good enough to exhibit alongside those of Franz Marc and Wassily Kandinsky as fellow members of the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter. From about 1908 to 1910, he would execute approximately two-thirds of a total oeuvre comprising about sixty-five oils.\nHe was interested in Hopalong Cassidy films, which Paul Buhle and David Wagner (2002, v\u2013vii) attribute to the films' left-wing screenwriters\u2014a rather odd claim in light of Schoenberg's statement that he was a \"bourgeois\" turned monarchist.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was executed by the Spanish following a months-long pursuit after the fall of the Neo-Inca State.\nHis name is derived from the Quechua words \"thupaq\", meaning \"royal\" or \"shining\" and \"amaru\", which can either mean \"snake\" or refer to the snake-like being from Andean mythology.\nAccession.\nFollowing the Spanish conquest of Peru in the 1530s, a few members of the royal family established the small independent Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, which was located in the relatively inaccessible Upper Amazon to the northeast of Cusco. The founder of this state was Manco Inca Yupanqui (also known as Manco C\u00e1pac II), who had initially allied himself with the Spanish, then led an unsuccessful war against them before establishing himself in Vilcabamba in 1540. After a Spanish attack in 1544 in which Manco Inca Yupanqui was killed, his son Sayri T\u00fapac assumed the title of \"Sapa Inca\" (emperor, literally \"only Inca\"), before accepting Spanish authority in 1558, moving to Cuzco and dying (perhaps by poison) in 1561. He was succeeded in Vilcabamba by his brother Titu Cusi, who himself died in 1571. T\u00fapac Amaru, another brother of the two preceding emperors, then succeeded to the title in Vilcabamba.\nFinal war with and capture by Spanish.\nAt this time, the Spanish were still unaware of the death of the previous \"Sapa Inca\" (Titu Cusi) and had routinely sent two ambassadors to continue ongoing negotiations being held with Titu Cusi. They were both killed on the border by an Inca captain.\nUsing the justification that the Incas had \"broken the inviolate law observed by all nations of the world regarding ambassadors\", the new viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa, decided to attack and conquer Vilcabamba. He declared war on 14 April 1572. The first engagement of the war commenced in the Vilcabamba valley on 1 June. The Inca people attacked first with much spirit despite being only lightly armed. Again and again, they attempted to lift the siege held by the Spanish and their native allies but each time they were forced to retreat. On 24 June the Spanish entered Vilcabamba to find it deserted and the \"Sapa Inca\" gone. The city had been entirely destroyed and the last remnants of the Inca Empire, the Neo-Inca State now officially ceased to exist.\nT\u00fapac Amaru had left the previous day with a party of about 100 and headed west into the lowland forests. The group, which included his generals and family members, had then split up into smaller parties in an attempt to avoid capture.\nThree groups of Spanish soldiers pursued them. One group captured Titu Cusi's son and wife. A second returned with military prisoners along with gold, silver and other precious jewels. The third group returned with T\u00fapac Amaru's two brothers, other relatives and several of his generals. The \"Sapa Inca\" and his commander remained at large.\nFollowing this, a group of forty hand-picked soldiers under Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda \u00d3\u00f1ez de Loyola set out to pursue them. They followed the Masahuay river for 170 miles, where they found an Inca warehouse with quantities of gold and the Inca's tableware. The Spanish captured a group of Chunco and compelled them to tell them what they had seen and if they had seen the \"Sapa Inca\". They reported that he had gone down river, by boat, to a place called Momor\u00ed. The Spaniards then constructed five rafts and pursued them.\nAt Momor\u00ed, they discovered that Tupac Amaru had escaped by land. They followed with the help of the Manar\u00ed, who advised which path the Inca had followed and reported that T\u00fapac was slowed by his wife, who was about to give birth. After a fifty-mile march, they saw a campfire around nine o'clock at night. They found the \"Sapa Inca\" T\u00fapac Amaru and his wife warming themselves. They assured them that no harm would come to them and secured their surrender. T\u00fapac Amaru was arrested.\nThe captives were brought back to the ruins of Vilcabamba and together they were all marched into Cuzco on 21 September. The invaders also brought the mummified remains of Manco C\u00e1pac and Titu Cusi and a gold statue of Punchao, a representation of the Inca's lineage containing the mortal remains of the hearts of the deceased Inca kings. These sacred items were then destroyed.\nExecution.\nThe five captured Inca generals received a summary trial and were sentenced to death by hanging. Several had already died of torture or disease.\nThe trial of the \"Sapa Inca\" himself began a couple of days later. T\u00fapac Amaru was convicted of the murder of the priests in Vilcabamba. T\u00fapac Amaru was sentenced to be beheaded. It was reported in various sources in 1598 that numerous Catholic clerics, convinced of T\u00fapac Amaru's innocence, pleaded to no avail, on their knees, that the Inca be sent to Spain for a trial instead of being executed.\nMany have argued that Viceroy Toledo, in executing a head of state recognized by the Spanish as an independent king, exceeded his authority and committed a crime within the political ideas of his own time. Other claims have been made to the contrary \u2013 that T\u00fapac Amaru was in rebellion (his predecessors having allegedly accepted Spanish authority), that Toledo had tried peaceful means to settle differences, that three of his ambassadors to the Inca were murdered and that T\u00fapac Amaru subsequently raised an army to resist the colonial army. The King of Spain, Philip II, disapproved of the execution.\nAn eyewitness report from the day recalls him riding a mule with hands tied behind his back and a rope around his neck. Other witnesses reported there were great crowds and the \"Sapa Inca\" was surrounded by hundreds of guards with lances. In front of the Cathedral of Santo Domingo in the central square of Cuzco a black-draped scaffold had been erected. Reportedly 10,000 to 15,000 witnesses were present.\nT\u00fapac Amaru mounted the scaffold accompanied by the Bishop of Cuzco. As he did, it was reported by the same witnesses that a \"multitude of Indians, who completely filled the square, saw that lamentable spectacle [and knew] that their lord and Inca was to die, they deafened the skies, making them reverberate with their cries and wailing.\"\nAs reported by eyewitnesses Baltasar de Ocampa and Friar Gabriel de Oviedo, Prior of the Dominicans at Cuzco, the \"Sapa Inca\" raised his hand to silence the crowds and his last words were: \"Ccollanan Pachacamac ricuy auccacunac yawarniy hichascancuta.\" (\"Pacha Kamaq, witness how my enemies shed my blood.\")\nDescendants.\nNearly forty years after the conquest of Peru began with the execution of Atahualpa, the conquest ended with the execution of his nephew. The Spanish Viceroy rounded up the royal descendants. Several dozen, including T\u00fapac Amaru's three-year-old son, were banished to Mexico, Chile, Panama and elsewhere. Some of them were allowed to return home.\nT\u00fapac Amaru's memory lived on and would become personified in an important late eighteenth century insurgency that was rooted in aspirations toward a revival of Inca status vis-a-vis the Spanish administration. In 1780, Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Condorcanqui (T\u00fapac Amaru II), who claimed to be a direct descendant of T\u00fapac Amaru, led an indigenous uprising against continued Spanish presence in Peru alongside his wife Micaela Bastidas. Condorcanqui's rebellion emerged in response to new Bourbon Reforms implemented by the Spanish crown, which included incremental increases in levels of taxation upon indigenous populations \u2013 such as the alcabala or sales tax. T\u00fapac Amaru II's rebellion was sparked when he (Condorcanqui) captured and killed the Spanish corregidor Antonio Arriaga in November 1780.\nLegacy.\nHistorian El Inca Garcilaso De La Vega claimed that King Philip II disapproved of the public execution of T\u00fapac Amaru. T\u00fapac Amaru's death in 1572 has generated great interest centuries after. \nRelatively little is known about T\u00fapac Amaru, but this has not prevented his death from becoming a symbol of power to those in the region. Public figures such as Andean rebel leader Jose Gabriel Condorcanqui resonated with T\u00fapac Amaru ideology, so much so that he changed his name to Tupac Amaru II. Despite T\u00fapac Amaru's short life and tragic death his legacy precedes him especially among the Peruvian community.\nPrimary school number 239 in Warsaw (Mir\u00f3w), had been named in honor of T\u00fapac Amaru, but it closed in 2001. Rapper Tupac Amaru Shakur was named after T\u00fapac Amaru II.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is usually designed to protect a person against sun or rain. Initially they were used in warmer countries for shade from the sun. In modern times they evolved to be used also for protection from rains. The term \"umbrella\" is etymologically to be used when protecting from the sun but, is commonly also used when protecting from rains. Some countries specifically use the words parasol and parapluie to differentiate based on their use. \nA modern hand-held umbrella or parasol may have a black exterior canopy and a silver inner coating, both for better protection from the sun and ultraviolet rays. It may be water-resistant. There are also combinations of parasol and parapluie that are called en-tout-cas (French for \"in any case\").\nIn general, umbrellas are small, handheld, personal use items. There are two types of umbrellas: completely collapsible umbrellas, which can be folded up into a small enough bag because of the supporting metal pole's ability to retract, and non-collapsible umbrellas, which only have the canopy that can be folded up. Manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas, which open with a button press, can also be distinguished from one another.\nHand-held umbrellas have a type of handle which can be made from wood, a plastic cylinder or a bent \"crook\" handle (like the handle of a cane). Umbrellas are available in a range of price and quality points, ranging from inexpensive, modest quality models sold at discount stores to expensive, finely made, designer-labeled models. Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with patio tables or other outdoor furniture, or as points of shade on a sunny beach.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"umbrella\" evolved from the Latin \"umbra\", meaning 'shadow' or 'shade from light' as it provided a shade from the sun. The Oxford English Dictionary records the first recorded usage in this sense in 1611.\nThe word \"parasol\" is a combination of the Latin , and , meaning 'sun'. (French) similarly consists of combined with , which means 'rain' (which in turn derives from , the Latin word for rain); the usage of this word was prevalent in the nineteenth century. (French) consists of combined with , which means 'snow' (which in turn derives from , the Latin word for snow). Hence, a parasol shields from sunlight, a parapluie shields from rain, and a paraneige shields from snow.\nIn Britain, umbrellas were sometimes referred to as \"gamps\" after the character Mrs. Gamp in Charles Dickens' novel \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" as the character was well known for carrying an umbrella, although this usage is now dated or obsolete.\nIn India the word \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930 (chhatra) has been used since ancient times. It represents, \"that which gives \u091b\u093e\u092f\u093e (chhaya)\", meaning shade or shadow from the Sun.\n\"Brolly\" is a slang word for \"umbrella\", used often in Australia, Ireland, Kenya, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.\n\"Bumbershoot\" is a rare and fanciful Americanism from the late 19th century.\nAn umbrella may also be called a sunshade, rainshade, snowshade, or beach umbrella (\"US English\").\nHistory.\nAfrica.\nAncient Egypt.\nThe earliest known umbrellas in Ancient Egyptian art date back to the Fifth Dynasty, around 2450 BC. The umbrella is found in various shapes. Typically it is depicted as a flabellum, a fan of palm-leaves or coloured feathers fixed on a long handle, resembling those now carried behind the Pope in processions. Gardiner Wilkinson, in his work on Egypt, has an engraving of an Ethiopian princess travelling through Upper Egypt in a chariot; a kind of umbrella fastened to a stout pole rises in the centre, bearing a close affinity to what are now termed chaise umbrellas. According to Wilkinson's account, the umbrella was generally used throughout Egypt, partly as a mark of distinction, but more on account of its useful than its ornamental qualities. In some paintings on a temple wall, a parasol is held over the figure of a god carried in procession.\nAshanti Empire.\nThe exact date when the Ashanti began using umbrellas is uncertain. However, in the 1800s, the Amanhene (senior chiefs) were using large multicolored umbrellas. Umbrellas were used during festivals as streets of Kumasi were paraded with them. Like the Asantehene's umbrella bearer, the others also spin their umbrellas in tune with the music produced by drummers while accompanying their \"Ohene\". Umbrellas were also used to provide coolness as well as highlight the importance of the various leaders.\nAmericas.\nMesoamerica.\nThe At district of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan was reported to have used an umbrella made from feathers and gold as its \"pantli\", an identifying marker that is the equivalent of a modern flag. The \"pantli\" was carried by the army general.\nUnited States.\nBeehler Umbrella Factory est. 1828 was the first umbrella manufacturing company in the United States. Francis Beehler was a woodcarver in his home country of Germany. After he immigrated to Baltimore, Maryland, he noticed a lack of umbrellas. Americans generally scorned the devices for their \"ridiculous effeminacy\". Nevertheless he used his talents in making wooden poles and whale bone ribbed umbrellas to create a new market (steel rib designs would not appear until after 1852). Beehler's success attracted competitors. Baltimore was long recognized as the umbrella capital of the country; at the industry's peak in 1920 there were seven umbrella companies in the city producing millions of umbrellas annually.\nAsia.\nAncient Near East.\nThe oldest extant example of an umbrella appears in the archaeological record around 2310 BC, in a victory stele of Sargon of Akkad. In later sculptures at Nineveh, the umbrella appears frequently. Austen Henry Layard gives a picture of a bas-relief representing a king in his chariot, with an attendant holding an umbrella over his head, dating from c. 710 BC. It has a curtain hanging down behind, but is otherwise exactly like those in use today. It is reserved exclusively for the monarch (who was bald), and is never carried over any other person.\nIn Persia, the umbrella is repeatedly found in the carved work of Persepolis, and Sir John Malcolm has an article on the subject in his 1815 \"History of Persia.\" In some sculptures, the figure of a king appears attended by a servant, who carries over his head an umbrella, complete with stretchers and runner. In other sculptures on the rock at Taghe-Bostan, supposed to be not less than twelve centuries old, a deer-hunt is represented, at which a king looks on, seated on a horse, and having an umbrella borne over his head by an attendant.\nChina.\nThe creation of the umbrella is attributed to the wife of Lu Ban, who invented it during the Warring State Period.147 Some investigators have supposed that its invention was first created by tying large leaves to bough-like ribs (the branching out parts of an umbrella). Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent, which remains in an unaltered form to the present day. However, the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air, hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high-ranking (though not necessarily royalty) in China. The use of umbrella as a social marker indicating and classifying the identities and social class of its users started by the post-Wei period and continued up to the Ming dynasty.148 On at least one occasion, twenty-four umbrellas were carried before the emperor when he went out hunting. The umbrella served in this case as a defence against rain rather than sun. The Chinese and Japanese traditional parasol, often used near temples, remains similar to the original ancient Chinese design.\nThe ancient book of Chinese ceremonies, called \"Zhou Li\" (\"The Rites of Zhou\"), dating some 2,400 years ago, directs that a dais should be placed upon the imperial cars. The figure of this dais contained in \"Zhou Li\", and the description of it given in the explanatory commentary of Lin-hi-ye, both identify it with an umbrella. The latter describes the dais to be composed of 28 arcs, which are equivalent to the ribs of the modern instrument, and the staff supporting the covering to consist of two parts, the upper being a rod 3/18 of a Chinese foot in circumference, and the lower a tube 6/10 in circumference, into which the upper half is capable of sliding and closing.\nThe \"Book of Han\" contains a reference to a collapsible umbrella, mentioning its usage in the year 21 AD when Wang Mang (r. 9\u201323) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula. The Chinese collapsible umbrella may predate Wang's tomb, however. Zhou dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts\u2014which could have been used for parasols and umbrellas\u2014were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.\nA late Song dynasty Chinese divination book, \"Book of Physiognomical, Astrological and Ornithomantic Divination according to the Three Schools\" () by Yuan Tianwang (), that was printed in about 1270 AD features a picture of a collapsible umbrella that is exactly like the modern umbrella of today's China.\nThe oil-paper umbrella also originated in China and was spread among the common people after the Eastern Han dynasty.148 It started to be introduced in other countries in the Tang dynasty148 and eventually spread across several East, South and Southeast Asian countries such as Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, where it has been further developed with different characteristics.\nAncient India.\nThe Sanskrit epic Mahabharata relates the following legend: Jamadagni was a skilled bow shooter, and his devoted wife Renuka would always recover each of his arrows immediately. One time however, it took her a whole day to fetch the arrow, and she later blamed the heat of the sun for the delay. The angry Jamadagni shot an arrow at the sun. The sun begged for mercy and offered Renuka a \"chatra\" (umbrella).\nJean Baptiste Tavernier, in his 17th century book \"Voyage to the East\", says that on each side of the Mogul's throne were two umbrellas, and also describes the hall of the King of Ava was decorated with an umbrella. The chh\u00e1ta of the Indian and Burmese princes is large and heavy, and requires a special attendant, who has a regular position in the royal household. In Ava it seems to have been part of the king's title, that he was \"King of the white elephant, and Lord of the twenty-four umbrellas.\"\nSoutheast Asia.\nSimon de la Loub\u00e8re, who was Envoy Extraordinary from the French King to the King of Siam in 1687 and 1688, wrote an account entitled a \"New Historical Relation of the Kingdom of Siam\", which was translated in 1693 into English. According to his account, the use of the umbrella was granted to only some of the subjects by the king. An umbrella with several circles, as if two or three umbrellas were fastened on the same stick, was permitted to the king alone; the nobles carried a single umbrella with painted cloths hanging from it. The Talapoins (who seem to have been a sort of Siamese monks) had umbrellas made of a palm-leaf cut and folded, so that the stem formed a handle.\nIn 1855 the King of Burma directed a letter to the Marquis of Dalhousie in which he styles himself \"His great, glorious, and most excellent Majesty, who reigns over the kingdoms of Thunaparanta, Tampadipa, and all the great umbrella-wearing chiefs of the Eastern countries\".\nThe Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella is one of the royal regalia of Thailand.\nEurope.\nThe Bronze Age Dupljaja chariot, a ceramic sculpture found in Serbia dating from c. 1300 BC (attributed to the Dubovac culture), depicts a male figure, interpreted as a solar deity, standing in a three-wheeled chariot with an attached umbrella held above him.\nAncient Greece.\nUmbrellas are first attested on pottery shards from the late Mycenaean period (c. 1320\u20131190 BC). Ancient umbrellas could be opened and shut, but rigid examples may have also existed. The earliest archaeological evidence for a collapsible umbrella was unearthed in Samos in a context from about 700 BC and follows closely the shape of a slightly older Phrygian specimen excavated at Gordion. The sliding mechanism of the two pieces is remarkably similar to those in use today.\nIn Classical Greece, the umbrella (\"skiadeion\", \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), was an indispensable adjunct to a lady of fashion in the late 5th century BC. Aristophanes mentions it among the common articles of female use; they could apparently open and close. Pausanias describes a tomb near Triteia in Achaia decorated with a 4th-century BC painting ascribed to Nikias; it depicted the figure of a woman, \"and by her stood a female slave, bearing a parasol\". For a man to carry one was considered a mark of effeminacy. In Aristophanes' \"Birds\", Prometheus uses one as a comical disguise.\nCultural changes among the Aristoi of Greece eventually led to a brief period, between 505 and 470 BC, when men used parasols. Vase iconography bears witness to a transition from men carrying swords, then spears, then staffs, then parasols, to eventually nothing. The parasol, at that time of its fashion, displayed the luxury of the user's lifestyle. During the period of their usage, Greek style was inspired by the Persian and Lydian nobility's way of dressing: loose robes, long decorated hair, gold, jewellery, and perfume.\nIt also had religious significance. In the Scirophoria, the feast of Athene Sciras, a white parasol was borne by the priestesses of the goddess from the Acropolis to the Phalerus. In the feasts of Dionysos, the umbrella was used, and in an old bas-relief, the same god is represented as descending \"ad inferos\" (towards the underworld) with a small umbrella in his hand. In the Panathenaea, the daughters of the Metics, or foreign residents, carried parasols over the heads of Athenian women as a mark of inferiority.\nDuring the Panathenaea, daughters of Metics carried the parasols of the Athenian maidens; this service was called \"sciadephoria\" (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b7\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1).\nAncient Rome.\nFrom Greece it is probable that the use of the umbrella passed to Rome, where it seems to have been usually used by women, while it was the custom even for effeminate men to defend themselves from the heat by means of the \"Umbraculum\", formed of skin or leather, and capable of being lowered at will. There are frequent references to the umbrella in the Roman Classics, and it appears that it was, not unlikely, a post of honour among maid-servants to bear it over their mistresses. Allusions to it are tolerably frequent in the poets. (Ovid Fast. lib. ii., 1. 31 I.; Martial, lib. xi., Ch. 73.; lib. xiv, Ch. 28, 130; Ovid Ars. Am., ii., 209). From such mentions the umbrella seems to have been employed as a defense from sun, but references to its use as a protection against rain, while rare, also exist (Juvenal, ix., 50.).\nAccording to Gorius, the umbrella came to Rome from the Etruscans who came to Rome for protection, and certainly it appears not infrequently on Etruscan vases and pottery, as also on later gems and rubies. One gem, figured by Pacudius, shows an umbrella with a bent handle, sloping backwards. Strabo describes a sort of screen or umbrella worn by Spanish women, but this is not like a modern umbrella.\nMiddle Ages.\nBy the fall of the Roman Empire, in the 5th and 6th centuries, the umbrella and parasol were largely forgotten in Europe, for the next few centuries. Beginning in the 8th century, there are numerous contemporary depictions and descriptions of umbrellas and parasols during the remainder of the Middle Ages, predominantly used in the religious ceremonies of the church. By the 8th century, the umbrella and parasol was firmly established in the church, seen as honorific and symbolic. The earliest visual record is an \"8th century image of Bishop John of Pavia, showing him followed by a servant carrying an umbrella.\" The earliest known written evidence of the parasol is also from the 8th century, when Pope Paul I (757-767) bestowed a jeweled parasol to Pepin the Short as part of a peace settlement.\n16th century.\nA 1530 depiction is in Girolamo dai Libri's painting (\"Madonna of the Umbrella\"), in which the Virgin Mary is sheltered by a cherub carrying a large, red umbrella (see image). Umbrellas were regarded as marks of distinction for the pope and clergy.\n17th century.\nThomas Wright, in his \"Domestic Manners of the English\", gives a drawing from the Harleian MS., No. 604, which represents an Anglo-Saxon gentleman walking out attended by his servant, the servant carrying an umbrella with a handle that slopes backwards, so as to bring the umbrella over the head of the person in front. It probably could not be closed, but otherwise it looks like an ordinary umbrella, and the ribs are represented distinctly.\nThe use of the parasol and parapluie in France and England was adopted, probably from China, about the middle of the seventeenth century. At that period, pictorial representations of it are frequently found, some of which exhibit the peculiar broad and deep canopy belonging to the large parasol of the Chinese Government officials, borne by native attendants.\nJohn Evelyn, in his \"Diary\" for 22 June 1664, mentions a collection of rarities shown to him by \"Thompson\", a Roman Catholic priest, sent by the Jesuits of Japan and China to France. Among the curiosities were \"fans like those our ladies use, but much larger, and with long handles, strangely carved and filled with Chinese characters\", which is evidently a description of the parasol.\nIn Thomas Coryat's \"Crudities\", published in 1611, about a century and a half prior to the general introduction of the umbrella into England, is a reference to a custom of riders in Italy using umbrellas:\nAnd many of them doe carry other fine things of a far greater price, that will cost at the least a duckat, which they commonly call in the Italian tongue umbrellas, that is, things which minister shadowve to them for shelter against the scorching heate of the sunne. These are made of leather, something answerable to the forme of a little cannopy, &amp; hooped in the inside with divers little wooden hoopes that extend the umbrella in a pretty large compasse. They are used especially by horsemen, who carry them in their hands when they ride, fastening the end of the handle upon one of their thighs, and they impart so large a shadow unto them, that it keepeth the heate of the sunne from the upper parts of their bodies.\nIn John Florio's \"A WORLD of Words\" (1598), the Italian word Ombrella is translated\na fan, a canopie. also a testern or cloth of state for a prince. also a kind of round fan or shadowing that they vse to ride with in sommer in Italy, a little shade. Also a bonegrace for a woman. Also the husk or cod of any seede or corne. also a broad spreding bunch, as of fenell, nill, or elder bloomes.\nIn Randle Cotgrave's \"Dictionary of the French and English Tongues\" (1614), the French Ombrelle is translated\nAn umbrello; a (fashion of) round and broad fanne, wherewith the Indians (and from them our great ones) preserve themselves from the heat of a scorching sunne; and hence any little shadow, fanne, or thing, wherewith women hide their faces from the sunne.\nIn Fynes Moryson's \"Itinerary\" (1617) is a similar allusion to the habit of carrying umbrellas in hot countries \"to auoide the beames of the Sunne\". Their employment, says the author, is dangerous, \"because they gather the heate into a pyramidall point, and thence cast it down perpendicularly upon the head, except they know how to carry them for auoyding that danger\".\nDuring Streynsham Master's 1676 visit to the East India Company's factory in Masulipatnam he noted that only the governor of the town and the next three officials in seniority were allowed to have \"a roundell [i.e. umbrella] carried over them.\"\nIn France, the rain umbrella (\"parapluie\") began to appear in the 1660s, when the fabric of umbrellas carried for protection against the sun was coated with wax. The inventory of the French royal court in 1763 mentioned \"eleven parasols of taffeta in different colours\" as well as \"three parasols of waxed \"toile\", decorated around the edges with lace of gold and silver\". They were rare, and the word \"parapluie\" (\"against the rain\") did not enter the dictionary of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise until 1718.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nKersey's Dictionary (1708) describes an umbrella as a \"screen commonly used by women to keep off rain\".\nThe first lightweight folding umbrella in Europe was introduced in 1710 by a Paris merchant named Jean Marius, whose shop was located near the barrier of Saint-Honor\u00e9. It could be opened and closed in the same way as modern umbrellas and weighed less than one kilogram. Marius received from the King the exclusive right to produce folding umbrellas for five years. A model was purchased by the Princess Palatine in 1712, and she enthused about it to her aristocratic friends, making it an essential fashion item for Parisiennes. In 1759, a French scientist named Navarre presented a new design to the French Academy of Sciences for an umbrella combined with a cane. Pressing a small button on the side of the cane opened the umbrella.\nTheir use became widespread in Paris. In 1768, a Paris magazine reported: \"The common usage for quite some time now is not to go out without an umbrella, and to have the inconvenience of carrying it under your arm for six months in order to use it perhaps six times. Those who do not want to be mistaken for vulgar people much prefer to take the risk of being soaked, rather than to be regarded as someone who goes on foot; an umbrella is a sure sign of someone who doesn't have his own carriage.\" \nIn 1769, the Maison Antoine, a store at the Magasin d'Italie on rue Saint-Denis, was the first to offer umbrellas for rent to those caught in downpours, and it became a common practice. The Lieutenant General of Police of Paris issued regulations for the rental umbrellas; they were made of oiled green silk, and carried a number so they could be found and reclaimed if someone walked off with one.\nBy 1808 there were seven shops making and selling umbrellas in Paris; one shop, Sagnier on rue des Vielles-Haudriettes, received the first patent given for an invention in France for a new model of umbrella. By 1813 there were 42 shops; by 1848 there were three hundred seventy-seven small shops making umbrellas in Paris, employing 1400 workers. One of the well-known makers was Boutique B\u00e9taille, which was located at rue Royale 20 from 1880 to 1939. Another was Revel, based in Lyon. By the end of the century, however, cheaper manufacturers in the Auvergne replaced Paris as the centre of umbrella manufacturing, and the town of Aurillac became the umbrella capital of France. The town still produces about half the umbrellas made in France; the umbrella factories there employ about one hundred workers.\nIn Daniel Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe\", Crusoe constructs his own umbrella in imitation of those that he had seen used in Brazil, covered with skins \"so that it cast off the rains like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest\". From this description the original heavy umbrella came to be called \"Robinson\" for many years in England.\nCaptain James Cook, in one of his voyages in the late 18th century, reported seeing some of the natives of the South Pacific Islands with umbrellas made of palm leaves. In the highlands of Mindanao in the Philippines, the large fronds of \"Dipteris conjugata\" are used as an umbrella.\nThe use of the umbrella or parasol (though not unknown) was uncommon in England during the earlier half of the eighteenth century, as is evident from the comment made by General (then Lieut.-Colonel) James Wolfe, when writing from Paris in 1752; he speaks of the use of umbrellas for protection from the sun and rain and wonders why a similar practice did not occur in England. About the same time, umbrellas came into general use as people found their value and got over the shyness natural to its introduction. Jonas Hanway, the founder of the Magdalen Hospital, has the credit of being the first man who ventured to dare public reproach and ridicule by carrying one habitually in London. As he died in 1786, and he is said to have carried an umbrella for thirty years, the date of its first use by him may be set down at about 1750. John Macdonald relates that in 1770, he used to be addressed as, \"Frenchman, Frenchman! why don't you call a coach?\" whenever he went out with his umbrella. By 1788 however they seem to have been accepted: a London newspaper advertises the sale of \"improved and pocket Umbrellas, on steel frames, with every other kind of common Umbrella.\"\nSince then, the umbrella has come into general use, in consequence of numerous improvements. In China people learned how to waterproof their paper umbrellas with wax and lacquer. The transition to the present portable form is due, partly, to the substitution of silk and gingham for the heavy and troublesome oiled silk, which admitted of the ribs and frames being made much lighter, and also to many ingenious mechanical improvements in the framework. Victorian era umbrellas had frames of wood or baleen, but these devices were expensive and hard to fold when wet. Samuel Fox invented the steel-ribbed umbrella in 1852; however, the \"Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique\" mentions metal ribs at the end of the eighteenth century, and they were also on sale in London during the 1780s. Modern designs usually employ a telescoping steel trunk; new materials such as cotton, plastic film and nylon often replace the original silk.\nModern use.\nNational Umbrella Day is held on 10 February each year around the world.\nThe pocket (foldable) umbrella was invented in Urai\u00fajfalu (Hungary) by the Balogh brothers, whose patent request was admitted in 1923 by the Royal Notary Public of Szombathely. Later on their patent was also approved in Austria, Germany, Belgium, France, Poland, Great Britain and the United States.\nIn 1928, Hans Haupt's pocket umbrellas appeared. In Vienna in 1928, Slawa Horowitz, a student studying sculpture at the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste Wien (Academy of Fine Arts), developed a prototype for an improved compact foldable umbrella for which she received a patent on 19 September 1929. The umbrella was called \"Flirt\" and manufactured by the Austrian company \"Br\u00fcder W\u00fcster\" and their German associates \"Kortenbach &amp; Rauh\". In Germany, the small foldable umbrellas were produced by the company \"Knirps\", which became a synonym in the German language for small foldable umbrellas in general.\nIn 1969, Bradford E Phillips, the owner of Totes Incorporated of Loveland, Ohio, obtained a patent for his \"working folding umbrella\".\nUmbrellas have also been fashioned into hats as early as 1880 and at least as recently as 1987.\nGolf umbrellas, one of the largest sizes in common use, are typically around across but can range anywhere from .\nTransparent umbrellas, often made with plastic or composite materials, were invented in 1958 by Mitsuo Sudou. The transparent umbrellas were popularized as fashion items during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The production had since been relocated to China and other Asian countries and has become ubiquitous on Japanese streets due to its affordability, aesthetics, and ease of access.\nUmbrellas are now a consumer product with a large global market. As of 2008, most umbrellas worldwide are made in China, mostly in the Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. The city of Shangyu alone had more than a thousand umbrella factories. In the US alone, about 33 million umbrellas, worth $348 million, are sold each year.\nUmbrellas continue to be actively developed. In the US, so many umbrella-related patents are being filed that the U.S. Patent Office employs four full-time examiners to assess them. As of 2008, the office registered 3000 active patents on umbrella-related inventions. Nonetheless, Totes, the largest American umbrella producer, has stopped accepting unsolicited proposals. Its director of umbrella development was reported as saying that while umbrellas are so ordinary that everyone thinks about them, \"it's difficult to come up with an umbrella idea that hasn\u2019t already been done.\"\nWhile the predominant canopy shape of an umbrella is round, canopy shapes have been streamlined to improve aerodynamic response to wind. Examples include the stealth-shaped canopy of Rizotti (1996), scoop-shaped canopy of Lisciandro (2004), and teardrop-shaped canopies of Hollinger (2004).\nIn 2005 Gerwin Hoogendoorn, a Dutch industrial design student of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, invented an aerodynamically streamlined storm umbrella (similar in shape to a stealth aircraft) which can withstand wind force 10 (winds of up to 100\u00a0km/h or 70 mph) and will not turn inside-out like a normal umbrella as well as being equipped with so-called \"eye savers\" which protect others from being accidentally wounded by the tips. Hoogendoorn's storm umbrella was nominated for and won several design awards, and was featured on Good Morning America. The umbrella is sold in Europe as the Senz umbrella and is sold under license by Totes in the United States.\nAlan Kaufman's \"Nubrella\" and Greg Brebner's \"Blunt\" are other contemporary designs.\nOther uses.\nThe umbrella is used in weather forecasting as an icon for rain. Two variations, a plain umbrella (\u2602, U+2602) and an umbrella with raindrops overhead (\u2614, U+2614), are encoded in the Miscellaneous Symbols block of Unicode.\nOpen umbrellas were used by critics of Neville Chamberlain. This protest tactic was then adopted by conservative Americans in the 1950s and 60s who perceived certain politicians to be \"appeasing the enemies of the United States\".\nIn religious ceremony.\nAs a canopy of state, umbrellas were generally used in southern and eastern Europe, and then passed from the imperial court into church ceremony. They are found in the ceremonies of the Byzantine Rite, were borne over the Host in procession, and form part of the Pontifical regalia.\nCatholic Church.\nAn umbrella, the \"ombrellino\" (Italian) or \"umbraculum\" (Latin) is an historic piece of the papal regalia. Although the popes no longer use it personally, it is displayed on the coat of arms of a \"sede vacante\" (the papal arms used between the death of a pope and the election of his successor). This umbraculum is normally made of alternating red and gold fabric, and is usually displayed in a partially unfolded manner. The popes have traditionally bestowed the use of the umbraculum as a mark of honor upon specific persons and places. The use of an umbraculum is one of the honorary symbols of a basilica and may be used in the basilica's coat of arms and carried in processions by the basilica's canons.\nA large umbrella is displayed in each of the Basilicas of Rome, and a cardinal bishop who receives his title from one of those churches has the privilege of having an umbrella carried over his head in solemn processions. It is possible that the galero (wide-brimmed cardinal's hat) may derive from this umbrella. Beatiano, an Italian herald, says that \"a vermilion umbrella in a field argent symbolizes dominion\".\nRoman Catholic liturgy also uses an umbrella, known as the \"umbraculum\" or \"ombrellino\". It is held over the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist and its carrier by a server in short processions taking place indoors, or until the priest is met at the sanctuary entrance by the bearers of the processional canopy or \"baldacchino\". It is regularly white or golden (the colours reserved for the Holy Sacrament) and made of silk.\nOriental Orthodox Churches.\nIn several Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, umbrellas are used liturgically to show honor to a person (such as a bishop) or a holy object. In the ceremonies of Timkat (Epiphany), priests will carry a model of the Tablets of Stone, called a Tabot, on their heads in procession to a body of water, which will then be blessed. Brightly colored embroidered and fringed liturgical parasols are carried above the Tabota during this procession. Such processions also take place on other major feast days.\nIn Buddhism.\nA decorated parasol is ushered over relics and statues of Gautama Buddha, Buddhist scriptures, and Bhikkhus, as a sign of respect.\nIn photography.\nUmbrellas with a reflective inside are used by photographers as a diffusion device when employing artificial lighting, and as a glare shield and shade, most often in portrait situations. Some umbrellas are shoot-through umbrellas, meaning the light goes through the umbrella and is diffused, rather than reflecting off the inside of the umbrella.\nAs a weapon of attack.\nIn 1835, the Baron Charles Random de Berenger instructed readers of his book \"How to Protect Life and Property\" in several methods of using an umbrella as an improvised weapon against highwaymen.\nIn 1897, journalist J. F. Sullivan proposed the umbrella as a misunderstood weapon in a tongue-in-cheek article for the \"Ludgate Monthly\".\nBetween 1899 and 1902, both umbrellas and walking sticks as self defence weapons were incorporated into the repertoire of Bartitsu.\nIn January 1902, an article in \"The Daily Mirror\" instructed women on how they could defend themselves from ruffians with an umbrella or parasol.\nIn March 2011, media outlets revealed that French president Nicolas Sarkozy had started using a \u00a310,000 armor-plated umbrella to protect him from attackers. \"Para Pactum\" is a Kevlar-coated device made by The Real Cherbourg. It will be carried by a member of Sarkozy's security team.\nDuring the 2014 Hong Kong protests, sometimes referred to as the \"Umbrella Revolution\", protesters used umbrellas as shields against the pepper spray and tear gas used by riot police.\nIn architecture.\nIn the 1950s, Frei Otto transformed the universally used individual umbrella into an item of lightweight architecture. He developed a new umbrella form, based on the minimum surface principle. The tension loaded membrane of the funnel-shaped umbrella is now stretched under the compression-loaded bars. This construction type made it technically and structurally possible to build very large convertible umbrellas. The first umbrellas of this kind (Federal Garden Exhibition, Kassel, 1955) were fixed, Frei Otto constructed the first convertible large umbrellas for the Federal Garden Exhibition in Cologne 1971. In 1978 he built a group of ten convertible umbrellas for British rock group Pink Floyd's American tour. The great beauty of these lightweight structures inspired many subsequent projects built all over the world. The largest convertible umbrellas built until now were designed by Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his team at SL-Rasch to provide shelter from sun and rain for the great mosques in Saudi Arabia.\nLater works by the architect Le Corbusier such as Centre Le Corbusier and Villa Shodhan involve a parasol, which served as a roof structure and provided cover from the sun and wind.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is called passive solar design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices. \nThe key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate performing an accurate site analysis. Elements to be considered include window placement and size, and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be adapted or \"retrofitted\".\nPassive energy gain.\n\"Passive solar\" technologies use sunlight without active mechanical systems (as contrasted to \"active solar\", which uses thermal collectors). Such technologies convert sunlight into usable heat (in water, air, and thermal mass), cause air-movement for ventilating, or future use, with little use of other energy sources. A common example is a solarium on the equator-side of a building. Passive cooling is the use of similar design principles to reduce summer cooling requirements.\nSome passive systems use a small amount of conventional energy to control dampers, shutters, night insulation, and other devices that enhance solar energy collection, storage, and use, and reduce undesirable heat transfer.\nPassive solar technologies include direct and indirect solar gain for space heating, solar water heating systems based on the thermosiphon, use of thermal mass and phase-change materials for slowing indoor air temperature swings, solar cookers, the solar chimney for enhancing natural ventilation, and earth sheltering.\nMore widely, solar technologies include the solar furnace, but this typically requires some external energy for aligning their concentrating mirrors or receivers, and historically have not proven to be practical or cost effective for widespread use. 'Low-grade' energy needs, such as space and water heating, have proven over time to be better applications for passive use of solar energy.\nAs a science.\nThe scientific basis for passive solar building design has been developed from a combination of climatology, thermodynamics (particularly heat transfer: conduction (heat), convection, and electromagnetic radiation), fluid mechanics/natural convection (passive movement of air and water without the use of electricity, fans or pumps), and human thermal comfort based on heat index, psychrometrics and enthalpy control for buildings to be inhabited by humans or animals, sunrooms, solariums, and greenhouses for raising plants.\nSpecific attention is divided into: the site, location and solar orientation of the building, local sun path, the prevailing level of insolation (latitude/sunshine/clouds/precipitation), design and construction quality/materials, placement/size/type of windows and walls, and incorporation of solar-energy-storing thermal mass with heat capacity.While these considerations may be directed toward any building, achieving an ideal optimized cost/performance solution requires careful, holistic, system integration engineering of these scientific principles. Modern refinements through computer modeling (such as the comprehensive U.S. Department of Energy \"Energy Plus\" building energy simulation software), and application of decades of lessons learned (since the 1970s energy crisis) can achieve significant energy savings and reduction of environmental damage, without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics. In fact, passive-solar design features such as a greenhouse/sunroom/solarium can greatly enhance the livability, daylight, views, and value of a home, at a low cost per unit of space.\nMuch has been learned about passive solar building design since the 1970s energy crisis. Many unscientific, intuition-based expensive construction experiments have attempted and failed to achieve zero energy \u2013 the total elimination of heating-and-cooling energy bills.\nPassive solar building construction may not be difficult or expensive (using off-the-shelf existing materials and technology), but the scientific passive solar building design is a non-trivial engineering effort that requires significant study of previous counter-intuitive lessons learned, and time to enter, evaluate, and iteratively refine the simulation input and output.\nOne of the most useful post-construction evaluation tools has been the use of thermography using digital thermal imaging cameras for a formal quantitative scientific energy audit. Thermal imaging can be used to document areas of poor thermal performance such as the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day.\nThe scientific lessons learned over the last three decades have been captured in sophisticated comprehensive building energy simulation computer software systems (like U.S. DOE Energy Plus).\nScientific passive solar building design with quantitative cost benefit product optimization is not easy for a novice. The level of complexity has resulted in ongoing bad-architecture, and many intuition-based, unscientific construction experiments that disappoint their designers and waste a significant portion of their construction budget on inappropriate ideas.\nThe economic motivation for scientific design and engineering is significant. If it had been applied comprehensively to new building construction beginning in 1980 (based on 1970s lessons learned), The United States could be saving over $250,000,000 per year on expensive energy and related pollution today.\nSince 1979, Passive Solar Building Design has been a critical element of achieving zero energy by educational institution experiments, and governments around the world, including the U.S. Department of Energy, and the energy research scientists that they have supported for decades. The cost effective proof of concept was established decades ago, but cultural change in architecture, the construction trades, and building-owner decision making has been very slow and difficult.\nThe new subjects such as \"architectural science\" and \"architectural technology\" are being added to some schools of architecture, with a future goal of teaching the above scientific and energy-engineering principles.\nThe solar path in passive design.\nThe ability to achieve these goals simultaneously is fundamentally dependent on the seasonal variations in the sun's path throughout the day.\nThis occurs as a result of the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation in relation to its orbit. The sun path is unique for any given latitude.\nIn Northern Hemisphere non-tropical latitudes farther than 23.5 degrees from the equator:\nThe converse is observed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the sun rises to the east and sets toward the west regardless of which hemisphere you are in.\nIn equatorial regions at less than 23.5 degrees, the position of the sun at solar noon will oscillate from north to south and back again during the year.\nIn regions closer than 23.5 degrees from either north-or-south pole, during summer the sun will trace a complete circle in the sky without setting whilst it will never appear above the horizon six months later, during the height of winter.\nThe 47-degree difference in the altitude of the sun at solar noon between winter and summer forms the basis of passive solar design. This information is combined with local climatic data (degree day) heating and cooling requirements to determine at what time of the year solar gain will be beneficial for thermal comfort, and when it should be blocked with shading. By strategic placement of items such as glazing and shading devices, the percentage of solar gain entering a building can be controlled throughout the year.\nOne passive solar sun path design problem is that although the sun is in the same relative position six weeks before, and six weeks after, the solstice, due to \"thermal lag\" from the thermal mass of the Earth, the temperature and solar gain requirements are quite different before and after the summer or winter solstice. Movable shutters, shades, shade screens, or window quilts can accommodate day-to-day and hour-to-hour solar gain and insulation requirements.\nCareful arrangement of rooms completes the passive solar design. A common recommendation for residential dwellings is to place living areas facing solar noon and sleeping quarters on the opposite side. A heliodon is a traditional movable light device used by architects and designers to help model sun path effects. In modern times, 3D computer graphics can visually simulate this data, and calculate performance predictions.\nPassive solar heat transfer principles.\nPersonal thermal comfort is a function of personal health factors (medical, psychological, sociological and situational), ambient air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air movement (wind chill, turbulence) and relative humidity (affecting human evaporative cooling). Heat transfer in buildings occurs through convection, conduction, and thermal radiation through roof, walls, floor and windows.\nConvective heat transfer.\nConvective heat transfer can be beneficial or detrimental. Uncontrolled air infiltration from poor weatherization / weatherstripping / draft-proofing can contribute up to 40% of heat loss during winter; however, strategic placement of operable windows or vents can enhance convection, cross-ventilation, and summer cooling when the outside air is of a comfortable temperature and relative humidity. Filtered energy recovery ventilation systems may be useful to eliminate undesirable humidity, dust, pollen, and microorganisms in unfiltered ventilation air.\nNatural convection causing rising warm air and falling cooler air can result in an uneven stratification of heat. This may cause uncomfortable variations in temperature in the upper and lower conditioned space, serve as a method of venting hot air, or be designed in as a natural-convection air-flow loop for passive solar heat distribution and temperature equalization. Natural human cooling by perspiration and evaporation may be facilitated through natural or forced convective air movement by fans, but ceiling fans can disturb the stratified insulating air layers at the top of a room, and accelerate heat transfer from a hot attic, or through nearby windows. In addition, high relative humidity inhibits evaporative cooling by humans.\nRadiative heat transfer.\nThe main source of heat transfer is radiant energy, and the primary source is the sun. Solar radiation occurs predominantly through the roof and windows (but also through walls). Thermal radiation moves from a warmer surface to a cooler one. Roofs receive the majority of the solar radiation delivered to a house. A cool roof, or green roof in addition to a radiant barrier can help prevent your attic from becoming hotter than the peak summer outdoor air temperature (see albedo, absorptivity, emissivity, and reflectivity).\nWindows are a ready and predictable site for thermal radiation.\nEnergy from radiation can move into a window in the day time, and out of the same window at night. Radiation uses photons to transmit electromagnetic waves through a vacuum, or translucent medium. Solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days. Solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by insulated glazing, shading, and orientation. Windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls. Convective heat transfer through and around window coverings also degrade its insulation properties. When shading windows, external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal window coverings.\nWestern and eastern sun can provide warmth and lighting, but are vulnerable to overheating in summer if not shaded. In contrast, the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter, but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall. The amount of radiant heat received is related to the location latitude, altitude, cloud cover, and seasonal / hourly angle of incidence (see Sun path and Lambert's cosine law).\nAnother passive solar design principle is that thermal energy can be stored in certain building materials and released again when heat gain eases to stabilize diurnal (day/night) temperature variations. The complex interaction of thermodynamic principles can be counterintuitive for first-time designers. Precise computer modeling can help avoid costly construction experiments.\nDesign elements for residential buildings in temperate climates.\nThe precise amount of equator-facing glass and thermal mass should be based on careful consideration of latitude, altitude, climatic conditions, and heating/cooling degree day requirements.\nFactors that can degrade thermal performance:\nEfficiency and economics of passive solar heating.\nTechnically, PSH is highly efficient. Direct-gain systems can utilize (i.e. convert into \"useful\" heat) 65\u201370% of the energy of solar radiation that strikes the aperture or collector.\nPassive solar fraction (PSF) is the percentage of the required heat load met by PSH and hence represents potential reduction in heating costs. RETScreen International has reported a PSF of 20\u201350%. Within the field of sustainability, energy conservation even of the order of 15% is considered substantial.\nOther sources report the following PSFs:\nIn favorable climates such as the southwest United States, highly optimized systems can exceed 75% PSF.\nFor more information see Solar Air Heat\nKey passive solar building configurations.\nThere are three distinct passive solar energy configurations, and at least one noteworthy hybrid of these basic configurations:\nDirect solar system.\nIn a direct-gain passive solar system, the indoor space acts as a solar collector, heat absorber, and distribution system. South-facing glass in the northern hemisphere(north-facing in the southern hemisphere) admits solar energy into the building interior where it directly heats (radiant energy absorption) or indirectly heats (through convection) thermal mass in the building such as concrete or masonry floors and walls. The floors and walls acting as thermal mass are incorporated as functional parts of the building and temper the intensity of heating during the day. At night, the heated thermal mass radiates heat into the indoor space.\nIn cold climates, a sun-tempered building is the most basic type of direct gain passive solar configuration that simply involves increasing (slightly) the south-facing glazing area, without adding additional thermal mass. It is a type of direct-gain system in which the building envelope is well insulated, is elongated in an east\u2013west direction, and has a large fraction (~80% or more) of the windows on the south side. It has little added thermal mass beyond what is already in the building (i.e., just framing, wall board, and so forth). In a sun-tempered building, the south-facing window area should be limited to about 5 to 7% of the total floor area, less in a sunny climate, to prevent overheating. Additional south-facing glazing can be included only if more thermal mass is added. Energy savings are modest with this system, and sun tempering is very low cost.\nIn genuine direct gain passive solar systems, sufficient thermal mass is required to prevent large temperature fluctuations in indoor air; more thermal mass is required than in a sun tempered building. Overheating of the building interior can result with insufficient or poorly designed thermal mass. About one-half to two-thirds of the interior surface area of the floors, walls and ceilings must be constructed of thermal storage materials. Thermal storage materials can be concrete, adobe, brick, and water. Thermal mass in floors and walls should be kept as bare as is functionally and aesthetically possible; thermal mass needs to be exposed to direct sunlight. Wall-to-wall carpeting, large throw rugs, expansive furniture, and large wall hangings should be avoided.\nTypically, for about every 1\u00a0ft2 of south-facing glass, about 5 to 10\u00a0ft3 of thermal mass is required for thermal mass (1 m3 per 5 to 10 m2). When accounting for minimal-to-average wall and floor coverings and furniture, this typically equates to about 5 to 10\u00a0ft2 per ft2 (5 to 10 m2 per m2) of south-facing glass, depending upon whether the sunlight strikes the surface directly. The simplest rule of thumb is that thermal mass area should have an area of 5 to 10 times the surface area of the direct-gain collector (glass) area.\nSolid thermal mass (e.g., concrete, masonry, stone, etc.) should be relatively thin, no more than about 4 in (100\u00a0mm) thick. Thermal masses with large exposed areas and those in direct sunlight for at least part of the day (2 hour minimum) perform best. Medium-to-dark, colors with high absorptivity, should be used on surfaces of thermal mass elements that will be in direct sunlight. Thermal mass that is not in contact with sunlight can be any color. Lightweight elements (e.g., drywall walls and ceilings) can be any color. Covering the glazing with tight-fitting, moveable insulation panels during dark, cloudy periods and nighttime hours will greatly enhance performance of a direct-gain system. Water contained within plastic or metal containment and placed in direct sunlight heats more rapidly and more evenly than solid mass due to natural convection heat transfer. The convection process also prevents surface temperatures from becoming too extreme as they sometimes do when dark colored solid mass surfaces receive direct sunlight.\nDepending on climate and with adequate thermal mass, south-facing glass area in a direct gain system should be limited to about 10 to 20% of the floor area (e.g., 10 to 20\u00a0ft2 of glass for a 100\u00a0ft2 floor area). This should be based on the net glass or glazing area. Note that most windows have a net glass/glazing area that is 75 to 85% of the overall window unit area. Above this level, problems with overheating, glare and fading of fabrics are likely.\nIndirect solar system.\nIn an indirect-gain passive solar system, the thermal mass (concrete, masonry, or water) is located directly behind the south-facing glass and in front of the heated indoor space and so there is no direct heating. The position of the mass prevents sunlight from entering the indoor space and can also obstruct the view through the glass. There are two types of indirect gain systems: thermal storage wall systems and roof pond systems.\nThermal Storage (Trombe) Walls.\nIn a thermal storage wall system, often called a Trombe wall, a massive wall is located directly behind south-facing glass, which absorbs solar energy and releases it selectively towards the building interior at night. The wall can be constructed of cast-in-place concrete, brick, adobe, stone, or solid (or filled) concrete masonry units. Sunlight enters through the glass and is immediately absorbed at the surface of the mass wall and either stored or conducted through the material mass to the inside space. The thermal mass cannot absorb solar energy as fast as it enters the space between the mass and the window area. Temperatures of the air in this space can easily exceed 120\u00a0\u00b0F (49\u00a0\u00b0C). This hot air can be introduced into interior spaces behind the wall by incorporating heat-distributing vents at the top of the wall. This wall system was first envisioned and patented in 1881 by its inventor, Edward Morse. Felix Trombe, for whom this system is sometimes named, was a French engineer who built several homes using this design in the French Pyrenees in the 1960s.\nA thermal storage wall typically consists of a 4 to 16 in (100 to 400\u00a0mm) thick masonry wall coated with a dark, heat-absorbing finish (or a selective surface) and covered with a single or double layer of high transmissivity glass. The glass is typically placed from &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 in to 2 in from the wall to create a small airspace. In some designs, the mass is located 1 to 2\u00a0ft (0.6 m) away from the glass, but the space is still not usable. The surface of the thermal mass absorbs the solar radiation that strikes it and stores it for nighttime use. Unlike a direct gain system, the thermal storage wall system provides passive solar heating without excessive window area and glare in interior spaces. However, the ability to take advantage of views and daylighting are eliminated. The performance of Trombe walls is diminished if the wall interior is not open to the interior spaces. Furniture, bookshelves and wall cabinets installed on the interior surface of the wall will reduce its performance.\nA classical Trombe wall, also generically called a vented thermal storage wall, has operable vents near the ceiling and floor levels of the mass wall that allow indoor air to flow through them by natural convection. As solar radiation heats the air trapped between the glass and wall and it begins to rise. Air is drawn into the lower vent, then into the space between the glass and wall to get heated by solar radiation, increasing its temperature and causing it to rise, and then exit through the top (ceiling) vent back into the indoor space. This allows the wall to directly introduce heated air into the space; usually at a temperature of about 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C).\nIf vents are left open at night (or on cloudy days), a reversal of convective airflow will occur, wasting heat by dissipating it outdoors. Vents must be closed at night so radiant heat from the interior surface of the storage wall heats the indoor space. Generally, vents are also closed during summer months when heat gain is not needed. During the summer, an exterior exhaust vent installed at the top of the wall can be opened to vent to the outside. Such venting makes the system act as a solar chimney driving air through the building during the day.\nVented thermal storage walls vented to the interior have proven somewhat ineffective, mostly because they deliver too much heat during the day in mild weather and during summer months; they simply overheat and create comfort issues. Most solar experts recommended that thermal storage walls should not be vented to the interior.\nThere are many variations of the Trombe wall system. An unvented thermal storage wall (technically not a Trombe wall) captures solar energy on the exterior surface, heats up, and conducts heat to the interior surface, where it radiates from the interior wall surface to the indoor space later in the day. A water wall uses a type of thermal mass that consists of tanks or tubes of water used as thermal mass.\nA typical unvented thermal storage wall consists of a south facing masonry or concrete wall with a dark, heat-absorbing material on the exterior surface and faced with a single or double layer of glass. High transmission glass maximizes solar gains to the mass wall. The glass is placed from &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 to 6 in. (20 to 150\u00a0mm) from the wall to create a small airspace. Glass framing is typically metal (e.g., aluminum) because vinyl will soften and wood will become super dried at the 180\u00a0\u00b0F (82\u00a0\u00b0C) temperature that can exist behind the glass in the wall. Heat from sunlight passing through the glass is absorbed by the dark surface, stored in the wall, and conducted slowly inward through the masonry. As an architectural detail, patterned glass can limit the exterior visibility of the wall without sacrificing solar transmissivity.\nA water wall uses containers of water for thermal mass instead of a solid mass wall. Water walls are typically slightly more efficient than solid mass walls because they absorb heat more efficiently due to the development of convective currents in the liquid water as it is heated. These currents cause rapid mixing and quicker transfer of heat into the building than can be provided by the solid mass walls.\nTemperature variations between the exterior and interior wall surfaces drive heat through the mass wall. Inside the building, however, daytime heat gain is delayed, only becoming available at the interior surface of the thermal mass during the evening when it is needed because the sun has set. The time lag is the time difference between when sunlight first strikes the wall and when the heat enters the building interior. Time lag is contingent upon the type of material used in the wall and the wall thickness; a greater thickness yields a greater time lag. The time lag characteristic of thermal mass, combined with dampening of temperature fluctuations, allows the use of varying daytime solar energy as a more uniform night-time heat source. Windows can be placed in the wall for natural lighting or aesthetic reasons, but this tends to lower the efficiency somewhat.\nThe thickness of a thermal storage wall should be approximately 10 to 14 in (250 to 350\u00a0mm) for brick, 12 to 18 in (300 to 450\u00a0mm) for concrete, 8 to 12 in (200 to 300\u00a0mm) for earth/adobe, and at least 6 in (150\u00a0mm) for water. These thicknesses delay movement of heat such that indoor surface temperatures peak during late evening hours. Heat will take about 8 to 10 hours to reach the interior of the building (heat travels through a concrete wall at rate of about one inch per hour). A good thermal connection between the inside wall finishes (e.g., drywall) and the thermal mass wall is necessary to maximize heat transfer to the interior space.\nAlthough the position of a thermal storage wall minimizes daytime overheating of the indoor space, a well-insulated building should be limited to approximately 0.2 to 0.3\u00a0ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.2 to 0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area), depending upon climate. A water wall should have about 0.15 to 0.2\u00a0ft2 of water wall surface per ft2 (0.15 to 0.2 m2 per m2) of floor area.\nThermal mass walls are best-suited to sunny winter climates that have high diurnal (day-night) temperature swings (e.g., southwest, mountain-west). They do not perform as well in cloudy or extremely cold climates or in climates where there is not a large diurnal temperature swing. Nighttime thermal losses through the thermal mass of the wall can still be significant in cloudy and cold climates; the wall loses stored heat in less than a day, and then leak heat, which dramatically raises backup heating requirements. Covering the glazing with tight-fitting, moveable insulation panels during lengthy cloudy periods and nighttime hours will enhance performance of a thermal storage system.\nThe main drawback of thermal storage walls is their heat loss to the outside. Double glass (glass or any of the plastics) is necessary for reducing heat loss in most climates. In mild climates, single glass is acceptable. A selective surface (high-absorbing/low-emitting surface) applied to the exterior surface of the thermal storage wall improves performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass; typically, it achieves a similar improvement in performance without the need for daily installation and removal of insulating panels. A selective surface consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall. It absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range. High absorbency turns the light into heat at the wall's surface, and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass.\nRoof Pond System.\nA roof pond\" \"passive solar system, sometimes called a solar roof, uses water stored on the roof to temper hot and cold internal temperatures, usually in desert environments. It typically is constructed of containers holding 6 to 12 in (150 to 300\u00a0mm) of water on a flat roof. Water is stored in large plastic bags or fiberglass containers to maximize radiant emissions and minimize evaporation. It can be left unglazed or can be covered by glazing. Solar radiation heats the water, which acts as a thermal storage medium. At night or during cloudy weather, the containers can be covered with insulating panels. The indoor space below the roof pond is heated by thermal energy emitted by the roof pond storage above. These systems require good drainage systems, movable insulation, and an enhanced structural system to support a 35 to 70\u00a0lb/ft2 (1.7 to 3.3\u00a0kN/m2) dead load.\nWith the angles of incidence of sunlight during the day, roof ponds are only effective for heating at lower and mid-latitudes, in hot to temperate climates. Roof pond systems perform better for cooling in hot, low humidity climates. Not many solar roofs have been built, and there is limited information on the design, cost, performance, and construction details of thermal storage roofs.\nHybrid direct/indirect solar system.\nKachadorian demonstrated that the drawbacks of thermal storage walls can be overcome by orienting the Trombe wall horizontally instead of vertically. If the thermal storage mass is constructed as a ventilated concrete slab floor instead of as a wall, it does not block sunlight from entering the home (the Trombe wall's most obvious disadvantage) but it can still be exposed to direct sunlight through double-glazed equator-facing windows, which can be further insulated by thermal shutters or shades at night. The Trombe wall's problematic delay in daytime heat capture is eliminated, because heat does not have to be driven through the wall to reach the interior air space: some of it reflects or re-radiates immediately from the floor. Provided the slab has air channels like the Trombe wall, which run through it in the north-south direction and are vented to the interior air space through the concrete slab floor just inside the north and south walls, vigorous air thermosiphoning through the slab still occurs as in the vertical Trombe wall, distributing the impounded heat throughout the house (and cooling the house in summer by the reverse process).\nThe ventilated horizontal slab is less expensive to construct than vertical Trombe walls, as it forms the foundation of the house which is a necessary expense in any building. Slab-on-grade foundations are a common, well-understood and cost-effective building component (modified only slightly by the inclusion of a layer of concrete-brick air channels), rather than an exotic Trombe wall construct. The only remaining drawback to this kind of thermal mass solar architecture is the absence of a basement, as in any slab-on grade design.\nThe Kachadorian floor design is a \"direct-gain\" passive solar system, but its thermal mass also acts as an \"indirect\" heating (or cooling) element, giving up its heat at night. It is an alternating cycle hybrid energy system, like a hybrid electric vehicle.\nIsolated solar system.\nIn an \"isolated gain passive solar system,\" the components (e.g., collector and thermal storage) are isolated from the indoor area of the building.\nAn attached sunspace, also sometimes called a solar room or solarium, is a type of isolated gain solar system with a glazed interior space or room that is part of or attached to a building but which can be completely closed off from the main occupied areas. It functions like an attached greenhouse that makes use of a combination of direct-gain and indirect-gain system characteristics. A sunspace may be called and appear like a greenhouse, but a greenhouse is designed to grow plants whereas a sunspace is designed to provide heat and aesthetics to a building. Sunspaces are very popular passive design elements because they expand the living areas of a building and offer a room to grow plants and other vegetation. In moderate and cold climates, however, supplemental space heating is required to keep plants from freezing during extremely cold weather.\nAn attached sunspace's south-facing glass collects solar energy as in a direct-gain system. The simplest sunspace design is to install vertical windows with no overhead glazing. Sunspaces may experience high heat gain and high heat loss through their abundance of glazing. Although horizontal and sloped glazing collects more heat in the winter, it is minimized to prevent overheating during summer months. Although overhead glazing can be aesthetically pleasing, an insulated roof provides better thermal performance. Skylights can be used to provide some daylighting potential. Vertical glazing can maximize gain in winter, when the angle of the sun is low, and yield less heat gain during the summer. Vertical glass is less expensive, easier to install and insulate, and not as prone to leaking, fogging, breaking, and other glass failures. A combination of vertical glazing and some sloped glazing is acceptable if summer shading is provided. A well-designed overhang may be all that is necessary to shade the glazing in the summer.\nThe temperature variations caused by the heat losses and gains can be moderated by thermal mass and low-emissivity windows. Thermal mass can include a masonry floor, a masonry wall bordering the house, or water containers. Distribution of heat to the building can be accomplished through ceiling and floor level vents, windows, doors, or fans. In a common design, thermal mass wall situated on the back of the sunspace adjacent to the living space will function like an indirect-gain thermal mass wall. Solar energy entering the sunspace is retained in the thermal mass. Solar heat is conveyed into the building by conduction through the shared mass wall in the rear of the sunspace and by vents (like an unvented thermal storage wall) or through openings in the wall that permit airflow from the sunspace to the indoor space by convection (like a vented thermal storage wall).\nIn cold climates, double glazing should be used to reduce conductive losses through the glass to the outside. Night-time heat loss, although significant during winter months, is not as essential in the sunspace as with direct gain systems since the sunspace can be closed off from the rest of the building. In temperate and cold climates, thermally isolating the sunspace from the building at night is important. Large glass panels, French doors, or sliding glass doors between the building and attached sunspace will maintain an open feeling without the heat loss associated with an open space.\nA sunspace with a masonry thermal wall will need approximately 0.3\u00a0ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area), depending on climate. Wall thicknesses should be similar to a thermal storage wall. If a water wall is used between the sunspace and living space, about 0.20\u00a0ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.2 m2 per m2 of floor area) is appropriate. In most climates, a ventilation system is required in summer months to prevent overheating. Generally, vast overhead (horizontal) and east- and west-facing glass areas should not be used in a sunspace without special precautions for summer overheating such as using heat-reflecting glass and providing summer-shading systems areas.\nThe internal surfaces of the thermal mass should be dark in color. Movable insulation (e.g., window coverings, shades, shutters) can be used help trap the warm air in the sunspace both after the sun has set and during cloudy weather. When closed during extremely hot days, window coverings can help keep the sunspace from overheating.\nTo maximize comfort and efficiency, the non-glass sunspace walls, ceiling and foundation should be well insulated. The perimeter of the foundation wall or slab should be insulated to the frost line or around the slab perimeter. In a temperate or cold climate, the east and west walls of the sunspace should be insulated (no glass).\nAdditional measures.\nMeasures should be taken to reduce heat loss at night e.g. window coverings or movable window insulation.\nHeat storage.\nThe sun doesn't shine all the time. Heat storage, or thermal mass, keeps the building warm when the sun can't heat it.\nIn diurnal solar houses, the storage is designed for one or a few days. The usual method is a custom-constructed thermal mass. This includes a Trombe wall, a ventilated concrete floor, a cistern, water wall or roof pond. It is also feasible to use the thermal mass of the earth itself, either as-is or by incorporation into the structure by banking or using rammed earth as a structural medium.\nIn subarctic areas, or areas that have long terms without solar gain (e.g. weeks of freezing fog), purpose-built thermal mass is very expensive. Don Stephens pioneered an experimental technique to use the ground as thermal mass large enough for annualized heat storage. His designs run an isolated thermosiphon 3\u00a0m under a house, and insulate the ground with a 6\u00a0m waterproof skirt.\nInsulation.\nThermal insulation or superinsulation (type, placement and amount) reduces unwanted leakage of heat. Some passive buildings are actually constructed of insulation.\nSpecial glazing systems and window coverings.\nThe effectiveness of direct solar gain systems is significantly enhanced by insulative (e.g. double glazing), spectrally selective glazing (low-e), or movable window insulation (window quilts, bifold interior insulation shutters, shades, etc.).\nGenerally, Equator-facing windows should not employ glazing coatings that inhibit solar gain.\nThere is extensive use of super-insulated windows in the German Passive House standard. Selection of different spectrally selective window coating depends on the ratio of heating versus cooling degree days for the design location.\nGlazing selection.\nEquator-facing glass.\nThe requirement for vertical equator-facing glass is different from the other three sides of a building. Reflective window coatings and multiple panes of glass can reduce useful solar gain. However, direct-gain systems are more dependent on double or triple glazing or even quadruple glazing in higher geographic latitudes to reduce heat loss. Indirect-gain and isolated-gain configurations may still be able to function effectively with only single-pane glazing. Nevertheless, the optimal cost-effective solution is both location and system dependent.\nRoof-angle glass and skylights.\nSkylights admit harsh direct overhead sunlight and glare either horizontally (a flat roof) or pitched at the same angle as the roof slope. In some cases, horizontal skylights are used with reflectors to increase the intensity of solar radiation (and harsh glare), depending on the roof angle of incidence. When the winter sun is low on the horizon, most solar radiation reflects off of roof angled glass ( the angle of incidence is nearly parallel to roof-angled glass morning and afternoon ). When the summer sun is high, it is nearly perpendicular to roof-angled glass, which maximizes solar gain at the wrong time of year, and acts like a solar furnace. Skylights should be covered and well-insulated to reduce natural convection ( warm air rising ) heat loss on cold winter nights, and intense solar heat gain during hot spring/summer/fall days.\nThe equator-facing side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere, and north in the southern hemisphere. Skylights on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination, except for summer days when the sun may rise on the non-equator side of the building (at some latitudes). Skylights on east-facing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning. West-facing skylights provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day.\nSome skylights have expensive glazing that partially reduces summer solar heat gain, while still allowing some visible light transmission. However, if visible light can pass through it, so can some radiant heat gain (they are both electromagnetic radiation waves).\nYou can partially reduce some of the unwanted roof-angled-glazing summer solar heat gain by installing a skylight in the shade of deciduous (leaf-shedding) trees, or by adding a movable insulated opaque window covering on the inside or outside of the skylight. This would eliminate the daylight benefit in the summer. If tree limbs hang over a roof, they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters, possibly cause roof-damaging ice dams, shorten roof life, and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic. Leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing, difficult to clean, and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms.\n\"Sawtooth roof glazing\" with vertical-glass-only can bring some of the passive solar building design benefits into the core of a commercial or industrial building, without the need for any roof-angled glass or skylights.\nSkylights provide daylight. The only view they provide is essentially straight up in most applications. Well-insulated light tubes can bring daylight into northern rooms, without using a skylight. A passive-solar greenhouse provides abundant daylight for the equator-side of the building.\nInfrared thermography color thermal imaging cameras ( used in formal energy audits ) can quickly document the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy states: \"vertical glazing is the overall best option for sunspaces.\" Roof-angled glass and sidewall glass are not recommended for passive solar sunspaces.\nThe U.S. DOE explains drawbacks to roof-angled glazing: Glass and plastic have little structural strength. When installed vertically, glass (or plastic) bears its own weight because only a small area (the top edge of the glazing) is subject to gravity. As the glass tilts off the vertical axis, however, an increased area (now the sloped cross-section) of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity. Glass is also brittle; it does not flex much before breaking. To counteract this, you usually must increase the thickness of the glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing. Both increase overall cost, and the latter will reduce the amount of solar gain into the sunspace.\nAnother common problem with sloped glazing is its increased exposure to the weather. It is difficult to maintain a good seal on roof-angled glass in intense sunlight. Hail, sleet, snow, and wind may cause material failure. For occupant safety, regulatory agencies usually require sloped glass to be made of safety glass, laminated, or a combination thereof, which reduce solar gain potential. Most of the roof-angled glass on the Crowne Plaza Hotel Orlando Airport sunspace was destroyed in a single windstorm. Roof-angled glass increases construction cost, and can increase insurance premiums. Vertical glass is less susceptible to weather damage than roof-angled glass.\nIt is difficult to control solar heat gain in a sunspace with sloped glazing during the summer and even during the middle of a mild and sunny winter day. Skylights are the antithesis of zero energy building Passive Solar Cooling in climates with an air conditioning requirement.\nAngle of incident radiation.\nThe amount of solar gain transmitted through glass is also affected by the angle of the incident solar radiation. Sunlight striking a single sheet of glass within 45 degrees of perpendicular is mostly transmitted (less than 10% is reflected), whereas for sunlight striking at 70 degrees from perpendicular over 20% of light is reflected, and above 70 degrees this percentage reflected rises sharply.\nAll of these factors can be modeled more precisely with a photographic light meter and a heliodon or optical bench, which can quantify the ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity, based on angle of incidence.\nAlternatively, passive solar computer software can determine the impact of sun path, and cooling-and-heating degree days on energy performance.\nOperable shading and insulation devices.\nA design with too much equator-facing glass can result in excessive winter, spring, or fall day heating, uncomfortably bright living spaces at certain times of the year, and excessive heat transfer on winter nights and summer days.\nAlthough the sun is at the same altitude 6-weeks before and after the solstice, the heating and cooling requirements before and after the solstice are significantly different. Heat storage on the Earth's surface causes \"thermal lag.\" Variable cloud cover influences solar gain potential. This means that latitude-specific fixed window overhangs, while important, are not a complete seasonal solar gain control solution.\nControl mechanisms (such as manual-or-motorized interior insulated drapes, shutters, exterior roll-down shade screens, or retractable awnings) can compensate for differences caused by thermal lag or cloud cover, and help control daily / hourly solar gain requirement variations.\nHome automation systems that monitor temperature, sunlight, time of day, and room occupancy can precisely control motorized window-shading-and-insulation devices.\nExterior colors reflecting \u2013 absorbing.\nMaterials and colors can be chosen to reflect or absorb solar thermal energy. Using information on a color for electromagnetic radiation to determine its thermal radiation properties of reflection or absorption can assist the choices.\nIn cold climates with short winter days direct-gain systems utilizing equator-facing windows may actually perform better when snow covers the ground, since reflected as well as direct sunlight will enter the house and be captured as heat.\nLandscaping and gardens.\nEnergy-efficient landscaping materials for careful passive solar choices include hardscape building material and \"softscape\" plants. The use of landscape design principles for selection of trees, hedges, and trellis-pergola features with vines; all can be used to create summer shading. For winter solar gain it is desirable to use deciduous plants that drop their leaves in the autumn gives year round passive solar benefits. Non-deciduous evergreen shrubs and trees can be windbreaks, at variable heights and distances, to create protection and shelter from winter wind chill. Xeriscaping with 'mature size appropriate' native species of-and drought tolerant plants, drip irrigation, mulching, and organic gardening practices reduce or eliminate the need for energy-and-water-intensive irrigation, gas powered garden equipment, and reduces the landfill waste footprint. Solar powered landscape lighting and fountain pumps, and covered swimming pools and plunge pools with solar water heaters can reduce the impact of such amenities.\nOther passive solar principles.\nPassive solar lighting.\nPassive solar lighting techniques enhance taking advantage of natural illumination for interiors, and so reduce reliance on artificial lighting systems.\nThis can be achieved by careful building design, orientation, and placement of window sections to collect light. Other creative solutions involve the use of reflecting surfaces to admit daylight into the interior of a building. Window sections should be adequately sized, and to avoid over-illumination can be shielded with a Brise soleil, awnings, well placed trees, glass coatings, and other passive and active devices.\nAnother major issue for many window systems is that they can be potentially vulnerable sites of excessive thermal gain or heat loss. Whilst high mounted clerestory window and traditional skylights can introduce daylight in poorly oriented sections of a building, unwanted heat transfer may be hard to control. Thus, energy that is saved by reducing artificial lighting is often more than offset by the energy required for operating HVAC systems to maintain thermal comfort.\nVarious methods can be employed to address this including but not limited to window coverings, insulated glazing and novel materials such as aerogel semi-transparent insulation, optical fiber embedded in walls or roof, or https://.\nReflecting elements, from active and passive daylighting collectors, such as light shelves, lighter wall and floor colors, mirrored wall sections, interior walls with upper glass panels, and clear or translucent glassed hinged doors and sliding glass doors take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside. The light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar light tubes or from active daylighting sources. In traditional Japanese architecture the Sh\u014dji sliding panel doors, with translucent Washi screens, are an original precedent. International style, Modernist and Mid-century modern architecture were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial, commercial, and residential applications.\nPassive solar water heating.\nThere are many ways to use solar thermal energy to heat water for domestic use. Different active-and-passive solar hot water technologies have different location-specific economic cost benefit analysis implications.\nFundamental passive solar hot water heating involves no pumps or anything electrical. It is very cost effective in climates that do not have lengthy sub-freezing, or very-cloudy, weather conditions. Other active solar water heating technologies, etc. may be more appropriate for some locations.\nIt is possible to have active solar hot water which is also capable of being \"off grid\" and qualifies as sustainable. This is done by the use of a photovoltaic cell which uses energy from the sun to power the pumps.\nComparison to the Passive House standard in Europe.\nThere is growing momentum in Europe for the approach espoused by the Passive House (\"Passivhaus\" in German) Institute in Germany. Rather than relying solely on traditional passive solar design techniques, this approach seeks to make use of all passive sources of heat, minimises energy usage, and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration. Most of the buildings built to the Passive House standard also incorporate an active heat recovery ventilation unit with or without a small (typically 1\u00a0kW) incorporated heating component.\nThe energy design of Passive House buildings is developed using a spreadsheet-based modeling tool called the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) which is updated periodically. The current version is PHPP 9.6 (2018). A building may be certified as a \"Passive House\" when it can be shown that it meets certain criteria, the most important being that the annual specific heat demand for the house should not exceed 15kWh/m2a.\nComparison to the Zero heating building.\nWith advances in ultra low U-value glazing a Passive House-based (nearly) zero heating building is proposed to supersede the nearly-zero energy buildings in EU. The zero heating building reduces on the passive solar design and makes the building more opened to conventional architectural design.\nThe annual specific heat demand for the zero-heating house should not exceed 3 kWh/m2a. Zero heating building is simpler to design and to operate. For example: there is no need for modulated sun shading in zero-heating houses.\nDesign tools.\nTraditionally a heliodon was used to simulate the altitude and azimuth of the sun shining on a model building at any time of any day of the year. In modern times, computer programs can model this phenomenon and integrate local climate data (including site impacts such as overshadowing and physical obstructions) to predict the solar gain potential for a particular building design over the course of a year. GPS-based smartphone applications can now do this inexpensively on a hand held device. These design tools provide the passive solar designer the ability to evaluate local conditions, design elements and orientation prior to construction. Energy performance optimization normally requires an iterative-refinement design-and-evaluate process. There is no such thing as a \"one-size-fits-all\" universal passive solar building design that would work well in all locations.\nLevels of application.\nMany detached suburban houses can achieve reductions in heating expense without obvious changes to their appearance, comfort or usability. This is done using good siting and window positioning, small amounts of thermal mass, with good-but-conventional insulation, weatherization, and an occasional supplementary heat source, such as a central radiator connected to a (solar) water heater. Sunrays may fall on a wall during the daytime and raise the temperature of its thermal mass. This will then radiate heat into the building in the evening. External shading, or a radiant barrier plus air gap, may be used to reduce undesirable summer solar gain.\nAn extension of the \"passive solar\" approach to seasonal solar capture and storage of heat and cooling. These designs attempt to capture warm-season solar heat, and convey it to a seasonal thermal store for use months later during the cold season (\"annualised passive solar.\") Increased storage is achieved by employing large amounts of thermal mass or earth coupling. Anecdotal reports suggest they can be effective but no formal study has been conducted to demonstrate their superiority. The approach also can move cooling into the warm season. Examples:\nA \"purely passive\" solar-heated house would have no mechanical furnace unit, relying instead on energy captured from sunshine, only supplemented by \"incidental\" heat energy given off by lights, computers, and other task-specific appliances (such as those for cooking, entertainment, etc.), showering, people and pets. The use of natural convection air currents (rather than mechanical devices such as fans) to circulate air is related, though not strictly solar design. Passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers, insulating shutters, shades, awnings, or reflectors. Some systems enlist small fans or solar-heated chimneys to improve convective air-flow. A reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their coefficient of performance. A heat pump might use 1 J for every 4 J it delivers giving a COP of 4. A system that only uses a 30 W fan to more-evenly distribute 10\u00a0kW of solar heat through an entire house would have a COP of 300.\nPassive solar building design is often a foundational element of a cost-effective zero energy building. Although a ZEB uses multiple passive solar building design concepts, a ZEB is usually not purely passive, having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as: wind turbine, photovoltaics, micro hydro, geothermal, and other emerging alternative energy sources. Passive solar is also a core building design strategy for passive survivability, along with other passive strategies.\nPassive solar design on skyscrapers.\nThere has been recent interest in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency. Because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments, yet require large amounts of energy to operate, there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques. One study, which analyzed the proposed 22 Bishopsgate tower in London, found that a 35% energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains, by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration, usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building, and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain. Indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness (from 20 to 30\u00a0cm), using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss, dedicating 15\u201320% of floor area for thermal storage, and implementing a Trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space. Overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer, and allow it in the winter, and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months.\nAnother study analyzed double-green skin facade (DGSF) on the outside of high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. Such a green facade, or vegetation covering the outer walls, can combat the usage of air conditioning greatly - as much as 80%, as discovered by the researchers.\nIn more temperate climates, strategies such as glazing, adjustment of window-to-wall ratio, sun shading and roof strategies can offer considerable energy savings, in the 30% to 60% range.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was known for his romantic swashbuckler roles, frequent partnerships with Olivia de Havilland and reputation for his womanising and hedonistic personal life.\nFlynn's roles include Robin Hood in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938), which was later named by the American Film Institute as the 18th-greatest hero in American film history; the lead role in \"Captain Blood\" (1935); Major Geoffrey Vickers in \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1936); and as the hero in a number of Westerns such as \"Dodge City\" (1939), \"Santa Fe Trail\", \"Virginia City\" (both 1940) and \"San Antonio\" (1945).\nFlynn was posthumously awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture and television industries in 1960.\nEarly life.\nErrol Leslie Thomson Flynn was born on 20 June 1909 at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point, Tasmania. His father, Theodore Thomson Flynn, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of marine biology and zoology at the University of Tasmania and Queen's University of Belfast, where he served as the Chair of Zoology. His father was the first biology professor in Tasmania. His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but shortly after marrying Theodore at St John's Church of England, Birchgrove, Sydney, on 23 January 1909, she changed her first name to Marelle. Flynn had a younger sister, Nora Rosemary Flynn (1919-1981). Flynn described his mother's family as \"seafaring folk\" and this appears to be where his lifelong interest in boats and the sea originated. Both of his parents were Australian-born of Irish, English and Scottish descent. Despite Flynn's claims, the evidence indicates that he was not descended from any of the \"Bounty\" mutineers.\nFlynn received his early schooling in Hobart. Future World Correspondence Chess Champion Cecil Purdy was one of his classmates. He attended The Hutchins School, Hobart College, The Friends School and Albuera Street Primary School and was expelled from each one. He made one of his first appearances as a performer in 1918, aged nine, when he served as a page boy to Enid Lyons in a queen carnival. In her memoirs, Lyons recalled Flynn as \"a dashing figure\u2014a handsome boy of nine with a fearless, somewhat haughty expression, already showing that sang-froid for which he was later to become famous throughout the civilised world\". She further noted: \"Unfortunately, Errol, at the age of nine, did not yet possess that magic for extracting money from the public which so distinguished his career as an actor. Our cause gained no apparent advantage from his presence in my entourage; we gained only third place in a field of seven.\"\nFrom 1923 to 1925, Flynn attended the South West London College, a private boarding school in Barnes, London. In 1926, he returned to Australia to attend Sydney Church of England Grammar School (known as \"Shore\"), where he was the classmate of a future Australian prime minister, John Gorton. His formal education ended with his expulsion from Shore for theft, although he later claimed it was for a sexual encounter with the school's laundress.\nAfter being dismissed from a job as a junior clerk with a Sydney shipping company for pilfering petty cash, he went to Papua New Guinea at the age of eighteen, seeking his fortune in tobacco planting and gold mining in the Morobe Goldfield. He spent the next five years oscillating between living in New Guinea and Sydney. In January 1931, Flynn became engaged to Naomi Campbell-Dibbs, the youngest daughter of Robert and Emily Hamlyn (Brown) Campbell-Dibbs of Temora and Bowral, New South Wales. They did not marry.\nEarly career.\n\"In the Wake of the Bounty\" (1933).\nAustralian filmmaker Charles Chauvel was making a film about the mutiny on the \"Bounty\", \"In the Wake of the Bounty\" (1933), a combination of dramatic re-enactments of the mutiny and a documentary on present-day Pitcairn Island. Chauvel was looking for someone to play the role of Fletcher Christian. There are different stories about the way Flynn was cast. According to one, Chauvel saw his picture in an article about a yacht wreck involving Flynn. The most popular account is that he was discovered by cast member John Warwick. The film was not a strong success at the box office, but Flynn was the lead role, leading him to travel to Britain in late 1933 to pursue a career in acting.\nBritain.\nFlynn got work as an extra in a film, \"I Adore You\" (1933), produced by Irving Asher for Warner Bros. He soon secured a job with the Northampton Repertory Company at the town's Royal Theatre (now part of Royal &amp; Derngate), where he worked and received his training as a professional actor for seven months. He performed at the 1934 Malvern Festival and in Glasgow, and briefly in London's West End.\nIn 1934, Flynn was dismissed from Northampton Rep. after he threw a female stage manager down a stairwell. He returned to London. Asher cast him as the lead in \"Murder at Monte Carlo\", a \"quota quickie\" made by Warner Brothers at their Teddington Studios in Middlesex. The movie was not widely seen (it is a lost film), but Asher was enthusiastic about Flynn's performance and cabled Warner Bros in Hollywood, recommending him for a contract. Executives agreed, and Flynn was sent to Los Angeles.\nHollywood.\nOn the ship from London, Flynn met (and eventually married) Lili Damita, an actress five years his senior whose contacts proved invaluable when Flynn arrived in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. publicity described him as an \"Irish leading man of the London stage\".\nHis first appearance was a small role in \"The Case of the Curious Bride\" (1935). Flynn had two scenes, one as a corpse and one in flashback. His next part was slightly bigger, in \"Don't Bet on Blondes\" (1935), a B-picture screwball comedy.\n\"Captain Blood\" and stardom.\nWarner Bros. was preparing a big-budget swashbuckler, \"Captain Blood\" (1935), based on the 1922 novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz.\nThe studio originally intended to cast Robert Donat, but he turned down the part, afraid that his chronic asthma would make it impossible for him to perform the strenuous role. Warners considered a number of other actors, including Leslie Howard and James Cagney, and also conducted screen tests of those they had under contract, like Flynn. The tests were impressive, and Warners finally cast Flynn in the lead, opposite 19-year-old Olivia de Havilland. The resulting film was a magnificent success for the studio and gave birth to two new Hollywood stars and an on-screen partnership that would encompass eight films over six years. The budget for \"Captain Blood\" was $1.242 million, and it made $1.357 million in the U.S. and $1.733 million overseas, meaning a huge profit for Warner Bros.\nFlynn had been selected to support Fredric March in \"Anthony Adverse\" (1936), but public response to \"Captain Blood\" was so enthusiastic that Warners instead reunited him with de Havilland and Curtiz in another adventure tale, this time set during the Crimean War, \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1936). The film was given a slightly larger budget than \"Captain Blood\", at $1.33\u00a0million, and it had a much higher box-office gross, earning $1.454\u00a0million in the U.S. and $1.928\u00a0million overseas, making it Warner Bros.' No. 1 hit of 1936.\nFlynn asked for a different kind of role, so when ill health made Leslie Howard drop out of the screen adaptation of Lloyd C. Douglas' inspirational novel, Flynn got the lead role in \"Green Light\" (1937), playing a doctor searching for a cure for Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The studio then put him back into another swashbuckler, replacing Patric Knowles as Miles Hendon in \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (1937). He appeared opposite Kay Francis in \"Another Dawn\" (1937), a melodrama set in a mythical British desert colony. Warners then gave Flynn his first starring role in a modern comedy, \"The Perfect Specimen\" (1937), with Joan Blondell, under the direction of Curtiz. Meanwhile, Flynn published his first book, \"Beam Ends\" (1937), an autobiographical account of his experiences sailing around Australia as a youth. He also travelled to Spain, in 1937, as a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War, in which he sympathised with the Republicans.\n\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938).\nFlynn followed this with his most famous movie, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938), playing the title role, opposite de Havilland's Marian. This movie was a global success. It was the 6th-top movie grosser of 1938. It was also the studio's first large-budget colour film using the three-strip Technicolor process. The budget for \"Robin Hood\" was the highest ever for a Warner Bros. production up to that point\u2014$2.47\u00a0million\u2014but it more than made back its costs and turned a huge profit as it grossed $2.343\u00a0million in the U.S. and $2.495\u00a0million overseas.\nIt also received lavish praise from critics and became a world favourite; in 2019, Rotten Tomatoes summarised the critical consensus: \"Errol Flynn thrills as the legendary title character, and the film embodies the type of imaginative family adventure tailor-made for the silver screen\". In 1995, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. Years later, in a 2005 interview, de Havilland described how, during the filming, she decided to tease Flynn, whose wife was on the set and watching closely. De Havilland said, \"And so we had one kissing scene, which I looked forward to with great delight. I remember I blew every take, at least six in a row, maybe seven, maybe eight, and we had to kiss all over again. And Errol Flynn got really rather uncomfortable, and he had, if I may say so, a little trouble with his tights.\"\nThe final duel between Robin and Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) is a classic, echoing the battle on the beach in \"Captain Blood\" where Flynn also kills Rathbone's character after a long demonstration of fine swordplay, in that case choreographed by Ralph Faulkner. According to Faulkner's student, Tex Allen, \"Faulkner had good material to work with. Veteran Basil Rathbone was a good fencer already, and Flynn, though new to the school of fence, was athletic and a quick learner\".\nThe success of \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" did little to convince the studio that their prize swashbuckler should be allowed to do other things, but Warners allowed Flynn to try a screwball comedy, \"Four's a Crowd\" (1938). Despite the presence of de Havilland and the direction of Curtiz, it was not a success. \"The Sisters\" (1938), a drama showing the lives of three sisters in the years from 1904 to 1908, including a dramatic rendering of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, was more popular. Flynn played alcoholic sports reporter Frank Medlin, who sweeps Louise Elliott (Bette Davis) off her feet on a visit to Silver Bow, Montana. Their married life in San Francisco is difficult, and Frank sails to Singapore just hours before the catastrophe. The original ending of the film was the same as the book: Louise married a character named William Benson, but preview audiences disliked the ending, and a new one was filmed in which Frank comes to Silver Bow to find her, and they reconcile. Apparently, audiences wanted Errol Flynn to \"get the girl\" or vice versa. (Bette Davis preferred the original ending.)\nFlynn had a powerful dramatic role in \"The Dawn Patrol\" (1938), a remake of a pre-code 1930 drama of the same title about Royal Flying Corps fighter pilots in World War I and the devastating burden carried by officers who must send men out to die every morning. Flynn and co-stars Basil Rathbone and David Niven led a cast that was all male and predominantly British. Director Edmund Goulding's biographer Matthew Kennedy wrote: \"Everyone remembered a set filled with fraternal good cheer... The filming of \"Dawn Patrol\" was an unusual experience for everyone connected with it, and dissipated for all time the legend that Britishers are lacking in a sense of humor... The picture was made to the accompaniment of more ribbing than Hollywood has ever witnessed. The setting for all this horseplay was the beautiful English manners of the cutterups. The expressions of polite and pained shock on the faces of Niven, Flynn, Rathbone et al., when (women) visitors were embarrassed was the best part of the nonsense.\"\nIn 1939, Flynn and de Havilland teamed up with Curtiz for \"Dodge City\" (1939), the first Western for both of them, set after the U.S. Civil War. Flynn was worried that audiences would not accept him in Westerns, but the film was Warner's most popular film of 1939, and he went on to make a number of movies in that genre.\nSecond World War.\nFlynn was reunited with Davis, Curtiz and de Havilland in \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\" (1939), playing Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Flynn's relationship with Davis during filming was quarrelsome; Davis allegedly slapped him across the face far harder than necessary during one scene. Flynn attributed her anger to unrequited romantic interest, but according to others, Davis resented sharing equal billing with a man she considered incapable of playing any role beyond a dashing adventurer. \"He himself openly said, 'I don't know really anything about acting,'\" she told an interviewer, \"and I admire his honesty because he's absolutely right.\" Years later, however, de Havilland said that during a private screening of \"Elizabeth and Essex\", an astounded Davis had exclaimed, \"Damn it! The man \"could\" act!\"\nWarners put Flynn in another Western, \"Virginia City\" (1940), set near the end of the Civil War. Flynn played Union officer Kerry Bradford. In an article for TCM, Jeremy Arnold wrote: \"Ironically, the Randolph Scott role [as Captain Vance Irby, commandant of the prison camp where Bradford was a prisoner of war] was originally conceived for Flynn... In fact, \"Virginia City\" was plagued with script, production and personnel problems all along. Shooting began without a finished script, angering Flynn, who complained unsuccessfully to the studio about it. Flynn disliked the temperamental Curtiz and tried to have him removed from the film. Curtiz didn't like Flynn (or co-star Miriam Hopkins) either. Humphrey Bogart apparently did not care for Flynn or Randolph Scott. Making matters worse was the steady rain that fell for two of the three weeks of location shooting near Flagstaff, Arizona. Flynn detested rain and was physically unwell for quite some time because of it. As Peter Valenti has written, \"Errol's frustration at the role can be easily understood: he changed from antagonist to protagonist, from Southern to Northern officer, almost as the film was being shot. [This] intensified Errol's feelings of inadequacy as a performer and his contempt for studio operation\". Despite the troubles behind the scenes, the film was a huge success, making a profit of just under $1\u00a0million.\nFlynn's next film had been planned since 1936: another swashbuckler taken from a Sabatini novel, \"The Sea Hawk\" (1940), but only the title was used. A reviewer observed in \"Time\" 19 August 1940, \"\"The Sea Hawk\" (Warner) is 1940's lustiest assault on the double feature. It cost $1,700,000 and exhibits Errol Flynn and 3,000 other cinema actors performing every imaginable feat of spectacular derring-do, and lasts two hours and seven minutes... Produced by Warner's Hal Wallis with a splendour that would set parsimonious Queen Bess's teeth on edge, constructed of the most tried-and-true cinema materials available, \"The Sea Hawk\" is a handsome, shipshape picture. To Irish [\"sic\"] Cinemactor Errol Flynn, it gives the best swashbuckling role he has had since Captain Blood. For Hungarian Director Michael Curtiz, who took Flynn from bit-player ranks to make \"Captain Blood\" and has made nine pictures with him since, it should prove a high point in their profitable relationship.\" It was not, but \"The Sea Hawk\" made a profit of $977,000 on that budget of $1.7\u00a0million.\nAnother financial success was the Western \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940), with de Havilland and Ronald Reagan and directed by Curtiz, which grossed $2,147,663 in the U.S., making it Warner Brothers' second-biggest hit of 1940. At the zenith of his career, Flynn was voted the fourteenth most popular star in the U.S. and the seventh most popular in Britain according to \"Motion Picture Daily\". According to \"Variety\", he was the fourth-biggest star in the U.S. and the fourth-biggest box-office attraction overseas as well.\nFlynn consistently ranked among Warner Bros.'s top stars. In 1937, he was the studio's No. 1 star, ahead of Paul Muni and Bette Davis. In 1938, he was No. 3, just behind Davis and Muni. In 1939, he was No. 3 again, this time behind Davis and James Cagney. In 1940 and 1941, he was Warner Bros.'s No. 1 top box-office draw. In 1942, he was No. 2, behind Cagney. In 1943, he was No. 2, behind Humphrey Bogart. Warners allowed Flynn a change of pace from a long string of period pieces in a light-hearted mystery, \"Footsteps in the Dark\" (1941). \"Los Angeles Times\"' Edwin Schallert wrote: \"Errol Flynn becomes a modern for a change in a whodunit film and the excursion proves eminently worth-while... an exceptionally clever and amusing exhibit ...\" The film was not a big success; far more popular was the military drama \"Dive Bomber\" (1941), his last film with Curtiz.\nIn later years, \"Footsteps in the Dark\" co-star Ralph Bellamy recalled Flynn at this time as \"a darling. Couldn't or wouldn't take himself seriously. And he drank like there was no tomorrow. Had a bum ticker from the malaria he'd picked up in Australia. Also, a spot of TB. Tried to enlist but flunked his medical, so he drank some more. Knew he wouldn't live into old age. He really had a ball in \"Footsteps in the Dark\". He was so glad to be out of swashbucklers\".\nFlynn became a naturalised American citizen on 14 August 1942. With the United States fully involved in the Second World War, he attempted to enlist in the armed services but failed the physical exam due to recurrent malaria (contracted in New Guinea), a heart murmur, various venereal diseases and latent pulmonary tuberculosis. Flynn was mocked by reporters and critics as a \"draft dodger\" because the studio refused to admit that their star, promoted for his physical beauty and athleticism, had been disqualified due to health problems.\nFlynn started a new long-term relationship with a director when he teamed with Raoul Walsh in \"They Died with Their Boots On\" (1942), a biopic of George Armstrong Custer. De Havilland was his co-star in this, the last of eight films they made together. The movie grossed $2.55\u00a0million in the U.S. alone, making it Warner Bros.' second-biggest hit of 1942. Flynn's first World War II film was \"Desperate Journey\" (1942), directed by Walsh, in which he played an Australian for the first time. It was another big hit.\nThe role of Gentleman Jim Corbett in Walsh's \"Gentleman Jim\" (1942) was one of Flynn's favourites. Warner Bros. purchased the rights to make a film of Corbett's life from his widow, Vera, specifically for their handsome, athletic and charming leading man. The movie bears little resemblance to the boxer's life, but the story was a crowd-pleaser. Despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014its departure from reality, \"Gentleman Jim\" packed the theatres. According to \"Variety\", it was the third Errol Flynn movie to gross at least $2 million for Warner Bros. in 1942.\nFlynn eagerly undertook extensive boxing training for this film, working with Buster Wiles and Mushy Callahan. Callahan's remembrances were documented in Charles Higham's \"\". \"Errol tended to use his right fist. I had to teach him to use his left and to move very fast on his feet...Luckily, he had excellent footwork, he was dodgy, [and] he could duck faster than anybody I saw. And by the time I was through with him, he'd jab, jab, jab with his left like a veteran\".\nFlynn took the role seriously and was rarely doubled during the boxing sequences. In \"The Two Lives of Errol Flynn\" by Michael Freedland, Alexis Smith told of taking the star aside: \"'It's so silly, working all day and then playing all night and dissipating yourself. Don't you want to live a long life?' Errol was his usually apparently unconcerned self: 'I'm only interested in this half,' he told her. 'I don't care for the future. '\" Flynn collapsed on set on 15 July 1942, while filming a boxing scene with Ward Bond. Filming was shut down while he recovered; he returned a week later. In his autobiography, \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\", Flynn describes the episode as a mild heart attack. In September 1942, Warners announced that Flynn had signed a new contract with the studio for four films a year, one of which he would also produce.\nIn \"Edge of Darkness\" (1943), set in Nazi-occupied Norway, Flynn played a Norwegian resistance fighter, a role originally intended for Edward G. Robinson. Director Lewis Milestone later recalled, \"Flynn kept underrating himself. If you wanted to embarrass him, all you had to do was to tell him how great he was in a scene he'd just finished playing: He'd blush like a young girl and muttering 'I'm no actor' would go away somewhere and sit down\". With a box office gross of $2.3 million in the U.S., it was Warner Bros.'s eighth-biggest movie of the year. In Warners' all-star musical comedy fund-raiser for the Stage Door Canteen, \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" (1943), Flynn sings and dances as a cockney seaman boasting to his pub mates of how he's won the war in \"That's What You Jolly Well Get\", the only musical number that was ever performed by Flynn on screen.\nStatutory rape charges.\nIn late 1942, two 17-year-old girls, Betty Hansen and Peggy Satterlee, separately accused Flynn of statutory rape at the Bel Air home of Flynn's friend Frederick McEvoy, and on board Flynn's yacht \"Sirocco\", respectively. The scandal received immense press attention. Many of Flynn's fans founded organisations to publicly protest the accusation. One such group, the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn\u2014ABCDEF\u2014accumulated a substantial membership that included William F. Buckley Jr.\nThe trial took place in late January and early February 1943. Satterlee testified that she had sex twice with Flynn aboard his boat when she was 15 years of age. Photographer Peter Stackpole, who joined Flynn's yacht cruise at Catalina Island on assignment for \"Life\" magazine, testified that Flynn and Satterlee spent hours together below decks, with the crew staying above, and that Satterlee was angry with Flynn and sullen afterward. Flynn denied everything, and blamed Stackpole's photography assignment for the presence of Satterlee on the yacht. Flynn's attorney, Jerry Giesler, impugned the accusers' character and morals and accused them of numerous indiscretions, including affairs with married men and, in Satterlee's case, an abortion (which was illegal at the time). He noted that the two girls, who said they did not know each other, filed their complaints within days of each other, although the episodes allegedly took place more than a year apart. He implied that the girls had cooperated with prosecutors in hopes of avoiding prosecution themselves.\nFlynn was acquitted, but the trial's widespread coverage and lurid overtones permanently damaged his carefully cultivated screen image as an idealised romantic leading player.\nAfter the trial.\n\"Northern Pursuit\" (1943), also with Walsh as director, was a war film set in Canada. He then made a film for his own production company, Thomson Productions, where he had a say in the choice of vehicle, director and cast, plus a portion of the profits. \"Uncertain Glory\" (1944), a war-time drama set in France with Flynn as a criminal who redeems himself, was not a success, earning only a modest gross of $1.5\u00a0million. Thomson Productions made no more movies. Still, Flynn earned $175,000 in 1943. With Walsh he made \"Objective, Burma!\" in 1944, released in 1945, a war film set during the Burma Campaign. Although popular, it was withdrawn in Britain after protests that the role played by British troops was not given sufficient credit. A Western, \"San Antonio\" (1945), was also very popular, grossing $3.553\u00a0million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.' third-biggest hit of the year.\nPost-war career.\nFlynn tried comedy again with \"Never Say Goodbye\" (1946), a comedy of remarriage opposite Eleanor Parker, but it was not a success, grossing $1.77\u00a0million in the U.S. In 1946, Flynn published an adventure novel, \"Showdown\", and earned a reported $184,000 (). \"Cry Wolf\" (1947) was a thriller with Flynn in a seemingly more villainous role. It was a moderate success at the box office. He was in a melodrama, \"Escape Me Never\" (1947), filmed in early 1946 but not released until late 1947, which lost money. More popular was a Western with Walsh and Ann Sheridan, \"Silver River\" (1948). This was a hit, although its high cost meant it was not very profitable. Flynn drank so heavily on the set that he was effectively disabled after noon-hour, and a disgusted Walsh terminated their business relationship. Warners tried returning Flynn to swashbucklers and the result was \"Adventures of Don Juan\" (1948). The film was very successful, becoming Warner Bros.' 4th-biggest hit of the year. As with some other Flynn films, it was more popular in Europe than the States, grossing $3.1\u00a0million there and $2.1\u00a0million in the U.S., with total earnings of $4.7\u00a0million on an approximate budget of $3.25\u00a0million. However, from this point on, Warner Bros. reduced the budgets of Flynn's films. In November 1947, Flynn signed a 15-year contract with Warner Bros. for $225,000 per film. His income totalled $214,000 that year, and $200,000 in 1948.\nLater Warner films.\nAfter a cameo in Warner Bros.' Technicolor musical comedy \"It's a Great Feeling\" (1949), Flynn was borrowed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in \"That Forsyte Woman\" (1949), which made $1.855\u00a0million in the U.S. and $1.842\u00a0million abroad which was the eleventh-biggest hit of the year for MGM. He went on a three-month holiday then made two medium-budget Westerns for Warners, \"Montana\" (1950), which made $2.1\u00a0million and was Warner Bros.' fifth-biggest movie of the year, and \"Rocky Mountain\" (1950), which made $1.7\u00a0million in the U.S. and was Warner Bros.' ninth-biggest movie of the year. He returned to MGM for \"Kim\" (1950), one of Flynn's most popular and profitable movies from this period, grossing $5.348\u00a0million ($2.896\u00a0million in the U.S. plus $2.452\u00a0million abroad, on a budget of $2.056\u00a0million) while making it MGM's fifth-biggest movie of the year by box office and eleventh biggest overall for Hollywood. It was shot partly in India. On his way home, he shot some scenes for a film he produced, \"Hello God\" (1951), directed by William Marshall; it was never released. For many years, this was considered a lost film, but in 2013, a copy was discovered in the basement of the surrogate court of New York City. Two of seven cans of the movie had deteriorated beyond hope, but five survived and were sent to the George Eastman House film archive for restoration.\nFlynn wrote and co-produced his next film, the low-budget \"Adventures of Captain Fabian\" (1951), directed by Marshall and shot in France. (Flynn wrote articles, novels and scripts but never had the discipline to turn it into a full-time career.) Flynn wound up suing Marshall over both movies. For Warners, he appeared in an adventure tale set in the Philippines, \"Mara Maru\" (1952). That studio released a documentary of a 1946 voyage he had taken on his yacht, \"Cruise of the Zaca\" (1952). In August 1951, he signed a one-picture deal to make a movie for Universal in exchange for a percentage of the profits: this was \"Against All Flags\" (1952), a popular swashbuckler. In 1952, he was seriously ill with hepatitis, resulting in liver damage. In England, he made another swashbuckler for Warners, \"The Master of Ballantrae\" (1953). After that, Warners ended their contract with him and their association that had lasted for 18 years and 35 films.\nEurope.\nFlynn relocated his career to Europe, starting with a swashbuckler in Italy, \"Crossed Swords\" (1954). This inspired him to produce a similar movie in that country, \"The Story of William Tell\" (1953), directed by Jack Cardiff with himself in the title role. The movie fell apart during production, was never finished, and ruined Flynn financially. Desperate for money, he accepted an offer from Herbert Wilcox to support Anna Neagle in a British musical, \"Lilacs in the Spring\" (1954). Also shot in Britain was \"The Dark Avenger\" (1955), for Allied Artists, in which Flynn played Edward, the Black Prince. Wilcox used him with Neagle again in \"King's Rhapsody\" (1955), but it was not a success, ending plans for further Wilcox-Flynn collaborations. In 1956 he presented and sometimes performed in the British-filmed television anthology series \"The Errol Flynn Theatre\".\nReturn to Hollywood.\nFlynn received an offer to make his first Hollywood film in five years: \"Istanbul\" (1957), for Universal, which was not well received. He made a thriller shot in Cuba, \"The Big Boodle\" (1957), then had his best role in a long time in the blockbuster Ernest Hemingway adaptation \"The Sun Also Rises\" (1957) for producer Darryl F. Zanuck, which made $3\u00a0million in the U.S. Flynn's performance in the latter was well received and led to a series of roles where he played to type, assaying drunks. Warner Bros. cast him as John Barrymore in \"Too Much, Too Soon\" (1958), and Zanuck used him again in \"The Roots of Heaven\" which made $3\u00a0million (1958). He met with Stanley Kubrick to discuss a role in \"Lolita\", but nothing came of it.\nFlynn went to Cuba in late 1958 to film the self-produced B film \"Cuban Rebel Girls\", where he met Fidel Castro and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Cuban Revolution. He wrote a series of newspaper and magazine articles for the \"New York Journal American\" and other publications documenting his time in Cuba with Castro. Flynn was the only journalist who happened to be with Castro the night Batista fled the country, and Castro learned of his victory in the revolution. Many of these pieces were lost until 2009 when they were rediscovered in a collection at the University of Texas at Austin's Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. He appeared in a short titled \"Cuban Story: The Truth About Fidel Castro Revolution\" (1959), his last-known work.\nPersonal life.\nLifestyle.\nFlynn developed a reputation for his womanising, hard drinking, chain smoking and, for a time in the 1940s, narcotics abuse. He was addicted to alcohol, tobacco, drugs and sex. He was linked romantically with Lupe V\u00e9lez. Carole Lombard is said to have resisted his advances but invited him to her extravagant parties. He was a regular attendee of William Randolph Hearst's equally lavish affairs at Hearst Castle, though he was once asked to leave after becoming excessively intoxicated.\nWhile Flynn acknowledged his personal attraction to Olivia de Havilland, assertions by film historians that they were romantically involved during the filming of \"Robin Hood\" were denied by de Havilland. \"Yes, we did fall in love, and I believe that this is evident in the screen chemistry between us\", she told an interviewer in 2009. \"But his circumstances [Flynn's marriage to Damita] at the time prevented the relationship going further. I have not talked about it a great deal but the relationship was not consummated. Chemistry was there, though. It was there.\"\nThe expression \"in like Flynn\" is said to have been coined to refer to the supreme ease with which he reputedly seduced women, but its origin is disputed. Flynn was reportedly fond of the expression and later claimed that he wanted to call his memoir \"In Like Me\". The publisher insisted on a more lurid title, \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\".\nFlynn had various mirrors and hiding places constructed inside his mansion, including an overhead trapdoor above a guest bedroom for surreptitious viewing. Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood toured the house as a prospective buyer in the 1970s and reported, \"Errol had two-way mirrors... speaker systems in the ladies' room. Not for security. Just that he was an A-1 voyeur.\" In March 1955, the popular Hollywood gossip magazine \"Confidential\" ran a salacious article titled \"The Greatest Show in Town... Errol Flynn and His Two-Way Mirror!\" In her 1966 biography, actress Hedy Lamarr wrote, \"Many of the bathrooms have peepholes or ceilings with squares of opaque glass through which you can't see out but someone can see in.\"\nFlynn had a Schnauzer dog named Arno, which was specially trained to protect him. They went together to premieres, parties, restaurants and clubs until the dog's death in 1941. On 15 June 1938, during filming, Arno bit Bette Davis on the ankle in a scene where she struck Flynn.\nMarriages and family.\nFlynn was married three times: to actress Lili Damita from 1935 until 1942 (one son, Sean Flynn, born 1941); to Nora Eddington from 1943 to 1949 (two daughters, Deirdre, born 1945, and Rory, born 1947); and to actress Patrice Wymore from 1950 until his death in 1959 (one daughter, Arnella Roma, born 1953). He is the maternal grandfather to actor Sean Flynn, through his daughter Rory, who starred in the TV series \"Zoey 101\".\nAfter quitting Hollywood, Flynn lived with Wymore in Port Antonio, Jamaica in the early 1950s. He was largely responsible for developing tourism in this area and, for a while, owned a hotel there. He popularised trips down rivers on bamboo rafts.\nFlynn's son, Sean Flynn, was an actor and war correspondent who disappeared in Cambodia in April 1970 during the Vietnam War. Sean and a colleague, Dana Stone, were working as freelance photojournalists for \"Time\" magazine. Neither man's body has ever been found; it is generally assumed that they were killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in 1970 or 1971. After a decade-long search financed by his mother, Sean was officially declared dead in 1984. Sean's life is recounted in the book \"Inherited Risk: Errol and Sean Flynn in Hollywood and Vietnam\".\nDeath.\nBy 1959, Flynn's financial difficulties had become so serious that he flew on 9 October to Vancouver, British Columbia, to negotiate the lease of his yacht \"Zaca\" to the businessman George Caldough. As Caldough was driving Flynn and the 17-year-old actress Beverly Aadland, who had accompanied him on the trip, to the airport on 14 October for a Los Angeles-bound flight, Flynn began complaining of severe pain in his back and legs. Caldough transported him to the residence of a doctor, Grant Gould, who noted that Flynn had considerable difficulty navigating the building's stairway. Gould, assuming that the pain was due to degenerative disc disease and spinal osteoarthritis, administered 50 milligrams of Demerol (pethidine) intravenously. As Flynn's discomfort diminished, he \"reminisced at great length about his past experiences\" to those present. He refused a drink when offered it.\nGould then performed a leg massage in the apartment's bedroom and advised Flynn to rest there before resuming his journey. Flynn responded that he felt \"ever so much better.\" After 20\u00a0minutes Aadland checked on Flynn and discovered him unresponsive. Despite immediate emergency medical treatment from Gould and a swift transfer by ambulance to Vancouver General Hospital, he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead that evening. The coroner's report and the death certificate noted the cause of death as a myocardial infarction (heart attack) due to coronary thrombosis and coronary atherosclerosis, with fatty degeneration of liver and partial cirrhosis of the liver significant enough to be listed as contributing factors. After his death, genital warts were reported to have been removed in previous medical treatment. Flynn was survived by his son and both his parents.\nFlynn was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, with six bottles of his favourite whisky.\nHonors.\nIn recognition for his contributions to the motion pictures and television industry, Flynn was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. The star for motion pictures is located at 6654 Hollywood Boulevard and the star awarded for television is located at 7008 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood, California.\nThere is a street named after Flynn in San Antonio, Texas.\nPosthumous controversies.\nIn a 1969 interview, his daughter Deirdre said that at the time of his death more than a dozen creditors demanded payment for sums owed by Flynn years earlier. The estate had not yet been settled in 1969, and that she and her sister Rory received a \"little money,\" proceeds from an insurance policy, and $30,000. As of 1969 his grave at Forest Lawn Memorial Park was unmarked as no headstone had yet been provided.\nIn a 1982 interview with \"Penthouse\" magazine, Ronald DeWolf, son of the author L. Ron Hubbard said that his father's friendship with Flynn was so strong that Hubbard's family considered Flynn an adoptive father to DeWolf. He said that Flynn and his father engaged in illegal activities together, including drug smuggling and sexual acts with underage girls, but that Flynn never joined Scientology, Hubbard's movement.\nJournalist George Seldes, who disliked Flynn intensely, wrote in his 1987 memoir that Flynn did not travel to Spain in 1937 to report on its civil war as announced or to deliver cash, medicine, supplies and food for the Republican soldiers, as promised. His purpose, according to Seldes, was to perpetrate a hoax that he triggered by sending an \"apparently harmless\" telegram from Madrid to Paris. The following day, American newspapers published an erroneous report that Flynn had been killed at the Spanish front. \"The next day he left Spain\u00a0...\u00a0. There were no ambulances, no medical supplies, no food for the Spanish Republic, and not one cent of money. The war correspondents said bitterly that it was the cruellest hoax of the time,\" Seldes wrote. \"Flynn... had used a terrible war just to advertise one of his cheap movies.\"\nRelationship with Beverly Aadland.\nIn 1961, Beverly Aadland's mother, Florence, co-wrote \"The Big Love\" with Tedd Thomey, alleging that Flynn had been involved in a sexual relationship with her daughter, who was 15 when it began. The memoir was adapted in 1991 by Jay Presson Allen and her daughter Brooke Allen into a one-woman play, \"The Big Love\", which starred Tracey Ullman as Florence Aadland in its New York premiere.\nIn 1996, Beverly Aadland gave an interview to Britain's Channel 4 documentary series \"Secret Lives\" corroborating the sexual relationship and claiming that the first time she and Flynn had sex, he had \"forced himself\" on her. She also said she loved him and wished they had more time together. \"I was very lucky. He could have had any woman he wanted. Why it was me, I have no idea. Never will.\"\nCharles Higham biography.\nIn 1980, author Charles Higham wrote a highly controversial biography, \"Errol Flynn: The Untold Story\", alleging that Flynn was a fascist sympathiser who spied for the Nazis before and during the Second World War and that he was bisexual and had multiple same-sex affairs. He claimed Flynn had arranged to have \"Dive Bomber\" filmed on location at the San Diego Naval Base for the benefit of Japanese military planners, who needed information on American warships and defence installations. Higham admitted that he had no evidence that Flynn was a German agent, but said he had \"pieced together a mosaic that proves that he is\". Flynn's friend David Niven criticised Higham for his unfounded accusations. In his autobiography, \"Iron Eyes Cody: My Life As A Hollywood Indian\", Iron Eyes Cody also trashed Higham's book and described Flynn as \"super straight\". The review of the Higham book in the \"New York Times Book Review\" accused Higham of \"shoddy reporting.\" \nSubsequent Flynn biographers are critical of Higham's allegations, and have found no evidence to corroborate them. Lincoln Hurst reported that Flynn attempted to join the OSS in 1942 and was put under surveillance by the FBI, which uncovered no subversive activities. Tony Thomas and Buster Wiles accused Higham of altering FBI documents to substantiate his claims. In 1981, Flynn's daughters, Rory and Deirdre, hired Melvin Belli to sue Higham and his publisher Doubleday for libel. The suit was dismissed on the grounds that a deceased person cannot, by definition, be libelled. In 2000, Higham repeated his claim that Flynn had been a German agent, citing corroboration from Anne Lane, secretary to MI5 chief Sir Percy Sillitoe from 1946 to 1951 and the person responsible for maintaining Flynn's British intelligence service file. Higham acknowledged that he never saw the file itself and was unable to secure official confirmation of its existence.\nSelect radio performances.\nFlynn appeared in numerous radio performances:\nStage performances.\nFlynn appeared on stage in a number of performances, particularly early in his career:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67031", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67031", "title": "Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act", "text": "2002 U.S. law regarding corporate accounting\nThe Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002 is a United States federal law that mandates certain practices in financial record keeping and reporting for corporations. The act, Pub. L.\u00a0, 116\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://, enacted , also known as the \"Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act\" (in the Senate) and \"Corporate and Auditing Accountability, Responsibility, and Transparency Act\" (in the House) and more commonly called Sarbanes\u2013Oxley, SOX or Sarbox, contains eleven sections that place requirements on all American public company boards of directors and management and public accounting firms. A number of provisions of the Act also apply to privately held companies, such as the willful destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation.\nThe law was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, including Enron and WorldCom. The sections of the bill cover responsibilities of a public corporation's board of directors, add criminal penalties for certain misconduct, and require the Securities and Exchange Commission to create regulations to define how public corporations are to comply with the law.\nBackground.\nIn 2002, Sarbanes\u2013Oxley was named after bill sponsors U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) and U.S. Representative Michael G. Oxley (R-OH). To be \"SOX compliant,\" top management must individually certify the accuracy of financial information. In addition, penalties for fraudulent financial activity are much more severe. The act increased the oversight role of boards of directors and the independence of the outside auditors who review the accuracy of corporate financial statements.\nThe bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, including those affecting Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems, and WorldCom. These scandals cost investors billions of dollars when the share prices of affected companies collapsed, and shook public confidence in the US securities markets.\nThe act contains eleven titles, or sections, ranging from additional corporate board responsibilities to criminal penalties, and requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement rulings on requirements to comply with the law. Harvey Pitt, the 26th chairman of the SEC, led the SEC in the adoption of dozens of rules to implement the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act. It created a new, quasi-public agency, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), charged with overseeing, regulating, inspecting, and disciplining accounting firms in their roles as auditors of public companies. The act also covers issues such as auditor independence, corporate governance, internal control assessment, and enhanced financial disclosure. The nonprofit arm of Financial Executives International, Financial Executives Research Foundation, completed extensive research studies to help support the foundations of the act.\nThe act was approved in the House by a vote of https:// and in the Senate with a vote of https://. President George W. Bush signed it into law, stating it included \"the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The era of low standards and false profits is over; no boardroom in America is above or beyond the law.\"\nIn response to the perception that stricter financial governance laws are needed, SOX-type regulations were subsequently enacted in Canada (2002), Germany (2002), South Africa (2002), France (2003), Australia (2004), India (2005), Japan (2006), Italy (2006), Israel, and Turkey. (See Similar laws in other countries below.)\nDebates continued as of 2007 over the perceived benefits and costs of SOX. Opponents of the bill have claimed it has reduced America's international competitive edge because it has introduced an overly complex regulatory environment into US financial markets. A study commissioned by then New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York Senator Chuck Schumer cited this as one reason America's financial sector is losing market share to other financial centers worldwide. Proponents of the measure said that SOX has been a \"godsend\" for improving the confidence of fund managers and other investors with regard to the veracity of corporate financial statements.\nThe 10th anniversary of SOX coincided with the passing of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, designed to give emerging companies an economic boost, and cutting back on a number of regulatory requirements.\nHistory and context.\nA variety of complex factors created the conditions and culture in which a series of large corporate frauds occurred between 2000 and 2002. The spectacular, highly publicized frauds at Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco exposed significant problems with conflicts of interest and incentive compensation practices. The analysis of their complex and contentious root causes contributed to the passage of SOX in 2002. In a 2004 interview, Senator Paul Sarbanes stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Senate Banking Committee undertook a series of hearings on the problems in the markets that had led to a loss of hundreds and hundreds of billions, indeed trillions of dollars in market value. The hearings set out to lay the foundation for legislation. We scheduled 10 hearings over a six-week period, during which we brought in some of the best people in the country to testify ... The hearings produced remarkable consensus on the nature of the problems: inadequate oversight of accountants, lack of auditor independence, weak corporate governance procedures, stock analysts' conflict of interests, inadequate disclosure provisions, and grossly inadequate funding of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTimeline and passage.\nThe House passed Rep. Oxley's bill (H.R. 3763) on April 24, 2002, by a vote of 334 to 90. The House then referred the \"Corporate and Auditing Accountability, Responsibility, and Transparency Act\" or \"CAARTA\" to the Senate Banking Committee with the support of President George W. Bush and the SEC. At the time, however, the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), was preparing his own proposal, Senate Bill 2673.\nSenator Sarbanes's bill passed the Senate Banking Committee on June 18, 2002, by a vote of 17 to 4. On June 25, 2002, WorldCom revealed it had overstated its earnings by more than $3.8 billion during the past five quarters (15 months), primarily by improperly accounting for its operating costs. Senator Sarbanes introduced Senate Bill 2673 to the full Senate that same day, and it passed 97\u20130 less than three weeks later on July 15, 2002.\nThe House and the Senate formed a Conference Committee to reconcile the differences between Sen. Sarbanes's bill (S. 2673) and Rep. Oxley's bill (H.R. 3763). The conference committee relied heavily on S. 2673 and \"most changes made by the conference committee strengthened the prescriptions of S. 2673 or added new prescriptions.\"\nThe Committee approved the final conference bill on July 24, 2002, and gave it the name \"the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002\". The next day, both houses of Congress voted on it without change, producing an overwhelming margin of victory: 423 to 3 in the House; and 99 to 0 in the Senate.\nOn July 30, 2002, President George W. Bush signed it into law, stating it included \"the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt\".\nAnalyzing the cost-benefits of Sarbanes\u2013Oxley.\nA significant body of academic research and opinion exists regarding the costs and benefits of SOX compliance, with significant differences in conclusions. This is due in part to the difficulty of isolating the impact of SOX from other variables affecting the stock market and corporate earnings. Section 404 of the act, which requires management and the external auditor to report on the adequacy of a company's internal control on financial reporting, is often singled out for analysis.\nAccording to a 2019 study in \"the Journal of Law and Economics\", \"We find a large decline in the average voting premium of US dual-class firms targeted by major SOX provisions that enhance boards' independence, improve internal controls, and increase litigation risks. The targeted firms also improve the efficiency of investment, cash management, and chief executive officers' compensation relative to firms not targeted by SOX. Overall, the evidence suggests that SOX is effective in curbing the private benefits of control.\"\nEffects on exchange listing choice of non-American companies.\nSome have asserted that Sarbanes\u2013Oxley legislation has helped displace business from New York to London, where the Financial Conduct Authority regulates the financial sector with a lighter touch. In the UK, the non-statutory Combined Code of Corporate Governance plays a somewhat similar role to SOX. See Howell E. Jackson &amp; Mark J. Roe, \"Public Enforcement of Securities Laws: Preliminary Evidence\" (Working Paper January 16, 2007). London based Alternative Investment Market claims that its spectacular growth in listings almost entirely coincided with the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley legislation. In December 2006, Michael Bloomberg, New York's mayor, and Chuck Schumer, U.S. senator from New York, expressed their concern.\nThe Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act's effect on non-U.S. companies cross-listed in the U.S. is different on firms from developed and well regulated countries than on firms from less developed countries according to Kate Litvak. Companies from badly regulated countries see benefits that are higher than the costs from better credit ratings by complying to regulations in a highly regulated country (USA), but companies from developed countries only incur the costs, since transparency is adequate in their home countries as well. On the other hand, the benefit of better credit rating also comes with listing on other stock exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange.\nPiotroski and Srinivasan (2008) examine a comprehensive sample of international companies that list onto U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges before and after the enactment of the Act in 2002. Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K. exchanges from 1995 to 2006, they find that the listing preferences of large foreign firms choosing between U.S. exchanges and the LSE's Main Market did not change following SOX. In contrast, they find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms choosing between the Nasdaq and LSE's Alternative Investment Market decreased following SOX. The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance. The screening of smaller firms with weaker governance attributes from U.S. exchanges is consistent with the heightened governance costs imposed by the Act increasing the bonding-related benefits of a U.S. listing.\nImplementation of key provisions.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Section 302: Disclosure controls.\nUnder Sarbanes\u2013Oxley, two separate sections came into effect\u2014one civil and the other criminal. \u00a0https:// (Section 302) (civil provision); \u00a0https:// (Section 906) (criminal provision).\nSection 302 of the Act mandates a set of internal procedures designed to ensure accurate financial disclosure. The signing officers must certify that they are \"responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls\" and \"have designed such internal controls to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to such officers by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the periodic reports are being prepared\". \u00a0https://. The officers must \"have evaluated the effectiveness of the company's internal controls as of a date within 90 days prior to the report\" and \"have presented in the report their conclusions about the effectiveness of their internal controls based on their evaluation as of that date\". \"Id.\".\nThe SEC interpreted the intention of Sec. 302 in Final Rule 33\u20138124. In it, the SEC defines the new term \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" which are distinct from \"internal controls over financial reporting\". Under both Section 302 and Section 404, Congress directed the SEC to promulgate regulations enforcing these provisions.\nExternal auditors are required to issue an opinion on whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects by management. This is in addition to the financial statement opinion regarding the accuracy of the financial statements. The requirement to issue a third opinion regarding management's assessment was removed in 2007.\nA \"Lord &amp; Benoit\" report, titled \"Bridging the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Disclosure Control Gap\", was filed with the SEC Subcommittee on internal controls which reported that those companies with ineffective internal controls, the expected rate of full and accurate disclosure under Section 302 will range between 8 and 15 percent. A full 9 out of every 10 companies with ineffective Section 404 controls self reported effective Section 302 controls in the same period end that an adverse Section 404 was reported, 90% in accurate without a Section 404 audit.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Section 303: Improper influence on the conduct of audits.\na. Rules To Prohibit. It shall be unlawful, in contravention of such rules or regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, for any officer or director of an issuer, or any other person acting under the direction thereof, to take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead any independent public or certified accountant engaged in the performance of an audit of the financial statements of that issuer for the purpose of rendering such financial statements materially misleading.\nb. Enforcement. In any civil proceeding, the Commission shall have exclusive authority to enforce this section and any rule or regulation issued under this section.\nc. No Preemption of Other Law. The provisions of subsection (a) shall be in addition to, and shall not supersede or preempt, any other provision of law or any rule or regulation issued thereunder.\nd. Deadline for Rulemaking. The Commission shall\u20141. propose the rules or regulations required by this section, not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n2. issue final rules or regulations required by this section, not later than 270 days after that date of enactment.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Section 401: Disclosures in periodic reports (Off-balance sheet items).\nThe bankruptcy of Enron drew attention to off-balance sheet instruments that were used fraudulently. During 2010, the court examiner's review of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy also brought these instruments back into focus, as Lehman had used an instrument called \"Repo 105\" to allegedly move assets and debt off-balance sheet to make its financial position look more favorable to investors. Sarbanes\u2013Oxley required the disclosure of all material off-balance sheet items. It also required an SEC study and report to better understand the extent of usage of such instruments and whether accounting principles adequately addressed these instruments; the SEC report was issued June 15, 2005. Interim guidance was issued in May 2006, which was later finalized. Critics argued the SEC did not take adequate steps to regulate and monitor this activity.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Section 404: Assessment of internal control.\nThe most contentious aspect of SOX is Section 404, which requires management and the external auditor to report on the adequacy of the company's internal control on financial reporting (ICFR). This is the most costly aspect of the legislation for companies to implement, as documenting and testing important financial manual and automated controls requires enormous effort.\nUnder Section 404 of the Act, management is required to produce an \"internal control report\" as part of each annual Exchange Act report. \"See\" \u00a0https://. The report must affirm \"the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting\". \u00a0https://. The report must also \"contain an assessment, as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of the Company, of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting\". To do this, managers are generally adopting an internal control framework such as that described in COSO.\nTo help alleviate the high costs of compliance, guidance and practice have continued to evolve. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) approved Auditing Standard No. 5 for public accounting firms on July 25, 2007. This standard superseded Auditing Standard No. 2, the initial guidance provided in 2004. The SEC also released its interpretive guidance on June 27, 2007. It is generally consistent with the PCAOB's guidance, but intended to provide guidance for management. Both management and the external auditor are responsible for performing their assessment in the context of a top-down risk assessment, which requires management to base both the scope of its assessment and evidence gathered on risk. This gives management wider discretion in its assessment approach. These two standards together require management to:\nSOX 404 compliance costs represent a tax on inefficiency, encouraging companies to centralize and automate their financial reporting systems. This is apparent in the comparative costs of companies with decentralized operations and systems, versus those with centralized, more efficient systems. For example, the 2007 Financial Executives International (FEI) survey indicated average compliance costs for decentralized companies were $1.9 million, while centralized company costs were $1.3 million. Costs of evaluating manual control procedures are dramatically reduced through automation.\nCorporate Implementation of Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Compliance.\nThe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) Report, as the framework became known, was the first-ever attempt in corporate America to establish a universal definition of Internal Controls, along with proposed guidelines for governance, independence and quality assurance. The initial implementation of a SOX compliance project is complex and burdensome on public companies planning to list or maintaining its listing. Full compliance requires an integrated enterprise-wide initiative. The success of the compliance project requires a triangulation of the resources of three executives, the CEO, CFO, and CIO and is usually facilitated by the project management office (PMO). The success of the compliance project depends on the proper \u201cmapping\u201d of information systems controls CoBIT (Control Objectives of Information and Its related Technology) to existing and new financial and operational controls as defined by the COSO Report.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley 404 and smaller public companies.\nThe cost of complying with SOX 404 impacts smaller companies disproportionately, as there is a significant fixed cost involved in completing the assessment. For example, during 2004 U.S. companies with revenues exceeding $5 billion spent 0.06% of revenue on SOX compliance, while companies with less than $100 million in revenue spent 2.55%.\nThis disparity is a focal point of 2007 SEC and U.S. Senate action. The PCAOB intends to issue further guidance to help companies scale their assessment based on company size and complexity during 2007. The SEC issued their guidance to management in June, 2007.\nAfter the SEC and PCAOB issued their guidance, the SEC required smaller public companies (non-accelerated filers) with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2007 to document a Management Assessment of their Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR). Outside auditors of non-accelerated filers however opine or test internal controls under PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) Auditing Standards for years ending after December 15, 2008. Another extension was granted by the SEC for the outside auditor assessment until years ending after December 15, 2009. The reason for the timing disparity was to address the House Committee on Small Business concern that the cost of complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002 was still unknown and could therefore be disproportionately high for smaller publicly held companies. On October 2, 2009, the SEC granted another extension for the outside auditor assessment until fiscal years ending after June 15, 2010. The SEC stated in their release that the extension was granted so that the SEC's Office of Economic Analysis could complete a study of whether additional guidance provided to company managers and auditors in 2007 was effective in reducing the costs of compliance. They also stated that there will be no further extensions in the future.\nOn September 15, 2010 the SEC issued final rule 33\u20139142 the permanently exempts registrants that are neither accelerated nor large accelerated filers as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 from Section 404(b) internal control audit requirement.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Section 802: Criminal penalties for influencing US Agency investigation/proper administration.\nSection 802(a) of the SOX, \u00a0https:// states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Section 806: Civil action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases.\nSection 806 of the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act, also known as the whistleblower-protection provision, prohibits any \"officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent\" of a publicly traded company from retaliating against \"an employee\" for disclosing reasonably perceived potential or actual violations of the six enumerated categories of protected conduct in Section 806 (securities fraud which includes insider trading and market manipulation, shareholder fraud, bank fraud, a violation of any SEC rule or regulation, mail fraud, or wire fraud). Section 806 prohibits a broad range of retaliatory adverse employment actions, including discharging, demoting, suspending, threatening, harassing, or in any other manner discriminating against a whistleblower. Recently a federal court of appeals held that merely \"outing\" or disclosing the identity of a whistleblower is actionable retaliation.\nRemedies under Section 806 include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFiling procedure.\nA claim under the anti-retaliation provision of the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act must be filed initially at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at the U.S. Department of Labor. OSHA will perform an investigation and if they conclude that the employer violated SOX, OSHA can order preliminary reinstatement. OSHA is required to dismiss the complaint if the complaint fails to make a \"prima facie\" showing that the protected activity was a \"contributing factor\" in the adverse employment action.\nSignificant \u00a7806 whistleblower decisions.\nIn the sixteen-year period from the passage of the Sarbanes Oxley Act in 2002 through December 31, 2018, a total of 1039 cases have been filed with the Department of Labor of which 62 were still pending before the Department of Labor as of January 1, 2019.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Section 906: Criminal Penalties for CEO/CFO financial statement certification.\n\u00a7 1350. Section 906 states: Failure of corporate officers to certify financial reports\n(a) Certification of Periodic Financial Reports.\u2014 Each periodic report containing financial statements filed by an issuer with the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m (a) or 78o (d)) shall be accompanied by a written statement by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer (or equivalent thereof) of the issuer.\n(b) Content.\u2014 The statement required under subsection (a) shall certify that the periodic report containing the financial statements fully complies with the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of [1] 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o (d)) and that information contained in the periodic report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer.\n(c) Criminal Penalties.\u2014 Whoever\u2014 \n(1) certifies any statement as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement does not comport with all the requirements set forth in this section shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; or\n(2) willfully certifies any statement as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement does not comport with all the requirements set forth in this section shall be fined not more than $5,000,000, or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley Section 1107: Criminal penalties for retaliation against whistleblowers.\nSection 1107 of the SOX \u00a0https:// states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whoever knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any federal offense, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\nClawbacks of executive compensation for misconduct.\nOne of the highlights of the law was a provision that allowed the SEC to force a company's CEO or CFO to disgorge any executive compensation (such as bonus pay or proceeds from stock sales) earned within a year of misconduct that results in an earnings restatement. However, according to Gretchen Morgenson of \"The New York Times\", such clawbacks have actually been rare, due in part to the requirement that the misconduct must be either deliberate or reckless. The SEC did not attempt to claw back any executive compensation until 2007, and as of December 2013 had only brought 31 cases, 13 of which were begun after 2010. However, according to Dan Whalen of the accounting research firm Audit Analytics, the threat of clawbacks, and the time-consuming litigation associated with them, has forced companies to tighten their financial reporting standards.\nCriticism.\nCongressman Ron Paul and others such as former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee have contended that SOX was an unnecessary and costly government intrusion into corporate management that places U.S. corporations at a competitive disadvantage with foreign firms, driving businesses out of the United States. In an April 14, 2005 speech before the U.S. House of Representatives, Paul stated\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These regulations are damaging American capital markets by providing an incentive for small US firms and foreign firms to deregister from US stock exchanges. According to a study by a researcher at the Wharton Business School, the number of American companies deregistering from public stock exchanges nearly tripled during the year after Sarbanes\u2013Oxley became law, while the New York Stock Exchange had only 10 new foreign listings in all of 2004. The reluctance of small businesses and foreign firms to register on American stock exchanges is easily understood when one considers the costs Sarbanes\u2013Oxley imposes on businesses. According to a survey by Korn/Ferry International, Sarbanes\u2013Oxley cost Fortune 500 companies an average of $5.1 million in compliance expenses in 2004, while a study by the law firm of Foley and Lardner found the Act increased costs associated with being a publicly held company by 130 percent.\nA research study published by Joseph Piotroski of Stanford University and Suraj Srinivasan of Harvard Business School titled \"Regulation and Bonding: Sarbanes Oxley Act and the Flow of International Listings\" in the Journal of Accounting Research in 2008 found that following the act's passage, smaller international companies were more likely to list in stock exchanges in the U.K. rather than U.S. stock exchanges.\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, critics blamed Sarbanes\u2013Oxley for the low number of initial public offerings (IPOs) on American stock exchanges during 2008. In November 2008, Newt Gingrich and co-author David W. Kralik called on Congress to repeal Sarbanes\u2013Oxley.\nA 2012 \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial stated,One reason the U.S. economy isn't creating enough jobs is that it's not creating enough employers ... For the third year in a row the world's leading exchange for new stock offerings was located not in New York, but in Hong Kong ... Given that the U.S. is still home to the world's largest economy, there's no reason it shouldn't have the most vibrant equity markets\u2014unless regulation is holding back the creation of new public companies. On that score it's getting harder for backers of the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley accounting law to explain away each disappointing year since its 2002 enactment as some kind of temporary or unrelated setback.\nPraise.\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan praised the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act in 2005: \"I am surprised that the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act, so rapidly developed and enacted, has functioned as well as it has ... the act importantly reinforced the principle that shareholders own our corporations and that corporate managers should be working on behalf of shareholders to allocate business resources to their optimum use.\"\nSOX has been praised by a cross-section of financial industry experts, citing improved investor confidence and more accurate, reliable financial statements. The CEO and CFO are now required to unequivocally take ownership for their financial statements under Section 302, which was not the case prior to SOX. Further, auditor conflicts of interest have been addressed, by prohibiting auditors from also having lucrative consulting agreements with the firms they audit under Section 201. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox stated in 2007: \"Sarbanes\u2013Oxley helped restore trust in U.S. markets by increasing accountability, speeding up reporting, and making audits more independent.\"\nThe 2007 FEI study and research by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) also indicate SOX has improved investor confidence in financial reporting, a primary objective of the legislation. The IIA study also indicated improvements in board, audit committee, and senior management engagement in financial reporting and improvements in financial controls.\nFinancial restatements increased significantly in the wake of the SOX legislation, as companies \"cleaned up\" their books. Glass, Lewis &amp; Co. LLC is a San Francisco-based firm that tracks the volume of do-overs by public companies. Its March 2006 report, \"Getting It Wrong the First Time,\" shows 1,295 restatements of financial earnings in 2005 for companies listed on U.S. securities markets, almost twice the number for 2004. \"That's about one restatement for every 12 public companies\u2014up from one for every 23 in 2004,\" says the report.\nA fraud documented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 2009, validated whistleblower allegations first logged in 2005. may be directly credited to Sarbanes\u2013Oxley. The fraud, which spanned nearly 20 years and involved over $24 million, was committed by Value Line (Nasdaq:\u00a0https://) against its mutual fund shareholders. The fraud was first reported to the SEC in 2004 by the then Value Line Fund (Nasdaq:\u00a0https://) portfolio manager and Chief Quantitative Strategist, Mr. John (Jack) R. Dempsey of Easton, Connecticut, who was required to sign a Code of Business Ethics as part of SOX. Restitution totaling $34 million was placed in a fair fund and returned to the affected Value Line mutual fund investors. The Commission ordered Value Line to pay a total of $43,705,765 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalty, and ordered Buttner, CEO and Henigson, COO to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and $250,000, respectively. The Commission further imposed officer and director bars and broker-dealer, investment adviser, and investment company associational bars (\"Associational Bars\") against Buttner and Henigson. No criminal charges were filed.\nThe Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act has been praised for nurturing an ethical culture as it forces top management to be transparent and employees to be responsible for their acts whilst protecting whistleblowers. Indeed, courts have held that top management may be in violation of its obligation to assess and disclose material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting when it ignores an employee's concerns that could impact the company's SEC filings.\nLegal challenges.\nA lawsuit (\"Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\") was filed in 2006 challenging the constitutionality of the PCAOB. The complaint argues that because the PCAOB has regulatory powers over the accounting industry, its officers should be appointed by the President, rather than the SEC. Further, because the law lacks a \"severability clause,\" if part of the law is judged unconstitutional, so is the remainder. If the plaintiff prevails, the U.S. Congress may have to devise a different method of officer appointment. Further, the other parts of the law may be open to revision.\nThe lawsuit was dismissed from a District Court; the decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals on August 22, 2008. Judge Kavanaugh, in his dissent, argued strongly against the constitutionality of the law. On May 18, 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. On December 7, 2009, it heard the oral arguments. On June 28, 2010, the United States Supreme Court unanimously turned away a broad challenge to the law, but ruled 5\u20134 that a section related to appointments violates the Constitution's separation of powers mandate. The act remains \"fully operative as a law\" pending a process correction.\nIn its March 4, 2014 \"Lawson v. FMR LLC\" decision the United States Supreme Court rejected a narrow interpretation of the SOX whistleblower protection and instead held that the anti-retaliation protection that the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002 provided to whistleblowers applies also to employees of a public company's private contractors and subcontractors, including the attorneys and accountants who prepare the SEC filings of public companies. Subsequent interpretations of Lawson, however, suggest that the disclosures of a contractor's employee are protected only if those disclosures pertain to fraud perpetrated by a publicly traded company, as opposed to wrongdoing by a private contractor.\nIn its February 25, 2015 \"Yates v. United States\" decision the Supreme Court of the United States sided with Yates by reversing the previous judgement, with a plurality of the justices reading the Act to cover \"only objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world\". Justice Samuel Alito concurred in the judgment and noted that the statute's nouns and verbs only applies to filekeeping and not fish.\nForty percent of the rioters of the January 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol attack were charged with violating the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002. On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that found obstruction under the law was only intended to apply to more limited circumstances involving forms of evidence tampering and couldn't be used for broader prosecutions. The ruling was 6-3, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissenting and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson concurring with the majority.\nSarbanes\u2013Oxley reporting tools.\nClose scrutiny of corporate governance and greater responsibility placed on directors to vouch for the reports submitted to the SEC and other federal agencies, have resulted in the growth of software solutions aimed at reducing the complexity, time and expense involved in creating the reports. This trend accelerated in 2008 with the passage of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was launched on 12 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Katherine R. Keating, and commissioned on 29 April 1944.\nService history.\nWorld War II.\n\"Barbero\"'s war operations span the period from 9 August 1944\u2013 2 January 1945, during which she completed two war patrols. She is credited with sinking three Japanese merchant ships totaling 9,126 tons while patrolling in the Java and South China Seas.\n\"Barbero\" embarked on her first war patrol from Pearl Harbor on 9 August 1944. She reached her patrol area, located east of the central Philippines off San Bernardino Strait, on 24 August. Though she had been stationed there to report and to interdict any attempt by the Japanese to use the strait to contest the Allied invasion of the Palau Islands, they tried no such move. Moreover, during the 31 days that she spent in the area, she encountered no large target. The high point of the patrol came when \"Barbero\" lobbed 25 rounds at a radar station on Batag Island with her deck gun. Though she obtained no definite results, her failure to detect radar activity the following night prompted her claim to have neutralized the station. The submarine cleared the area on 24 September 1944 and headed for western Australia, concluding a disappointing 56-day patrol at Fremantle on 4 October.\nAfter refit and a brief training period, \"Barbero\" departed Fremantle on her second war patrol on 26 October. On this patrol, Comdr. Hartman also assumed command of a coordinated attack group (nicknamed a wolfpack) consisting of \"Barbero\", , and . The first phase of this two-part patrol lasted from 26 October until 15 November. It was conducted in the Makassar Strait and in the area west of Mindoro. On 2 November, after a lively passage of Lombok Strait during which picket boats and shore batteries fired on her, \"Barbero\" sank her first ship, a 2,700-ton troop transport. On 8 November, she sent a 7,500-ton tanker to the bottom during a coordinated attack on a small convoy (consisting of submarine chasers and \"CH-8\" escorting oilers \"Shimotsu Maru\" and \"Nichinan Maru No. 2\") carried out in cooperation with \"Redfin\". \"Redfin\" received credit for sinking the other tanker in the convoy.\nFollowing a three-day stop at Mios Woendi to rearm with torpedoes and perform minor upkeep, \"Barbero\" embarked on the second portion of the patrol. This longer phase lasted from 18 November 1944 to 2 January 1945 and was conducted in the South China Sea northeast of Borneo. On 24 December in an attack on an escorted four-ship convoy, a 7,500-ton gasoline tanker was sunk and a second tanker grossing about 5,000 tons was damaged. On Christmas Day, the submarine sank a 4,000-ton Japanese cargo ship. On 27 December, while she attempted the perilous repassage of Lombok Strait, fragments from an aerial bomb that narrowly missed \"Barbero\" close aboard aft damaged her port reduction gear. The damage forced her to cover the distance remaining to Fremantle on a single screw, and put her out of action for the remainder of the war. In 68 days away from Fremantle, Barbero returned having sunk four ships totalling 21,700 tons and claiming damage to a fifth of 5,000 tons.\nPost-war cargo and Regulus missile conversions.\nIn September 1945, she was ordered to Mare Island Naval Shipyard \u2013 where she underwent pre-inactivation overhaul \u2013 and was placed in commission in reserve on 25 April 1946.\nFollowing conversion to a cargo submarine at Mare Island, \"Barbero\" was recommissioned, redesignated SSA-317, and assigned to the Pacific Fleet on 31 March 1948. From October 1948 \u2013 March 1950, she took part in an experimental program to evaluate her capabilities as a cargo carrier. Experimentation ended in early 1950, and she was decommissioned into the reserve on 30 June 1950.\nOn 1 February 1955, \"Barbero\" entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for her a conversion under project SCB 118, equipping her to launch the Regulus I nuclear cruise missile. She was thus redesignated SSG-317 and recommissioned on 28 October 1955 under Lt. Cmdr. Samuel T. Bussey as the second submarine equipped with the Regulus missile, having been converted in 1953. In this role, \"Barbero\" was equipped with a hangar housing two missiles and a launcher on the after deck. One of the limitations of Regulus was that the firing submarine had to surface, the missile then being rolled out onto the launcher and fired. Regulus I also required guidance from submarines or other platforms after firing. She operated off the coast of California, firing her first test missile near San Clemente Island on 14 March 1956, until April 1956, when she transited the Panama Canal and joined the Atlantic Fleet, based at Norfolk, Virginia. From there, she served as an integral part in the nation's defense against nuclear war by carrying out early versions of the deterrent patrols that later became a regular feature of the submarine force after the introduction of the fleet ballistic missile submarine. She conducted patrols in the Atlantic for the next three years, under a policy of having one Regulus boat in each ocean.\nOn 1 July 1959, \"Barbero\" was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet's Submarine Squadron 1, based at Pearl Harbor to conduct deterrent patrols in the Pacific due to a shift in policy placing all deployed Regulus assets there. She usually patrolled with \"Tunny\" to provide four missiles on station. In January 1962, \"Barbero\" entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for an extensive five-month overhaul. During that time, members of her crew pursued various fields of training and education at service schools in Hawaii and on the United States West Coast. After concluding the overhaul in June 1962, \"Barbero\" carried out local operations and conducted refresher training. She then completed a single deterrent patrol in the latter half of 1962. \"Barbero\" conducted another two deterrent patrols in 1963, making liberty calls in East Asian ports at the conclusion of each.\nMissile Mail.\nIn 1959 \"Barbero\" assisted the United States Post Office Department, predecessor of what in 1971 became today's United States Postal Service (USPS), in its search for faster, more efficient forms of mail transportation. The Post Office tried its first and only delivery of \"Missile Mail\", though the idea of delivering mail by rocket was not new. Shortly before noon on 8 June 1959, off the northern Florida coast under command of her new skipper Robert H. Blount, \"Barbero\" fired a Regulus cruise missile towards the Naval Auxiliary Air Station, Mayport, Florida. Twenty-two minutes later the training type missile landed at its target; its training-type warhead having been configured to contain two official USPS mail containers.\nThe Post Office had officially established a branch post office on \"Barbero\" and delivered some 3,000 pieces of mail to it before \"Barbero\" left Norfolk, Virginia. The mail consisted entirely of commemorative postal covers addressed to President of the United States Dwight Eisenhower, other government officials, the Postmasters General of all members of the Universal Postal Union, and so on. They contained letters from United States Postmaster General Arthur E. Summerfield. Their postage (four cents domestic, eight cents international) had been cancelled \"USS Barbero 8 June 9.30\u00a0am 1959\" before the boat put to sea. In Mayport, the Regulus was opened and the mail forwarded to the Jacksonville, Florida Post Office for further sorting and routing.\nUpon witnessing the missile's landing, Summerfield stated, \"This peacetime employment of a guided missile for the important and practical purpose of carrying mail, is the first known official use of missiles by any Post Office Department of any nation.\" Summerfield proclaimed the event to be \"of historic significance to the peoples of the entire world,\" and predicted that \"before man reaches the moon, mail will be delivered within hours from New York to California, to Britain, to India or Australia by guided missiles. We stand on the threshold of rocket mail.\"\nDecommissioning and disposal.\nRegulus was superseded by the Polaris missile in 1964. \"Barbero\" ended her nuclear strategic deterrent patrols and was decommissioned on 30 June 1964. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 July 1964, prior to being used as a target and sunk by the submarine off Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 October 1964.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many types of insulation can be thought of as weatherization, because they block drafts or protect from cold winds. Whereas insulation primarily reduces \"conductive\" heat flow, weatherization primarily reduces \"convective\" heat flow.\nIn the United States, buildings use one third of all energy consumed and two thirds of all electricity. Due to the high energy usage, they are a major source of the pollution that causes urban air quality problems and pollutants that contribute to climate change. Building energy usage accounts for 49 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25 percent of nitrous oxide emissions, and 10 percent of particulate emissions.\nProcedures.\nTypical weatherization procedures include:\nThe phrase \"whole-house weatherization\" extends the traditional definition of weatherization to include installation of modern, energy-saving heating and cooling equipment, or repair of old, inefficient equipment (furnaces, boilers, water heaters, programmable thermostats, air conditioners, and so on). The \"Whole-House\" approach also looks at how the house performs as a system.\nAir quality.\nWeatherization generally does not cause indoor air quality problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.\nWeatherization may have a negative impact on indoor air quality, if done improperly, exacerbating respiratory conditions especially among occupants with pre-existing respiratory illnesses. This may occur because of a drastic decrease in air exchange rate in the home, introduction of new chemicals, and poor management of indoor moisture due to a poorly performed weatherization work. Low air exchange rates may lead to higher concentrations of pollutants in the air when ventilation is not sufficiently addressed during weatherization work. However, the situation may be different in case of a house situated in an area with high outdoor air pollution levels such as in close proximity (&lt;200 m) from a busy major road. In such a scenario, a more airtight building envelope can actually offer protection against infiltration of outdoor air pollution. The same is true for the protection offered by tighter building envelopes during wildfire events that cause elevated levels of outdoor air pollution.\nUS Weatherization Assistance Program.\nWeatherization is a set of measures and practices aimed at improving the energy efficiency of a building or home, primarily to reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills. The main goal of weatherization is to make a structure more comfortable and cost-effective to live in, especially during extreme weather conditions. It involves making various improvements to a building's insulation, air sealing, and overall energy systems.\nThe American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that up to February 2018[ [update]] over 7 million homes have been weatherized, giving yearly savings of 2.6 TWh of electricity, of fossil gas and of reduced carbon dioxide emissions. The US Department of Energy estimates weatherization returns $2.69 for each dollar spent on the program, realized in energy and non-energy benefits. Families whose homes are weatherized are expected to save $358 on their first year's utility bills.\nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Programs in many states work side by side with WAP to provide both immediate and long-term solutions to energy poverty.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thermal insulation can be achieved with specially engineered methods or processes, as well as with suitable object shapes and materials.\nHeat flow is an inevitable consequence of contact between objects of different temperature. Thermal insulation provides a region of insulation in which thermal conduction is reduced, creating a thermal break or thermal barrier, or thermal radiation is reflected rather than absorbed by the lower-temperature body.\nThe insulating capability of a material is measured as the inverse of thermal conductivity (k). Low thermal conductivity is equivalent to high insulating capability (resistance value). In thermal engineering, other important properties of insulating materials are product density (\u03c1) and specific heat capacity (c).\nDefinition.\nThermal conductivity \"k\" is measured in watts-per-meter per kelvin (W\u00b7m\u22121\u00b7K\u22121 or W/mK). This is because heat transfer, measured as power, has been found to be (approximately) proportional to \nFrom this, it follows that the power of heat loss formula_4 is given by\nformula_5\nThermal conductivity depends on the material and for fluids, its temperature and pressure. For comparison purposes, conductivity under standard conditions (20\u00a0\u00b0C at 1 atm) is commonly used. For some materials, thermal conductivity may also depend upon the direction of heat transfer.\nThe act of insulation is accomplished by encasing an object in material with low thermal conductivity in high thickness. Decreasing the exposed surface area could also lower heat transfer, but this quantity is usually fixed by the geometry of the object to be insulated.\nMulti-layer insulation is used where radiative loss dominates, or when the user is restricted in volume and weight of the insulation (e.g. emergency blanket, radiant barrier)\nInsulation of cylinders.\nFor insulated cylinders, a \"critical radius\" blanket must be reached. Before the critical radius is reached, any added insulation increases heat transfer. The convective thermal resistance is inversely proportional to the surface area and therefore the radius of the cylinder, while the thermal resistance of a cylindrical shell (the insulation layer) depends on the ratio between outside and inside radius, not on the radius itself. If the outside radius of a cylinder is increased by applying insulation, a fixed amount of conductive resistance (equal to 2\u00d7\u03c0\u00d7k\u00d7L(Tin-Tout)/ln(Rout/Rin)) is added. However, at the same time, the convective resistance is reduced. This implies that adding insulation below a certain critical radius actually increases the heat transfer. For insulated cylinders, the critical radius is given by the equation\nformula_6\nThis equation shows that the critical radius depends only on the heat transfer coefficient and the thermal conductivity of the insulation. If the radius of the insulated cylinder is smaller than the critical radius for insulation, the addition of any amount of insulation will increase heat transfer.\nApplications.\nClothing and natural animal insulation in birds and mammals.\nGases possess poor thermal conduction properties compared to liquids and solids and thus make good insulation material if they can be trapped. In order to further augment the effectiveness of a gas (such as air), it may be disrupted into small cells, which cannot effectively transfer heat by natural convection. Convection involves a larger bulk flow of gas driven by buoyancy and temperature differences, and it does not work well in small cells where there is little density difference to drive it, and the high surface-to-volume ratios of the small cells retards gas flow in them by means of viscous drag.\nIn order to accomplish small gas cell formation in man-made thermal insulation, glass and polymer materials can be used to trap air in a foam-like structure. This principle is used industrially in building and piping insulation such as (glass wool), cellulose, rock wool, polystyrene foam (styrofoam), urethane foam, vermiculite, perlite, and cork. Trapping air is also the principle in all highly insulating clothing materials such as wool, down feathers and fleece.\nThe air-trapping property is also the insulation principle employed by homeothermic animals to stay warm, for example down feathers, and insulating hair such as natural sheep's wool. In both cases the primary insulating material is air, and the polymer used for trapping the air is natural keratin protein.\nBuildings.\nMaintaining acceptable temperatures in buildings (by heating and cooling) uses a large proportion of global energy consumption. Building insulations also commonly use the principle of small trapped air-cells as explained above, e.g. fiberglass (specifically glass wool), cellulose, rock wool, polystyrene foam, urethane foam, vermiculite, perlite, cork, etc. For a period of time, asbestos was also used, however, it caused health problems. \nWindow insulation film can be applied in weatherization applications to reduce incoming thermal radiation in summer and loss in winter.\nWhen well insulated, a building is:\nIn industry, energy has to be expended to raise, lower, or maintain the temperature of objects or process fluids. If these are not insulated, this increases the energy requirements of a process, and therefore the cost and environmental impact.\nMechanical systems.\nSpace heating and cooling systems distribute heat throughout buildings by means of pipes or ductwork. Insulating these pipes using pipe insulation reduces energy into unoccupied rooms and prevents condensation from occurring on cold and chilled pipework.\nPipe insulation is also used on water supply pipework to help delay pipe freezing for an acceptable length of time.\nMechanical insulation is commonly installed in industrial and commercial facilities.\nPassive radiative cooling surfaces.\nThermal insulation has been found to improve the thermal emittance of passive radiative cooling surfaces by increasing the surface's ability to lower temperatures below ambient under direct solar intensity. Different materials may be used for thermal insulation, including polyethylene aerogels that reduce solar absorption and parasitic heat gain which may improve the emitter's performance by over 20%. Other aerogels also exhibited strong thermal insulation performance for radiative cooling surfaces, including a silica-alumina nanofibrous aerogel.\nRefrigeration.\nA refrigerator consists of a heat pump and a thermally insulated compartment.\nSpacecraft.\nLaunch and re-entry place severe mechanical stresses on spacecraft, so the strength of an insulator is critically important; the failure of insulating tiles on the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" caused the shuttle airframe to overheat and break apart during reentry, killing the astronauts on board. Re-entry through the atmosphere generates very high temperatures due to compression of the air at high speeds. Insulators must meet demanding physical properties beyond their thermal transfer retardant properties. Examples of insulation used on spacecraft include reinforced carbon-carbon composite nose cone and silica fiber tiles of the Space Shuttle. See also Insulative paint.\nAutomotive.\nInternal combustion engines produce a lot of heat during their combustion cycle. This can have a negative effect when it reaches various heat-sensitive components such as sensors, batteries, and starter motors. As a result, thermal insulation is necessary to prevent the heat from the exhaust from reaching these components.\nRace cars such as F1, high performance road cars and even most ordinary road cars use thermal insulation to control the temperatures of critical components, principally shielding them from heat radiated from exhaust manifolds and pipes and/or turbochargers. Heat shielding is also often used in road cars to reduce the transmission of engine and exhaust system heat to the interior of the car. \nAerospace.\nAircraft engines such as turbojets use thermal barriers on components such as the combuster sections/afterburner for heat protection.\nGreenhouse.\nThermal insulation is integral to greenhouse design, enabling controlled environments for plant growth and energy efficiency. Common insulation techniques include the use of double-layer films and multi-wall polycarbonate panels, which trap air between layers to reduce heat transfer while maintaining sufficient light transmission for photosynthesis. These measures improve energy efficiency and support year-round crop production, significantly reducing heating costs.\nFactors influencing performance.\nInsulation performance is influenced by many factors, the most prominent of which include:\nIt is important to note that the factors influencing performance may vary over time as material ages or environmental conditions change.\nCalculating requirements.\nIndustry standards are often rules of thumb, developed over many years, that offset many conflicting goals: what people will pay for, manufacturing cost, local climate, traditional building practices, and varying standards of comfort. Both heat transfer and layer analysis may be performed in large industrial applications, but in household situations (appliances and building insulation), airtightness is the key in reducing heat transfer due to air leakage (forced or natural convection). Once airtightness is achieved, it has often been sufficient to choose the thickness of the insulating layer based on rules of thumb. Diminishing returns are achieved with each successive doubling of the insulating layer.\nIt can be shown that for some systems, there is a minimum insulation thickness required for an improvement to be realized.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most writers use it as a synonym for heat capacity, the ability of a body to store thermal energy. It is typically referred to by the symbol \"C\"th, and its SI unit is J/K or J/\u00b0C (which are equivalent). \nBecause: \nThe lack of a consistent definition of what property of matter thermal mass describes has led some writers to dismiss its use in building design as pseudoscience.\nBackground.\nThe equation relating thermal energy to thermal mass is:\nformula_1\nwhere \"Q\" is the thermal energy transferred, \"C\"th is the thermal mass of the body, and \u0394\"T\" is the change in temperature.\nFor example, if 250\u00a0J of heat energy is added to a copper gear with a thermal mass of 38.46\u00a0J/\u00b0C, its temperature will rise by 6.50\u00a0\u00b0C.\nIf the body consists of a homogeneous material with sufficiently known physical properties, the thermal mass is simply the mass of material present times the specific heat capacity of that material. For bodies made of many materials, the sum of heat capacities for their pure components may be used in the calculation, or in some cases (as for a whole animal, for example) the number may simply be measured for the entire body in question, directly.\nAs an extensive property, heat capacity is characteristic of an object; its corresponding intensive property is specific heat capacity, expressed in terms of a measure of the amount of material such as mass or number of moles, which must be multiplied by similar units to give the heat capacity of the entire body of material. Thus the heat capacity can be equivalently calculated as the product of the mass \"m\" of the body and the specific heat capacity \"c\" for the material, or the product of the number of moles of molecules present \"n\" and the molar specific heat capacity formula_2. For discussion of \"why\" the thermal energy storage abilities of pure substances vary, see factors that affect specific heat capacity.\nFor a body of uniform composition, formula_3 can be approximated by\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 is the mass of the body and formula_6 is the isobaric specific heat capacity of the material averaged over temperature range in question. For bodies composed of numerous different materials, the thermal masses for the different components can just be added together.\nHeat capacity in buildings.\nChristoph Reinhard describes the impact of heat capacity this way: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;* If the outside diurnal temperature swing frequently oscillates around a desired (balance point) temperature, adding thermal mass may increase the hours of comfort in a given time interval.\nHeat capacity is not normally calculated in the engineering of buildings. In the United States and Canada, national building codes and most state and local jurisdictions require that heating and cooling equipment be sized in accordance with Manual J of the Air Conditioning Contractors of America. The Manual J process uses detailed measurements of a building's dimensions, construction, insulation, air-tightness, features and occupant loads, but it does not take into effect the heat capacity. Some heat capacity is presumed in the Manual J process, equipment sized according to Manual J is sized to maintain comfort at the first percentile of temperature for heating and the 99th percentile of temperature for cooling. The process presumes that the building has sufficient heat capacity to maintain comfort during brief excursions outside of those extremes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1948, he established Honda Motor Co., Ltd. and oversaw its expansion from a wooden shack manufacturing bicycle motors to a multinational automobile and motorcycle manufacturer.\nEarly years.\nHonda was born in K\u014dmy\u014d village, Iwata District, Shizuoka, near Hamamatsu on 17 November 1906. He spent his early childhood helping his father, Gihei Honda, a blacksmith, with his bicycle repair business. At the time his mother, Mika Honda, was a weaver. Honda was not interested in traditional education. His school handed grade reports to the children, but required that they be returned stamped with the family seal, to make sure that a parent had seen it. Honda created a stamp to forge his family seal out of a used rubber bicycle pedal cover. \nThe fraud was soon discovered when he started to make forged stamps for other children. Honda was unaware that the stamp was supposed to be mirror-imaged. His family name \u672c\u7530 (Honda) is symmetrical when written vertically, so it did not cause a problem, but some of the other children's family names were not. \nEven as a toddler, Honda had been thrilled by the first car that was ever seen in his village. In later life, he would often say that he could never forget the smell of oil it gave off, saying that it smelled \"like perfume\".\nSoichiro once borrowed one of his father's bicycles to see a demonstration of an airplane made by pilot Art Smith, which cemented his love for machinery and invention. \nAt 15, without any formal education, Honda left home and headed to Tokyo to look for work. He obtained an apprenticeship at a garage in 1922. After some hesitation over his employment, he stayed for six years, working as a car mechanic before returning home to start his own auto repair business in 1928 at the age of 22.\nHonda raced a turbocharged Ford in the \"1st Japan Automobile Race\" at Tamagawa Speedway in 1936. He crashed and seriously injured his left eye. His brother was also injured. After that, he quit racing.\nDevelopment of Honda Motor Co., Ltd..\nIn 1937, Honda founded T\u014dkai Seiki to produce piston rings for Toyota. During World War II, a US B-29 bomber attack destroyed T\u014dkai Seiki's Yamashita plant in 1944 and the Iwata plant collapsed in the 1945 Mikawa earthquake. After the war, Honda sold the salvageable remains of the company to Toyota for \u00a5450,000 and used the proceeds to found the Honda Technical Research Institute in October 1946. \nIn 1948, he started producing a complete motorized bicycle, the Type A, which was driven by the first mass-produced engine designed by Honda, and was sold until 1951. The Type D in 1949 was a true motorcycle with a pressed-steel frame designed and produced by Honda and with a 2-stroke, engine, and became the first model in the Dream series of motorcycles. The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan lists both the Type A and the Type D models as two of their \"240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology\".\nAfter the war, Honda became reacquainted with his friend Takeo Fujisawa, whom he had known during his days as a supplier of piston rings to Nakajima Aircraft Company. In 1949, Honda hired Fujisawa, who oversaw the financial side of the company and helped the firm expand. In 1959, Honda Motorcycles opened its first dealership in the United States. \nAs president of the Honda Motor Company, Soichiro Honda turned the company into a billion-dollar multinational that produced the best-selling motorcycles in the world. Honda's engineering and marketing skills resulted in Honda motorcycles outselling Triumph and Harley-Davidson in their respective home markets. \nHonda remained president until his retirement in 1973, where he stayed on as director and was appointed \"supreme advisor\" in 1983. His status was such that \"People\" magazine placed him on their \"25 Most Intriguing People of the Year\" list for 1980, dubbing him \"the Japanese Henry Ford\". In retirement, Honda busied himself with work connected with the Honda Foundation. In his memoirs, Soichiro Honda expressed his sorrow for sometimes being rude to his employees, humiliating and occasionally even slapping them in the face.\nLast years.\nEven at his advanced age, Soichiro and his wife Sachi both held private pilot's licenses. He also enjoyed skiing, golf, racing cars, hang gliding and ballooning at 77, and he was a highly accomplished artist. He and Takeo Fujisawa made a pact never to force their own sons to join the company. His son, Hirotoshi Honda, was the founder and former CEO of Mugen Motorsports, a tuner for Honda vehicles who also created original racing vehicles. \nASME established the Soichiro Honda Medal in recognition of Mr. Honda's achievements in 1982; this medal recognizes outstanding achievement or significant engineering contributions in the field of personal transportation. In 1989, he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame near Detroit. \nSoichiro Honda died on 5 August 1991, days before the Hungarian Grand Prix, of liver failure. He was 84.

It is usually treated as the only genus in the family Selaginellaceae, with over 750 known species.\nThis family is distinguished from Lycopodiaceae (the clubmosses) by having scale-leaves bearing a ligule and by having spores of two types. They are sometimes included in an informal paraphyletic group called the \"fern allies\". The species \"S. moellendorffii\" is an important model organism. Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. The name \"Selaginella\" was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species \"Selaginella selaginoides\", which turns out (with the closely related \"Selaginella deflexa\") to be a clade that is sister to all other \"Selaginellas\", so any definitive subdivision of the species into separate genera leaves two taxa in \"Selaginella\", with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera.\n\"Selaginella\" occurs mostly in the tropical regions of the world, with a handful of species to be found in the arctic-alpine zones of both hemispheres. Fossils assignable to the modern genus are known spanning over 300 million years from the Late Carboniferous to the present.\nDescription.\n\"Selaginella\" species are creeping or ascendant plants with simple, scale-like leaves (microphylls) on branching stems from which roots also arise. The stems are aerial, horizontally creeping on the substratum (as in \"Selaginella kraussiana\"), sub-erect (\"Selaginella trachyphylla\") or erect (as in \"Selaginella erythropus\"). The vascular steles are polystelic protosteles. Stem section shows the presence of more than two protosteles. Each stele is made up of diarch (having two strands of xylem) and exarch (growing outward in) xylems. The steles are connected with the cortex by means of many tube-like structures called trabeculae, which are modified endodermal cells with casparian strips on their lateral walls. The stems contain no pith.\nIn \"Selaginella\", each microphyll and sporophyll has a small scale-like outgrowth called a ligule at the base of the upper surface. The plants are heterosporous with spores of two different size classes, known as megaspores and microspores. In Selaginella rupestris fertilization takes place while the megaspore is still attached to the parent plant, and is only released after the embryo has produced cotyledons and a root.\nUnusual for the lycopods, which nearly always have microphylls with a single unbranched vein, the microphylls of a few \"Selaginella\" species contain a branched vascular trace.\nUnder dry conditions, some species of \"Selaginella\" can survive dehydration. In this state, they may roll up into brown balls and be uprooted, but can rehydrate under moist conditions, become green again and resume growth. This phenomenon is known as poikilohydry, and poikilohydric plants such as \"Selaginella bryopteris\" are sometimes referred to as resurrection plants.\nThere is no evidence of whole genome duplication in Selaginella's evolutionary history. Instead they have gone through tandem gene duplications, which is particularly noticeable in genes relevant for desiccation tolerance.\nTheir chloroplasts are missing about two-thirds of their plastidial tRNA genes, which are instead found in the genome of the nucleus. The genus is unique among vascular plants in having species with monoplastidic cells, single giant chloroplasts, located mostly in their dorsal epidermal cells, but also in the upper mesophyll of some species. This appears to be a derived traits and an adaptation to low-light conditions, having originated at least twice. Cells with multiplastidic chloroplasts, more than ten chloroplasts per cell, are considered most basal, and are found in species exposed to more light. Oligoplastidic cells, cells with 3 to ten chloroplasts, are more adated to weaker light, and the monoplastidic species being the most shade-loving forms. It is estimated that 70% of Selaginella species are monoplastidic. These receive just 0.4~2.1% of full sunlight, while species with multiple chloroplasts live in open places where they on average receive more than 40.5% of full sunlight.\nTaxonomy.\nSome scientists still place the Selaginellales in the class Lycopodiopsida (often misconstructed as \"Lycopsida\"). Some modern authors recognize three generic divisions of \"Selaginella\": \"Selaginella\", \"Bryodesma\" , and \"Lycopodioides\" . \"Lycopodioides\" would include the North American species \"S. apoda\" and \"S. eclipes\", while \"Bryodesma\" would include \"S. rupestris\" (as \"Bryodesma rupestre\"). \"Stachygynandrum\" is also sometimes used to include the bulk of species.\nThe first major attempt to define and subdivide the group was by Palisot de Beauvois in 1803\u20131805. He established the genus \"Selaginella\" as a monotypic genus, and placed the bulk of species in \"Stachygynandrum\". \"Gymnogynum\" was another monotypic genus, but that name is superseded by his own earlier name of \"Didiclis\". This turns out, today, to be a group of around 45\u201350 species also known as the \"Articulatae\", since his genus \"Didiclis/Gymnogynum\" was based on \"Selaginella plumosa\". He also described the genus \"Diplostachyum\" to include a group of species similar to \"Selaginella apoda\". Spring inflated the genus \"Selaginella\" to hold all selaginelloid species four decades later.\nPhylogenetic studies by Korall &amp; Kenrick determined that the \"Euselaginella\" group, comprising solely the type species, \"Selaginella selaginoides\" and a closely related Hawaiian species, \"Selaginella deflexa\", is a basal and anciently diverging sister to all other \"Selaginella\" species. Beyond this, their study split the remainder of species into two broad groups, one including the \"Bryodesma\" species, the \"Articulatae\", section \"Ericetorum\" and others, and the other centered on the broad \"Stachygynandrum\" group.\nIn 2023, Zhou &amp; Zhang suggested that the genus should be broken up into 19 different genera.\nSpecies.\nThere are about 750 known species of \"Selaginella\". They show a wide range of characters; the genus is overdue for a revision which might include subdivision into several genera. Species of spikemoss include:\nA few species of \"Selaginella\" are desert plants known as \"resurrection plants\", because they curl up in a tight, brown or reddish ball during dry times, and uncurl and turn green in the presence of moisture. Other species are tropical forest plants that appear at first glance to be ferns.\nCultivation.\nA number of \"Selaginella\" species are popular plants for cultivation, mostly tropical species. Some of the species popularly cultivated and actively available commercially include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are a Bantu-speaking people and the second-largest of three main ethnic groups in Rwanda and Burundi, the other two being the Hutu and Twa.\nHistorically, the Tutsi were pastoralists and filled the ranks of the warrior caste. Before 1962, they regulated and controlled Rwandan society, which consisted of Tutsi aristocrats and Hutu commoners under a clientship structure. The Tutsi occupied the dominant positions in the sharply stratified society and constituted the ruling class.\nOrigins and classification.\nAmerican historian Christopher Ehret believes that the Tutsi mainly descend from speakers of an extinct branch of South Cushitic he calls \"Tale South Cushitic\". The Tale Southern Cushites entered the Great Lakes region sometime before 800 BC and were pastoralists who relied only on their livestock and conceivably growing no grains themselves. They did not practice the hunting of wild animals, while the consumption of fish was taboo and heavily avoided. The Tale Southern Cushitic way of life shows striking similarities to the Tutsi, who rely heavily on the milk, blood, and meat of their cattle and traditionally shun the cultivation and consumption of grains, look down on pottery and hunting, and avoid eating fish. A number of words related to pastoralism in the Rwanda-Rundi languages are Tale Southern Cushitic loanwords, such as \"bull\", \"cow dung\", and \"lion\" (a livestock predator).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This late continuation of Southern Cushites as important pastoralists in the southern half of the lacustrine region raises the intriguing possibility that the latter-day Tutsi and Hima pastoralism, most significant in the southern half of the region, is rooted in the Southern Cushitic culture and so derived from the east rather than the north.\u2014\u200a\nThe Tutsi also derive a significant amount of their ancestry from the Sog Eastern Sahelians (a long-extinct Nilo-Saharan group). The Sog were agro-pastoralists who entered Rwanda and Burundi in 2,000 BC, mostly settling in southern Rwanda and to the east and west of the\u00a0Ruzizi River. According to Ehret, they spoke a Kir-Abbaian language that was related to, but distinct from, Nilotic and Surmic languages. The Western Lakes Bantu languages spoken by the Tutsi have many Sog Eastern Sahelian loanwords, such as the word for cow (inka), which originally meant \"cattle camp\" in the Sog language, demonstrating their contribution to Tutsi pastoralism.\nCentral Sudanic peoples likely form another part of the ancestry of the Tutsi. Central Sudanic farmers and herders entered Rwanda and Burundi in 3000 BC, and some of their cultural practices have remained following their assimilation by the Bantu. For example, in Central Sudanic\u2013speaking societies, women are kept away from cattle. Among the Tutsi (and the neighbouring Hima people to the north), women are strictly forbidden to milk cows (especially menstruating women).\nThe definition of \"Tutsi\" has changed through time and location. Social structures were unstable throughout Rwanda, even during colonial times under Belgian rule. Generally, the Tutsi elite or aristocracy was distinguished from Tutsi commoners.\nWhen the Belgian colonial administration conducted censuses, it identified the people throughout Rwanda-Burundi according to a simple classification scheme. The \"Tutsi\" were defined as anyone owning more than ten cows (a sign of wealth) or with the physical features such as a longer, thin nose, high cheekbones, or being over six feet tall, all of which are common descriptions associated with the Tutsi.\nIn the colonial era, the Tutsi were hypothesized to have arrived in the Great Lakes region from the Horn of Africa, in accordance with the Hamitic hypothesis.\nTutsi are considered by some to be of Cushitic origin, although they do not speak a Cushitic language, and have inhabited the same areas for 400 years, leading to considerable intermarriage with Hutu in the area. Due to the history of intermingling and intermarrying of Hutu and Tutsi, some ethnographers and historians believe that the Hutu and Tutsi cannot be called distinct ethnic groups.\nGenetics.\nY-DNA (paternal lineages).\nModern-day genetic studies of the Y-chromosome generally indicate that the Tutsi, like the Hutu, are largely of Bantu extraction (60% E1b1a, 20% B, 4% E-P2(xE1b1a)).\nPaternal genetic influences associated with the Horn of Africa and North Africa are few (under 3% E1b1b-M35), and are ascribed to much earlier inhabitants who were assimilated. However, the Tutsi have considerably more haplogroup B Y-DNA paternal lineages (14.9% B) than do the Hutu (4.3% B).\nAutosomal DNA (overall ancestry).\nIn general, the Tutsi appear to share a close genetic kinship with neighbouring Bantu populations, particularly the Hutu. However, it is unclear whether this similarity is primarily due to extensive genetic exchanges between these communities through intermarriage or whether it ultimately stems from common origins:\n[...] generations of gene flow obliterated whatever clear-cut physical distinctions may have once existed between these two Bantu peoples \u2013 renowned to be height, body build, and facial features. With a spectrum of physical variation in the peoples, Belgian authorities legally mandated ethnic affiliation in the 1920s, based on economic criteria. Formal and discrete social divisions were consequently imposed upon ambiguous biological distinctions. To some extent, the permeability of these categories in the intervening decades helped to reify the biological distinctions, generating a taller elite and a shorter underclass, but with little relation to the gene pools that had existed a few centuries ago. The social categories are thus real, but there is little if any detectable genetic differentiation between Hutu and Tutsi.\nHeight.\nTheir average height is , although individuals have been recorded as being taller than .\nHistory.\nPrior to the arrival of colonists, Rwanda had been ruled by a Tutsi-dominated monarchy since the 15th century. In 1897, Germany established a presence in Rwanda with the formation of an alliance with the king, beginning the colonial era. Later, Belgium took control in 1916 during World War I. Both European nations ruled through the Rwandan king and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy.\nIn Burundi, meanwhile, a ruling faction known as the \"ganwa\" emerged and quickly assumed effective control of the country's administration. The \"ganwa\", who relied on support from both Hutu and Tutsi populations to rule, were perceived within Burundi as neither Hutu nor Tutsi.\nRwanda was ruled as a colony by Germany from 1897 to 1916, and by Belgium from 1922 to 1961. Both the Tutsi and Hutu had been the traditional governing elite, but both colonial powers allowed only the Tutsi to be educated and to participate in the colonial government. Such discriminatory policies engendered resentment.\nWhen the Belgians took over, they believed the areas, which were formerly under German colonial control, could be better governed if they continued to identify the different populations as they had been previously identified. In the 1920s, the Belgian authorities required the population to identify with a particular ethnic group and the authorities classified them accordingly in censuses.\nIn 1959, Belgium reversed its stance and allowed the majority Hutu to assume control of the government through universal elections after independence. This partly reflected internal Belgian domestic politics, in which the discrimination against the Hutu majority came to be regarded as similar to oppression within Belgium stemming from the Flemish-Walloon conflict, and the democratisation and empowerment of the Hutu was seen as a just response to the Tutsi's domination. Belgian policies wavered considerably during this period leading up to the independence of Rwanda and Burundi.\nIndependence of Rwanda and Burundi (1962).\nThe Hutu majority in Rwanda revolted against the Tutsi and was able to take power. Many Tutsi fled and created exile communities outside Rwanda, in Uganda and Tanzania. Overt discrimination from the colonial period was continued by different Rwandan and Burundian governments, including identity cards that distinguished between Tutsi and Hutu.\nEthnic violence in Burundi (1993).\nIn 1993, Burundi's first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated by Tutsi officers, as was the person entitled to succeed him under the constitution. This sparked ethnic violence in Burundi, in which \"possibly as many as 25,000 Tutsi\" \u2013 including military, civil servants, and civilians \u2013 were murdered by Hutu and \"at least as many\" Hutu were killed by Tutsi. Since the 2000 Arusha Accords, Burundi's Tutsi minority shares power in a more or less equitable manner with the Hutu majority. Traditionally, the Tutsi held more economic power and controlled the military.\n1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.\nA similar pattern of events took place in Rwanda, where the Hutu came to power in 1962. They in turn often oppressed the Tutsi, who fled the country. After the anti-Tutsi violence of the Rwandan Revolution (1959\u20131961), Tutsi fled in large numbers.\nThese Tutsi communities in exile gave rise to Tutsi rebel movements. The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), mostly made up of exiled Tutsi living in Uganda, attacked Rwanda in 1990 with the intention of taking back power for the Tutsi. The RPF had experience in organised irregular warfare from the Ugandan Bush War and received support from the Ugandan government. The initial RPF advance was halted by a lift of French arms to the Rwandan government. Attempts at peace culminated in the 1993 Arusha Accords.\nThe agreement broke down after the assassination of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, triggering a resumption of hostilities and the start of the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, in which the Hutu killed an estimated 500,000\u2013600,000 people, mostly Tutsi. Victorious in the aftermath of the genocide, the Tutsi-led RPF came to power in July 1994.\nCulture.\nIn Rwanda, from the 15th century until 1961, the Tutsi were ruled by a king (the \"mwami\"). Belgium abolished the monarchy, following the national referendum that led to independence. By contrast, in the northwestern part of the country, which is predominantly Hutu, large regional landholders shared power, similar to the society of Buganda (in present-day Uganda).\nUnder their holy king, Tutsi culture traditionally revolved around administering justice and government. They were the only proprietors of cattle, and sustained themselves on their own products. Additionally, their lifestyle afforded them plenty of leisure time, which they spent cultivating the high arts of poetry, weaving, and music. Due to the Tutsi's status as a dominant minority vis-a-vis the Hutu farmers and the other local inhabitants, this relationship has been likened to that between lords and serfs in feudal Europe.\nAccording to British historian John Fage, the Tutsi are serologically related to Bantu and Nilotic populations. This in turn rules out a possible Cushitic origin for the founding Tutsi-Hima ruling class in the lacustrine kingdoms. However, the royal burial customs of the latter kingdoms are quite similar to those practised by the former Cushitic Sidama states in the southern Gibe region of Ethiopia. By contrast, Bantu populations to the north of the Tutsi-Hima in the mount Kenya area such as the Agikuyu were until modern times essentially without a king (instead having a stateless age set system which they adopted from Cushitic peoples) while there were a number of Bantu kingdoms to the south of the Tutsi-Hima in Tanzania, all of which shared the Tutsi-Hima's chieftaincy pattern. Since the Cushitic Sidama kingdoms interacted with Nilotic groups, Fage thus proposes that the Tutsi may have descended from one such migrating Nilotic population. The Nilotic ancestors of the Tutsi would thereby in earlier times have served as cultural intermediaries, adopting some monarchical traditions from adjacent Cushitic kingdoms and subsequently taking those borrowed customs south with them when they first settled amongst Bantu autochthones in the Great Lakes area. However, little difference can be ascertained between the cultures today of the Tutsi and Hutu; both groups speak the same Bantu language. The rate of intermarriage between the two groups was traditionally very high, and relations were amicable until the 20th century. Many scholars have concluded that the determination of Tutsi was and is mainly an expression of class or caste, rather than ethnicity. Rwandans have their own language, Kinyarwanda. English, French and Swahili serve as additional official languages for different historic reasons, and are widely spoken by Rwandans as a second language.\nTutsi in the Congo.\nScholars have long recognised that the Tutsi presence in the modern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is best understood by distinguishing between two principal groups, whose histories have been significantly shaped\u2014and often distorted\u2014by colonial policies and later political struggles.\nBanyarwanda in North Kivu and South Kivu.\nA second Tutsi presence is found among the broader Banyarwanda community in parts of North Kivu. This community, which includes both Tutsi and Hutu, is largely the result of multiple migratory waves from neighbouring Rwanda, occurring over the pre-colonial, colonial, and post-genocide periods. In particular, the mass exodus during and after the Rwandan Genocide of 1994 is well documented and has significantly reshaped the ethnic landscape in eastern Congo. The academic consensus holds that these migratory processes, far from being a single exogenous event, have complex historical antecedents that continue to influence regional politics.\nConflict and Contemporary Issues.\nThe eastern DRC has been a hotspot of conflict for decades, involving numerous armed groups. Some of these, notably those evolving from the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) into what became known as the M23, have been led by individuals of Tutsi background. However, the portrayal of these groups solely through an ethnic lens oversimplifies the situation. Academic studies agree that the roots of the conflict lie in a mixture of colonial legacies, competition over valuable resources such as cobalt, and deep-seated political and social grievances. Reports from international organisations have documented serious human rights abuses\u2014including the recruitment of child soldiers and illegal exploitation of mineral wealth\u2014but these are best understood within the broader framework of state fragility and international economic pressures rather than as a straightforward ethnic conflict.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They inhabit South Sudan and the Gambela Region of Ethiopia, while also being a large minority in Kenya, Uganda, the northern area of Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania. The Nilotic people consist of the Dinka, the Nuer, the Shilluk, the Luo peoples, the Alur, the Anuak, the Ateker peoples, the Kalenjin people and the Karamojong people also known as the Karamojong or Karimojong, Ngasa people, Datooga, Samburu, and the Maa-speaking peoples. Each of the ethnic groups mentioned have distinct languages, ethnic origins, and migration history, so the grouping under the name Nilotic or Nilotes is anthropologically contentious. \nThe Nilotes constitute the majority of the population in South Sudan while constituting a substantial minority in the countries of Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. They make up a notable part of the population of North eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as well. Nilotic people are believed to number 50 million in the 21st century.\nPhysically, Nilotes are noted for their typically very dark skin color and lean, and occasionally tall bodies. They often possess exceptionally long limbs, particularly their distal segments (forearms, lower legs).\nThe Nilotic people primarily adhere to Christianity and traditional beliefs, with the majority of them being Christians. A small minority of Nilotes practice the religion of Islam.\nName.\nThe term Nilotic was used by a Church of England's clergyman named Thomas Gataker in mid to late 1600s. \nThe terms \"Nilotic\" and \"Nilote\"' were previously used as racial subclassifications, based on anthropological observations of the supposed distinct body morphology of many Nilotic speakers. Twentieth-century social scientists have largely discarded such efforts to classify peoples according to physical characteristics, in favor of using linguistic studies to distinguish among peoples. They formed ethnicities and cultures based on a shared language. Since the late 20th century, however, social and physical scientists are making use of data from population genetics.\nNilotic and Nilote are now mainly used to refer to the various disparate people who speak languages in the same Nilotic language family. Etymologically, the terms Nilotic and Nilote (singular nilot) derive from the Nile Valley; specifically, the Upper Nile and its tributaries, where most Sudanese Nilo-Saharan-speaking people live.\nEthnic and linguistic divisions.\nLanguages.\nLinguistically, Nilotic people are divided into three subgroups:\nEthnic groups.\nNilotic people constitute the bulk of the population of South Sudan. The largest of the Sudanese Nilotic peoples are the Dinka, who have as many as 25 ethnic subdivisions. The next-largest groups are the Nuer, followed by the Shilluk.\nNilotic people in Uganda includes the Luo peoples (Acholi, Alur, Adhola), the Ateker peoples (Iteso, Kumam, Karamojong, Lango people who despite speaking a mixture of Luo words, have Atekere origins, Sebei, and Kakwa).\nIn East Africa, the Nilotes are often subdivided into three general groups:\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nArchaeological evidence from the Lower Wadi Howar\u2014a now-extinct river system that once flowed west of the Nile\u2014points to the presence of mobile pastoralist communities during the Mid-Holocene (c. 6000\u20134000 BCE). These groups practiced cattle herding, fishing, and limited agriculture, and exhibited strong cultural links with pre-Kerma societies of the Nubian Nile Valley. Artifacts such as herringbone-incised pottery, cattle burials, and signs of long-distance trade suggest their integration into a broader Eastern Sudanic cultural sphere. As the Sahara underwent increasing aridification after 4000 BCE, these populations gradually migrated eastward and southward into the Nile Valley and White Nile basin, laying early demographic and cultural foundations for what would become the Nilotic-speaking peoples.\nProto-Nilotic.\nContemporaneous with pre-dynastic Egyptian developments down the Nile, the formation of a proto-Nilotic identity\u2014distinct from an earlier, broader Eastern Sudanic unity\u2014is thought to have emerged by the third millennium BCE, likely in connection with the rise of pastoralism. Linguistic models propose that this unity occurred east of the Nile, in what is now South Sudan. However, this is complicated by archaeological evidence placing culturally Nilotic populations firmly within the Nile Valley\u2014from Kadero to Mero\u00eb\u2014by the early third millennium BCE, suggesting a wider and more integrated presence.\nComposed of varied distinct identities, they were commonly collectively referred to as the Nehesy (southerners) by the ancient Egyptians, Aethiopians by the Greeks and Cushi (Cushites or Kushites) by the Israelites, a term that possibly derived from their own name for themselves.\nThese communities likely contributed to the development of major civilizations such as the Kingdom of Kush\u2014including Kerma, Napata, and Mero\u00eb\u2014and the later Christian kingdoms of Makuria, Nobatia, and Alodia. Genetic and archaeological studies indicate that Nubians were originally a population closely related to Nilotic groups, who later received gene flow from Middle Eastern and East African populations.\nOne of the earliest known archaeological sites associated with a pastoralist culture bearing Nilotic characteristics is Kadero, located about 48\u00a0km north of modern Khartoum, on the east bank of the Nile just upstream from the confluence with the Blue Nile. Dating to around 3000 BCE, Kadero reveals a cattle-herding society that also practiced seed cultivation and fishing. The site contains burial remains with distinct sub-Saharan African features and evidence of long-distance trade, artistry, and mixed subsistence strategies\u2014an economic pattern still observed among later Nilotic groups.\nAntiquity.\nBy the 2nd century, descriptions in Ptolemy's Geography (c. 150 CE), situates a group called the Memnones between the Nile and the Blue Nile (Astapos), near the region of Mero\u00eb. Classical authors often associated this area with mythic \"\" or descendants of Memnon\u2014a Homeric figure representing powerful peoples of the Upper Nile. The term Ethiopians (historically denoting dark skinned Africans) and their geographic placement in the text overlaps with the historical peoples and heartland of early Nilotic-speaking populations. The Nubei (or Nuba) at this time appear only on the periphery of this world, contrasting with the more central Memnones, a group bearing the name of Memnon, the mythic Ethiopian king of Trojan War fame. Their prominence\u2014both mythological and geographic\u2014suggests that they may reflect a residual Kushite aristocracy, remembered or mythologized in the Greco-Roman imagination. Though speculative, the group Ptolemy names the Sapaei, situated south of the Memnones between the Nile and the Astapos (Blue Nile), may correspond to early Nilotic populations ancestral to the southern Nilotes. Their described location\u2014likely within modern South Sudan\u2014lies approximately 700\u2013800\u00a0km north of Mount Elgon, in a south-southwesterly direction. Ethnographic accounts consistently identify the Mount Elgon region (Tulwet ab Kony) as a pivotal ancestral waypoint in the migration of Southern Nilotic-speaking peoples into Kenya. Among the Kalenjin, Mount Elgon and its residents is sometimes referred to as Kapkugo, meaning \"grandparents' place,\" reflecting its status in cultural memory as an ancestral homeland. The Kalenjin communities living around Elgon\u2014particularly the Sabaot\u2014have historically been grouped under the term Sebei, used in both Ugandan and Kenyan contexts to refer to the Nilotic highland peoples of the area. Similarly, a recurring myth among Tatoga sub-tribes describes a homeland on a high mountain\u2014Endabesht\u2014overlooking two great lakes, widely interpreted as Lake Victoria and Lake Turkana. The memory captured in the name of the town - Endebess, one of the towns nearest to Mount Elgon in Kenya.\nExpansion out of central Sudan.\nBetween the 5th and 11th centuries CE, Nilotic-speaking groups began expanding southward from central Sudanese regions such as the Gezira into what is now South Sudan. This movement took place during a time of major political and cultural shifts across the Nile Valley. Even as late as the 4th century, the ancient Kushite kingdom still exerted influence in Lower Nubia, as seen in a joint embassy of Ethiopians (Kushites) and Blemmyes (Beja) to Emperor Constantine around AD 336. But by the 5th century, Kushite political structures had collapsed, creating a power vacuum in the region.\nThe Nilotic migrations gained momentum in the 11th century, coinciding with the arrival of Arab traders in central Sudan. Although these later migrations significantly predate the collapse of the Christian Nubian kingdoms of Makuria and Alodia (around 1500 CE), they occur after early contact with Arabs (c.9-10 century), a contact that may have introduced new cultural and technological elements, such as humpless cattle breeds.\nAccording to archaeologist Roland Oliver, this same period also marks the emergence of the Iron Age among Nilotic groups. The combination of declining older polities, incoming lifeways and technologies, and internal cultural developments may have created the conditions that allowed or perhaps forced Nilotic-speaking peoples to expand and adapt to regions further south.\nExpansion into East Africa.\nFollowing their expansion across South Sudan during the first millennium CE, Nilotic-speaking pastoralists began settling further east into the highlands and Rift Valley of what is now Kenya and northern Tanzania. This movement, which accelerated from the 13th century onward, corresponds with the emergence of the Pastoral Iron Age in East Africa\u2014a transformative period marked by new forms of livestock management, iron technology, and territorial consolidation.\nGenetic studies of ancient remains from Kenya and Tanzania show that Pastoral Iron Age communities were distinct from their earlier Pastoral Neolithic predecessors. The latter were composed of approximately 40% Nilotic-related ancestry (similar to the Dinka), 40% ancestry from northeastern Africa (likely from the Horn or Levant), and 20% from indigenous foragers. By contrast, Pastoral Iron Age individuals show up to 60% Nilotic-related ancestry, indicating a renewed demographic and cultural expansion by Nilotic-speaking groups during this period.\nThese developments are reflected archaeologically in the rise of the Sirikwa culture (c.1200 to 1800 CE), a widespread agropastoral tradition centered on the Uasin Gishu plateau and surrounding western highlands. The Sirikwa economy emphasized dairying and seasonal herd mobility, supported by fortified settlements featuring distinctive cattle enclosures (\"Sirikwa holes\"), defensive gate systems, and irrigation features\u2014pointing to a highly organized and sedentary pastoral society.\nShilluk.\nBy the 16th century, the most powerful group among the Nilotic speakers were the C\u00f8ll\u00f8, called Shilluk by Arabs and Europeans, who spread east to the banks of the white Nile under the legendary leadership of Nyikang, who is said to have ruled L\u00e4g C\u00f8ll\u00f8 c from around 1490 to 1517. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 gained control of the west bank of the river as far north as Kosti in Sudan. There they established an economy based on cattle raising, cereal farming, and fishing, with small villages located along the length of the river. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 developed an intensive system of agriculture. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 lands in the 17th century had a population density similar to that of the Egyptian Nile lands.\nOne theory is that pressure from the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 drove the Funj people north, who would establish the Sultanate of Sennar.\nThe Dinka remained in the Sudd area, maintaining their transhumance economy.\nWhile the Dinka were protected and isolated from their neighbours, the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 were more involved in international affairs. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 controlled the west bank of the White Nile, but the other side was controlled by the Funj sultanate, with regular conflict between the two. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 had the ability to quickly raid outside areas by war canoe, and had control of the waters of the Nile. The Funj had a standing army of armoured cavalry, and this force allowed them to dominate the plains of the sahel.\nC\u00f8ll\u00f8 traditions tell of R\u00e4dh Odak Ocollo who ruled around 1630 and led them in a three-decade war with Sennar over control of the White Nile trade routes. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 allied with the Sultanate of Darfur and the Kingdom of Takali against the Funj, but the capitulation of Takali ended the war in the Funj's favour. In the later 17th century, the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 and Funj allied against the Dinka, who rose to power in the border area between the Funj and C\u00f8ll\u00f8.\nThe C\u00f8ll\u00f8 political structure gradually centralized under the a king or \"reth\". The most important is R\u00e4dh Tug\u00f8 (son of R\u00e4dh Dh\u00f8k\u00f6\u00f6dh\u00f8) who ruled from \"circa\" 1690 to 1710 and established the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 capital of Fashoda. The same period had the gradual collapse of the Funj sultanate, leaving the C\u00f8ll\u00f8 in complete control of the White Nile and its trade routes. The C\u00f8ll\u00f8 military power was based on control of the river.\nGeographical barriers protected the southerners from Islam's advance, enabling them to retain their social and cultural heritage and their political and religious institutions. The Dinka people were especially secure in the Sudd marshlands, which protected them from outside interference, and allowed them to remain secure without a large armed forces. The Shilluk, Azande, and Bari people had more regular conflicts with neighbouring states.\nWestern Nilotic settlement in East Africa.\nFor various reasons, slow and multigenerational migrations of Nilotic Luo peoples occurred from South Sudan into Uganda and western Kenya from at least 1000\u00a0AD, and continuing until the early 20th century.\nOral history and genealogical evidence have been used to estimate timelines of Luo expansion into and within Kenya and Tanzania. Four major waves of migrations into the former Nyanza province in Kenya are discernible starting with the people of Jok (\"Joka Jok\"), which is estimated to have begun around 1490\u20131517.\n\"Joka Jok\" were the first and largest wave of migrants into northern Nyanza. These migrants settled at a place called Ramogi Hill, then expanded around northern Nyanza. The people of Owiny' (\"Jok'Owiny\") and the people of Omolo (\"Jok'Omolo\") followed soon after (1598\u20131625).\nA miscellaneous group composed of the Suba, Sakwa, Asembo, Uyoma, and Kano then followed. The Suba originally were Bantu-speaking people who assimilated into Luo culture. They fled from the Buganda Kingdom in Uganda after the civil strife that followed the murder of the 24th Kabaka of Buganda in the mid-18th century and settled in South Nyanza, especially at Rusinga and Mfangano islands. Luo speakers crossed Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria from northern Nyanza into South Nyanza starting in the early 17th century.\nEastern Nilotic settlement in East Africa.\nThe Maasai inhabit the African Great Lakes region and arrived via South Sudan. Most Nilotic speakers in the area, including the Maasai, the Turkana and the Kalenjin, are pastoralists and have a reputation as fearsome warriors and cattle rustlers. The Maasai and other groups in East Africa have adopted customs and practices from neighbouring Cushitic-speaking groups, including the age-set system of social organisation, circumcision, and vocabulary terms.\nMany ethnic groups that had already formed settlements in the region were forcibly displaced by the incoming Maasai. Other, mainly Southern Cushitic groups, were assimilated into Maasai society. The Nilotic ancestors of the Kalenjin likewise absorbed some early Cushitic populations.\nThe Maasai territory reached its largest size in the mid-19th century and covered almost all of the Great Rift Valley and adjacent lands from Mount Marsabit in the north to Dodoma in the south. At this time the Maasai, as well as the larger Nilotic group they were part of, raised cattle as far east as the Tanga coast in Tanganyika (now mainland Tanzania). Raiders used spears and shields but were most feared for throwing clubs (orinka) which could be accurately thrown from up to 70 paces (approx. 100 metres). In 1852, there was a report of a concentration of 800 Maasai warriors on the move in what is now Kenya. In 1857, after having depopulated the \"Wakuafi wilderness\" in what is now southeastern Kenya, Maasai warriors threatened Mombasa on the Kenyan coast.\nBecause of this migration, the Maasai are the southernmost Nilotic speakers.\nSouthern Nilotic settlement in East Africa.\nStarting in the mid-19th century, European anthropologists and later Kenyan historians have been interested in the origins of human migration from various parts of Africa into East Africa. One of the more notable broad-based theories emanating from these studies includes the Bantu expansion. The main tools of study have been linguistics, archaeology and oral traditions.\nThe significance of tracing individual clan histories in order to get an idea of Kalenjin groups formation has been shown by scholars such as B.E. Kipkorir (1978). He argued that the Tugen first settled in small clan groups, fleeing from war, famine, and disease, and that they arrived from western, eastern, and northern sections. Even a section among the Tugen claims to have come from Mount Kenya.\nThe Nandi account on the settlement of Nandi displays a similar manner of occupation of the Nandi territory. The Kalenjin clans who moved into and occupied the Nandi area, thus becoming the Nandi tribe, came from a wide array of Kalenjin-speaking areas.\nApparently, spatial core areas existed to which people moved and concentrated over the centuries, and in the process evolved into the individual Kalenjin communities known today by adopting migrants and assimilating original inhabitants.\nSeveral early ethnographic accounts from the various Kalenjin sub tribes point to Tulwetab/Tulwop Kony (Mount Elgon) as their original point of settlement in Kenya. This point of origin appears as a central theme in most narratives recorded after the colonial period. One of the more famous accounts states:\n...\u00a0The Kalenjin originated from a country in the north known as Emet ab Burgei, which means, the warm country. The people are said to have traveled southwards passing through Mount Elgon or Tulwet ab Kony in Kalenjin. The Sabaot settled around the slopes of the mountain while the others travelled on in search of better land. The Keiyo and Marakwet settled in Kerio Valley and Cherangani Hills. The Pokot settled on the northern side of Mount Elgon and later spread to areas north of Lake Baringo. At Lake Baringo, the Tugen separated from the Nandi and the Kipsigis. This was during a famine known as Kemeutab Reresik, which means, famine of the bats. It is said that during this famine a bat brought blades of green grass which was taken as a sign of good omen signifying that famine could be averted through movement to greener pastures. The Tugen moved and settled around Tugen Hills while the Kipsigis and the Lembus Nandi moved to Rongai area. The Kipsigis and Nandi are said to have lived as a united group for a long time but eventually were forced to separate due to antagonistic environmental factors. Some of these were droughts and invasion of the Maasai from Uasin Gishu.\nCulture and religion.\nThe culture of Nilotic peoples is diverse yet exhibits broad commonalities rooted in their shared linguistic and historical heritage. Nilotic cultures are traditionally pastoralist, with strong emphasis on cattle, age-grade systems, oral traditions, and spiritual practices. These cultures have adapted over time to a range of environments from the Nile Valley and the Sudd wetlands to the East African highlands and savannahs.\nSocial organization.\nNilotic societies are traditionally organized along clan and lineage lines, often with a patrilineal descent system. Age-sets and initiation rituals structure communal life, conferring social responsibilities and identity. In many groups\u2014such as the Maasai, Turkana, Nuer, and Dinka\u2014age-set systems determine leadership, military roles, and generational continuity.\nWhile political centralization varies, leadership is often distributed among councils of elders, ritual specialists, and in some cases, divine or semi-divine kings (e.g., among the Shilluk). Kinship ties remain crucial, and exogamous marriage practices reinforce alliances between clans or sections.\nLivelihoods: cattle and cultivation.\nWhile Nilotic peoples are often described as pastoralist, most communities in fact maintain dual economies, combining livestock herding with subsistence agriculture. Cattle hold deep symbolic and ritual significance and many Nilotes today continue to practice pastoralism, migrating on a seasonal basis with their herds of livestock but crop cultivation remains equally essential to everyday survival. Some Nilotic communities are known for the practice of cattle raiding.\nThe deep historical roots of Nilotic agriculture may extend much further back than commonly assumed. In one particularly evocative passage, Pliny the Elder (, ca. 77 CE) describes a people who \"imbibe their drink through the stalk of the oat, which grows spontaneously and supplies them with its grain for food.\" This likely reflects a rudimentary form of wild grain exploitation or proto-cultivation\u2014potentially one of the earliest Greco-Roman observations of forager-cultivators in eastern Sudan or South Sudan. While Nilotic traditions consistently emphasize sorghum as their ancestral grain, Pliny, unfamiliar with African cereals, likened it to the oat. His description\u2014of a self-growing stalk used for both food and drink\u2014closely matches sorghum, whose domestication and cultural significance are deeply rooted in Nilotic societies.\nThe Dinka (Jieng) of South Sudan are widely known for their cattle-centric culture, yet agriculture plays a significant, and often underappreciated, role in their livelihood. Sorghum is the staple crop, traditionally grown in family plots surrounding the homestead. Other crops include okra, sesame, pumpkin, cow peas, maize, cassava, groundnuts, beans, watermelons, millet, and tobacco. Both men and women engage in cultivation, with women often responsible for brewing sorghum beer and managing large gardens.\nAmong groups like the Jie of northeastern Uganda, sorghum is considered an ancient crop of divine origin. Elders maintain that \"God created sorghum and cattle on the same day,\" underscoring its foundational role in Jie cosmology. Although other crops\u2014such as maize, sim-sim (sesame), groundnuts, and sweet potatoes\u2014are often regarded as more recent introductions (frequently attributed to contact with Lwo-speaking neighbors), they are cultivated to varying degrees, particularly by women. Scholars such as Gulliver and Dyson-Hudson have demonstrated that while agriculture and livestock are economically complementary, cattle dominate the ritual and sociopolitical spheres, which are traditionally controlled by men.\nThis pattern holds across other Nilotic groups. Evans-Pritchard, in his seminal ethnography of the Nuer, noted that \"cattle are the thread that runs through Nuer institutions, language, rites of passage, politics, economy, and allegiances,\" yet he also documented their cultivation of millet and other crops during lean times.\nThe Kalenjin, a Southern Nilotic group of the Kenyan highlands, also practice a semi-pastoral lifestyle, with both livestock herding and agriculture playing central roles. Their body of folklore contains within it the narrative of how they discovered sorghum grain cultivation. Today they are noted for being among the largest grain producers in the country.\nThis dual economy is often gendered: men primarily manage cattle, which confer prestige, political status, and ritual authority, while women tend to the fields, ensuring food security for the household. The cultural primacy of cattle, however, has historically shaped external perceptions, often obscuring the agricultural dimension of Nilotic life.\nReligion and cosmology.\nIn terms of religious beliefs, Nilotes primarily adhere to traditional faiths, Christianity and to a lesser extent Islam. Traditional Nilotic religions are typically monotheistic or henotheistic, centering around a high god associated with the sky or rain. For instance, the Dinka worship Nhialic, while the Nuer recognize Kwoth. Spirits of ancestors, nature deities, and other intermediary beings also play roles in ritual life.\nThe Dinka has a pantheon of deities includes a Supreme, Creator God, Nhialic, who is the God of the sky and rain, and the ruler of all the spirits.\nHe is believed to be present in all of creation, and to control the destiny of every human, plant, and animal on Earth. Nhialic is also known as Jaak, Juong, or Dyokin by other Nilotic groups, such as the Nuer and Shilluk. Dengdit or Deng, is the sky God of rain and fertility, empowered by Nhialic.\nDeng's mother is Abuk, the patron goddess of gardening and all women, represented by a snake. Garang, another deity, is believed or assumed by some Dinka to be a god suppressed by Deng. His spirits can cause most Dinka women, and some men, to scream. The term \"Jok\" refers to a group of ancestral spirits.\nIn the Lotuko mythology, the chief God is called Ajok. He is generally seen as kind and benevolent, but can be angered. He once reportedly answered a woman's prayer for the resurrection of her son. Her husband, however, was angry and killed the child. According to the Lotuko religion, Ajok was annoyed by the man's actions and swore never to resurrect any Lotuko again. As a result, death was said to have become permanent.\nRitual specialists, including prophets, diviners, and rainmakers, mediate between the community and the spiritual realm. Ceremonies mark key transitions in life\u2014birth, initiation, marriage, and death\u2014and often involve songs, dance, animal sacrifice, and invocation of ancestral spirits.\nChristianity and Islam have had a significant impact on many Nilotic communities since the 19th century, leading to religious pluralism and hybrid practices in contemporary settings.\nOral traditions and arts.\nNilotic cultures have rich oral traditions encompassing myths of origin, genealogies, epics, proverbs, and songs. These oral forms serve educational, historical, and moral functions, often reinforcing collective memory and identity.\nArtistic expression is visible in body adornment, scarification, beadwork, and wood carving. Dance and music are central to communal life, with drums, horns, and vocal polyphony featuring prominently in ceremonies.\nGender and initiation.\nVarious initiation rites mark the transition from childhood to adulthood. These rites confer full community membership and social roles.\nThrough lengthy interaction with neighbouring peoples, the Nilotes in East Africa have adopted many customs and practices from Southern Cushitic groups. The latter include the age set system of social organization and also the practice of circumcision as a form of initiation.\nHistorical continuity and change.\nDespite colonial disruptions, war, and displacement, Nilotic cultures have shown remarkable resilience and adaptability. Contemporary Nilotic societies are engaged in national politics, modern economies, and global diasporas while maintaining distinct cultural practices.\nGenetics.\nY DNA.\nA Y-chromosome study by Wood et al. (2005) tested various populations in Africa for paternal lineages, including 26 Maasai and 9 Luo from Kenya, and 9 Alur from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The signature Nilotic paternal marker Haplogroup A3b2 was observed in 27% of the Maasai, 22% of the Alur, and 11% of the Luo.\nHaplogroup B is another characteristically Nilotic paternal marker. It was found in 22% of Luo samples, 8% of Maasai, and 50% of Nuer peoples. The E1b1b haplogroup has been observed at overall frequencies around 11% among Nilo-Saharan-speaking groups in the Great Lakes area, with this influence concentrated among the Maasai (50%). This is indicative of substantial historic gene flow from Cushitic-speaking males into these Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations. 67% of the Alur samples possessed the E2 haplogroup.\nThe Y-DNA of populations in the Sudan region were studied, with various local Nilotic groups included for comparison. The signature Nilotic A and B clades were the most common paternal lineages amongst the Nilo-Saharan speakers, except those inhabiting western Sudan. There, a prominent North African influence was noted.\nHaplogroup A was observed amongst 62% of Dinka, 53.3% of Shilluk, 46.4% of Nuba, 33.3% of Nuer, 31.3% of Fur, and 18.8% of Masalit. Haplogroup B was found in 50% of Nuer, 26.7% of Shilluk, 23% of Dinka, 14.3% of Nuba, 3.1% of Fur, and 3.1% of Masalit. The E1b1b clade was also observed in 71.9% of the Masalit, 59.4% of the Fur, 39.3% of the Nuba, 20% of the Shilluk, 16.7% of the Nuer, and 15% of the Dinka. Balemi (2018) found that a sample of 50 Nuer carried e1b1b-M78 (32%), A-M13 (28%), B-M60 (24%) and F-M89 (4%).\nSolomon Balemi (2018)\nGenetic Study of LCT- Enhancer, Y chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Variation in Some Ethnic Groups in Ethiopia.\nThe atypically high frequencies of the haplogroup in the Masalit was attributed to either a recent population bottleneck, which likely altered the community's original haplogroup diversity, or to geographical proximity to E1b1b's place of origin in North Africa. The clade \"might have been brought to Sudan [...] after the progressive desertification of the Sahara around 6,000\u20138,000 years ago\". Similarly, Afro-Asiatic influence was seen in the Nilotic Datog of northern Tanzania, 43% of whom carried the M293 subclade of E1b1b.\nmtDNA.\nUnlike the paternal DNA of Nilotes, the maternal lineages of Nilotes in general show low-to-negligible amounts of Afro-Asiatic and other extraneous influences. An mtDNA study examined the maternal ancestry of various Nilotic populations in Kenya, with Turkana, Samburu, Maasai, and Luo individuals sampled. The mtDNA of almost all of the tested Nilotes belonged to various sub-Saharan macro-haplogroup L subclades, including L0, L2, L3, L4, and L5. Low levels of maternal gene flow from North Africa and the Horn of Africa were observed in a few groups, mainly by the presence of mtDNA haplogroup M and haplogroup I lineages in about 12.5% of the Maasai and 7% of the Samburu samples, respectively.\nAutosomal DNA.\nThe autosomal DNA of Nilotic peoples has been examined in a study on the genetic clusters of various populations in Africa. According to the researchers, Nilotes generally form their own African genetic cluster, although relatively most closely related to other Nilo-Saharan populations, more distantly followed by Afro-Asiatic speakers and Niger-Congo speakers. The authors also found that certain Nilotic populations in the eastern Great Lakes region, such as the Maasai, showed some additional Afro-Asiatic affinities due to repeated assimilation of Cushitic-speaking peoples over the past 5000 or so years.\nOverall, Nilotic people and other Nilo-Saharan groups are closely related to Afro-Asiatic speakers of North and East Africa. Both groups are inferred to have diverged from a common ancestor around 16,000 years ago. Nilotic people and other Nilo-Saharan groups are also closely related to Niger-Congo speakers of West and Central Africa. Both groups are inferred to have diverged from a common ancestor around 28,000 years ago, perhaps somewhere in the Sahel. Most Nilotic peoples have predominant to exclusive West/East African ancestry, although some groups display varying degrees of West-Eurasian admixture, mostly mediated indirectly through pastoralists from the Horn of Africa.\nAdmixture analysis.\nIn 121 African populations, four African American populations, and 60 non-African populations, results indicated a high degree of mixed ancestry reflecting migration events. In East Africa, all population groups examined had elements of Nilotic, Cushitic and Bantu ancestry amongst others to varying degrees. By and large, genetic clusters were consistent with linguistic classification with notable exceptions including the Luo of Kenya. Despite being Nilo-Saharan speakers, the Luo cluster with the Niger-Kordofanian-speaking populations that surround them. This indicates a high degree of admixture occurred during the southward migration of southern Luo. Kalenjin groups and Maasai groups were found to have less Bantu ancestry, but significant Cushitic ancestry.\nPhysiology.\nPhysically, Nilotes are noted for their typically very dark skin color and lean, and occasionally tall bodies. They often possess exceptionally long limbs, particularly their distal segments (fore arms, lower legs). Sudanese Nilotes are regarded as one of the tallest peoples in the world. Average values of for height and for weight were seen in a sample of Sudanese Shilluk. Another sample of Sudanese Dinka had a stature/weight ratio of and , with an extremely ectomorphic somatotype of 1.6\u20133.5\u20136.2.\nIn terms of facial features, the nasal profile most common amongst Nilotic populations is broad, with characteristically high index values ranging from 86.9 to 92.0. Lower nasal indices are often found amongst Nilotes who inhabit the more southerly Great Lakes region, such as the Maasai, which is attributed to genetic differences.\nAdditionally, the Nilotic groups presently inhabiting the African Great Lakes region are sometimes smaller in stature than those residing in the Sudan region. Measurements of and were found in a sample of agricultural Turkana in northern Kenya, and of and in pastoral Turkana. A height of was seen for Maasai in southern Kenya, with an extreme trunk/leg length ratio of 47.7.\nMany Nilotic groups excel in long- and middle-distance running. This sporting prowess may be related to their exceptional running economy, a function of slim body morphology and very long, slender legs (particularly lower legs, i.e., calf muscles and ankles.). For 404 elite Kenyan distance runners, 76% of the international-class respondents identified as part of the Kalenjin ethnic group and 79% spoke a Nilotic language.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in \"Tales of Suspense\" #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with \"Iron Man\" #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.\nIron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created in response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to create a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been used to explore political themes, with early Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War. The character's role as a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.\nMajor Iron Man stories include \"Demon in a Bottle\" (1979), \"Armor Wars\" (1987\u20131988), \"Extremis\" (2005), and \"Iron Man 2020\" (2020). He is also a leading character in the company-wide stories \"Civil War\" (2006\u20132007), \"Dark Reign\" (2008\u20132009), and \"Civil War II\" (2016). Additional superhero characters have emerged from Iron Man's supporting cast, including James Rhodes as War Machine and Riri Williams as Ironheart, as well as reformed villains, Natasha Romanova as Black Widow and Clint Barton as Hawkeye. Iron Man's list of enemies includes his archenemy, the Mandarin, various supervillains of communist origin, and many of Stark's business rivals.\nRobert Downey Jr. portrayed Tony Stark in \"Iron Man\" (2008), the first film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and continued to portray the character until his final live-action appearance in \"\" (2019). Downey's portrayal popularized the character, elevating Iron Man into one of Marvel's most recognizable superheroes. Other adaptations of the character appear in animated direct-to-video films, television series, and video games.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPublication history.\nCreation.\nFollowing the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics created new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man. He wanted to design a character who should be unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the character anyway. Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character's backstory. The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam during Iron Man's creation as \"a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil\".\nLarry Lieber developed Iron Man's origin and wrote the first Iron Man story, while Jack Kirby and Don Heck were responsible for the initial design. Lee modeled Iron Man after businessman Howard Hughes, invoking his physical appearance, his image as a businessman, and his reputation as an arrogant playboy. Kirby and Heck then incorporated elements of the actor Errol Flynn's physical appearance in the design. When first designing the character, Lee wanted to create a modernized Arthurian knight. Kirby initially drew the Iron Man armor as a \"round and clunky gray heap\", and Heck modified the design to incorporate gadgets such as jets, drills, and suction cups. The Iron Man character was created at a time when comic book characters were first depicted struggling with real-life problems, and his heart injury was an early example of a superhero with a physical disability.\nEarly years.\nIron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series \"Tales of Suspense\". Marvel premiered several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero comics became more popular than traditional science-fiction and horror comics. Iron Man's first appearance, \"Iron Man is Born!\", appeared in \"Tales of Suspense\" #39, released in December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date. Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, Marvel changed it to gold because of issues with printing. Lee initially delegated the writing duties to other creators at Marvel, but he felt their work was substandard; as with his other characters, Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he could write the stories himself.\nOnce Marvel's distributor allowed the company more monthly releases, \"The Avengers\" (1963) was developed as a new comic book series. Iron Man was one of the five characters who formed the titular superhero team. By 1965, the difficulty of maintaining continuity between \"The Avengers\" and the members' solo titles prompted Lee to temporarily write the original cast out of \"The Avengers\", including Iron Man.\nHeck continued as the primary Iron Man artist until 1965, as Kirby had obligations to other Marvel properties. As part of a shuffling to match artists with the characters they were most suited for, Steve Ditko briefly became the artist for Iron Man. He was responsible for only three issues in late 1963, but in this time he redesigned Iron Man's suit from fully gold to the red and gold color scheme that became the character's primary image. Iron Man's recurring nemesis, the Mandarin, first appeared shortly after in \"Tales of Suspense\" #50 (1964). By this time, the science-fiction and horror stories were phased out from \"Tales of Suspense\", and the series ran only Iron Man and Captain America stories. Gene Colan became the artist for Iron Man in January 1966, bringing with him an expressionist style.\nFor the first five years of publication, Iron Man represented the United States in Cold War allegories. Growing opposition to the American involvement in Vietnam prompted a shift in Iron Man's characterization, which was part of a larger push by Marvel in the late 1960s to be more apolitical. Over the years, the letters to the editor column in several issues saw extensive political debate. Lee shifted the stories' focus to espionage and domestic crime, incorporating Marvel's fictional intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. He also incorporated the villains of other Marvel heroes, avoiding Iron Man's primarily communist rogues' gallery and rewriting some of Iron Man's communist villains to have personal motivations independent of their communist allegiances.\nIron Man was one of several characters whom Marvel gave a full-length dedicated series in 1968. Marvel combined the final issues of \"Tales of Suspense\" and the Sub-Mariner's \"Tales to Astonish\" into a one-shot special, \"Iron Man and Sub-Mariner\". \"Iron Man\" then began its run under writer Archie Goodwin. Goodwin reintroduced political themes slowly over the following years, with a focus on domestic issues like racial conflict and environmentalism rather than geopolitics. George Tuska started illustrating the character in \"Iron Man\" #5 (1968) and intermittently served as artist for much of the 1970s. In total, he drew over one hundred issues for the character.\n1970s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI don't feel Tony Stark is a dinosaur, a creature unable to change before the weight of time crushes him aside. Yeah, it is hard in 1977 to praise a millionaire industrialist, playboy and former munitions-manufacturer\u2014but it isn't impossible to change that image. Which is what I plan to do.\n Bill Mantlo\n, \"Iron Man #100\"\nWhen Goodwin became Marvel's editor-in-chief, he assigned Gerry Conway as the writer for \"Iron Man\". Conway was the first of several writers in a four-year effort to reform Iron Man, beginning in 1971, with stories that directly addressed the character's history as a weapons manufacturer. These stories were especially prominent during a run by Mike Friedrich, in which corporate reform of Stark Industries was a recurring subplot.\nIron Man was one of several Marvel characters who declined in popularity during the 1970s, and the series went a period of time without a dedicated writer until Bill Mantlo took over in 1977. The following year, David Michelinie and Bob Layton took charge of the series, beginning with issue #116. While inking the series, Layton used issues of \"GQ\", \"Playboy\", and electronics catalogues as visual references, which he and Michelinie used to stay informed on developments in real world technology so the Iron Man armor would always be a more advanced version of what existed. Layton was inspired by the vast collection of specialized outfits used by Batman when designing Iron Man's various armors.\nIn \"Iron Man\" #117 and #118 (1978), Michelinie and Layton replaced many elements that developed over the series' run: they removed Iron Man's romantic interest Whitney Frost and Stark's robotic Life Model Decoy doubles, and they had Stark move to a different home. They introduced Iron Man's new romantic interest, Bethany Cabe, as a feminist character who worked as his bodyguard. Their goal was to push the character toward a more grounded, realistic portrayal. The largest change they made was to make Iron Man an alcoholic, an unprecedented move for a major comic book hero, which led to the \"Demon in a Bottle\" story arc that ran from issues #120 to #128 (1979). At the same time, they introduced the character Justin Hammer, who provided financial backing for several Iron Man villains.\n1980s and 1990s.\nMichelinie and Layton remained on the series until \"Iron Man\" #153 (1981). Michelinie later said, \"The reason I quit is that we felt we'd done everything with it that we'd set out to do.\" Through the 1980s, writers for Iron Man focused on the character's role as a businessman, reflecting the economic changes associated with Reaganomics, and many of his challenges involved threats to his company. Denny O'Neil was put in charge of \"Iron Man\" beginning with issue #158 (1982). His run explored Stark's psychology, having him relapse into alcoholism and suffer at the hands of business rival Obadiah Stane. O'Neil wrote Stark out of the role entirely beginning with issue #170 (1983), having him temporarily retire as Iron Man and replacing him with his ally James Rhodes. Stark was relegated as a side character until he returned to heroism in \"Iron Man\" #200 (1985).\nThe 1987 \"Armor Wars\" story arc followed Iron Man as he reclaimed his technology, which Justin Hammer distributed to several villains. This story blended the character's superhero and businessman aspects more directly when Stark sought legal recourse against his rivals. Michelinie and Layton returned to the series with issue #215 (1988) through issue #232 (1989). Again, they experimented with variations on the Iron Man armor and focused on down to Earth stories with realistic situations.\nIn 1990, Michelinie and Layton handed the series over to John Byrne, one of the most highly regarded comic book writers at the time. He wrote three story arcs across 20 issues: \"Armor Wars II\" (which had already been announced by Michelinie and Layton), \"The Dragon Seed Saga\", and \"War Games\". Byrne revisited Iron Man's opposition to communism but portrayed it as less of a threat, and he rewrote Iron Man's origin to remove references to communism and the Vietnam War. He lost interest in the series by 1992 as his collaborators John Romita Jr. and Howard Mackie had moved on to other projects. Iron Man's supporting character War Machine was spun off into his own comic book series in 1994.\nThe \"Iron Man\" series rejected broader ideological themes by the 1990s, and individualist values replaced Stark's allegiance to American democracy for its own sake. He remained anti-communist, reiterating his support for democracy and refusing to do business in China following the Tiannamen Square Massacre in 1989. The absence of Cold War politics was not immediately replaced by another theme, and post-Cold War Iron Man stories often explored different ideas regarding technology for a short time before moving on. When terrorism became more prominent in the public mind, writers shifted Iron Man's symbolism from anti-communism to anti-terrorism.\nAs part of a company-wide reorganization in 1996, Marvel's major characters, including Iron Man, were given to former Marvel writers Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld in a profit-sharing agreement. Lee and Liefeld were given charge of the \"Heroes Reborn\" branding that renumbered Marvel's long-running periodicals at issue #1. This new \"Iron Man\" series, labeled volume two, was set in an alternate universe created during the \"Onslaught\" event. It ran for 13 issues, written by Lee and Scott Lobdell and illustrated by Whilce Portacio. The following year, Marvel introduced the \"Heroes Return\" event to bring the characters back from the alternate universe, which again reset characters such as Iron Man to issue #1. Kurt Busiek became the writer for volume three while Sean Chen was the artist.\n2000s.\nWhen the Ultimate Marvel imprint was created with reimagined versions of Marvel's characters, an alternate Iron Man appeared in 2002 with the Ultimates, the imprint's adaptation of the Avengers. Marvel released a five-issue limited series, \"Ultimate Iron Man\", featuring this character in 2005.\nIron Man represented an attempt to define what a superhero was in the 21st century, following the September 11 attacks, implicitly likening the fear of terrorism to the fear of unregulated super-powered beings. In 2004, Iron Man was a major character in the \"Avengers Disassembled\" event and subsequently became a founding member of the New Avengers. \"Iron Man\" volume four began in 2005, with Warren Ellis as the writer and Adi Granov as the artist. Its first story arc, \"Extremis\", saw Iron Man upgrade his body directly through the Extremis virus, giving him direct control over a biological armor. The volume's first 14 issues carried the \"Iron Man\" title, while issues #15\u201332 (2007\u20132008) were titled \"Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"\nIron Man led the pro-registration faction during the 2006 \"Civil War\" crossover event by Mark Millar and Steve McNiven. In an allegory for the Patriot Act and government surveillance, Iron Man's pro-registration faction represented conservative support for government surveillance in the name of security and stood against Captain America's anti-registration faction that represented individualism and liberal opposition to government surveillance. Iron Man believed in pragmatically choosing the lesser of two evils, whereas Captain America held an idealist approach, and both held these positions at great personal cost. While Marvel was neutral between the characters, readers overwhelmingly saw Iron Man as the villain, being the stronger force that the underdog had to overcome.\nIron Man appeared with the Mighty Avengers in 2007, and his characterization in this era leaned into his identity as a futurist. Marvel restarted Iron Man's comic book run with \"Invincible Iron Man\" in 2008, written by Matt Fraction and illustrated by Salvador Larroca. This series launched around the same time as the film \"Iron Man\" premiered, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe developed while this run was in publication.\n2010s and 2020s.\nThe \"Iron Man\" series reverted to the original numbering in 2011, when the overall 500th issue was published as \"Iron Man\" #500. A concurrent series, \"Iron Man Legacy\" by Fred Van Lente, was launched in 2010 leading up to the release of the film \"Iron Man 2\". Iron Man was then one of several characters whose series was relaunched at issue #1 with the Marvel Now! branding following the 2012 \"Avengers vs. X-Men\" event, written by Kieron Gillen. The 2014 \"AXIS\" event led into the \"Superior Iron Man\" series by Tom Taylor, featuring Iron Man with a new reversed personality.\nA new \"Invincible Iron Man\" run written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by David Marquez began in 2015. A simultaneous Iron Man series, \"International Iron Man\", ran for seven issues in 2016 under Marvel's \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" branding, also by Bendis. This series was meant to ensure Iron Man's status as a major character as \"All-New, All-Different\" developed. A second \"Civil War\" event in 2016 portrayed Iron Man as an advocate of free will against Captain Marvel's determinism.\nAs part of a broader trend by Marvel Comics to substitute its main characters with a diverse cast of original characters in the 2010s, Iron Man was temporarily replaced by Ironheart, a teenaged African-American girl who reverse-engineered the Iron Man armor, in 2016. At the same time, the series \"Infamous Iron Man\" began publication with Doctor Doom as Iron Man.\nThe series \"Tony Stark: Iron Man\" premiered in 2018 with the Fresh Start branding, written by Dan Slott and illustrated by Valerio Schiti. In 2020, Iron Man was relaunched in a new series, written by Christopher Cantwell and illustrated by CAFU, following the \"Iron Man 2020\" event. This series moved away from the developments and deviations made to Stark's character introduced over the previous years\u2014including the more extravagant science fiction and soap opera plots\u2014creating a clean slate for new story arcs in a traditional superhero setting. The character was relaunched again in 2022 with \"Invincible Iron Man\", written by Gerry Duggan and illustrated by Juan Frigeri. A new volume was launched in October 2024, written by Spencer Ackerman and illustrated by Julius Ohta.\nCharacterization.\nFictional character biography.\nAnthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark was born on Long Island, New York. As a child, he inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, when his parents were killed in a car crash. Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man. The war zone Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a \"sliding scale of continuity\" in which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first decades of Iron Man's publication history. This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian country in the 1990s, and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.\nIron Man returns to the United States and becomes a superhero, convincing the public Iron Man is Stark's bodyguard. When he is called to stop the Hulk and learns Loki is behind the Hulk's attack, he joins forces with the Hulk, Thor, Ant-Man, and the Wasp to defeat Loki, and they agree to form a superhero team, the Avengers. He also helps found the intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., providing the organization with equipment. Iron Man then undergoes surgery to replace the damaged portions of his heart, eliminating the need for his prosthetic chest plate. As he comes to regret his involvement in weapons manufacturing, Stark Industries is changed to Stark International, an electronics company that emphasizes environmentalism and ending world hunger. S.H.I.E.L.D. attempts to take over the business and return it to weapons manufacturing. At the same time, Iron Man is framed for murder. These stresses cause him to begin drinking, and he develops alcoholism. Though he gets sober, he relapses because of a plot orchestrated by his business rival Obadiah Stane. Iron Man briefly loses his company to Stane, passes the Iron Man mantle to his ally James Rhodes, and becomes homeless. After Stark recovers, Stane adopts an armored suit and becomes the Iron Monger before being defeated. Iron Man then founds a space technology company, Stark Enterprises. When Iron Man learns Justin Hammer had acquired the Iron Man armor's technology, he seeks out all the other armors. The resulting fights leave Iron Man a fugitive, leading him to fake his death and then describe himself as a new Iron Man.\nWhen Iron Man is shot in the spine and paralyzed, he develops a new prosthesis that grants him mobility. This prosthesis is hacked and controlled remotely, causing neurological damage that appears for a time to kill him. Rhodes temporarily becomes Stark's chosen successor as Iron Man. After returning, Immortus places Stark under his control and turns him evil. The Avengers bring an alternate Tony Stark from another reality to help defeat him. Iron Man is killed and the alternate Tony Stark becomes the new Iron Man, but Franklin Richards merges both versions into a single being when he rewrites reality. Stark's company is bought out at this point, so he starts a consulting firm, Stark Solutions. His secret identity is revealed to the public shortly afterwards. He is then appointed Secretary of Defense until the Scarlet Witch alters his mind, causing him to behave drunkenly at the United Nations and leave in disgrace. When Mallen becomes a threat through the Extremis project, Iron Man has Maya Hansen inject him with the Extremis virus, giving him a biological armor he can control with his mind.\nIron Man serves as the Superhero Registration Act's enforcer upon its enactment, creating a schism between superheroes, with Iron Man leading proponents of registration against a group of resistors led by Captain America. After the conflict, Iron Man becomes head of S.H.I.E.L.D. The government dismantles S.H.I.E.L.D. after it fails to prevent an alien invasion, but Iron Man refuses to turn over the list of registered heroes to its corrupt successor agency H.A.M.M.E.R. This agency is dismantled as well, and Iron Man organizes the Avengers to replace these agencies. He founds a clean energy company, Stark Resilient, and fakes his death so his enemies will not threaten it. He joins the Guardians of the Galaxy for a time, and upon returning to Earth, he discovers he had actually been adopted by the Starks so their biological son could be hidden from an alien threat.\nWhile they fight Red Skull, a spell cast by Victor von Doom and the Scarlet Witch temporarily inverts the personalities of several heroes. The new morally corrupt Iron Man protects himself from the counterspell and takes over San Francisco to augment the residents with Extremis. When a man is discovered who can see the future, the superhero community undergoes another schism, and Iron Man leads a team of heroes opposed to a predetermined justice system based on his ability. The battle ends with Iron Man in a coma. A reformed Victor von Doom becomes Iron Man, while an artificial intelligence backup of Stark's mind guides a new armored superhero, Ironheart. Stark resumes his work as Iron Man after the technology in his body allows him to heal. He then allies with Emma Frost and marries her to set a trap for their common enemy Feilong.\nPersonality and motivations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe really thought about how we needed to give him a weakness. It wasn't hip to have him running out of energy and looking for a light socket every few pages, or having a heart attack every time Ultimo was fighting him. So we discussed it and we thought that we would give him the corporate man's disease [alcoholism]. Something that would always haunt him.\n Bob Layton\nIron Man is a businessman and entrepreneur who seeks to innovate and improve his technology, both for society's benefit and his own. Iron Man is one of many Marvel heroes with a genius-level intellect, but his focus on societal application alongside hard science distinguishes him from other heroes. The character is a futurist, and he works to identify solutions for problems that have yet to emerge. This preemptive problem-solving was a driving force in his organization of the Avengers and later in his support for the Superhero Registration Act during the \"Civil War\" event.\nStark's intelligence and engineering skills allowed him to construct the Iron Man armor, and he believes this justifies his authority over the armor and who uses it. While Iron Man sometimes develops equipment for other superheroes, he is selective about who can use the armor, trusting only a few close allies. In the 2008 story \"The Five Nightmares,\" Iron Man narrates his five greatest fears: relapse into alcoholism, reproduction of the Iron Man technology, other people becoming Iron Man, the technology becoming disposable, and that someone else would be distributing this technology. Besides the danger such scenarios pose, they all represent fear of losing power over himself or his technology.\nIron Man finds machines easier to interact with than humans, believing machines can be more easily controlled and repaired. This leads him to engage in self-destructive behavior, giving his relationships as Tony Stark lower priority and failing to be accountable for his creations as Iron Man. His isolation comes to him from two directions, with both his celebrity status and his role as Iron Man making personal relationships difficult. Through both poor decisions and bad luck, he is unable to maintain romantic relationships despite his wealth and talents. Writer Dennis O'Neil described the Iron Man armor as \"a psychological crutch preventing him from dealing with his own inner demons\". He identifies with the Iron Man armor as an extension of himself, believing the image it presents is his own image, and he considers himself responsible any time someone uses the technology.\nIron Man behaves differently as a superhero and as a civilian, engaging in courageous and selfless acts as Iron Man but morally ambiguous behavior as Stark. The character represents a traditional understanding of American masculinity as a businessman and a playboy, particularly as it was seen in the Cold War. This characterization also manifests in negative traits that were prominent in early Iron Man stories, including belligerence, negligence, and misogyny. Stark has several character flaws emerging from his impulsivity and arrogance, engaging in vices that include excessive drinking, partying, and womanizing.\nIron Man's heart injury was prominent in his early characterization, causing him to isolate himself so as not to reveal his injury or his secret identity. This weakness was a threat to his autonomy and his masculinity. As real-world medical technology made heart injuries less fatal, writers introduced neurological damage and alcoholism as other medical weaknesses. Despite this, Iron Man considers himself lucky and believes he lives \"a good life,\" attributing this to his money, friendships, engineering skills, and recovering health.\nIron Man's belief in progress sometimes manifests as opposition to the press and politicians, whose attempts to keep him accountable hamper his efforts as a superhero. He is conflicted between his support for the rule of law and his moral beliefs in doing what he feels must be done for the greater good. When he engages in unsanctioned attacks against those who co-opted his technology in the \"Armor Wars\" story, he describes it as \"a tough decision; perhaps the toughest in my life.\" The character's morally ambiguous nature can make him more accessible to readers relative to other superheroes who are more inherently virtuous.\nThemes and motifs.\nPolitics and economics.\nIron Man was more overtly political than other Silver Age Marvel characters. Lee wrote the character to represent liberal capitalism, fighting against communism and other anti-democratic forces. Though anti-communist sentiments were present throughout Marvel Comics, they appeared most prominently in Iron Man stories. After Marvel shifted away from addressing foreign conflicts toward the end of the 1960s, Iron Man was portrayed as a liberal who was skeptical of the U.S. government, yet also opposed radicalism; at the time associated with 1960s counterculture. Marvel portrayed Iron Man as more self-doubting, questioning when the use of force is justified against communism. By 1975, Iron Man opposed the Vietnam War, which gave the character a new motivation in making up for his promotion of violence in the past. Iron Man's use of his vast resources as a protector was reframed as a cautionary tale, in which these resources could be co-opted to do harm. His motivation for providing weapons to the government was retroactively changed so Stark only got involved because he believed it would end the war more quickly. Over time, writers portrayed Iron Man as a philanthropist.\nThe dual role of Iron Man and Tony Stark allows for the examination of both the perspective of an individual inventor and that of the bureaucracy of governments and corporations, respectively. His business Stark Industries is depicted as a force for good that advances scientific knowledge through capitalist innovation. The Iron Man persona itself, as well as the technology Iron Man uses, are proprietary assets owned by Stark Industries. Reflecting his characterization as a businessman, Iron Man stories often invoke themes of economic competition, seeing him face characters who try to develop better versions of the Iron Man armor. Many of Iron Man's challenges involve corrupt business rivals and corporate espionage.\nTechnology.\nTechnology and its influence on society are common themes in Iron Man stories, and various writers have portrayed him as a technological marvel since his earliest appearances. The character's use of technology, both as a weapons manufacturer and as Iron Man, explores problems that arise from progress and advancement, including misuse of technology and the implications of cybernetics. Iron Man's position within the suit allows for discussion regarding automation versus human oversight of technology, and it reflects the debate on how new technologies are incorporated into public and military use, including the use of exoskeletons and battle suits. These technological themes are explored through a modern lens during the \"Extremis\" story arc, which incorporates the idea of human enhancement through biotechnology.\nDepictions of technology in Iron Man stories have often endorsed its use to alter the natural world. This is in contrast with Silver Age Marvel stories, where radiation and other technological advancements were portrayed as dangerous. Iron Man's engineering talent is key to his heroism, unlike other heroes who use engineering to supplement superhuman abilities. This makes it more plausible that something like Iron Man could exist in the real world, as it is only technological advancement that separates Iron Man from reality. Iron Man's power of flight is especially significant in the technology's symbolism, as it associates traditional heroic imagery with a technological component, giving this power to a man who created it himself in a transcendental fashion.\nArmor.\nIron Man does not have any superhuman abilities. Instead, he derives his strength from a powered armor of his own design. The armor is equipped with various weapons, which include \"repulsor rays\" in each palm that project particle beams as well as a stronger \"unibeam\" on his chest. As of 2010, Marvel described Iron Man's armor as being able to lift 100 tons and to fly at Mach 8.\nMarvel initially depicted the armor as powered by transistors, but this was replaced with integrated circuits as real-world technology advanced. New designs have further miniaturized the technology, ultimately incorporating nanotechnology. Developments in the armor's design often reflect real-world advances in technology and trends in science fiction. The changing nature of the armor allows artists to make frequent changes to the character's appearance without controversy. Iron Man has also created specialized models for specific purposes, including space armor, stealth armor, and deep sea armor, as well as the Hulkbuster armor to engage in combat with the Hulk.\nPrior to Iron Man's surgery, the armor's primary function was to produce a magnetic field that protected his heart from the shrapnel in his body. His efforts to keep it charged and to keep it secret drove the story's plot. From its first appearance, Stark has controlled the armor by linking it to his brainwaves, and he must calibrate it to any allies who use it. The armor is often shown to have some method of shrinking it down to make it portable when not being used.\nIron Man stories contrast the armor's strength and the vulnerability of the human inside it. The armor protects Iron Man externally from attacks, but it also protected him internally when it kept his heart beating. The form-fitting design of many Iron Man armors emphasizes this with a human figure in an otherwise robotic-looking character.\nDuring the \"Extremis\" story arc, Iron Man adopted a biotechnological armor embedded in his DNA and stored in his bones. This allowed him to summon the armor from within his body and control it with his mind, effectively giving him superhuman abilities. This reduced the input lag between his brain and his armor, allowed him to mentally interface with any technology in the world, and gave him the focus to engage in several unrelated tasks at once. The Extremis technology also converted Iron Man's mind into a digital storage device to create a back up of his memories. It also presented a weakness, as Iron Man's archnemesis Mandarin was able to access and manipulate the data. Iron Man gave up the Extremis armor after it was compromised with a computer virus by the Skrulls, who used it to disable Earth's defenses during an invasion.\nSupporting characters.\nAllies.\nPepper Potts is a Stark Industries employee who Stark promoted to his executive assistant. The original portrayal of the character was that of a simple love interest and damsel in distress. She came to manage the business herself, as Stark had little interest in his responsibilities. When Stark became Iron Man and took responsibility for his company, she taught him how to manage the business. When Pepper was injured by an explosion and received a heart injury similar to Iron Man's, he installed the arc reactor technology in her. She eventually became the CEO of Stark Industries. Iron Man secretly worked on a suit of armor to be powered by her arc reactor, and she discovered it in a Stark Industries lab while she had control of the company. Taking the armor, she became the superhero Rescue.\nJames Rhodes was an employee of Stark's. He first appeared in 1979 and was developed as a supporting character in 1981. He briefly became Iron Man while Stark was relapsing on alcoholism. Later on, when Stark was near death, he gave Rhodes his corporation and the War Machine armor. Stark let Rhodes keep the armor, and Rhodes became the superhero War Machine. Rhodes' dependency on Iron Man for his armor often constrains him as a supporting character to Stark, even in solo War Machine stories.\nHappy Hogan was hired as Stark's chauffeur after saving his life, and Happy later deduced Stark was Iron Man. Iron Man has other allies through his affiliation with the Avengers, including close personal relationships with Captain America, Ant-Man, and the Wasp. As Tony Stark, he is the benefactor of the Avengers, providing their headquarters at Avengers Mansion. Stark's butler, Edwin Jarvis, works for both Iron Man and the Avengers. During a period without Pepper, Stark hired a new secretary, Mrs. Arbogast. Iron Man is also supported by his artificial intelligence companions Jocasta and F.R.I.D.A.Y. His association with S.H.I.E.L.D. sees him working with its agents and leadership, including Nick Fury and Maria Hill. He has taken on other heroes as sidekicks, including Spider-Man and Jack of Hearts.\nOther characters in the Marvel Universe have taken up the Iron Man mantle besides Stark, including James Rhodes and Victor von Doom. The Iron Man armor itself came to life in the \"Mask in the Iron Man\" storyline, becoming violent before sacrificing itself to save Stark's life.\nRomantic interests.\nIron Man has had many romantic interests, most of which only last a short time. In the original \"Tales of Suspense\" run, Lee established a love triangle in which Stark and Happy were both romantically interested in Pepper. Happy eventually married Pepper. The series then introduced Roxie Gilbert, the sister of the villain Firebrand, as a romantic interest in the early 1970s. She was a foil for both Iron Man and Firebrand, representing non-violent activism.\nThe women associated with Iron Man became more independent as second-wave feminism encouraged Marvel's writers to create stronger female characters. Whitney Frost was Iron Man's romantic interest later in the 1970s until she turned against him as the villain Madame Masque. Bethany Cabe became Stark's love interest in 1978 as part of an overhaul of Iron Man's supporting cast, and she supported him during his period of alcoholism. Michelinie chose to remove Pepper as a love interest in favor of Cabe because he felt that Iron Man would be more interested in a strong woman. She left Iron Man after he saved her husband, who was presumed dead.\nStark was seduced by Indries Moomji, who was hired by Obadiah Stane to help ruin Stark, first appearing in issue #163 (1982). He later partnered with Rumiko Fujikawa, the daughter of a businessman who took over Stark Enterprises. Stark also began a relationship with his long time ally Janet van Dyne, the Wasp, whom he had briefly dated in the past before she learned he was Iron Man. A story arc in September 2023 saw Iron Man married to X-Men member Emma Frost as part of a plan to defeat the villain Feilong.\nVillains.\nIron Man's earliest villains were often affiliated with the Soviet government or otherwise associated with communism. In the first three years after Iron Man was created, one-third of his villains were communists. Some of these enemies were Soviet counterparts of Iron Man, such as Titanium Man and Crimson Dynamo, while others held leadership positions in communist states, such as the Red Barbarian and the real-life Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev, like most communists in the series, was drawn in caricature style as a brute who only sought power. Multiple communist villains, such as Crimson Dynamo, reformed and became heroes loyal to the United States to present Iron Man and liberal capitalism as more appealing and morally superior. Two prominent Marvel heroes, Soviet spy Black Widow and American street criminal Hawkeye, were introduced as Iron Man villains before reforming as heroes.\nMarvel introduced the Mandarin as a Chinese villain, incorporating racist Yellow Peril themes and stereotypes regarding China. Though he is an allegory for autocracy, the Mandarin was not created as another communist villain. Instead, any work he does with the Chinese government is purely in self-interest. Later on, the Mandarin was retroactively established as the man behind the kidnapping that created Iron Man. The Mandarin contrasts with Iron Man through his association with magic and mysticism instead of science and technology, and because he was born into nobility unlike Iron Man, who is a self-made man in line with American ideals.\nBeginning in the 1970s, Iron Man faced villains who represented social conflict and unrest, such as the anarchist Firebrand and the corrupt businessman Guardsman. He also faced villains representing concerns about technology, such as Ultimo. Stark's business pursuits have invited several supervillains who oppose Stark Industries instead of just Iron Man. These villains became prominent in the 1980s, and they were amplified by backlash to consumerism that emerged in the 1990s. Some of these villains wish to compete with the corporation and steal trade secrets, such as Spymaster, Whiplash, and Beetle. Others oppose the corporation on ideological grounds, such as Atom-Smasher.\nTony Stark's chief business rival is Obadiah Stane. Stark's application of business as an altruistic pursuit is contrasted with Stane's application as a selfish pursuit. Justin Hammer was introduced as another businessman to be Tony Stark's antithesis. Unlike Stark, Hammer avoids public attention and provides equipment for other villains instead of using it himself. Other major villains include Shockwave, the Controller, the Mauler, and Stilt-Man. A focus on terrorism introduced villains such as Zeke Stane, the son of Obadiah Stane who carried out terrorist attacks using suicide bombers.\nAlternate versions.\nOther versions of Iron Man exist in other universes as part of Marvel's multiverse. In the Ultimate Universe, an alternate version of Iron Man exists as a member of the Ultimates, the universe's counterpart of the Avengers. Iron Man 2020 is the superhero persona of Tony's cousin-once-removed Arno Stark, who is from an alternate future in which superheroes vanished in the 1980s. After becoming Iron Man, Arno traveled back in time to the primary Marvel Universe.\nReception and legacy.\nIron Man's appearances in the 1960s saw mixed reception from readers, many of whom criticized the character for his association with the United States military and the controversial Vietnam War. In response, Marvel rewrote the character in the 1970s to moderate his image and to have him directly reflect on his culpability in the harms caused by war. According to Lee, Iron Man was the most popular hero when reading fanmail from female readers, which he attributed to both the character's charisma and his tragic nature.\nMany stories featuring the character have achieved critical acclaim. \"Demon in a Bottle\" in \"Iron Man\" #120\u2013129 (1979) is celebrated as the definitive Iron Man story for exploring the depth of his character through his alcoholism. \"Doomquest\" in #149\u2013150 (1981) is a popular favorite for its lighter tone and its establishment of a rivalry between Iron Man and Doctor Doom. \"Armor Wars\" in #225\u2013232 (1987\u20131988) is credited for developing Iron Man's personality as someone willing to be more aggressive at the expense of his alliances and public trust. \"Extremis\" in \"Iron Man\" Vol. 4 #1\u20136 (2005\u20132006) is recognized as a landmark for a new modern era of Iron Man comics. Other celebrated stories include \"Deliverance\" in \"Iron Man\" #182 (1984), the \"Iron Monger Saga\" in \"Iron Man\" #190\u2013200 (1984\u20131985), and \"World's Most Wanted\" in \"Invincible Iron Man\" #8\u201319 (2009). Iron Man's characterization in \"Civil War\" (2006\u20132007) was received negatively, with most readers seeing him as the villain.\nIron Man became widely popular following the success of the 2008 film \"Iron Man\", which made him one of Marvel's most recognizable characters, and the film is credited with redefining the superhero film genre. Since then, many publishers have listed Iron Man among the top ten in lists of best superheroes and best Marvel characters. Iron Man's portrayal of futuristic technology has affected public image of how these technologies may develop. Heavy use of augmented reality interfaces by Iron Man, in his helmet's heads-up display and elsewhere, has informed public awareness of the technology. In 2019, a statue representing the character in his Iron Man armor was erected in Forte dei Marmi, Italy, to memorialize the character's actions in \"\" (2019) and as a reminder that \"the future of humanity depends on our decisions ... that all of us must be heroes!\".\nIn other media.\nIn 2008, a film adaptation titled \"Iron Man\" was released, starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and directed by Jon Favreau. \"Iron Man\" was met with positive reviews from film critics, grossing $318 million domestically and $585 million worldwide, and became the first in the long-running Marvel Cinematic Universe. Downey's casting was praised, as was his portrayal of the character; Downey's own recovery from substance abuse was seen as creating a personal connection with the character. Downey reprises his role in \"Iron Man 2\" (2010), \"Marvel's The Avengers\" (2012), \"Iron Man 3\" (2013), ' (2015), ' (2016), ' (2017), ' (2018), and \"\" (2019). Iron Man supporting characters are set to appear in their own Marvel Cinematic Universe titles, \"Ironheart\" and \"Armor Wars\".\nIron Man's first animated appearance was in a segment of the 1966 series \"The Marvel Super Heroes\", which adapted comic book drawings into animations, and has since been featured in the animated series \"Iron Man\" (1994\u20131996) and \"\" (2009\u20132012). He also made many appearances in other Marvel animated programs, particularly those featuring the Avengers, and there have been multiple Iron Man direct-to-video releases.\nIron Man has featured in several video games, including \"Iron Man\" (2008) and \"Iron Man 2\" (2010), which were released as adaptations of his Marvel Cinematic Universe films. He also featured in the PlayStation VR game \"Iron Man VR\" (2020). An Iron Man action-adventure game was announced in 2022 to be developed by Motive Studio. He also appeared in many other Marvel video games, such as those featuring the Avengers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67058", "revid": "1306550418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67058", "title": "Abdominal cavity", "text": "Body cavity in the abdominal area\nThe abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans and many other animals that contains organs. It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet, opening into the pelvis.\nStructure.\nOrgans.\nOrgans of the abdominal cavity include the stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, small intestine, kidneys, large intestine, and adrenal glands.\nPeritoneum.\nThe abdominal cavity is lined with a protective membrane termed the peritoneum. The inside wall is covered by the parietal peritoneum. The kidneys are located behind the peritoneum, in the retroperitoneum, outside the abdominal cavity. The viscera are also covered by visceral peritoneum.\nBetween the visceral and parietal peritoneum is the peritoneal cavity, which is a potential space. It contains a serous fluid called peritoneal fluid that allows motion. This motion is apparent of the gastrointestinal tract. The peritoneum, by virtue of its connection to the two (parietal and visceral) portions, gives support to the abdominal organs.\nThe peritoneum divides the cavity into numerous compartments. One of these the lesser sac is located behind the stomach and joins into the greater sac via the foramen of Winslow. Some of the organs are attached to the walls of the abdomen via folds of peritoneum and ligaments, such as the liver and others use broad areas of the peritoneum, such as the pancreas. The peritoneal ligaments are actually dense folds of the peritoneum that are used to connect viscera to viscera or viscera to the walls of the abdomen. They are named in such a way as to show what they connect typically. For example, the gastrocolic ligament connects the stomach and colon and the splenocolic ligament connects the spleen and the colon, or sometimes by their shape as the round ligament or triangular ligament.\nMesentery.\nMesenteries are folds of peritoneum that are attached to the walls of the abdomen and enclose viscera completely. They are supplied with plentiful amounts of blood. The three most important mesenteries are mesentery for the small intestine, the transverse mesocolon, which attaches the back portion of the colon to the abdominal wall, and the sigmoid mesocolon which enfolds the sigmoid colon.\nOmenta.\nThe omentum are specialized folds of peritoneum that enclose nerves, blood vessels, lymph channels, fatty tissue, and connective tissue. There are two omenta. First, is the greater omentum that hangs off of the transverse colon and greater curvature of the stomach. The other is the lesser omentum that extends between the stomach and the liver.\nClinical significance.\nAscites.\nWhen fluid collects in the abdominal cavity, this condition is called ascites. This is usually not noticeable until enough fluid has collected to distend the abdomen. The collection of fluid will cause pressure on the viscera, veins, and thoracic cavity. Treatment is directed at the cause of the fluid accumulation. One method is to decrease the portal vein pressure, especially useful in treating cirrhosis. Chylous ascites heals best if the lymphatic vessel involved is closed. Heart failure can cause recurring ascites.\nInflammation.\nAnother disorder is called peritonitis which usually accompanies inflammatory processes elsewhere. It can be caused by damage to an organ, or from a contusion to the abdominal wall from the outside or by surgery. It may be brought in by the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. The most common origin is the gastrointestinal tract. Peritonitis can be acute or chronic, generalized or localized, and may have one origin or multiple origins. The omenta can help control the spread of infection; however without treatment, the infection will spread throughout the cavity. An abscess may also form as a secondary reaction to an infection. Antibiotics have become an important tool in fighting abscesses; however, external drainage is usually required also.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67060", "revid": "11555324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67060", "title": "Hot spring", "text": "Spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater\nA hot spring, thermal spring, hydrothermal spring, or geothermal spring is a spring produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater onto the surface of the Earth. The groundwater is heated either by shallow bodies of magma (molten rock) or by circulation through faults to hot rock deep in the Earth's crust.\nHot spring water often contains large amounts of dissolved minerals. The chemistry of hot springs ranges from acid sulfate springs with a pH as low as 0.8, to alkaline chloride springs saturated with silica, to bicarbonate springs saturated with carbon dioxide and carbonate minerals. Some springs also contain abundant dissolved iron. The minerals brought to the surface in hot springs often feed communities of extremophiles, microorganisms adapted to extreme conditions, and it is possible that life on Earth had its origin in hot springs.\nHumans have made use of hot springs for bathing, relaxation, or medical therapy for thousands of years. However, some are hot enough that immersion can be harmful, leading to scalding and, potentially, death.\nDefinitions.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of a hot spring. For example, one can find the phrase \"hot spring\" defined as\nThe related term \"warm spring\" is defined as a spring with water temperature less than a hot spring by many sources, although Pentecost et al. (2003) suggest that the phrase \"warm spring\" is not useful and should be avoided. In 1923, Menzier proposed that a warm spring be defined as a thermal spring where the water is below that of the human body, but above that of the mean air temperature around the spring, though this definition is contested.\nSources of heat.\nWater issuing from a hot spring is heated geothermally, that is, with heat produced from the Earth's mantle. This takes place in two ways. In areas of high volcanic activity, magma (molten rock) may be present at shallow depths in the Earth's crust. Groundwater is heated by these shallow magma bodies and rises to the surface to emerge at a hot spring. However, even in areas that do not experience volcanic activity, the temperature of rocks within the earth increases with depth. The rate of temperature increase with depth is known as the geothermal gradient. If water percolates deeply enough into the crust, it will be heated as it comes into contact with hot rock. This generally takes place along faults, where shattered rock beds provide easy paths for water to circulate to greater depths.\nMuch of the heat is created by decay of naturally radioactive elements. An estimated 45 to 90 percent of the heat escaping from the Earth originates from radioactive decay of elements mainly located in the mantle. The major heat-producing isotopes in the Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232. In areas with no volcanic activity, this heat flows through the crust by a slow process of thermal conduction, but in volcanic areas, the heat is carried to the surface more rapidly by bodies of magma.\nA hot spring that periodically jets water and steam is called a geyser. In active volcanic zones such as Yellowstone National Park, magma may be present at shallow depths. If a hot spring is connected to a large natural cistern close to such a magma body, the magma may superheat the water in the cistern, raising its temperature above the normal boiling point. The water will not immediately boil, because the weight of the water column above the cistern pressurizes the cistern and suppresses boiling. However, as the superheated water expands, some of the water will emerge at the surface, reducing pressure in the cistern. This allows some of the water in the cistern to flash into steam, which forces more water out of the hot spring. This leads to a runaway condition in which a sizable amount of water and steam are forcibly ejected from the hot spring as the cistern is emptied. The cistern then refills with cooler water, and the cycle repeats.\nGeysers require both a natural cistern and an abundant source of cooler water to refill the cistern after each eruption of the geyser. If the water supply is less abundant, so that the water is boiled as fast as it can accumulate and only reaches the surface in the form of steam, the result is a fumarole. If the water is mixed with mud and clay, the result is a mud pot.\nAn example of a non-volcanic warm spring is Warm Springs, Georgia (frequented for its therapeutic effects by paraplegic U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who built the Little White House there). Here the groundwater originates as rain and snow (meteoric water) falling on the nearby mountains, which penetrates a particular formation (Hollis Quartzite) to a depth of and is heated by the normal geothermal gradient.\nChemistry.\nBecause heated water can hold more dissolved solids than cold water, the water that issues from hot springs often has a very high mineral content, containing everything from calcium to lithium and even radium. The overall chemistry of hot springs varies from \"alkaline chloride\" to \"acid sulfate\" to \"bicarbonate\" to \"iron-rich\", each of which defines an end member of a range of possible hot spring chemistries.\nAlkaline chloride hot springs are fed by hydrothermal fluids that form when groundwater containing dissolved chloride salts reacts with silicate rocks at high temperature. These springs have nearly neutral pH but are saturated with silica (). The solubility of silica depends strongly upon temperature, so upon cooling, the silica is deposited as geyserite, a form of opal (opal-A: ). This process is slow enough that geyserite is not all deposited immediately around the vent, but tends to build up a low, broad platform for some distance around the spring opening.\nAcid sulfate hot springs are fed by hydrothermal fluids rich in hydrogen sulfide (), which is oxidized to form sulfuric acid, . The pH of the fluids is thereby lowered to values as low as 0.8. The acid reacts with rock to alter it to clay minerals, oxide minerals, and a residue of silica.\nBicarbonate hot springs are fed by hydrothermal fluids that form when carbon dioxide () and groundwater react with carbonate rocks. When the fluids reach the surface, is rapidly lost and carbonate minerals precipitate as travertine, so that bicarbonate hot springs tend to form high-relief structures around their openings.\nIron-rich springs are characterized by the presence of microbial communities that produce clumps of oxidized iron from iron in the hydrothermal fluids feeding the spring.\nSome hot springs produce fluids that are intermediate in chemistry between these extremes. For example, mixed acid-sulfate-chloride hot springs are intermediate between acid sulfate and alkaline chloride springs and may form by mixing of acid sulfate and alkaline chloride fluids. They deposit geyserite, but in smaller quantities than alkaline chloride springs.\nFlow rates.\nHot springs range in flow rate from the tiniest \"seeps\" to veritable rivers of hot water. Sometimes there is enough pressure that the water shoots upward in a geyser, or fountain.\nHigh-flow hot springs.\nThere are many claims in the literature about the flow rates of hot springs. There are many more high flow non-thermal springs than geothermal springs. Springs with high flow rates include:\nEcosystems.\nHot springs often host communities of microorganisms adapted to life in hot, mineral-laden water. These include thermophiles, which are a type of extremophile that thrives at high temperatures, between . Further from the vent, where the water has had time to cool and precipitate part of its mineral load, conditions favor organisms adapted to less extreme conditions. This produces a succession of microbial communities as one moves away from the vent, which in some respects resembles the successive stages in the evolution of early life.\nFor example, in a bicarbonate hot spring, the community of organisms immediately around the vent is dominated by filamentous thermophilic bacteria, such as \"Aquifex\" and other Aquificales, that oxidize sulfide and hydrogen to obtain energy for their life processes. Further from the vent, where water temperatures have dropped below , the surface is covered with microbial mats thick that are dominated by cyanobacteria, such as \"Spirulina\", \"Oscillatoria\", and \"Synechococcus\", and green sulfur bacteria such as \"Chloroflexus\". These organisms are all capable of photosynthesis, though green sulfur bacteria produce sulfur rather than oxygen during photosynthesis. Still further from the vent, where temperatures drop below , conditions are favorable for a complex community of microorganisms that includes \"Spirulina\", \"Calothrix\", diatoms and other single-celled eukaryotes, and grazing insects and protozoans. As temperatures drop close to those of the surroundings, higher plants appear.\nAlkali chloride hot springs show a similar succession of communities of organisms, with various thermophilic bacteria and archaea in the hottest parts of the vent. Acid sulfate hot springs show a somewhat different succession of microorganisms, dominated by acid-tolerant algae (such as members of Cyanidiophyceae), fungi, and diatoms. Iron-rich hot springs contain communities of photosynthetic organisms that oxidize reduced (ferrous) iron to oxidized (ferric) iron.\nHot springs are a dependable source of water that provides a rich chemical environment. This includes reduced chemical species that microorganisms can oxidize as a source of energy.\nSignificance to abiogenesis.\nHot spring hypothesis.\nIn contrast with \"black smokers\" (hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor), hot springs similar to terrestrial hydrothermal fields at Kamchatka produce fluids having suitable pH and temperature for early cells and biochemical reactions. Dissolved organic compounds were found in hot springs at Kamchatka . Metal sulfides and silica minerals in these environments would act as photocatalysts. They experience cycles of wetting and drying which promote the formation of biopolymers which are then encapsulated in vesicles after rehydration. Solar UV exposure to the environment promotes synthesis to monomeric biomolecules. The ionic composition and concentration of hot springs (K, B, Zn, P, O, S, C, Mn, N, and H) are identical to the cytoplasm of modern cells and possibly to those of the LUCA or early cellular life according to phylogenomic analysis. For these reasons, it has been hypothesized that hot springs may be the place of origin of life on Earth. The evolutionary implications of the hypothesis imply a direct evolutionary pathway to land plants. Where continuous exposure to sunlight leads to the development of photosynthetic properties and later colonize on land and life at hydrothermal vents is suggested to be a later adaptation.\nRecent experimental studies at hot springs support this hypothesis. They show that fatty acids self-assemble into membranous structures and encapsulate synthesized biomolecules during exposure to UV light and multiple wet-dry cycles at slightly alkaline or acidic hot springs, which would not happen at saltwater conditions as the high concentrations of ionic solutes there would inhibit the formation of membranous structures. David Deamer and Bruce Damer note that these hypothesized prebiotic environments resemble Charles Darwin's imagined \"warm little pond\". If life did not emerge at deep sea hydrothermal vents, rather at terrestrial pools, extraterrestrial quinones transported to the environment would generate redox reactions conducive to proton gradients. Without continuous wet-dry cycling to maintain stability of primitive proteins for membrane transport and other biological macromolecules, they would go through hydrolysis in an aquatic environment. Scientists discovered a 3.48 billion year old geyserite that seemingly preserved fossilized microbial life, stromatolites, and biosignatures. Researchers propose pyrophosphite to have been used by early cellular life for energy storage and it might have been a precursor to pyrophosphate. Phosphites, which are present at hot springs, would have bonded together into pyrophosphite within hot springs through wet-dry cycling. Like alkaline hydrothermal vents, the Hakuba Happo hot spring goes through serpentinization, suggesting methanogenic microbial life possibly originated in similar habitats.\nLimitations.\nA problem with the hot spring hypothesis for an origin of life is that phosphate has low solubility in water. Pyrophosphite could have been present within protocells, however all modern life forms use pyrophosphate for energy storage. Kee suggests that pyrophosphate could have been utilized after the emergence of enzymes. Dehydrated conditions would favor phosphorylation of organic compounds and condensation of phosphate to polyphosphate. Another problem is that solar ultraviolet radiation and frequent impacts would have inhibited habitability of early cellular life at hot springs, although biological macromolecules might have undergone selection during exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and would have been catalyzed by photocatalytic silica minerals and metal sulfides. Carbonaceous meteors during the Late Heavy Bombardment would not have caused cratering on Earth as they would produce fragments upon atmospheric entry. The meteors are estimated to have been 40 to 80 meters in diameter however larger impactors would produce larger craters. Metabolic pathways have not yet been demonstrated at these environments, but the development of proton gradients might have been generated by redox reactions coupled to meteoric quinones or protocell growth. Metabolic reactions in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and reverse Krebs cycle have been produced in acidic conditions and thermophilic temperatures in the presence of metals which is consistent with observations of RNA mostly stable at acidic pH.\nHuman uses.\nBathing.\nHistory.\nHot springs have been enjoyed by humans for thousands of years. Even macaques are known to have extended their northern range into Japan by making use of hot springs to protect themselves from cold stress. Hot spring baths (\"onsen\") have been in use in Japan for at least two thousand years, traditionally for cleanliness and relaxation, but increasingly for their therapeutic value. In the Homeric Age of Greece (ca. 1000 BCE), baths were primarily for hygiene, but by the time of Hippocrates (ca. 460 BCE), hot springs were credited with healing power. The popularity of hot springs has fluctuated over the centuries since, but they are now popular around the world. In 2023 the Global Wellness Institute, a wellness industry study, estimated the global earnings of the 31,200 hot springs establishments to be over $62 billion USD.\nTherapeutic uses.\nBecause of both the folklore and the claimed medical value attributed to some hot springs, they are often popular tourist destinations, and locations for rehabilitation clinics for those with disabilities. However, the scientific basis for therapeutic bathing in hot springs is uncertain. Hot bath therapy for lead poisoning was common and reportedly highly successful in the 18th and 19th centuries, and may have been due to diuresis (increased production of urine) from sitting in hot water, which increased excretion of lead; better food and isolation from lead sources; and increased intake of calcium and iron. Significant improvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have been reported in studies of spa therapy, but these studies have methodological problems, such as the obvious impracticality of placebo-controlled studies (in which a patient does not know if they are receiving the therapy). As a result, the therapeutic effectiveness of hot spring therapy remains uncertain.\nPrecautions.\nHot springs in volcanic areas are often at or near the boiling point. People have been seriously scalded and even killed by accidentally or intentionally entering these springs.\nSome hot springs microbiota are infectious to humans:\nEtiquette.\nThe customs and practices observed differ depending on the hot spring. It is common practice that bathers should wash before entering the water so as not to contaminate the water (with/without soap). In many countries, like Japan, it is required to enter the hot spring with no clothes on, including swimwear. Often there are different facilities or times for men and women, but mixed \"onsen\" do exist. In some countries, if it is a public hot spring, swimwear is required.\nCooking and drinking.\nHot springs are used for geothermal cooking, such as boiling eggs and vegetables at Hammam Maskhoutine (Algeria), and in Japan. Immersing eggs into hot springs of around produces (lit.\u2009'hot spring egg'), which have unique texture unlike ordinary boiled eggs, with a soft-set yolk and custardy white. are served in hot spring resorts throughout Japan.\nSome people drink the water from hot springs as folk remedies.\nExamples.\nThere are hot springs in many places and on all continents of the world. Countries that are renowned for their hot springs include China, Costa Rica, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Japan, New Zealand, Brazil, Peru, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States, but there are hot springs in many other places as well:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The dough may be accordingly called pastry dough for clarity. Sweetened pastries are often described as \"baker's confectionery\". Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches, croissants, and turnovers. \nThe French word p\u00e2tisserie is also used in English (with or without the accent) for many of the same foods, as well as the set of techniques used to make them. Originally, the French word referred to anything, such as a meat pie, made in dough (\"paste\", later \"p\u00e2te\") and not typically a luxurious or sweet product. This meaning still persisted in the nineteenth century, though by then the term more often referred to the sweet and often ornate confections implied today.\nDefinitions.\nThe precise definition of the term pastry varies based on location and culture. Common doughs used to make pastries include filo dough, puff pastry, choux pastry, short dough, \"p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e\", \"p\u00e2te sucr\u00e9e\", and other enriched doughs. Pastries tend to have a delicate texture, often flaky or crumbly, and rich flavor\u2014simple breads are thus excluded from the pastry category. Pastries also tend to be baked.\nHistory.\nThe European tradition of pastry-making is often traced back to the shortcrust era of flaky doughs that were in use throughout the Mediterranean in ancient times. In the ancient Mediterranean, the Romans, Greeks, and Phoenicians all had filo-style pastries in their culinary traditions. \nIn the plays of Aristophanes, written in the 5th century BC, there is mention of sweetmeats, including small pastries filled with fruit. Roman cuisine used flour, oil, and water to make pastries that were used to cover meats and fowls during baking in order to keep in the juices, but the pastry was not meant to be eaten. A pastry that was meant to be eaten was a richer pastry that was made into small pastries containing eggs or little birds and that were often served at banquets. Greeks and Romans both struggled in making a good pastry because they used oil in the cooking process, and oil causes the pastry to lose its stiffness.\nIn the medieval cuisine of Northern Europe, pastry chefs were able to produce nice, stiff pastries because they cooked with shortening and butter. Some incomplete lists of ingredients have been found in medieval cookbooks, but no full, detailed versions. There were stiff, empty pastries called coffins or 'huff paste', that were eaten by servants only and included an egg yolk glaze to help make them more enjoyable to consume. Medieval pastries also included small tarts to add richness.\nIt was not until about the mid-16th century that actual pastry recipes began appearing. These recipes were adopted and adapted over time in various European countries, resulting in the myriad pastry traditions known to the region, from Portuguese \"past\u00e9is de nata\" in the west to Russian \"pirozhki\" in the east. The use of chocolate in pastry-making in the west, so commonplace today, arose only after Spanish and Portuguese traders brought chocolate to Europe from the New World starting in the 16th century. Many culinary historians consider French pastry chef Antonin Car\u00eame (1784\u20131833) to have been the first great master of pastry making in modern times.\nPastry-making has a strong tradition in many parts of Asia. Chinese pastry is made from rice, or different types of flour, with fruit, sweet bean paste or sesame-based fillings. The mooncakes are part of Chinese Mid Autumn Festival traditions, while cha siu bao, steamed or baked pork buns, are a regular savory dim sum menu item. In the 19th century, the British brought western-style pastry to the Far East, though it would be the French-influenced Maxim in the 1950s that made western pastry popular in Chinese-speaking regions starting with Hong Kong. The term \"western cake\" (\u897f\u9905) is used to refer to western pastry, otherwise Chinese pastry is assumed. Other Asian countries such as Korea prepare traditional pastry-confections such as tteok, hangwa, and yaksik with flour, rice, fruits, and regional specific ingredients to make unique desserts. Japan also has specialized pastry-confections better known as mochi and manj\u016b. Pastry-confections that originate in Asia are clearly distinct from those that originate in the west, which are generally much sweeter.\n Choux begins as a mixture of milk or water and butter which are heated together until the butter melts, to which flour is added to form a dough. Eggs are then beaten into the dough to further enrich it. This high percentage of water causes the pastry to expand into a light, hollow pastry. Initially, the water in the dough turns to steam in the oven and causes the pastry to rise; then the starch in the flour gelatinizes, thereby solidifying the pastry. Once the choux dough has expanded, it is taken out of the oven; a hole is made in it to let out the steam. The pastry is then placed back in the oven to dry out and become crisp. The pastry is filled with various flavors of cream and is often topped with chocolate. Choux pastries can also be filled with ingredients such as cheese, tuna, or chicken to be used as appetizers.\nChemistry.\nDifferent kinds of pastry doughs are made by utilizing the natural characteristics of wheat flour and certain fats. When wheat flour is mixed with water and kneaded into plain dough, it develops strands of gluten, which are what make bread tough and elastic. In a typical pastry, however, this toughness is unwanted, so fat or oil is added to slow down the development of gluten. Pastry flour can also be used, since it typically has a lower level of protein than all-purpose or bread flours.\nLard or suet work well because they have a coarse, crystalline structure that is very effective. Using unclarified butter does not work well because of its water content; clarified butter, or ghee, which is virtually water-free, is better, but shortcrust pastry using only butter may develop an inferior texture. If the fat is melted with hot water or if liquid oil is used, the thin oily layer between the grains offers less of an obstacle to gluten formation and the resulting pastry is tougher.\nA good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a shortcrust pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid---to ensure that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such as Danish pastry and croissants, the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to yeast bread dough, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin layers.\nPastry chefs.\nPastry chefs use a combination of culinary ability and creativity for baking, decoration, and flavoring with ingredients. Many baked goods require a lot of time and focus. Presentation is an important aspect of pastry and dessert preparation. The job is often physically demanding, requiring attention to detail and long hours. Pastry chefs are also responsible for creating new recipes to put on the menu, and they work in restaurants, bistros, large hotels, casinos and bakeries. Pastry baking is usually done in an area slightly separate from the main kitchen. This section of the kitchen is in charge of making pastries, desserts, and other baked goods.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is typically made as a by-product during the distillation of rose petals to create rose oil for perfumes. Rose water is widely utilized to flavour culinary dishes and enhance cosmetic products, and it is significant in religious rituals throughout Eurasia. Iran is a major producer, supplying around 90% of the world's rose water demand.\nCentral Iran is home to the annual Golabgiri festival each spring. Thousands of tourists visit the area to celebrate the rose harvest for the production of rosewater.\nHistory.\nSince ancient times, roses have been used medicinally, nutritionally, and as a source of perfume. 11th-century writings by Ibn Jazla state that rose water strengthened the gums and stomach as well as being an antiemetic.\nGeographer \"Al-Dimashqi\" wrote that his native Damascus exported rose water to much of the Arab world. Some sources state that it was exported from cities in modern-day Turkey and Syria to the Indian subcontinent and even China.\nRose perfumes are made from rose oil, also called \"attar of roses\", which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam-distilling the crushed petals of roses. Rose water is a by-product of this process. Before the development of the technique of distilling rose water, rose petals were already used in Persian cuisine to perfume and flavour dishes. Rose water likely originated in Persia, where it is known as \"gul\u0101b\" (), from \"gul\" ( rose) and \"ab\" ( water). The term was adopted into Medieval Greek as \"zoul\u00e1pin\".\nThe process of creating rose water through steam distillation was refined by Arab and Persian chemists in the medieval Islamic world, which led to more efficient and economic uses for perfume industries.\nUses.\nFood.\nRose water is often added to water to mask unpleasant odours and flavours.\nIn South Asian cuisine, it is a common ingredient in sweets such as laddu, gulab jamun, and peda. It is also used to flavour milk, lassi, rice pudding, and other dairy dishes.\nIn Southeast Asia, rose water is the basis for a sweet, red-tinted cordial sometimes enhanced with screwpine (\"pandan\") and/or spices called or . This concoction is often diluted to be served on its own (as \"air sirap\"), mixed with calamansi (as \"air sirap limau\"), or mixed with milk to produce a pink beverage called \"air bandung\".\nRose water is used in various dishes, especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, nougat, and baklava. Marzipan has long been flavoured with rose water. In Cyprus, it is used to flavour a number of different desserts, including the local version of muhallebi.\nIt is also frequently used as a halal substitute for red wine and other alcohols in cooking. The Premier League, Bahrain Grand Prix, and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix offer a rose water-based beverage as an alternative for champagne when awarding Muslim players.\nCosmetics.\nIn medieval Europe, rose water was used to wash hands during feasts.\nReligion.\nRose water is used in religious ceremonies in Christianity (in the Byzantine Rite of the Catholic Church and in the Eastern Orthodox Church), Zoroastrianism, and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith (in \"Kitab-i-Aqdas\" 1:76).\nChemical composition.\nDepending on the origin and manufacturing method, rose water is obtained from the sepals and petals of \"Rosa \u00d7 damascena\" through steam distillation. The following monoterpenoid and alkane components can be identified with gas chromatography: mostly citronellol, nonadecane, geraniol, and phenylethyl alcohol, and also henicosane, nonadecane, eicosane, linalool, citronellyl acetate, methyleugenol, heptadecane, pentadecane, docosane, nerol, disiloxane, octadecane, and pentacosane. Usually, phenylethyl alcohol is responsible for the typical odour of rose water but is not always present in derivative products.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In human language processing and cognition, it is usually subconscious.\nGiven that natural language requires reflection of neurological reality, as shaped by the abilities provided by the brain's neural networks, computer science has had a long-term challenge in developing the ability in computers to do natural language processing and machine learning.\nMany techniques have been researched, including dictionary-based methods that use the knowledge encoded in lexical resources, supervised machine learning methods in which a classifier is trained for each distinct word on a corpus of manually sense-annotated examples, and completely unsupervised methods that cluster occurrences of words, thereby inducing word senses. Among these, supervised learning approaches have been the most successful algorithms to date.\nAccuracy of current algorithms is difficult to state without a host of caveats. In English, accuracy at the coarse-grained (homograph) level is routinely above 90% (as of 2009), with some methods on particular homographs achieving over 96%. On finer-grained sense distinctions, top accuracies from 59.1% to 69.0% have been reported in evaluation exercises (SemEval-2007, Senseval-2), where the baseline accuracy of the simplest possible algorithm of always choosing the most frequent sense was 51.4% and 57%, respectively.\nVariants.\nDisambiguation requires two strict inputs: a dictionary to specify the senses which are to be disambiguated and a corpus of language data to be disambiguated (in some methods, a training corpus of language examples is also required). WSD task has two variants: \"lexical sample\" (disambiguating the occurrences of a small sample of target words which were previously selected) and \"all words\" task (disambiguation of all the words in a running text). \"All words\" task is generally considered a more realistic form of evaluation, but the corpus is more expensive to produce because human annotators have to read the definitions for each word in the sequence every time they need to make a tagging judgement, rather than once for a block of instances for the same target word.\nHistory.\nWSD was first formulated as a distinct computational task during the early days of machine translation in the 1940s, making it one of the oldest problems in computational linguistics. Warren Weaver first introduced the problem in a computational context in his 1949 memorandum on translation. Later, Bar-Hillel (1960) argued that WSD could not be solved by \"electronic computer\" because of the need in general to model all world knowledge.\nIn the 1970s, WSD was a subtask of semantic interpretation systems developed within the field of artificial intelligence, starting with Wilks' preference semantics. However, since WSD systems were at the time largely rule-based and hand-coded they were prone to a knowledge acquisition bottleneck.\nBy the 1980s large-scale lexical resources, such as the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English (OALD), became available: hand-coding was replaced with knowledge automatically extracted from these resources, but disambiguation was still knowledge-based or dictionary-based.\nIn the 1990s, the statistical revolution advanced computational linguistics, and WSD became a paradigm problem on which to apply supervised machine learning techniques.\nThe 2000s saw supervised techniques reach a plateau in accuracy, and so attention has shifted to coarser-grained senses, domain adaptation, semi-supervised and unsupervised corpus-based systems, combinations of different methods, and the return of knowledge-based systems via graph-based methods. Still, supervised systems continue to perform best.\nDifficulties.\nDifferences between dictionaries.\nOne problem with word sense disambiguation is deciding what the senses are, as different dictionaries and thesauruses will provide different divisions of words into senses. Some researchers have suggested choosing a particular dictionary, and using its set of senses to deal with this issue. Generally, however, research results using broad distinctions in senses have been much better than those using narrow ones. Most researchers continue to work on fine-grained WSD.\nMost research in the field of WSD is performed by using WordNet as a reference sense inventory for English. WordNet is a computational lexicon that encodes concepts as synonym sets (e.g. the concept of car is encoded as { car, auto, automobile, machine, motorcar }). Other resources used for disambiguation purposes include Roget's Thesaurus and Wikipedia. More recently, BabelNet, a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary, has been used for multilingual WSD.\nPart-of-speech tagging.\nIn any real test, part-of-speech tagging and sense tagging have proven to be very closely related, with each potentially imposing constraints upon the other. The question whether these tasks should be kept together or decoupled is still not unanimously resolved, but recently scientists incline to test these things separately (e.g. in the Senseval/SemEval competitions parts of speech are provided as input for the text to disambiguate).\nBoth WSD and part-of-speech tagging involve disambiguating or tagging with words. However, algorithms used for one do not tend to work well for the other, mainly because the part of speech of a word is primarily determined by the immediately adjacent one to three words, whereas the sense of a word may be determined by words further away. The success rate for part-of-speech tagging algorithms is at present much higher than that for WSD, state-of-the art being around 96% accuracy or better, as compared to less than 75% accuracy in word sense disambiguation with supervised learning. These figures are typical for English, and may be very different from those for other languages.\nInter-judge variance.\nAnother problem is inter-judge variance. WSD systems are normally tested by having their results on a task compared against those of a human. However, while it is relatively easy to assign parts of speech to text, training people to tag senses has been proven to be far more difficult. While users can memorize all of the possible parts of speech a word can take, it is often impossible for individuals to memorize all of the senses a word can take. Moreover, humans do not agree on the task at hand \u2013 give a list of senses and sentences, and humans will not always agree on which word belongs in which sense.\nAs human performance serves as the standard, it is an upper bound for computer performance. Human performance, however, is much better on coarse-grained than fine-grained distinctions, so this again is why research on coarse-grained distinctions has been put to test in recent WSD evaluation exercises.\nSense inventory and algorithms' task-dependency.\nA task-independent sense inventory is not a coherent concept: each task requires its own division of word meaning into senses relevant to the task. Additionally, completely different algorithms might be required by different applications. In machine translation, the problem takes the form of target word selection. The \"senses\" are words in the target language, which often correspond to significant meaning distinctions in the source language (\"bank\" could translate to the French \u2013 that is, 'financial bank' or \u2013 that is, 'edge of river'). In information retrieval, a sense inventory is not necessarily required, because it is enough to know that a word is used in the same sense in the query and a retrieved document; what sense that is, is unimportant.\nDiscreteness of senses.\nFinally, the very notion of \"word sense\" is slippery and controversial. Most people can agree in distinctions at the coarse-grained homograph level (e.g., pen as writing instrument or enclosure), but go down one level to fine-grained polysemy, and disagreements arise. For example, in Senseval-2, which used fine-grained sense distinctions, human annotators agreed in only 85% of word occurrences. Word meaning is in principle infinitely variable and context-sensitive. It does not divide up easily into distinct or discrete sub-meanings. Lexicographers frequently discover in corpora loose and overlapping word meanings, and standard or conventional meanings extended, modulated, and exploited in a bewildering variety of ways. The art of lexicography is to generalize from the corpus to definitions that evoke and explain the full range of meaning of a word, making it seem like words are well-behaved semantically. However, it is not at all clear if these same meaning distinctions are applicable in computational applications, as the decisions of lexicographers are usually driven by other considerations. In 2009, a task \u2013 named lexical substitution \u2013 was proposed as a possible solution to the sense discreteness problem. The task consists of providing a substitute for a word in context that preserves the meaning of the original word (potentially, substitutes can be chosen from the full lexicon of the target language, thus overcoming discreteness).\nApproaches and methods.\nThere are two main approaches to WSD \u2013 deep approaches and shallow approaches.\nDeep approaches presume access to a comprehensive body of world knowledge. These approaches are generally not considered to be very successful in practice, mainly because such a body of knowledge does not exist in a computer-readable format, outside very limited domains. Additionally due to the long tradition in computational linguistics, of trying such approaches in terms of coded knowledge and in some cases, it can be hard to distinguish between knowledge involved in linguistic or world knowledge. The first attempt was that by Margaret Masterman and her colleagues, at the Cambridge Language Research Unit in England, in the 1950s. This attempt used as data a punched-card version of Roget's Thesaurus and its numbered \"heads\", as an indicator of topics and looked for repetitions in text, using a set intersection algorithm. It was not very successful, but had strong relationships to later work, especially Yarowsky's machine learning optimisation of a thesaurus method in the 1990s.\nShallow approaches do not try to understand the text, but instead consider the surrounding words. These rules can be automatically derived by the computer, using a training corpus of words tagged with their word senses. This approach, while theoretically not as powerful as deep approaches, gives superior results in practice, due to the computer's limited world knowledge.\nThere are four conventional approaches to WSD:\nAlmost all these approaches work by defining a window of \"n\" content words around each word to be disambiguated in the corpus, and statistically analyzing those \"n\" surrounding words. Two shallow approaches used to train and then disambiguate are Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers and decision trees. In recent research, kernel-based methods such as support vector machines have shown superior performance in supervised learning. Graph-based approaches have also gained much attention from the research community, and currently achieve performance close to the state of the art.\nDictionary- and knowledge-based methods.\nThe Lesk algorithm is the seminal dictionary-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that words used together in text are related to each other and that the relation can be observed in the definitions of the words and their senses. Two (or more) words are disambiguated by finding the pair of dictionary senses with the greatest word overlap in their dictionary definitions. For example, when disambiguating the words in \"pine cone\", the definitions of the appropriate senses both include the words evergreen and tree (at least in one dictionary). A similar approach searches for the shortest path between two words: the second word is iteratively searched among the definitions of every semantic variant of the first word, then among the definitions of every semantic variant of each word in the previous definitions and so on. Finally, the first word is disambiguated by selecting the semantic variant which minimizes the distance from the first to the second word.\nAn alternative to the use of the definitions is to consider general word-sense relatedness and to compute the semantic similarity of each pair of word senses based on a given lexical knowledge base such as WordNet. Graph-based methods reminiscent of spreading activation research of the early days of AI research have been applied with some success. More complex graph-based approaches have been shown to perform almost as well as supervised methods or even outperforming them on specific domains. Recently, it has been reported that simple graph connectivity measures, such as degree, perform state-of-the-art WSD in the presence of a sufficiently rich lexical knowledge base. Also, automatically transferring knowledge in the form of semantic relations from Wikipedia to WordNet has been shown to boost simple knowledge-based methods, enabling them to rival the best supervised systems and even outperform them in a domain-specific setting.\nThe use of selectional preferences (or selectional restrictions) is also useful, for example, knowing that one typically cooks food, one can disambiguate the word bass in \"I am cooking basses\" (i.e., it's not a musical instrument).\nSupervised methods.\nSupervised methods are based on the assumption that the context can provide enough evidence on its own to disambiguate words (hence, common sense and reasoning are deemed unnecessary). Probably every machine learning algorithm going has been applied to WSD, including associated techniques such as feature selection, parameter optimization, and ensemble learning. Support Vector Machines and memory-based learning have been shown to be the most successful approaches, to date, probably because they can cope with the high-dimensionality of the feature space. However, these supervised methods are subject to a new knowledge acquisition bottleneck since they rely on substantial amounts of manually sense-tagged corpora for training, which are laborious and expensive to create.\nSemi-supervised methods.\nBecause of the lack of training data, many word sense disambiguation algorithms use semi-supervised learning, which allows both labeled and unlabeled data. The Yarowsky algorithm was an early example of such an algorithm. It uses the \u2018One sense per collocation\u2019 and the \u2018One sense per discourse\u2019 properties of human languages for word sense disambiguation. From observation, words tend to exhibit only one sense in most given discourse and in a given collocation.\nThe bootstrapping approach starts from a small amount of seed data for each word: either manually tagged training examples or a small number of surefire decision rules (e.g., 'play' in the context of 'bass' almost always indicates the musical instrument). The seeds are used to train an initial classifier, using any supervised method. This classifier is then used on the untagged portion of the corpus to extract a larger training set, in which only the most confident classifications are included. The process repeats, each new classifier being trained on a successively larger training corpus, until the whole corpus is consumed, or until a given maximum number of iterations is reached.\nOther semi-supervised techniques use large quantities of untagged corpora to provide co-occurrence information that supplements the tagged corpora. These techniques have the potential to help in the adaptation of supervised models to different domains.\nAlso, an ambiguous word in one language is often translated into different words in a second language depending on the sense of the word. Word-aligned bilingual corpora have been used to infer cross-lingual sense distinctions, a kind of semi-supervised system.\nUnsupervised methods.\nUnsupervised learning is the greatest challenge for WSD researchers. The underlying assumption is that similar senses occur in similar contexts, and thus senses can be induced from text by clustering word occurrences using some measure of similarity of context, a task referred to as word sense induction or discrimination. Then, new occurrences of the word can be classified into the closest induced clusters/senses. Performance has been lower than for the other methods described above, but comparisons are difficult since senses induced must be mapped to a known dictionary of word senses. If a mapping to a set of dictionary senses is not desired, cluster-based evaluations (including measures of entropy and purity) can be performed. Alternatively, word sense induction methods can be tested and compared within an application. For instance, it has been shown that word sense induction improves Web search result clustering by increasing the quality of result clusters and the degree diversification of result lists. It is hoped that unsupervised learning will overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck because they are not dependent on manual effort.\nRepresenting words considering their context through fixed-size dense vectors (word embeddings) has become one of the most fundamental blocks in several NLP systems. Even though most of traditional word-embedding techniques conflate words with multiple meanings into a single vector representation, they still can be used to improve WSD. A simple approach to employ pre-computed word embeddings to represent word senses is to compute the centroids of sense clusters. In addition to word-embedding techniques, lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet) can also assist unsupervised systems in mapping words and their senses as dictionaries. Some techniques that combine lexical databases and word embeddings are presented in AutoExtend and Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA). In AutoExtend, they present a method that decouples an object input representation into its properties, such as words and their word senses. AutoExtend uses a graph structure to map words (e.g. text) and non-word (e.g. synsets in WordNet) objects as nodes and the relationship between nodes as edges. The relations (edges) in AutoExtend can either express the addition or similarity between its nodes. The former captures the intuition behind the offset calculus, while the latter defines the similarity between two nodes. In MSSA, an unsupervised disambiguation system uses the similarity between word senses in a fixed context window to select the most suitable word sense using a pre-trained word-embedding model and WordNet. For each context window, MSSA calculates the centroid of each word sense definition by averaging the word vectors of its words in WordNet's glosses (i.e., short defining gloss and one or more usage example) using a pre-trained word-embedding model. These centroids are later used to select the word sense with the highest similarity of a target word to its immediately adjacent neighbors (i.e., predecessor and successor words). After all words are annotated and disambiguated, they can be used as a training corpus in any standard word-embedding technique. In its improved version, MSSA can make use of word sense embeddings to repeat its disambiguation process iteratively.\nOther approaches.\nOther approaches may vary differently in their methods:\nLocal impediments and summary.\nThe knowledge acquisition bottleneck is perhaps the major impediment to solving the WSD problem. Unsupervised methods rely on knowledge about word senses, which is only sparsely formulated in dictionaries and lexical databases. Supervised methods depend crucially on the existence of manually annotated examples for every word sense, a requisite that can so far be met only for a handful of words for testing purposes, as it is done in the Senseval exercises.\nOne of the most promising trends in WSD research is using the largest corpus ever accessible, the World Wide Web, to acquire lexical information automatically. WSD has been traditionally understood as an intermediate language engineering technology which could improve applications such as information retrieval (IR). In this case, however, the reverse is also true: web search engines implement simple and robust IR techniques that can successfully mine the Web for information to use in WSD. The historic lack of training data has provoked the appearance of some new algorithms and techniques, as described in Automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora.\nExternal knowledge sources.\nKnowledge is a fundamental component of WSD. Knowledge sources provide data which are essential to associate senses with words. They can vary from corpora of texts, either unlabeled or annotated with word senses, to machine-readable dictionaries, thesauri, glossaries, ontologies, etc. They can be classified as follows:\nStructured:\nUnstructured:\nEvaluation.\nComparing and evaluating different WSD systems is extremely difficult, because of the different test sets, sense inventories, and knowledge resources adopted. Before the organization of specific evaluation campaigns most systems were assessed on in-house, often small-scale, data sets. In order to test one's algorithm, developers should spend their time to annotate all word occurrences. And comparing methods even on the same corpus is not eligible if there is different sense inventories.\nIn order to define common evaluation datasets and procedures, public evaluation campaigns have been organized. Senseval (now renamed SemEval) is an international word sense disambiguation competition, held every three years since 1998: http:// (1998), https:// (2001), https:// (2004), and its successor, https:// (2007). The objective of the competition is to organize different lectures, preparing and hand-annotating corpus for testing systems, perform a comparative evaluation of WSD systems in several kinds of tasks, including all-words and lexical sample WSD for different languages, and, more recently, new tasks such as semantic role labeling, gloss WSD, lexical substitution, etc. The systems submitted for evaluation to these competitions usually integrate different techniques and often combine supervised and knowledge-based methods (especially for avoiding bad performance in lack of training examples).\nIn recent years 2007-2012, the WSD evaluation task choices had grown and the criterion for evaluating WSD has changed drastically depending on the variant of the WSD evaluation task. Below enumerates the variety of WSD tasks:\nTask design choices.\nAs technology evolves, the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks grows in different flavors towards various research directions and for more languages:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The satellite's signals are broadcast nationwide, across a much wider geographical area than terrestrial radio stations, and the service is primarily intended for the occupants of motor vehicles. It is available by subscription, mostly commercial free, and offers subscribers more stations and a wider variety of programming options than terrestrial radio.\nSatellite radio technology was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2002. Satellite radio uses the 2.3\u00a0GHz S band in North America for nationwide digital radio broadcasting. In other parts of the world, satellite radio uses the 1.4\u00a0GHz L band formerly allocated for DAB.\nHistory and overview.\nThe first satellite radio broadcasts occurred in Africa and the Middle East in 1999. The first US broadcasts were in 2001 followed by Japan in 2004 and Canada in 2005.\nThere have been three (not counting MobaHo! of Japan) major satellite radio companies: WorldSpace, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, all founded in the 1990s in the United States. WorldSpace operated in the Africa and Asia region, whereas Sirius and XM competed in the North American (USA and Canada) market. Of the three companies, WorldSpace went bankrupt in 2009 and Sirius and XM merged in 2008 to form Sirius XM. The merger was done to avoid bankruptcy. The new company had financial problems and was within days of bankruptcy in 2009, but was able to find investors. The company did not go bankrupt and Sirius XM Satellite radio continues (as of 2025[ [update]]) to operate.\nAfrica and Eurasia.\nWorldSpace was founded by Ethiopia-born lawyer Noah Samara in Washington, D.C., in 1990, with the goal of making satellite radio programming available to the developing world. On June 22, 1991, the FCC gave WorldSpace permission to launch a satellite to provide digital programming to Africa and the Middle East. WorldSpace first began broadcasting satellite radio on October 1, 1999, in Africa. India would ultimately account for over 90% of WorldSpace's subscriber base. In 2008, WorldSpace announced plans to enter Europe, but those plans were set aside when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2008. In March 2010, the company announced it would be de-commissioning its two satellites (one served Asia, the other served Africa). Liberty Media, which owns 50% of Sirius XM Radio, had considered purchasing WorldSpace's assets, but talks between the companies collapsed. The satellites are now transmitting educational data and operate under the name of Yazmi USA, LLC.\nOndas Media was a Spanish company which had proposed to launch a subscription-based satellite radio system to serve Spain and much of Western Europe, but failed to acquire licenses throughout Europe.\nOnde Num\u00e9rique was a French company which had proposed to launch a subscription-based satellite radio system to serve France and several other countries in Western Europe but has suspended its plans indefinitely, effective December, 2016.\nUnited States.\nSirius Satellite Radio was founded by Martine Rothblatt, who served as the new company's Chairman of the Board. Co-founder David Margolese served as Chief Executive Officer with former NASA engineer Robert Briskman serving as President and Chief Operating Officer. In June 1990, Rothblatt's shell company, Satellite CD Radio, Inc., petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to assign new frequencies for satellites to broadcast digital sound to homes and cars. The company identified and argued in favor of the use of the S-band frequencies that the FCC subsequently decided to allocate to digital audio broadcasting. The National Association of Broadcasters contended that satellite radio would harm local radio stations.\nIn April 1992, Rothblatt resigned as CEO of Satellite CD Radio; Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed chairman and CEO. Six months later, Rogers Wireless co-founder Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000. In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and \"effectively created the industry,\" the FCC also sold a license to the American Mobile Radio Corporation, which changed its name to XM Satellite Radio in October 1998. XM was founded by Lon Levin and Gary Parsons, who served as chairman until November 2009.\nCD Radio purchased their license for $83.3 million, and American Mobile Radio Corporation bought theirs for $89.9 million. Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corporation and Primosphere were unsuccessful in their bids for licenses. Sky Highway Radio Corporation had also expressed interest in creating a satellite radio network, before being bought out by CD Radio in 1993 for $2 million. In November 1999, Margolese changed the name of CD Radio to Sirius Satellite Radio. In November 2001, Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him \"for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry.\"\nXM's first satellite was launched on March 18, 2001 and its second on May 8, 2001. Its first broadcast occurred on September 25, 2001, nearly four months before Sirius. Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002, expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002. The two companies spent over $3 billion combined to develop satellite radio technology, build and launch the satellites, and for various other business expenses. Stating that it was the only way satellite radio could survive, Sirius and XM announced their merger on February 19, 2007, becoming Sirius XM. The FCC approved the merger on July 25, 2008, concluding that it was not a monopoly, primarily due to Internet audio-streaming competition.\nJapan.\nMobaHo! was a mobile satellite digital audio/video broadcasting service based in Japan which offered different services to Japan and the Republic of Korea and whose services began on October 20, 2004, and ended on March 31, 2009.\nCanada.\nXM satellite radio was launched in Canada on November 29, 2005. Sirius followed two days later on December 1, 2005. Sirius Canada and XM Radio Canada announced their merger into Sirius XM Canada on November 24, 2010. It was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on April 12, 2011.\nSystem design.\nSatellite radio uses the 2.3\u00a0GHz S band in North America for nationwide digital radio broadcasting. MobaHO! operated at 2.6\u00a0GHz. In other parts of the world, satellite radio uses part of the 1.4\u00a0GHz L band allocated for DAB.\nSatellite radio subscribers purchase a receiver and pay a monthly subscription fee to listen to programming. They can listen through built-in or portable receivers in automobiles; in the home and office with a portable or tabletop receiver equipped to connect the receiver to a stereo system; or on the Internet. Reception is activated by obtaining the radio's unique ID and giving this to the service provider.\nGround stations transmit signals to the satellites which are 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above the Equator in geostationary orbits. The satellites send the signals back down to radio receivers in cars and homes. This signal contains scrambled broadcasts, along with meta data about each specific broadcast. The signals are unscrambled by the radio receiver modules, which display the broadcast information. In urban areas, ground repeaters enable signals to be available even if the satellite signal is blocked. The technology allows for nationwide broadcasting, so that, for instance US listeners can hear the same stations anywhere in the country.\nContent, availability and market penetration.\nSatellite radio in the US offers commercial-free music stations, as well as news, sports, and talk, some of which include commercials. In 2004, satellite radio companies in the United States began providing background music to hotels, retail chains, restaurants, airlines and other businesses. On April 30, 2013, SiriusXM CEO Jim Meyer stated that the company would be pursuing opportunities over the next few years to provide in-car services through their existing satellites, including telematics (automated security and safety, such as stolen vehicle tracking and roadside assistance) and entertainment (such as weather and gas prices).\nAs of \u00a02020[ [update]], SiriusXM had 34.7 million subscribers. This was primarily due to the company's partnerships with automakers and car dealers. Roughly 60% of new cars sold come equipped with SiriusXM, and just under half of those units gain paid subscriptions. The company has long-term deals with General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Kia, Bentley, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai and Mitsubishi. The presence of Howard Stern, whose show attracts over 12 million listeners per week, has also been a factor in the company's steady growth. As of 2013[ [update]], the main competition to satellite radio is streaming Internet services, such as Pandora and Spotify, as well as FM and AM Radio.\nSatellite radio versus other formats.\nSatellite radio differs from AM, FM radio, and digital television radio (DTR) in the following ways (the table applies primarily to the United States):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cars and trucks, running on government-built roads, all but ended passenger train service and severely reduced railroads' cargo revenues. Railroads continued to be regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and a complex system for setting shipping rates.\nThe Staggers Act followed the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (often called the \"4R Act\"), which reduced federal regulation of railroads and authorized implementation details for Conrail, the new northeastern railroad system. The 4R reforms included allowance of a greater range for railroad pricing without close regulatory restraint, greater independence from collective rate making procedures in rail pricing and service offers, contract rates, and, to a lesser extent, greater freedom for entry into and exit from rail markets.\nAlthough the 4R Act established the guidelines, the ICC at first, did not give much effect to its legislative mandates. As regulatory change began to appear from 1976 to 1979, including the phasing out of the collective ratemaking authority, most major railroads shifted away from their effort to maintain the historic regulatory system and came to support greater freedom for rail pricing, for higher and lower rail rates.\nMajor railroad shippers also continued to believe that they would be better served by more flexibility to arrive at tailored arrangements that were mutually beneficial to a particular shipper, and to the carrier serving a particular shipper. The judgments supported a second round of legislation.\nSummary.\nThe major regulatory changes of the Staggers Act were:\nThe Act also had provisions allowing the Commission to require access by one railroad to another railroad's facilities if one railroad had effective \"bottleneck\" control of traffic. The provisions dealt with \"reciprocal switching\" (handling of railroad cars between long-haul rail carriers and local customers) and trackage rights. However, the provisions did not have as much effect as the others mentioned.\nThe act was named for Harley Staggers (D-WV), who chaired the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\nImpact.\nBy 1997, studies of the rail industry showed dramatic benefits for both railroads and their users from the alteration to the regulatory system. According to studies by the Department of Transportation's Freight Management and Operations, railroad industry costs and prices were halved over a ten-year period, the railroads reversed their historic loss of traffic (as measured by ton-miles) to the trucking industry, and railroad industry profits began to recover, after decades of low profits and widespread railroad insolvencies. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office reported to Congress, \"The railroad industry is increasingly healthy and rail rates have generally declined since 1985, despite recent rate increases... There is widespread consensus that the freight rail industry has benefited from the Staggers Rail Act.\"\nThe Association of American Railroads, the principal railroad industry trade association, stated that the Staggers Act has led to a 51 percent reduction in average shipping rates, and $480 billion has been reinvested by the industry into their rail systems.\nRelated deregulatory legislation.\nThe Staggers Act was one of three major deregulation laws passed by Congress in a two-year period, as the cumulative result of efforts to reform transport regulation begun in 1971, during the Nixon administration. The other two laws were the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and the Motor Carrier Act of 1980. This legislation in effect superseded almost a century of detailed regulation begun with the establishment of the ICC in 1887. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 abolished the ICC and created its successor agency, the Surface Transportation Board, an administrative affiliate of the United States Department of Transportation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The law approved the \"Final System Plan\" for the newly created Conrail and authorized acquisition of Northeast Corridor tracks and facilities by Amtrak.\nThe Act was the first in a series of laws which collectively are described as the deregulation of transportation in the United States. It was followed by the Airline Deregulation Act (1978), Staggers Rail Act (1980), and the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.\nBackground.\nFollowing the massive bankruptcy of the Penn Central in 1970, Congress created Amtrak to take over the failed company's intercity passenger train service, under the Rail Passenger Service Act. Congress passed the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (the \"3R Act\") to salvage viable freight operations from Penn Central and other failing rail lines in the northeast, mid-Atlantic and midwestern regions, through the creation of Conrail. Conrail began operations in 1976.\nSummary.\nThe \"Declaration of policy\" in the Act (Section 101), was as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n(a) Purpose\nIt is the purpose of the Congress in this Act to provide the means to rehabilitate and maintain the physical facilities, improve the operations and structure, and restore the financial stability of the railway system of the United States, and to promote the revitalization of such railway system, so that this mode of transportation will remain viable in the private sector of the economy and will be able to provide energy-efficient, ecologically compatible transportation services with greater efficiency, effectiveness, and economy, through - \n(1) ratemaking and regulatory reform;\n(2) the encouragement of efforts to restructure the system on a more economically justified basis, including planning authority in the Secretary of Transportation, an expedited procedure for determining whether merger and consolidation applications are in the public interest, and continuing reorganization authority;\n(3) financing mechanisms that will assure adequate rehabilitation and improvement of facilities and equipment, implementation of the final system plan, and implementation of the Northeast Corridor project;\n(4) transitional continuation of service on light-density rail lines that are necessary to continued employment and community well-being throughout the United States;\n(5) auditing, accounting, reporting, and other requirements to protect Federal funds and to assure repayment of loans and financial responsibility; and\n(6) necessary studies.\n(b) Policy\nIt is declared to be the policy of the Congress in this Act to -\n(1) balance the needs of carriers, shippers, and the public;\n(2) foster competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation, to promote more adequate and efficient transportation services, and to increase the attractiveness of investing in railroads and rail-service-related enterprises;\n(3) permit railroads greater freedom to raise or lower rates for rail services in competitive markets;\n(4) promote the establishment of railroad rate structures which are more sensitive to changes in the level of seasonal, regional, and shipper demand;\n(5) promote separate pricing of distinct rail and rail-related services;\n(6) formulate standards and guidelines for determining adequate revenue levels for railroads; and\n(7) modernize and clarify the functions of railroad rate bureaus.\nThe financial assistance provisions of the act were largely palliative and transitional. They were extended on the condition that changes in the regulatory system governing railroads be enacted, with the hope that a regulatory system which gave railroads more freedom in pricing and service arrangements, subject to greater competitive constraints, would yield a more viable industry and better service for its users. Studies of the legislative history of the Act indicate that the Gerald Ford administration secured the regulatory provisions only by threatening a veto of any act containing financial assistance for railroads but no reform of the regulatory system.\nThe changes in regulation provided for were as follows:\nIn a signing statement, President Ford stated,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn addition to providing short-term financial assistance, Congress in approving this legislation has taken a fundamental step to restore the long-term economic health of this vital American industry. The regulatory reform provisions in this bill are long overdue, and I commend the Congress for this farsighted and necessary action. \nThis kind of fundamental change in government policy takes time. Every President since Harry S. Truman has called in vain for increased competition and reform of our regulated industries. For example, the Landis Report commissioned by President-elect Kennedy in 1960 recommended major policy revisions in transportation regulation. But for more than a quarter of a century, the Nation has had no results. In contrast, the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act is the first significant reform of transportation regulation by any administration--or Congress. \nAn equally important task facing us now is to extend the principles of reform embodied in this legislation to the aviation and motor carrier industries. In these industries, we must strive to create a regulatory climate which relies on competitive forces, rather than on inflexible and bureaucratic directives of Federal agencies, to determine which firm will provide the desired transportation services and at what price. The time has come to place greater reliance on market competition.\nReaction.\nMany members of the ICC strongly opposed the Act. The regulatory provisions had been enacted over several commissioners' objections, and the Commission's implementation of the Act initially had little impact on the way the rail industry functioned.\nWhen President Jimmy Carter nominated A. Daniel O'Neal, originally appointed by President Richard Nixon, to chair the ICC, O\u2019Neal began to develop the possibilities for opening up the rail market to competition. Also, in 1978 a group of major railroads formed an organization called TRAIN (Transportation by Rail for Agricultural and Industrial Needs) to support further deregulation of the industry. The carriers' perception was that with collective rate making limited, and a Commission apparently more interested in letting their rates go down than go up, the regulatory system no longer favored them.\nLarge shippers of goods by rail also wished to have more flexibility in the rail market. The result of this alignment between carriers, the shippers, and the Carter administration\u2019s ICC, was the Staggers Act of 1980. The Staggers Act extended the principles of the 4R Act. One of the key changes from the 1976 Act was allowance of secret contracts between carriers and shippers, not limited to large-investment situations and not effectively subject to regulatory review. According to former Congressional Budget Office analyst Christopher Barnekov, such contracts allowed rail carriers and shippers much to develop more efficient transport arrangements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He appears regularly in the first four seasons of the television series ' (\"TNG\"), and sporadically in its next three seasons. He also appeared in the feature film ' (2002), in one episode apiece of the television series ' (2022) and ' (2023), and as a main cast member in of \"\" (2024). He is the son of Beverly Crusher and Jack Crusher and is portrayed by actor Wil Wheaton.\nOverview.\nTelevision series and films.\nIn the television series \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", Wesley Crusher first arrives on the \"Enterprise\"-D with his mother, soon after Captain Jean-Luc Picard assumes command. Crusher's father was killed while under Picard's command, with Picard delivering the message to Wesley and to his mother, Beverly. Picard initially found Wesley irritating, as he is often uncomfortable around children, a fact he discloses to his first officer, Commander William Riker, in the pilot episode \"Encounter at Farpoint\".\nIn early episodes of the series, Picard does not allow Wesley on the ship's bridge. However, during the first season, Picard comes to realize that Wesley understands many things beyond his age, having inherited his mother's intelligence, and grants him more opportunities onboard. An alien known as the Traveler tells Captain Picard that Wesley possesses a unique intelligence and great potential when provided encouragement and opportunity, comparing him to a child prodigy like Mozart. Picard soon appoints Crusher as acting ensign.\nIn the episode \"\", Crusher takes the Starfleet Academy entrance exam, but fails to pass it. In the episode \"M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Troi\", he misses his second chance to take the exam; but when he helps the \"Enterprise\"-D crew rescue Riker, Deanna Troi and from hostile Ferengi, Picard grants him a field promotion to full ensign.\nIn the third-season episode \"The Bonding\", Crusher reveals that following his father's death, he felt animosity towards Picard, because Picard was in command of the \"Stargazer\" during the mission in which Wesley's father was killed. By the end of the episode, he no longer harbors these feelings.\nThe following year, Crusher is invited to re-take the Academy exam. He is accepted, and joins an elite group of cadets known as Nova Squadron. In the fifth-season episode \"The First Duty\", a squadron-mate is killed attempting a dangerous and prohibited flight maneuver and, under pressure from the team's leader, Nick Locarno, Crusher abets the squadron's efforts to cover up the truth. Although the \"Enterprise\" crew's intervention and Crusher's own testimony saves him from expulsion, Crusher's academic credits for the year are revoked; he is required to repeat the year and graduate after most of the rest of his class. He remains in the Academy until the Traveler recontacts him in a later season 7 episode, \", where he resigns his commission and goes with the Traveler to explore other planes of reality.\nCrusher is next seen sitting next to his mother in the background of the wedding scenes in the feature film '. In a scene deleted from the film, Captain Picard asks Crusher if he is excited to serve on board the USS \"Titan\" (Captain Riker's ship). Crusher tells him that he will be running the night shift in Engineering, which would have indicated that Wesley returned to Starfleet prior to the events of the film and held the rank of Lieutenant.\nCrusher returns in the ' episode \"Farewell\". In the years since \"Star Trek: Nemesis\", he has rejoined the Travelers, traveling across space and time. In the year 2024, he approaches Kore Soong and reveals that he and his fellow Travelers were responsible for creating the Supervisors and the Watchers to help ensure the universe's survival. He offers Kore a position with the Travelers, although he can't guarantee her safety, and she accepts.\nCrusher returns in the of \"\" where he tries to help the young crew of the \"Protostar\" rescue Captain Chakotay from the future and then to deal with their inadvertent alterations to the timeline. In the first half of the season, Crusher acts from the shadows, sending disguised messages to the crew. Crusher eventually brings the young cadets to meet him in person, explaining that the temporal paradox is destroying their universe and while the other Travelers have abandoned it as a lost cause, Crusher is unwilling to give up on the universe that was his home and more importantly where his mother still lives. Crusher reveals that having studied billions of possible futures, there is only one where life in the galaxy doesn't end in endless suffering and that involves the seven cadets sticking together. As extra-dimensional scavengers called the Loom move to destroy the universe, Crusher helps the cadets find the \"Protostar\" and vanishes after promising to distract the Loom to buy them time.\nIn the second half of the season, Crusher is captured by Asencia and his mind probed to create temporal weaponry that she intends to use to destroy the Federation in a war. Crusher is eventually rescued by the cadets, but reveals that he had allowed himself to be captured in order to guide Asencia into creating the technology that they will need to send the \"Protostar\" back in time and restore the timeline. Although the Doctor is able to treat Crusher's injuries, the damage to his brain puts Crusher's Traveler powers out of commission for the time being. Working with Janeway to rescue the cadets, Crusher struggles to adjust to not being able to rely on his powers before Janeway reminds him that Crusher was a Starfleet officer before he was a Traveler and his natural talents are more valuable to them than his space-time powers. Given a confidence boost, Crusher plays a pivotal role in the rescue mission using his skills as a pilot and later his intellect to reprogram a tricorder to remotely bring their ship in for departure. Crusher later helps to figure out how to open the wormhole and chooses to accompany the \"Protostar\" along with the crew to see the mission through. Privately, Crusher reveals to Dal R'El that the important thing that he had predicted for the group to do that will shape the future of the galaxy is still yet to come. After the crisis is over, Crusher visits his mother for the first time in years and is introduced to his little brother Jack, having been rebuked by Janeway for not seeing his mother more often.\nReception.\nThe Wesley Crusher character was unpopular among some \"Star Trek\" fans. Many considered the character a Mary Sue, and a stand-in for Gene Roddenberry (whose middle name was Wesley). The character's role in the show was greatly downplayed after the first season when Roddenberry's involvement in the show's production became more peripheral.\nSome fans disliked the idea of a boy who seemed to regularly save the whole ship using a \"deus ex machina\" plot device. Commentators have observed at least seven times in which Crusher, \"who has trouble getting into the Starfleet Academy\" and is on a ship \"filled with Starfleet's best and brightest crew members\", has come up with \"the needed solution\". Fans' dislike for Crusher has become something of a pop-culture meme, reflected in other TV shows such as \"The Big Bang Theory\", the English dub of \"Steins;Gate\", and in a 2009 \"Family Guy\" episode, \"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\", which included the main \"The Next Generation\" cast and featured Wil Wheaton in character as Crusher being bullied by Patrick Stewart.\nWheaton wrote: \"When I was younger, people gave me such a hard time about Wesley Crusher, there was a time in my late teens and early twenties when I resented \"Star Trek\". It felt so unfair that people who had never met me were so cruel and hateful toward me as a person because they didn\u2019t like a character I played on a TV show, I wanted to put \"Star Trek\" behind me and forget that it was ever part of my life.\"\nIn a 2016 issue of \"Wired\" magazine, Wesley Crusher was ranked 31st of the 100 most important Starfleet characters in the \"Star Trek\" science fiction universe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Portrayed by Denise Crosby, Yar is chief of security aboard the Starfleet starship USS \"Enterprise\"-D and carries the rank of lieutenant.\nThe character first appeared in the series' pilot episode, \"Encounter at Farpoint\". After Crosby decided to leave the series, Yar was killed in the episode \"Skin of Evil\" near the end of the series' first season. She has a guest appearance in the episode \"Yesterday's Enterprise\", in which her character was still alive in an alternate timeline, and again in the final episode of the series \"\", which included events set prior to the pilot.\nYar was described as a forerunner to other strong women in science fiction, such as Kara Thrace from the 2004 version of \"Battlestar Galactica\", while providing an intermediary step between the depictions of female characters on ' to the command positions they have on ' and \"\". Some fans have speculated on the sexuality of her character, and that the events in the episode \"The Naked Now\" were designed to establish her heterosexuality given an otherwise ambiguous portrayal.\nConcept and development.\nThe original December 1986 casting call for actors described early versions of the crew. It included a character named \"Macha Hernandez\" inspired by Vasquez in \"Aliens\" who was the security chief of the . A version from February 1987 gave her the position of tactical officer to make it so she'd have a reason to be on the bridge. The producers considered Jenette Goldstein, who had played Vasquez, for the role, but writer Dorothy Fontana pointed out that the actress \"is not Latina. She is petite, blue-eyed, freckle-faced\". The character was briefly renamed \"Tanya\" in March 1987 as a result.\nBy the time that the writers' and directors' guide for the series was published, dated March 23, 1987, the character's name had become Natasha \"Tasha\" Yar. The guide described her character as such:\nThe starship Security Chief, Tasha, who performs that same function both aboard ship and on away missions. Born at a \"failed\" Earth colony of renegades and other violent undesirables, she escaped to Earth in her teens and discovered Starfleet, which she still \"worships\" today as the complete opposite of all the ugliness she once knew.\nHer surname was suggested by Robert Lewin, drawing inspiration from the Babi Yar atrocities in Ukraine during the World War II. Her biography stated that she was 28\u00a0years old, and confirmed her Ukrainian descent. She was planned to have a friendship with teenager Wesley Crusher, and was described in the guide as \"treat[ing] this boy like the most wonderful person imaginable. Wes is the childhood friend that Tasha never had.\"\nIn April 1987, Lianne Langland, Julia Nickson, Rosalind Chao, Leah Ayres, and Bunty Bailey were each listed as being in contention for the role; Chao was a favorite candidate. Denise Crosby was described as \"the only possibility\" for the character of Deanna Troi. The production staff were not keen on having two actresses in the bridge crew roles with similar physical types and hair colors, and so the team took account of the casting of the two roles together. The writers and directors guide described Yar as having a muscular but very feminine body type, and being sufficiently athletic to defeat most other crew members in martial arts. After Crosby and Marina Sirtis had each auditioned for Troi and Yar respectively, Gene Roddenberry decided to switch the actresses and cast Crosby as Tasha Yar. He felt that Sirtis' appearance was better suited to the \"exotic\" Troi.\nBefore the end of the first season, Crosby asked to be released from her contract as she was unhappy that her character was not being developed. She later said \"I was miserable. I couldn't wait to get off that show. I was dying\". Roddenberry agreed to her request and she left on good terms. The final episode she filmed was \"\", which was completed after Yar's death in \"Skin of Evil\". Her last scene was during the final act of the episode, in which a holographic farewell recording of her is played for the bridge crew. After her departure, archive footage of Crosby as Yar was used in the episodes \" and \". In a later retrospective, Crosby noted that the producers loved the character of Tasha Yar, despite the scripts of the first season failing to do much with the character. She speculated that her departure (and the departure of Gates McFadden) might have saved Marina Sirtis's then-tenuous position, as the producers had to avoid a situation where all three of the lead female actresses of season 1 were dismissed in season 2.\nCrosby was happy to return in \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" due to the strength of the script, saying that \"I had more to do in that episode than I'd ever had to do before\". Prior to the episode being aired, the media had to be reassured that Yar was not returning in a dream sequence. Crosby later said that she was impressed with the changes wrought by Michael Piller as showrunner in the third season. Following her appearance in that episode, Crosby pitched the idea of Yar's daughter, Sela, to the producers. She made her first appearance in this role in the two-part \" and appeared once more in another two-part episode, \". Denise returned twice more in the non-canon \"Star Trek\" universe. In 2007, she appeared as an ancestor of Tasha Yar, Jenna Yar, in \", an episode of the fan-produced series \". Tasha Yar was written into \"Star Trek Online\" as part of the third anniversary celebration in 2013. Denise Crosby recorded audio for the game, in scenes set after those in \"Yesterday's Enterprise\".\nAppearances.\nNatasha Yar's origins are explained in the season four episode \"\". She was born on the planet Turkana\u00a0IV in 2337. She had a younger sister named Ishara, who was born five years after her. Shortly after Ishara's birth, the girls' parents were killed and they were taken in by other people; however, they were subsequently abandoned and Tasha was required to look after her sister on her own. The government on the planet had collapsed, and the sisters were forced to scavenge for food while avoiding rape gangs. In 2352, aged 15, Tasha managed to leave Turkana\u00a0IV. She never saw Ishara again; the latter joined the \"Coalition\", one of the factions on the planet before Tasha left. Tasha refused to join the cadres on the planet, blaming them for her parents' deaths.\nYar appeared for the first time in the pilot episode of \"\" as the Security and Tactical Officer on board the USS \"Enterprise\"-D. When Captain Picard orders an emergency saucer separation, Yar is one of the bridge crew to accompany him to the battle bridge. She is amongst the crew abducted by Q, and later serves on the away team to Farpoint Station. In both that episode and \"Hide and Q\", she is outspoken and the most openly defiant of Q of the cast, although her defiance is ineffective both times. In \"The Naked Now\", while the crew are under the influence of an alien ailment, she initiates a sexual encounter with the android Data. In \"\" Yar is abducted by Lutan, the leader of the planet Ligon II, after she demonstrates her combat skills on the holodeck. She kills Lutan's wife Yareena in ritual combat to the death, though Yareena is revived on the \"Enterprise\" by Doctor Crusher. During the events of \"Where No One Has Gone Before\", Yar begins to hallucinate that she is back on Turkana\u00a0IV and running for her life. In \"The Arsenal of Freedom\", Yar and Data are trapped together on the surface of the planet Minos and are attacked by a series of sentry probes that adapt to Data and Yar's phasers. The situation is resolved by Captain Picard, who is trapped elsewhere on the planet's surface with Dr. Crusher.\nIn \"Skin of Evil\", Yar forms part of the away team that beams down to Vagra II to rescue Deanna Troi from a crashed shuttlecraft. She is killed by the creature Armus in a display of his power. The crew hold a memorial service for her on the holodeck, and Worf replaces her as chief tactical and security officer.\nYar's legacy has a minor role in \"\", a second season episode. Despite Data's lack of emotions, he is sentimentally attached to her, and keeps a small hologram of her in his quarters. During the court hearing on Data's stature as a sentient being, he says that he and Yar were intimate and that she was special to him. \nThe USS \"Enterprise\"-C emerges from a rift in space-time in \"Yesterday's Enterprise\", and the timeline is changed. Yar is once again alive and in her former position on the \"Enterprise\"-D. She works with the older Enterprise's helmsman, Richard Castillo, and the two become close. Guinan, who has some awareness of the timeline that would be restored by the \"Enterprise\"-C returning into the rift, confides in Yar that she believes that Yar died senselessly in that timeline. Based on that advice, Yar transfers to the \"Enterprise\"-C and returns with it to two decades into the past, and its expected destruction at the hands of the Romulans while defending the Klingon outpost Narendra\u00a0III. The alternative universe version of Yar traveled back in time on board the \"Enterprise\"-C, and into the main timeline. This process was later described as \"world jumping\" rather than a typical timeline travel story by critics.\nIn the two-part episode \"\", Denise Crosby plays Sela, Yar's half-Romulan daughter. In a follow-up to \"Yesterday's Enterprise\", it is revealed that several members of the \"Enterprise\"-C crew were captured by the Romulans when it returned through the rift, including Yar. A Romulan general offered to spare the crew's lives if she became his consort. After a year, Yar gave birth to Sela. When Sela was four, Yar attempted to escape but Sela screamed to prevent her from being taken away from her father. After she was caught, Yar was executed.\nThe series finale \"\" includes Yar's final appearance, in scenes that take place prior to and in the early parts of \"Encounter at Farpoint\". As most of the bridge crew are yet to join the \"Enterprise\"-D in the scenes, Yar is one of the senior members of the crew under Captain Picard in the earliest of the three timeframes in the episode. She needs to be convinced by Picard to put the ship in danger in order to destroy the temporal anti-time anomaly that threatens to prevent life from evolving on Earth.\nReception and commentary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe loss of Yar is unfortunate. While it's true the character as portrayed didn't live up to the character as envisioned\u2014Yar was the most interesting person in the TNG bible\u2014that's also true of a lot of characters. Denise Crosby has never been the best actor in the universe, but Michael Dorn, Jonathan Frakes, and Marina Sirtis weren't any great shakes in the first season, either, and their characters didn't blow the doors off. They got better with time, and there's every reason to believe the same would've been true for Crosby had she remained.\nKeith DeCandido, July 25, 2011\nScience fiction writer Keith DeCandido considered Yar the most interesting role in the \"\"TNG\" writer's bible\" used during the creation of the first season's scripts, despite missteps in fulfilling this potential. Peter W. Lee likewise admired the original \"Macha Hernandez\" role from the drafts and the elements that stretched into the final version of Yar: a character whose backstory was informed by failures of the Federation, but who rose above them. Lee also felt that these themes were related to then-resonant issues from the Reagan era of the 1980s. In particular, Yar provided a good counterbalance to the rest of the cast: she differed from the characters with utopian yet sheltered backgrounds, most starkly Wesley Crusher. However, Lee thought skepticism of career-oriented feminism in the 1980s resulted in contradictory depictions of her character. He thought it was unfortunate that the character never had a chance to develop. \nCritics were initially positive about the potential of her character as the first season debuted. A \"Post-Tribune\" review of the series following the pilot described Yar as a \"tough cookie\" and the reviewer's favorite crew member, while the \"Los Angeles Times\" called Crosby an especially good case of casting against type.\nFrank Oglesbee, in an article on ''s Kira Nerys, outlined the progression of female roles in \"gender assumptions\" from ' where women were on the bridge, through Tasha Yar in \"The Next Generation\" where they were in command positions, to \"Deep Space Nine\" and \"\" where women were in lead roles. He noted specifically that women appeared in command positions more regularly as main and supporting characters, and were portrayed as more assertive and combative, with leading roles in action sequences. A \"Den of Geek\" article by Martin Anderson about women in \"Star Trek\" described the character as a predecessor to Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace in the 2004 \"Battlestar Galactica\" series.\nFans and media critics have speculated about the character's sexuality. The series is largely silent about her sexuality, providing a space for interpretation that some fans have used to suggest she might be lesbian or bisexual. Henry Jenkins wrote that \"For these fans, the text's silences about character's sexuality or motives can be filled with homosexual desire, since, after all, in our society, such desire must often go unspoken.\" Jenkins described Yar as \"an obvious bisexual\". \"Curve\" magazine speculated that Yar was a \"closeted\" lesbian. The main exception to the usual silence on Yar's sexuality is the episode \"The Naked Now\", where Yar pairs off with Data while both are under the influence of a mysterious uninhibiting malady. Jenkins disliked the implications of the episode, and wrote that \"when they [the writers] decided to straighten her, they used an android. So we ended up heterosexualizing two perfectly wonderful characters\". The authors of the book \"Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos\" thought that having Data and Yar consummate sexually was a means to state early on in the series the heterosexuality of the two most androgynous characters in the show. Regardless of sexuality, Yar is portrayed as on the masculine tomboyish side, with short cropped hair and a lack of makeup leading to a \"somewhat butch\" appearance. Yar seeking out Troi's seductive and flimsy dresses in \"The Naked Now\" is correctly taken by Troi as a sign that Yar is ill.\nFans responded negatively to the death of Yar as they felt that the character had potential for future expansion. Many reviewers were critical of the manner of her death. Keith DeCandido called it \"pointless\", but also thought that it was no worse than the deaths of other security officer \"redshirts\" throughout the history of \"Star Trek\". He said that he preferred her death in \"Skin of Evil\" to the \"clich\u00e9d-up-the-wazoo\" death she experienced in \"Yesterday's Enterprise\". Gary Westfahl, in his book \"Space and Beyond: The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction\", described Yar's death as one of the most notable ones in \"Star Trek\", alongside that of Spock in \"\" and James T. Kirk in \"Star Trek Generations\". \"SFX\" magazine included her first death in a 2012 list of \"Naff Sci-Fi Deaths\", writing that while the intended idea that \"mundane\" deaths happen was fair, the overall effect was still \"a bit crap\". And while some critics thought her fate in that episode was cliche (such as DeCandido), many others liked \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" and considered it a classic episode, and praised it giving a chance for Yar to die heroically rather than meaninglessly.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The character returned for the third season of '. Portrayed by Michelle Forbes, she is a member of the Bajoran species who joins the crew of the USS \"Enterprise-D\" over the fervent objection of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), who cited her previous court-martial. Ro, too, was against joining the \"Enterprise\" crew, but said, \"It is better than prison.\" The character was intended both to be at odds with the series regulars and to replace Wesley Crusher in the conn officer post on the bridge. Forbes was cast to portray Ro after previously appearing in the series as Dara in the episode \".\nThe character first appears in the fifth-season episode \", which reveals elements of Ro's backstory. She continues to appear throughout that season, and makes a further appearance in both the sixth and seventh seasons. Starfleet sought her aid to help the Cardassians apprehend a Bajoran terrorist. After joining the \"Enterprise\" crew, she wants to abandon the engineering section of the vessel following a series of power failures in \"\". Alongside Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), she is affected by a Romulan experiment in \"The Next Phase\", and must help prevent the aliens from destroying the \"Enterprise\". In \", she is among the crew who are transformed into children and helps prevent a Ferengi plot. When making her final appearance in \", she is tasked by Starfleet to infiltrate the Maquis, eventually defecting and joining them permanently.\nRo was also planned to be a main character in \"\", but Forbes turned down the role, so Kira Nerys was created to replace her. Reviewers discussed Ro's religious views, comparing them to those of Kira. Ro was received positively by both critics and fans alike. Critics have praised Forbes's performance and Ro's interaction with the existing characters. She has been placed in several polls listing the most popular characters, with Jordan Hoffman calling her the second-strongest supporting female character in the franchise.\nRo, again played by Forbes, returned for the third season of \"Picard\" in the episode \"Imposters\", serving as a commander for Starfleet Intelligence.\nConcept and development.\nDuring the course of planning out the of \", the producers were looking to add a recurring character who could conflict with the regular cast at times, as well as a new conn officer to replace Wesley Crusher. With that in mind, the episode \" was written by Michael Piller, from a story idea created in conjunction with Rick Berman, to specifically introduce the character of Ensign Ro Laren. The episode was designed to show a backstory for the character, who would be at odds with series creator Gene Roddenberry's ideal that Starfleet officers should all work together seamlessly. One of her major character traits was that she would be a member of an oppressed people, whose homeworld had been conquered by another. Supervising producer Jeri Taylor explained that they had sought to add some \"fresh life\" using a darker character. \nMichelle Forbes was asked to return to the series, after impressing the producers with her performance as Dara in the episode \"\". The character was the daughter of Timicin, played by David Ogden Stiers, and supported the tradition that her father should commit ritual suicide upon reaching a certain age. The Bajoran make-up was created on her, with Michael Westmore seeking to make her look different from the rest of the crew, but in a way that would not detract from her appearance. Westmore created an appliance over Forbes' nose, before adding a row of ridges on her face. It was designed to be light and flexible, as he wanted the piece to move with Forbes' facial expressions. Her version of the make-up had seven ridges, while other actors in \"Ensign Ro\" had different numbers, between five and nine, with the male actors wearing larger pieces.\nPiller described the addition of Ro to the cast as one of that season's biggest accomplishments, and was pleased that it was well received. He added that in \"Ensign Ro\", they made a deliberate decision to have Ro embraced by Guinan to ensure that the fans warmed to the new addition. Piller felt that when Guinan took Ro to meet Captain Picard in that episode, the character was effectively presenting Ro to the fans of the series and endorsing her. During the writing process, he felt that once he came across the friendship between Guinan and Ro, he believed \"we had really done something magnificent\". Forbes, meanwhile, praised the writing and the cast of the series, saying that she had \"become very attached to \"Star Trek\".\nPiller was disappointed with the following Ro episode, \", as it put her in the position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of \"victories\" in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. She enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in \"\". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying: \"When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's an interesting thing. I had a really good time with that episode.\" Later in the season, \"The Next Phase\" was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro, instead, as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode \"\". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.\nRo made a single appearance in the sixth season, in the episode \"Rascals\", in which a transporter accident reverts Ro and three others into adolescents, with the younger version of Ro portrayed by Megan Parlen. Some consideration arose after the episode about whether or not to keep Ro as a child, as her return to adulthood was never shown on screen. Taylor said that the change would have been \"too drastic for us\", and the idea was abandoned. Her final appearance, in the penultimate episode of the series, \"\", had been considered a long shot by the producers. After the failure to agree to her appearances on \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\", Forbes' agent had warned them to stay away from her. A week prior to filming, no story was created for the episode other than the idea it would follow on from the \"Deep Space Nine\" episode \"\", and no agreement had been reached with Forbes to appear. Her agent indicated that Forbes wanted to talk directly to the producers, so she made the phone call, making up a story for the episode as the conversation went on. Forbes agreed, making her final appearance in the series. The character was promoted to lieutenant, and Forbes wore updated Bajoran make-up developed by Westmore for \"Deep Space Nine\".\n\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\n\"Ensign Ro\" influenced the creation of \"Deep Space Nine\", with the Bajorans and Cardassians taken directly from the episode. The character was included in the original series description, stationed on the Bajor-based Starfleet station, and the producers had planned for her to be promoted to lieutenant in an episode of \"The Next Generation\" prior to the start of \"Deep Space Nine\". Taylor had expected Ro to be written out of \"The Next Generation\", so had taken some steps to see that the character was replaced. She said, \"We all just love Michelle Forbes\", but the plans to replace Ro would not seek to add someone with the type of fire shown by the character in such episodes as \"The Next Phase\". She also said that if Ro were to remain on \"The Next Generation\", then the character would have naturally evolved away from that conflicted position, anyway.\nThe intention was that Ro would be one of a handful of \"The Next Generation\" characters moving over to the new series, alongside Miles and Keiko O'Brien. At this stage, the other characters were only described as a wheelchair-using science officer, a brash doctor, a civilian law enforcer, a bar owner and the station commander and his son. Ro's position on the station would have been to act as the liaison between the station and the Bajoran government. As described in the series bible, the producers had planned for Ro to be a point of conflict with \"by-the-book Starfleet officers\". Regarding the other main characters, she was planned to have a friendship with Odo and be mentored by Jadzia Dax.\nBoth Berman and Piller sought to have Forbes sign on to portray Ro as a main character in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on \"The Next Generation\", but did not want to tie herself down to a five- to six-year main-cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, and did not want to undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in \"Deep Space Nine\". The producers of \"Deep Space Nine\" decided to create a new character to fit a similar mold, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.\nAppearances.\nBackground.\nIn accordance with Bajoran tradition, her family name precedes her personal name. When she first joins the crew of the \"Enterprise-D\" during the course of \"Ensign Ro\", Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) addresses her as \"Ensign Laren\". She corrects him, saying that Laren is her given name and Ro is her family name. She is then referred to as \"Ensign Ro\". Over the course of her several appearances in \"The Next Generation\", information is revealed about her backstory. Bajor had been under the occupation of the Cardassians during her early life, and at the age of seven, she watched as one of the occupiers tortured her father to death. This led to a lifelong hatred of Cardassians.\nRo joined Starfleet, and after being posted to the USS \"Wellington\", she formed part of an away team. During that mission, she disobeyed orders, resulting in the death of eight crewmen. She was subsequently court-martialled and was imprisoned on Jaros II. Admiral Kennelly (Cliff Potts) later gave her a pardon and allowed her to return to Starfleet service in return for convincing Bajoran terrorist Orta (Jeffrey Hayenga) to call off his attacks after a raid on a Federation colony. He brings her to the \"Enterprise\" for the purpose of completing this mission.\n\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\nAs shown in \"Ensign Ro\", during an away-team mission to capture Orta, Ro manages to get the team taken hostage. As a result, Picard confines her to her quarters, but discovers that the Bajorans were not responsible for the attack on the Federation colony, and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) convinces Ro to tell Picard of Kennelly's plan. Ro was under orders to offer arms to Orta to trick him into revealing his presence so the Cardassians can destroy his vessel. At that point, Kennelly would intervene and order Picard not to intervene to keep the peace treaty with the Cardassians. Picard allows the plan to proceed, but the Cardassians destroy an empty ship before revealing that they had staged the attack to enlist aid against the Bajorans. At the conclusion of the episode, Picard offers Ro a position on the crew of the \"Enterprise\", which she accepts.\nIn \"Disaster\", Ro is one of the crew trapped on the bridge of the \"Enterprise\" when it undergoes a series of power failures. The ship is placed at risk of destruction because of the potential failure of the containment fields on the antimatter pods. Ro argues that they need to separate the saucer section to save those on board it, since they have no way of knowing if anyone is still alive on the engineering part of the vessel. When the crew undergoes group amnesia in \"Conundrum\", Ro and Riker act on a mutual attraction until their memories are restored. In \"The Next Phase\", Ro and La Forge apparently die after a transporter accident after returning from a Romulan Warbird, but they have suffered the side effects of a Romulan cloaking experiment. Ro initially questions whether or not she has died and is now in the afterlife, but together with La Forge, she discovers a Romulan plot. Defeating a similarly cloaked Romulan operative, Ro and La Forge alert the crew and return to normal, warning Picard and averting disaster.\nIn the episode \"Rascals\", Ro, Picard, Guinan, and Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao) are transformed into adolescent versions of themselves while retaining their adult intelligence. As children, they foil a Ferengi plot to steal the \"Enterprise\" and sell the crew as slave labor.\nIn her final episode, \"Preemptive Strike\", Ro returns to the \"Enterprise\" as a lieutenant after spending a year at Starfleet Advanced Tactical Training. During the course of her training, her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Chakotay, resigns from Starfleet to join the Maquis when his father is killed by the Cardassians. She is asked by Starfleet to infiltrate the rebel Maquis, who are undermining the Federation treaty with Cardassia. During the mission, she finds her loyalties in conflict with her duties, as she becomes increasingly sympathetic to the plight of the Maquis. Despite Picard's effort to force her to do her duty, she joins the rebel group. Riker says she seemed pretty sure she was doing the right thing, though she regrets disappointing Picard. Clearly wounded by Ro's betrayal, Picard remains silent.\n\"Star Trek: Picard\".\nRo later returns in \"Imposters\", the fifth episode of the third season of \"\". Since leaving the \"Enterprise\", Ro had turned herself in to Starfleet and was recruited by Starfleet Intelligence due to her experience with infiltrating terrorist organizations. She arrives on the \"Titan-A\" to presumably interrogate Picard and Riker for hijacking the ship, but after a heated exchange with Picard over her betrayal, reveals she is investigating the changelings and believes Starfleet has been compromised at the highest levels. Ro gives Picard a head start to get away, but is betrayed by her security team, actually changelings in disguise, and sacrifices herself to cripple the \"Intrepid\" to allow the \"Titan-A\" to escape, but not before giving Picard her Bajoran earring, revealed by Riker to be a data chip containing files on her entire investigation. An incoming transmission reveals that she was Worf and Raffi's mysterious handler. Before her death, Picard and Ro manage to come to terms with her betrayal, with Picard finally coming to understand her decisions. Her death greatly affects Picard.\nNoncanonical appearances.\nRo makes a series of appearances in the noncanonical novel series based on \"The Next Generation\". Her first appearance is in the novel, \"War Drums\", by John Vorholt, published in 1992, which chronicles a mission to a planet called Selva, and Ro plays a major role. Also included is an expansion on her background and early life in the book \"Night of the Wolves\" by S. D. Perry and Britta Dennison. The events of the away mission while she was serving on the USS \"Wellington\" were shown in the second special issue of DC Comics' \"\" series. Ro's career with the Maquis is also chronicled in the novels. In \"Rogue Saucer\", she is responsible for planning out the attack on the \"Enterprise\" in which the Maquis steal a prototype saucer section. Ro appears in the novel \"Tunnel Through the Stars\", set during the events of the Dominion War. Ro and the remaining Maquis join forces with Picard and the \"Enterprise-E\" to defeat the Dominion forces that are attempting to build an artificial wormhole to bypass the one near \"Deep Space Nine\".\nShe began to appear in the beginning with the two-part \"Avatar\" by Perry. The relaunch novels show the events that occur after the final episode of the television series. In \"Avatar\", Ro enlists in the Bajoran Militia with the rank of lieutenant, and is assigned to \"Deep Space Nine\" as the new security chief under the command of Colonel Kira. This move for Ro is also chronicled in the background to the massively multiplayer online role-playing game \"Star Trek Online\".\nIn \"Twilight\" by David R. George III, the first part of the \"Mission: Gamma\" miniseries, Quark and Ro start to develop romantic feelings for each other. In Perry's \"Unity\", Ro rejoins Starfleet after Bajor joins the Federation and its military forces are merged. She is initially apprehensive about the prospect, but is convinced to accept a pardon for her time with the Maquis by Picard. Over time, Ro was promoted to captain and as of the \"\" series of books, is in command of the new \"Deep Space Nine\", following the destruction of the original at the hands of a rogue element of the . Ro was also one of the characters included at launch in the strategy video game \"Star Trek Timelines\" by Disruptor Beam.\nThemes.\nThe Bajorans have been described as analogues for a variety of displaced peoples, with \"Star Trek\" novelist Keith DeCandido comparing them to \"Palestinians, Jews, Kurds, Haitians; the sad reality is that you can pretty much pick and choose. History is full of people who have had their homes taken from them, forced to become refugees.\" The Cardassian occupation of Bajor (the Bajoran homeworld) has been compared to the Holocaust, with Ro singled out as a Holocaust survivor. In his chapter \"Speakers for the Dead: \"Star Trek\", the Holocaust, and the Representation of Atrocity\" within the book \"Star Trek as Myth\", writer Matthew Wilheim Kapell compared the experiences and reactions of Ro Laren and Kira Nerys following the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. He said that the impact on Ro represented the \"non-American view of the holocaust\" in that she does not fully recover from the trauma and continues to affect in, for example, preventing her from connecting with her religious beliefs in \"The Next Phase\". He explains that Kira is a far more \"Americanize[d]\" character, acting as a \"resister and even liberator\" during the occupation. As a result, unlike Ro, Kira retains her religious beliefs and does not typically show any ongoing emotional trauma. Further commentary of Ro's relationship to religion have been made. In \"The Literary Galaxy of Star Trek\", James F. Broderick compared the situation in which Ro and La Forge are trapped out of phase in \"The Next Phase\" to that of the purgatory dweller in Dante Alighieri's \"Inferno\".\nReception.\nWhen reviewing \"Ensign Ro\" for \"Tor.com\", DeCandido described Michelle Forbes as \"stellar\" and called Ro \"one of \"TNG\"'s best recurring characters\". He also added that the character was \"a bit of piss and vinegar to add to the syrupy mix of homogeneity that the \"TNG\" cast tends to be\". In his review of \"Preemptive Strike\", he said that the Ro character arc \"comes full circle: once again making a decision that puts her on the outs with Starfleet.\" He praised Forbes again, saying that she \"inhabits the character so completely, from her awkwardness at the reception in her honor to her playing the role of rebel, to her pain at thinking about her father... to her decision to betray Starfleet and the \"Enterprise\".\" He did criticise the episode for not wrapping up the Riker-Ro relationship in the same way that closure had been given to her friendship with Picard. Zack Handlen reviewed \"Ensign Ro\" for \"The A.V. Club\", and described Ro as \"terrific\" and said that the role represented \"one of the rare times that \"TNG\" has managed to have a frustrated character who doesn't immediately seem overly hateful or falsely confrontational\". But he criticized the manner in which her opinion changed to be more favourable of Picard and the \"Enterprise\", as he felt that Guinan's intervention was detrimental to the plot.\nRo Laren has placed in several polls featuring the characters of the franchise over the course of several years. In a list of the strongest female characters on the official \"Star Trek\" website by Jordan Hoffman in 2012, Ro Laren was placed second behind Edith Keeler from the \"\" episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". He said that Ro was one of the \"richest figures in \"Trek\"\", and wished to be able to see an alternative timeline where Forbes had accepted the main cast position on \"Deep Space Nine\". A poll at the Creation Entertainment official \"Star Trek\" convention in 2013, conducted by Hoffman, placed Ro Laren as the fifth most popular recurring character among fans, behind Elim Garak, Q, Gul Dukat and General Martok. Hoffman expressed a view that he had expected her to place higher in the rankings, due to the number of her vocal supporters; however, she also had many booing her. On a poll run on the official \"Star Trek\" website in 2014 regarding the fans' favourite supporting character, Ro came eighth out of ten. In 2015, she was included in a list of the 21 \"most interesting\" supporting characters in the franchise by Lisa Granshaw at Blastr. Granshaw called Ro \"a complicated, strong character\", and said her \"different layers and motivations made her a great character to watch interact with the loyal crew of the \"Enterprise\".\"\nIn 2016, the character of Ro Laren was ranked as the 54th-most important character of Starfleet within the \"Star Trek\" science-fiction universe by \"Wired\". In 2016, \"Screen Rant\" rated Ro Laren as the 15th best character in \"Star Trek\". In 2017, \"IndieWire\" ranked Ro Laren as the 12th best character on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\nIn 2018, \"CBR\" ranked Ro Laren the 15th-best recurring character of all \"Star Trek\". They point out she was the first Bajoran presented in \"Star Trek\", and might have ended up as a character on \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the only living genus in the family Isoetaceae and order Isoetales. As of 2016[ [update]], there were about 200 recognized species, with a cosmopolitan distribution mostly in aquatic habitats but with the individual species often scarce to rare. Species virtually identical to modern quillworts have existed since the Jurassic epoch, though the timing of the origin of modern \"Isoetes\" is subject to considerable uncertainty.\nThe name of the genus may also be spelled \"Iso\u00ebtes\". The diaeresis (two dots over the e) indicates that the o and the e are to be pronounced in two distinct syllables. Including this in print is optional; either spelling (\"Isoetes\" or \"Iso\u00ebtes\") is correct.\nDescription.\nQuillworts are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic in clear ponds and slow-moving streams, though several (e.g. \"I.\u00a0butleri\", \"I.\u00a0histrix\" and \"I.\u00a0nuttallii\") grow on wet ground that dries out in the summer. The quillworts are spore-producing plants and highly reliant on water dispersion. Quillworts have different ways to spread their spores based on the environment. Quillwort leaves are hollow and quill-like, with a minute ligule at the base of the upper surface. arising from a central corm. The sporangia are sunk deeply in the leaf bases. Each leaf will either have many small spores or fewer large spores. Both types of leaf are found on each plant. Each leaf is narrow, long (exceptionally up to ) and wide; they can be either evergreen, winter deciduous, or dry-season deciduous. Only 4% of total biomass, the tips of the leaves, is chlorophyllous.\nThe roots broaden to a swollen base up to wide where they attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground rhizome characteristic of most quillwort species, though a few (e.g. \"I.\u00a0tegetiformans\") form spreading mats. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (\"velum\"), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. They are heterosporous. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining their megaspores under a microscope. Moreover, habitat, texture, spore size, and velum provide features that distinguish Iso\u00ebtes taxa. They also possess a vestigial form of secondary growth in the basal portions of its cormlike stem, an indication that they evolved from larger ancestors.\nBiochemistry and genetics.\nQuillworts use crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) for carbon fixation. Some aquatic species do not have stomata and the leaves have a thick cuticle which prevents CO2 uptake, a task that is performed by their hollow roots instead, which absorb CO2 from the sediment. This has been studied extensively in \"Isoetes andicola\". CAM is normally considered an adaptation to life in arid environments to prevent water loss with the plants opening their stomata at night rather than in the heat of the day. This allows CO2 to enter and minimises water loss. As mostly submerged aquatic plants, quillworts do not lack water and the use of CAM is considered to avoid competition with other aquatic plants for CO2 during daytime.\nThe first detailed quillwort genome sequence, of \"I. taiwanensis\", showed that there were differences from CAM in terrestrial plants. CAM involves the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and plants have two forms of the enzyme. One is normally involved in photosynthesis and the other in central metabolism. From the genome sequence, it appears that in quillworts, both forms are involved in photosynthesis. In addition, circadian expression of key CAM pathway genes peaked at different times of day than in angiosperms. These fundamental differences in biochemistry suggest that CAM in quillworts is probably another example of convergent evolution of CAM during the more than 300 million years since the genus diverged from other plants. However, they may also be because of differences between life in water and in the air. The genome sequence also provided two insights into its structure. First, genes and repeated non-coding regions were fairly evenly distributed across all the chromosomes. This is similar to genomes of other non-seed plants, but different from the seed plants (angiosperms) where there are distinctly more genes at the ends of chromosomes. Secondly, there was also evidence that the whole genome had been duplicated in the ancient past.\nThere are species that switch from CAM to C3 photosynthesis when they go from being submerged in water to living terrestrially, and develop stomata on their leaves. Some species (\"I.\u00a0palmeri\", \"I.\u00a0lechleri\" and \"I.\u00a0karsteni\"), even under aerial conditions, rarely form stomata, and in some cases (\"I.\u00a0triquetra\" and \"I.\u00a0andina\") appear to have completely lost the ability to produce stomata.\nReproduction.\nOverview.\nLike all land plants, \"Isoetes\" undergoes an alternation of generations between a diploid sporophyte stage and a sexual haploid gametophyte stage. However, the dominance of one stage over the other has shifted over time. The development of vascular tissue and subsequent diversification of land plants coincides with the increased dominance of the sporophyte and reduction of the gametophyte. \"Isoetes\", as members of the Lycopodiopsida class, are part of the oldest extant lineage that reflects this shift to a sporophyte dominant lifecycle. In closely related lineages, such as the extinct \"Lepidodendron\", spores were dispersed by the sporophyte through large collections of sporangia called strobili for wind-based spore dispersal. However, \"Isoetes\" are small heterosporous semi-aquatic plants, with different reproductive needs and challenges than large tree-like land plants.\nDescription.\nLike the rest of the Lycopodiopsida class, \"Isoetes\" reproduces with spores. Among the lycophytes, both \"Isoetes\" and the Selaginellaceae (spikemosses) are heterosporous, while the remaining lycophyte family Lycopodiaceae (clubmosses) is homosporous. As heterosporous plants, fertile Isoetes sporophytes produce megaspores and microspores, which develop in the megasporangia and microsporangia. These spores are highly ornate and are the primary way by which species are identified, although no one functional purpose of the intricate surface patterns is agreed upon. The megasporangia occur within the outermost microphylls (single-veined leaves) of the plant while the microsporangia are found in the innermost microphylls. This pattern of development is hypothesized to improve the dispersal of the heavier megaspore. These spores then germinate and divide into mega- and micro- gametophytes. The microgametophytes have antheridia, which in turn produce sperm. The megagametophytes have archegonia, which produce egg cells. Fertilization takes place when the motile sperm from a microgametophyte locates the archegonia of a megagametophyte and swims inside to fertilize the egg.\nOutside of heterospory, a distinguishing feature of \"Isoetes\" (and \"Selaginella\") from other pteridophytes, is that their gametophytes grow inside the spores. This means that the gametophytes never leave the protection of the spore that disperses them, cracking the perispore (the outer layer of the spore) just enough to allow the passage of gametes. This is fundamentally different from ferns, where the gametophyte is a photosynthetic plant exposed to the elements of its environment. However, containment creates a separate problem for Isoetes, which is that the gametophytes have no way to acquire energy on their own. \"Isoetes\" sporophytes solve this problem by provisioning starches and other nutrients to the spores as an energy reserve for the eventual gametophytes. Although not a homologous process, this provisioning is somewhat analogous to other modes of offspring resource investment in seed-plants, such as fruits and seeds. The extent to which resources provisioned to the megaspore also support the growth of the new sporophyte is unknown in \"Isoetes\".\nDispersal.\nSpore dispersal occurs primarily in water (hydrochory) but may also occur via adherence to animals (zoochory) and as a result of ingestion (endozoochory). These are among the reasons suggested for the ornamentations of the spore, with some authors demonstrating that certain patterns seem well-adapted for sticking to relevant animals like waterfowl. Another critical element of dispersal is the observation that in some species of \"Isoetes\", the outer coat of megaspores have pockets that trap microspores, a condition known as synaptospory. Typically, heterospory means that colonization and long-dispersal are more difficult due to the fact that a single spore cannot grow a bisexual gametophyte and thus cannot establish a new population from a single spore as can happen in homosporous ferns. \"Isoetes\" may mitigate this issue via microspores stuck to megaspores, greatly increasing the possibility of successful fertilization upon dispersal.\nTaxonomy.\nCompared to other genera, \"Isoetes\" is poorly known. The first critical monograph on their taxonomy, written by Norma Etta Pfeiffer, was published in 1922 and remained a standard reference into the twenty-first century. Even after studies with cytology, scanning electron microscopy, and chromatography, species are difficult to identify and their phylogeny is disputed. Vegetative characteristics commonly used to distinguish other genera, such as leaf length, rigidity, color, or shape are variable and depend on the habitat. Most classification systems for \"Isoetes\" rely on spore characteristics, which make species identification nearly impossible without microscopy. Some botanists split the genus, separating two South American species into the genus \"Stylites\", although molecular data place these species among other species of \"Isoetes\", so that \"Stylites\" does not warrant taxonomic recognition. \nEvolution.\nThe earliest fossil that has been assigned to the genus is \u2020\"Isoetes beestonii\" from the latest Permian of New South Wales, Australia, around 252 million years ago. However, the relationships of pre-Jurassic isoetaleans to modern \"Isotetes\" have been regarded as unclear by other authors. \"Isoetites rolandii\" from the Late Jurassic of North America has been described as the \"earliest clear example of a isoetalean lycopsid containing all the major features uniting modern \"Isoetes\",\" including the loss of the elongated stem and vegetative leaves. Based on this, it has been stated that \"the overall morphology of \"Isoetes\" appears to have persisted virtually unchanged since at least the Jurassic\".\"\" The timing of the origin of the crown group is uncertain. Wood \"et al\" (2020) asserted there to be no morphological features that define the major clades within \"Isoetes,\" and no fossils are known that can be definitively assigned to the crown group.\"\" While Wood \"et al.\" suggested a young origin dating to the early Cenozoic based on molecular clock estimates\"\", the results were questioned by Wikstr\u00f6m \"et al.\" (2023) who regarded the molecular clock as providing no firm evidence for the origin time of the genus, which could date to the Mesozoic or even the late Paleozoic, depending on the calibration method used.\nExtant species.\nAs of November\u00a02019[ [update]], \"Plants of the World Online\" accepted the following extant species:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMany species, such as the Louisiana quillwort and the mat-forming quillwort, are endangered species.
