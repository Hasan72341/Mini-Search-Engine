With partner Anton Sikharulidze, she is the 1998 and 1999 World champion, 1998 Olympic silver medalist and 2002 Olympic champion.\nBerezhnaya first competed with Oleg Shliakhov for Latvia and won gold at the 1995 Troph\u00e9e de France. While training together in January 1996, she suffered a serious injury, leaving her partly paralyzed and unable to speak. She recovered rapidly and began competing again in November 1996 with new partner, Anton Sikharulidze. Within two years of the accident, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had established themselves as one of the best pair teams in the world. During their competitive career, they were coached by Tamara Moskvina at the Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and the Ice House in Hackensack, New Jersey.\nEarly life.\nBerezhnaya was born in the southern Russian town of Nevinnomyssk, her mother having moved from Voronezh and her father from beyond the Urals. She has an elder brother, Alexei, and a younger one, Ivan. Her parents divorced when she was five due to her father's alcoholism; her mother remarried but eventually divorced again. The family also included a cousin, Nadezhda, whose parents had died.\nBerezhnaya began skating at the age of four in Nevinnomyssk. At the age of 8, she began to be coached by Nina Ruchkina, who had arrived from Moscow. When Berezhnaya was 13, her coach asked her to switch from singles to pairs. Ruchkina had decided that her son, Alexander Ruchkin, should be a pair skater despite not being physically suited for the discipline \u2013 and she wanted Berezhnaya, as the smallest girl, to be his partner. Although Berezhnaya enjoyed watching pair skating, she was skeptical of the proposed partnership but Ruchkina convinced her mother that the pair would get a chance at CSKA Moscow's skating school. The coaches at CSKA also had doubts about Ruchkin's suitability but accepted the pair. Berezhnaya moved to Moscow, 791 miles to the north, and lived in a dormitory as her mother could not move with her. They made little progress as Ruchkin continued to struggle to lift her.\nEarly career.\nAfter unsuccessful partnerships with Ruchkin and another skater, the 14-year-old Berezhnaya teamed with Latvian-born Oleg Shliakhov, who had been dumped by his seventh partner. The partnership went well at first, however, over time he started to become physically and verbally abusive, hitting Berezhnaya and dropping her from lifts. He decided to move to Riga, Latvia, saying they would have better and cheaper training conditions. Seeing no alternative partner, she went with him. Although not violent outside the rink, he became abusive again in training. Berezhnaya kept quiet and did not tell her mother, worrying it would worsen her poor health. She continued for her mother's sake, \"I knew that she would watch me skate on TV and that it gave her strength. She was the only reason for me to continue.\" They trained on their own for a year as no coach wanted to take the pair but eventually found a coach unaware of Shliakhov's reputation. They had a strong showing at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, finishing eighth. The next season they won a pair of silver medals at the 1994 Skate Canada International and 1994 Troph\u00e9e de France and finished 7th at the 1995 World Championships. Having little success in keeping Shliakhov in line, their coach resigned at the end of the season.\nThe Latvian federation appealed to renowned coach Tamara Moskvina to take on the pair and she eventually invited them to train with her in May or June 1995. They spent a few months training in Colorado Springs, Colorado and then trained mostly at Yubileyny Sports Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia, despite the deteriorating and crowded facilities of the 1990s. Berezhnaya/Shliakhov won bronze at Skate America, gold at Troph\u00e9e de France and bronze at Nations Cup. Shliakhov was well behaved for half a year, but then dropped her from a lift. Moskvina had professional psychologists work with him regularly, however, after brief periods of calm with apologies and professions of affection, he would start to slip back to his old behavior. Berezhnaya thought he showed some improvement, however, Moskvina told her it was not enough and advised her to end the partnership. Shliakhov was registered at a mental hospital in Riga.\nBerezhnaya had begun to develop friendships with the other skaters at Yubileyny, becoming particularly close to Anton Sikharulidze, the 1994 and 1995 World Junior champion with Maria Petrova. Shliakhov began to perceive Sikharulidze as his rival. At the end of 1995, Shliakhov demanded that they train in Riga for three weeks in preparation for the 1996 European Championships. Sikharulidze urged her to stay in Saint Petersburg but she believed she could manage a few weeks.\nOn 9 January 1996, Berezhnaya was seriously injured when Shliakhov's blade sliced into her skull while the pair were practicing a side-by-side camel spin in Riga. Two surgical operations were performed to remove bone fragments from her brain. The accident caused partial paralysis on her right side, and doctors were unsure if she would walk again. She also briefly lost the ability to speak.\nDuring her hospitalization, Sikharulidze heard of the news, and traveled to Latvia to be with her, joining Moskvina. Berezhnaya was surprised and overjoyed to see him, but unable to speak or move. Shliakhov also arrived at the hospital with flowers but Berezhnaya did not wish to see him again. Her mother, Sikharulidze, and Moskvina took her back to Saint Petersburg, Russia where she could begin her rehabilitation. She was grateful for his support, saying she was \"skinny, shaved, half-alive, almost a skeleton, and Anton so tenderly cared about me. Perhaps it was his belief in me that helped me recover so quickly.\"\nPartnership with Anton Sikharulidze.\nBerezhnaya wished to return to the ice and doctors agreed that physical exercise would be therapeutic. On 15 March 1996, only two months after the accident, she began skating carefully with Sikharulidze's help and Moskvina observing. Berezhnaya said, \"I didn't have any false dreams about the future. All I thought about was those first steps.\" Moskvina felt the pair looked promising, \"They're a natural pair. They've got it \u2013 something magical.\"\nWith Berezhnaya's condition improving, the two began to consider the possibility of a competitive career together. She had made a nearly full recovery, although her speech remained slurred requiring speech therapy. As of 2010, only a minor speech problem remained. She returned to competition in November 1996, skating with Sikharulidze at Troph\u00e9e Lalique where the pair won bronze. In December, they placed fifth at Cup of Russia, and then captured the silver medal at the Russian Nationals, earning them a berth to the European Championships. In January 1997 in Paris, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze made the podium at their first Europeans together, obtaining the bronze medal. At the 1997 World Championships in March, their short program placed them provisionally in third, with two judges giving them first-place votes. However, the pair placed 12th in the long program and dropped to 9th overall.\n1998 Olympic season.\nThe next season, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze won the European Championship, defeating 1992 Olympic champion Artur Dmitriev with his new partner Oksana Kazakova, and the reigning World Champions Mandy W\u00f6tzel/Ingo Steuer. At only 20 and 21 years of age respectively, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze had established themselves as gold-medal favorites going into the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. They also won the Grand Prix Finals that year. Observers were impressed by their rapid progress. Ekaterina Gordeeva selected the pair as her and Sergei Grinkov's skating doubles in a documentary on the legendary team after her husband's death.\nAt the Olympics, the pair had one fall in the short program but their other elements were of high quality. In the long, they put themselves back in contention for the gold medal with a strong performance, until five seconds from the end when they had a surprising fall as Sikharulidze set her down from a closing star lift. Although disappointed by suddenly giving away their chance at the gold so close to the end of the program, Sikharulidze recovered from his shock and joked, \"It's a new finish. If you don't like it, we'll change it, no problem.\" The quality of the rest of their skating earned them the silver medal ahead of W\u00f6tzel/Steuer, while Kazakova/Dmitriev claimed the title. Former Japanese singles skater Yuko Kawaguchi became inspired to switch to pair skating after seeing Elena Berezhnaya at the Nagano Olympics.\nPost-1998 Olympics.\nFollowing the Olympics, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze competed at the 1998 World Championships where they won the gold medal. Later in the year, they spent some time training at the Stamford Twin Rinks in Stamford, Connecticut. They won 1998 Skate America and 1998 NHK Trophy. In January 1999, they had to withdraw from the European Championships after the short program due to Berezhnaya having the flu. They won their second world title at the 1999 World Championships in March 1999.\nThe Yubileyny Sports Palace ice rink then closed for renovations, forcing the pair and Moskvina to relocate to Hackensack, New Jersey's Ice House in the summer of 1999. Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze struggled at Skate America in October 1999, placing third, but regained their form to win Skate Canada in November. Moskvina would later admit Sikharulidze had become distracted by life in a new country and was not as focused on training. In February 2000, the pair won gold at the 2000 Europeans but were stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive for pseudoephedrine, a substance whose ban was lifted temporarily between 2004 and 2010 before being banned again. This resulted in a three-month disqualification from the date of the test, and the medal being stripped. She stated that she had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required. The pair missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification.\nBerezhnaya/Sikharulidze developed a rivalry with Canadians Jamie Sal\u00e9 and David Pelletier. The 2001 World Championships were held in Sal\u00e9/Pelletier's home country of Canada. Although Sal\u00e9 fell on the triple toe loop in the short program and then singled her double Axel in the long, Sal\u00e9/Pelletier were awarded gold ahead of Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze. At the 2001 European Championships, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze reclaimed their title.\nIn autumn 2001, Sikharulidze required stitches for a long gash along his arm when his partner's blade accidentally cut him in training just before the start of the Grand Prix season. The injury having delayed their preparations, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze used their Charlie Chaplin program at the start of the season and debuted their new long program to Meditation de Thais at the Grand Prix Final in December. The pair decided to keep their new programs for the Olympics, while their rivals abandoned their new long program, with which they had been struggling, and decided to reuse their old \"Love Story\" program. \"The New York Times\" speculated that the judging might be influenced by the crowd response, with the familiar music of Love Story having more potential to draw louder applause in North America and the judges not being immune to human reactions.\n2002 Olympics.\nAt the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, both pairs skated strong short programs, after which Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze were in first and Sal\u00e9/Pelletier, who had a fall at the end of their program, second. In the long program, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze skated a good program although Sikharulidze had a stumble on a jump element before quickly regaining unison with his partner. Sal\u00e9/Pelletier, meanwhile, had no obvious mistakes, although their program was easier. Four judges placed the Canadians first, while five had Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze as the winners, with the Canadians receiving higher technical scores and the Russians higher presentation scores. They were awarded the gold and the Canadians the silver. The result sparked a controversy with the media emphasizing Sikharulidze's stepout.\nThe International Skating Union's Technical Committee decided to look into the matter, first approaching French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the only Western judge in favor of the Russian pair. She allegedly said that she had been intimidated by the head of the French skating organization into voting for the Russian pair in exchange for an advantage for the French couple in the ice dancing competition, which was to follow a few days later. A second gold medal was awarded to the Canadian pair, and the IOC and ISU decided to declare both pairs as Olympic co-champions.\nPost-competitive career.\nIn May 2003, Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze confirmed they had retired from competitive skating. From 2002 to 2006, they toured with Stars on Ice, then returned to Russia. Although taking time off to have two children, Berezhnaya made occasional appearances in Russian ice productions. In 2006, Berezhnaya teamed with the actor Aleksandr Nosik for the Channel One (Russia) ice show \"Stars on Ice\" (Russian: ). In 2008, she was paired with the pop star Dima Bilan for the Russia 1 series \"Star Ice\" (\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0451\u0434). In 2009, she skated with the comedian Mikhail Galustyan in the Channel One series \"Ice Age 3\". She also skated with former training mate John Zimmerman in the \"Kings on Ice\" (\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043b\u044c\u0434\u0430) show in 2009, and with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Blanchard in \"Ice Heart\" (\u041b\u0435\u0434\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435). In 2010, she joined another edition of \"Ice Age\", teaming up with Igor Ugolnikov.\nBerezhnaya/Sikharulidze skated together at a \"City Lights\"-themed ice show in Moscow from 14 to 17 October 2010. In late 2010 and early 2011, Berezhnaya played the White Queen in an \"Alice in Wonderland\" ice show in St. Petersburg and Moscow, alongside Alexei Yagudin and Tatiana Totmianina/Maxim Marinin. In autumn 2011, Berezhnaya participated in the third season of the Canadian reality program \"Battle of the Blades\", partnered with former NHL player Curtis Leschyshyn. In November 2011, she announced her retirement from performing. Berezhnaya coaches at the Yubileyny rink in Saint Petersburg.\nIn September 2021 Netflix premiered docuseries Bad Sport that includes an episode (\"Gold War\") detailing the events of the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal.\nPersonal life.\nSikharulidze and Berezhnaya had an on-and-off romantic relationship between 1996 and 2002; they remain close friends. With former husband Steven Cousins, Berezhnaya has a son Tristan \u2013 born 6 October 2007 in London, England \u2013 and daughter, Sofia Diana (diminutive: Sonia) \u2013 born on 21 June 2009 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In August 2010, the children were baptized in an Orthodox church in Saint Petersburg, with Sikharulidze becoming her son's godfather.\nPrograms.\nWith Sikharulidze.\nEligible career\nProfessional career\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This may be the ancient settlement the remains of which have been found on the hill named Castillo de la Zuda. In Roman times, the town took the name Dertosa ().\nTortosa was occupied in about 714, during the Arab conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom. It remained under Muslim rule for more than 400 years. King Louis the Pious laid siege to Tortosa in 808\u2013809, but although the city submitted he did not manage to occupy it.\nThe city was conquered by the Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona in 1148, as part of the Second Crusade. Because of the crusading appeal made by Pope Eugene III and his representative Nicholas Brakespear (the future Pope Hadrian IV), the siege received the aid of crusaders from multiple nationalities (Genovese, Anglo-Normans, Normans, Occitans, Germans, Flemish and Dutch), who were on their way to the Holy Land. The siege of Tortosa was narrated by the Genovese chronicler and diplomat Caffaro.\nAfter its conquest, the city and its territory were divided among the victors, with multiple lands being granted to foreign crusaders and to the military and religious orders.\nTortosa also had a sizable Jewish community in the 14th and 15th centuries; vestiges of that community can be seen throughout the City. \nIn the years 1413 and 1414, as an attempt to force conversion upon the Jews, Jews were forced to defend their religion in a two-week Disputation of Tortosa which took place in the Cathedral of Tortosa, which is still standing today.\nConstruction work on a railway line between Tortosa and Alca\u00f1iz began in 1891, to open a communication gate between this region and Aragon. The work, however, was haphazard and the first trains between Alca\u00f1iz and Tortosa began only in 1942.

Tortosa enjoys a very warm climate for its latitude. Even considering it's located at miles inland from the coastline, this mostly happens because the city lies on the delta of the Ebro river, which acts as a natural barrier against cold fronts. Albeit being a Mediterranean climate, winter months have less precipitation than autumn (common pattern in eastern Spain), but there is still a substantial summer drought.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It discusses the theory in relation to crime and strategies to contain or eliminate crime from urban neighborhoods.\nA successful strategy for preventing vandalism, according to the book's authors, is to address the problems when they are small. Repair the broken windows within a short time, say, a day or a week, and the tendency is that vandals are much less likely to break more windows or do further damage. Clean up the sidewalk every day, and the tendency is for litter not to accumulate, or for the rate of littering to be much less. Problems are less likely to escalate and thus respectable residents do not flee the neighborhood.\nOscar Newman introduced defensible space theory in his 1972 book \"Defensible Space\". He argued that although police work is crucial to crime prevention, police authority is not enough to maintain a safe and crime-free city. People in the community help with crime prevention. Newman proposed that people care for and protect spaces that they feel invested in, arguing that an area is eventually safer if the people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the area. Broken windows and vandalism are still prevalent because communities simply do not care about the damage. Regardless of how many times the windows are repaired, the community still must invest some of their time to keep it safe. Residents' negligence of broken window-type decay signifies a lack of concern for the community. Newman says this is a clear sign that the society has accepted this disorder\u2014allowing the unrepaired windows to display vulnerability and lack of defense. Canadian writer Malcolm Gladwell also relates this theory to the reality of New York City in his book, \"The Tipping Point\".\nThus, the theory makes a few major claims: that improving the quality of the neighborhood environment reduces petty crime, anti-social behavior, and low-level disorder, and that major crime is also prevented as a result. Criticism of the theory has tended to focus on the latter claim.\nTheoretical explanation.\nThe reason the state of the urban environment may affect crime consists of three factors: social norms and conformity; the presence or lack of routine monitoring; and social signaling and signal crime.\nIn an anonymous urban environment, with few or no other people around, social norms and monitoring are not clearly known. Thus, individuals look for signals within the environment as to the social norms in the setting and the risk of getting caught violating those norms; one of the signals is the area's general appearance.\nUnder the broken windows theory, an ordered and clean environment, one that is maintained, sends the signal that the area is monitored and that criminal behavior is not tolerated. Conversely, a disordered environment, one that is not maintained (broken windows, graffiti, excessive litter), sends the signal that the area is not monitored and that criminal behavior has little risk of detection.\nThe theory assumes that the landscape \"communicates\" to people. A broken window transmits to criminals the message that a community displays a lack of informal social control and so is unable or unwilling to defend itself against a criminal invasion. It is not so much the actual broken window that is important, but the message the broken window sends to people. It symbolizes the community's defenselessness and vulnerability and represents the lack of cohesiveness of the people within. Neighborhoods with a strong sense of cohesion fix broken windows and assert social responsibility on themselves, effectively giving themselves control over their space.\nThe theory emphasizes the built environment, but must also consider human behavior.\nUnder the impression that a broken window left unfixed leads to more serious problems, residents begin to change the way they see their community. In an attempt to stay safe, a cohesive community starts to fall apart, as individuals start to spend less time in communal space to avoid potential violent attacks by strangers. The slow deterioration of a community, as a result of broken windows, modifies the way people behave when it comes to their communal space, which, in turn, breaks down community control. As rowdy teenagers, panhandlers, addicts, and prostitutes slowly make their way into a community, it signifies that the community cannot assert informal social control, and citizens become afraid that worse things will happen. As a result, they spend less time in the streets to avoid these subjects and feel less and less connected from their community, if the problems persist.\nAt times, residents tolerate \"broken windows\" because they feel they belong in the community and \"know their place\". Problems, however, arise when outsiders begin to disrupt the community's cultural fabric. That is the difference between \"regulars\" and \"strangers\" in a community. The way that \"regulars\" act represents the culture within, but strangers are \"outsiders\" who do not belong.\nConsequently, daily activities considered \"normal\" for residents now become uncomfortable, as the culture of the community carries a different feel from the way that it was once.\nWith regard to social geography, the broken windows theory is a way of explaining people and their interactions with space. The culture of a community can deteriorate and change over time, with the influence of unwanted people and behaviors changing the landscape. The theory can be seen as people shaping space, as the civility and attitude of the community create spaces used for specific purposes by residents. On the other hand, it can also be seen as space shaping people, with elements of the environment influencing and restricting day-to-day decision making.\nHowever, with policing efforts to remove unwanted disorderly people that put fear in the public's eyes, the argument would seem to be in favor of \"people shaping space\", as public policies are enacted and help to determine how one is supposed to behave. All spaces have their own codes of conduct, and what is considered to be right and normal will vary from place to place.\nThe concept also takes into consideration spatial exclusion and social division, as certain people behaving in a given way are considered disruptive and therefore, unwanted. It excludes people from certain spaces because their behavior does not fit the class level of the community and its surroundings. A community has its own standards and communicates a strong message to criminals, by social control, that their neighborhood does not tolerate their behavior. If, however, a community is unable to ward off would-be criminals on their own, policing efforts help.\nBy removing unwanted people from the streets, the residents feel safer and have a higher regard for those that protect them. People of less civility who try to make a mark in the community are removed, according to the theory.\nConcepts.\nInformal social controls.\nMany claim that informal social control can be an effective strategy to reduce unruly behavior. expresses that \"community policing measures in the realization that informal social control exercised through everyday relationships and institutions is more effective than legal sanctions.\" Informal social control methods have demonstrated a \"get tough\" attitude by proactive citizens, and express a sense that disorderly conduct is not tolerated. According to Wilson and Kelling, there are two types of groups involved in maintaining order, 'community watchmen' and 'vigilantes'. With broken windows theory, the United States has, in some ways, adopted policing strategies of pre-modern Europe where informal social control was the norm. Wilson and Kelling (1982) find that, in pre-modern times, as there was no statutory framework for law enforcers to follow, informal policing was primarily 'objective' driven.\n argue that improper land use can cause disorder, and the larger the public land is, the more susceptible it will be to criminal deviance. Therefore, nonresidential spaces, such as businesses, may assume to the responsibility of informal social control \"in the form of surveillance, communication, supervision, and intervention\". It is expected that more strangers occupying the public land creates a higher chance for disorder. Jane Jacobs can be considered one of the original pioneers of this perspective of \"broken windows\". Much of her book, \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\", focuses on residents' and nonresidents' contributions to maintaining order on the street, and explains how local businesses, institutions, and convenience stores provide a sense of having \"eyes on the street\".\nSocial indifference or apathy poses a problem to the \"eyes on the street\" theory of informal social control, as many residents feel that regulating disorder in the community is not their responsibility. Wilson and Kelling cite psychological research that suggest people often refuse to go to the aid of someone seeking help, not due to a lack of concern or selfishness \"but the absence of some plausible grounds for feeling that one must personally accept responsibility\". On the other hand, others plainly refuse to put themselves in harm's way, depending on how grave they perceive the nuisance to be; a 2004 study observed that \"most research on disorder is based on individual level perceptions decoupled from a systematic concern with the disorder-generating environment.\" Essentially, everyone perceives disorder differently, and can contemplate seriousness of a crime based on those perceptions. However, Wilson and Kelling feel that although community involvement can make a difference, \"the police are plainly the key to order maintenance.\"\nRole of fear.\nRanasinghe argues that the concept of fear is a crucial element of broken windows theory, because it is the foundation of the theory. She also adds that public disorder is \"... unequivocally constructed as problematic because it is a source of fear\". Fear is elevated as perception of disorder rises; creating a social pattern that tears the social fabric of a community and leaves the residents feeling hopeless and disconnected. Wilson and Kelling hint at the idea, but do not focus on its central importance. They indicate that fear was a product of incivility, not crime, and that people avoid one another in response to fear, weakening controls. Hinkle and Weisburd found that police interventions to combat minor offenses, as per the broken windows model, \"significantly increased the probability of feeling unsafe,\" suggesting that such interventions might offset any benefits of broken windows policing in terms of fear reduction.\nComparison to \"zero tolerance\".\nBroken windows policing is sometimes described as a \"zero tolerance\" policing style, including in some academic studies. Bratton and Kelling have said that broken windows policing and zero tolerance are different, and that minor offenders should receive lenient punishment.\nCritical developments.\nIn an earlier publication of \"The Atlantic\" released March 1982, Wilson wrote an article indicating that police efforts had gradually shifted from maintaining order to fighting crime. This indicated that order maintenance was something of the past, and soon it would seem as it has been put on the back burner. The shift was attributed to the rise of the social urban riots of the 1960s, and \"social scientists began to explore carefully the order maintenance function of the police, and to suggest ways of improving it\u2014not to make streets safer (its original function) but to reduce the incidence of mass violence\". Other criminologists argue between similar disconnections, for example, Garland argues that throughout the early and mid 20th century, police in American cities strived to keep away from the neighborhoods under their jurisdiction. This is a possible indicator of the out-of-control social riots that were prevalent at that time. Still many would agree that reducing crime and violence begins with maintaining social control/order.\nJane Jacobs' \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" is discussed in detail by Ranasinghe, and its importance to the early workings of broken windows, and claims that Kelling's original interest in \"minor offences and disorderly behaviour and conditions\" was inspired by Jacobs' work. Ranasinghe includes that Jacobs' approach toward social disorganization was centralized on the \"streets and their sidewalks, the main public places of a city\" and that they \"are its most vital organs, because they provide the principal visual scenes\". Wilson and Kelling, as well as Jacobs, argue on the concept of civility (or the lack thereof) and how it creates lasting distortions between crime and disorder. Ranasinghe explains that the common framework of both set of authors is to narrate the problem facing urban public places. Jacobs, according to Ranasinghe, maintains that \"Civility functions as a means of informal social control, subject little to institutionalized norms and processes, such as the law\" 'but rather maintained through an' \"intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among people... and enforced by the people themselves\".\nCase studies.\nPrecursor experiments.\nBefore the introduction of this theory by Wilson and Kelling, Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist, arranged an experiment testing the broken-window theory in 1969. Zimbardo arranged for an automobile with no license plates and the hood up to be parked idle in a Bronx neighbourhood and a second automobile, in the same condition, to be set up in Palo Alto, California. The car in the Bronx was attacked within minutes of its abandonment. Zimbardo noted that the first \"vandals\" to arrive were a family\u2014a father, mother, and a young son\u2014who removed the radiator and battery. Within twenty-four hours of its abandonment, everything of value had been stripped from the vehicle. After that, the car's windows were smashed in, parts torn, upholstery ripped, and children were using the car as a playground. At the same time, the vehicle sitting idle in Palo Alto sat untouched for more than a week until Zimbardo himself went up to the vehicle and deliberately smashed it with a sledgehammer. Soon after, people joined in for the destruction, although criticism has been levelled at this claim as the destruction occurred after the car was moved to the campus of Stanford university and Zimbardo's own students were the first to join him. Zimbardo observed that a majority of the adult \"vandals\" in both cases were primarily well dressed, Caucasian, clean-cut and seemingly respectable individuals. It is believed that, in a neighborhood such as the Bronx where the history of abandoned property and theft is more prevalent, vandalism occurs much more quickly, as the community generally seems apathetic. Similar events can occur in any civilized community when communal barriers\u2014the sense of mutual regard and obligations of civility\u2014are lowered by actions that suggest apathy.\nNew York City.\nIn 1985, the New York City Transit Authority hired George L. Kelling, the author of \"Broken Windows\", as a consultant. Kelling was later hired as a consultant to the Boston and the Los Angeles police departments.\nOne of Kelling's adherents, David L. Gunn, implemented policies and procedures based on the Broken Windows Theory, during his tenure as President of the New York City Transit Authority. One of his major efforts was to lead a campaign from 1984 to 1990 to rid graffiti from New York's subway system.\nIn 1990, William J. Bratton became head of the New York City Transit Police. Bratton was influenced by Kelling, describing him as his \"intellectual mentor\". In his role, he implemented a tougher stance on fare evasion, faster arrestee processing methods, and background checks on all those arrested.\nAfter being elected Mayor of New York City in 1993, Rudy Giuliani hired Bratton as his police commissioner to implement similar policies and practices throughout the city. Giuliani heavily subscribed to Kelling and Wilson's theories. Such policies emphasized addressing crimes that negatively affect quality of life. In particular, Bratton directed beat officers to more strictly enforce laws against petty offenses like subway fare evasion, public drinking, public urination, and graffiti. Bratton also revived the New York City Cabaret Law, a previously dormant Prohibition-era ban on dancing in unlicensed establishments. Throughout the late 1990s, the NYPD shut down many of the city's acclaimed nightspots for illegal dancing.\nAccording to a 2001 study by Kelling and William Sousa of crime trends in New York City, rates of both petty and serious crime saw significant drops after the aforementioned quality-of-life policing policies were implemented. Furthermore, crime across all categories continued to decline for the following ten years. This data suggested that policies based on the Broken Windows Theory were effective. Later, in 2016, Brian Jordan Jefferson used the precedent of Kelling and Sousa's study to conduct fieldwork in the 70th precinct of New York City, which it was corroborated that crime mitigation in the area were concerning \"quality of life\" issues, which included noise complaints and loitering. The falling crime rates throughout New York City had built a mutual relationship between residents and law enforcement in vigilance of disorderly conduct.\nHowever, other studies do not find a causal relationship between the adoption of such policies and decreases in crime. The decrease may have been part of a broader trend across the United States. The rates of most crimes, including all categories of violent crime, made consecutive declines from their peak in 1990, under Giuliani's predecessor, David Dinkins. Other cities also experienced less crime, even though they had different police policies. Other factors, such as the 39% drop in New York City's unemployment rate between 1992 and 1999, could also explain the decrease reported by Kelling and Sousa.\nA 2017 study found that when the New York Police Department (NYPD) stopped aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes in late 2014 and early 2015 that civilian complaints of three major crimes (burglary, felony assault, and grand larceny) decreased (slightly with large error bars) during and shortly after sharp reductions in proactive policing. There was no statistically significant effect on other major crimes such as murder, rape, robbery, or grand theft auto. These results are touted as challenging prevailing scholarship as well as conventional wisdom on authority and legal compliance by implying that aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes incites more severe criminal acts.\nAlbuquerque.\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, instituted the Safe Streets Program in the late 1990s based on the Broken Windows Theory. The Safe Streets Program sought to deter and reduce unsafe driving and incidence of crime by saturating areas where high crime and crash rates were prevalent with law enforcement officers. Operating under the theory that American Westerners use roadways much in the same way that American Easterners use subways, the developers of the program reasoned that lawlessness on the roadways had much the same effect as it did on the New York City Subway. Effects of the program were reviewed by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and were published in a case study. The methodology behind the program demonstrates the use of deterrence theory in preventing crime.\nLowell, Massachusetts.\nIn 2005, Harvard University and Suffolk University researchers worked with local police to identify 34 \"crime hot spots\" in Lowell, Massachusetts. In half of the spots, authorities cleared trash, fixed streetlights, enforced building codes, discouraged loiterers, made more misdemeanor arrests, and expanded mental health services and aid for the homeless. In the other half of the identified locations, there was no change to routine police service.\nThe areas that received additional attention experienced a 20% reduction in calls to the police. The study concluded that cleaning up the physical environment was more effective than misdemeanor arrests.\nNetherlands.\nIn 2007 and 2008, Kees Keizer and colleagues from the University of Groningen conducted a series of controlled experiments to determine if the effect of existing visible disorder (such as litter or graffiti) increased other crime such as theft, littering, or other antisocial behavior. They selected several urban locations, which they arranged in two different ways, at different times. In each experiment, there was a \"disorder\" condition in which violations of social norms as prescribed by signage or national custom, such as graffiti and littering, were clearly visible as well as a control condition where no violations of norms had taken place. The researchers then secretly monitored the locations to observe if people behaved differently when the environment was \"disordered\". Their observations supported the theory. The conclusion was published in the journal \"Science\": \"One example of disorder, like graffiti or littering, can indeed encourage another, like stealing.\"\nMexico City.\nAn 18-month study by Carlos Vilalta in Mexico City showed that framework of Broken Windows Theory on homicide in suburban neighborhoods was not a direct correlation, but a \"concentrated disadvantage\" in the perception of fear and modes of crime prevention. In areas with more social disorder (such as public intoxication), an increased perception of law-abiding citizens to feel unsafe amplified the impact of homicide occurring in the neighborhood. It was also found that it was more effective in preventing instances of violent crime among people living in areas with less physical structural decay (such as graffiti), lending credence to the Broken Windows Theory basis that law enforcement is trusted more among those in areas with less disorder.\nFurthering this data, a 2023 study conducted by Ricardo Massa on residency near clandestine dumpsites associated economic disenfranchisement with high physical disorder. The neighborhoods that had high concentrations of landfill waste were correlated with crimes (such as vehicle theft and robbery), and most significantly crimes related to property. In a space where property damage and neglect is normalized, a person's response to this type of environment can also greatly be affected by their perception of their surroundings. It was also concluded that non-residents of these high-concentration areas tended to fear and avoid these locations, seeing as there was typically less surveillance and lack of community efficacy surrounding clandestine dumpsites. However, despite this fear, Massa also notes that, in this case, individual targets for crime (such as homicide or rape) were unlikely compared to the vandalism of public and private property.\nOther effects.\nReal estate.\nOther side effects of better monitoring and cleaned up streets may well be desired by governments or housing agencies and the population of a neighborhood: broken windows can count as an indicator of low real estate value and may deter investors. Real estate professionals may benefit from adopting the \"Broken Windows Theory\", because if the number of minor transgressions is monitored in a specific area, there is likely to be a reduction in major transgressions as well. This may actually increase or decrease value in a house or apartment, depending on the area. Fixing windows is, therefore, also a step of real estate development, which may lead, whether it is desired or not, to gentrification. By reducing the number of broken windows in the community, the inner cities would appear to be attractive to consumers with more capital. Eliminating danger in spaces that are notorious for criminal activity, such as downtown New York City and Chicago, would draw in investment from consumers, increase the city's economic status, and provide a safe and pleasant image for present and future inhabitants.\nEducation.\nIn education, the broken windows theory is used to promote order in classrooms and school cultures. The belief is that students are signaled by disorder or rule-breaking and that they in turn imitate the disorder. Several school movements encourage strict paternalistic practices to enforce student discipline. Such practices include language codes (governing slang, curse words, or speaking out of turn), classroom etiquette (sitting up straight, tracking the speaker), personal dress (uniforms, little or no jewelry), and behavioral codes (walking in lines, specified bathroom times).\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Stephen B. Plank and colleagues from Johns Hopkins University conducted a correlational study to determine the degree to which the physical appearance of the school and classroom setting influence student behavior, particularly in respect to the variables concerned in their study: fear, social disorder, and collective efficacy. They collected survey data administered to 6th-8th students by 33 public schools in a large mid-Atlantic city. From analyses of the survey data, the researchers determined that the variables in their study are statistically significant to the physical conditions of the school and classroom setting. The conclusion, published in the \"American Journal of Education\", was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStatistical evidence.\nA 2015 meta-analysis of broken windows policing implementations found that disorder policing strategies, such as \"hot spots policing\" or problem-oriented policing, result in \"consistent crime reduction effects across a variety of violent, property, drug, and disorder outcome measures\". As a caveat, the authors noted that \"aggressive order maintenance strategies that target individual disorderly behaviors do not generate significant crime reductions,\" pointing specifically to zero tolerance policing models that target singular behaviors such as public intoxication and remove disorderly individuals from the street via arrest. The authors recommend that police develop \"community co-production\" policing strategies instead of merely committing to increasing misdemeanor arrests.\nCriticism.\nOther factors.\nSeveral studies have argued that many of the apparent successes of broken windows policing (such as New York City in the 1990s) were the result of other factors. They claim that the \"broken windows theory\" conflates correlation with causality: reasoning prone to fallacy. David Thacher, assistant professor of public policy and urban planning at the University of Michigan, stated in a 2004 paper:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[S]ocial science has not been kind to the broken windows theory. A number of scholars reanalyzed the initial studies that appeared to support it... Others pressed forward with new, more sophisticated studies of the relationship between disorder and crime. The most prominent among them concluded that the relationship between disorder and serious crime is modest, and even that relationship is largely an artifact of more fundamental social forces.\nC. R. Sridhar, in his article in the \"Economic and Political Weekly\", also challenges the theory behind broken windows policing and the idea that the policies of William Bratton and the New York Police Department was the cause of the decrease of crime rates in New York City. The policy targeted people in areas with a significant amount of physical disorder and there appeared to be a causal relationship between the adoption of broken windows policing and the decrease in crime rate. Sridhar, however, discusses other trends (such as New York City's economic boom in the late 1990s) that created a \"perfect storm\" that contributed to the decrease of crime rate much more significantly than the application of the broken windows policy. Sridhar also compares this decrease in crime rate with other major cities that adopted various policies and determined that the broken windows policy is not as effective.\nIn a 2007 study called \"Reefer Madness\" in the journal \"Criminology and Public Policy\", Harcourt and Ludwig found further evidence confirming that mean reversion fully explained the changes in crime rates in the different precincts in New York in the 1990s. Further alternative explanations that have been put forward include the waning of the crack epidemic, unrelated growth in the prison population by the Rockefeller drug laws, and that the number of males from 16 to 24 was dropping regardless of the shape of the US population pyramid.\nIt has also been argued that rates of major crimes also dropped in many other US cities during the 1990s, both those that had adopted broken windows policing and those that had not. It is thought that this is due to the exposure of children to environmental lead, which leads to loss of impulse control and, when they reach young adulthood, criminal acts. There appears to be a correlation between a 25-year lag between the addition and removal of lead from paint and gasoline and rises and falls in murder arrests.\nIn his book, Baltimore criminologist Ralph B. Taylor argues that fixing windows is only a partial and short-term solution. His data supports a materialist view: changes in physical decay, superficial social disorder, and racial composition do not lead to higher crime, but economic decline does. He contends that the example shows that real, long-term reductions in crime require that urban politicians, businesses, and community leaders work together to improve the economic fortunes of residents in high-crime areas.\nIn 2015, Northeastern University assistant professor Daniel T. O'Brien criticised the broken window theory model. Using his Big Data based research model, he argues that the broken window model fails to capture the origins of crime in a neighbourhood. He concludes that crime comes from the social dynamics of communities and private spaces and spills into public spaces.\nRelationship between crime and disorder.\nAccording to a study by Robert J. Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush, the premise on which the theory operates, that social disorder and crime are connected as part of a causal chain, is faulty. They argue that a third factor, collective efficacy, \"defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space,\" is the cause of varying crime rates observed in an altered neighborhood environment. They also argue that the relationship between public disorder and crime rate is weak.\nIn the winter 2006 edition of the \"University of Chicago Law Review\", Bernard Harcourt and Jens Ludwig looked at the later Department of Housing and Urban Development program that rehoused inner-city project tenants in New York into more-orderly neighborhoods. The broken windows theory would suggest that these tenants would commit less crime once moved because of the more stable conditions on the streets. However, Harcourt and Ludwig found that the tenants continued to commit crimes at the same rate. Another tack was taken by a 2010 study questioning the theory's legitimacy concerning the subjectivity of disorder as perceived by persons living in neighborhoods. It concentrated on whether citizens view disorder as separate from crime or identical to it. The study noted that crime cannot be the result of disorder if the two are identical, agreed that disorder provided evidence of \"convergent validity\" and concluded that broken windows theory misinterprets the relationship between disorder and crime.\nRacial bias.\nBroken windows policing has sometimes become associated with zealotry, which has led to critics suggesting that it encourages discriminatory behaviour. Some campaigns such as Black Lives Matter have called for an end to broken windows policing. In 2016, a Department of Justice report argued that it had led the Baltimore Police Department to discriminate against and alienate minority groups.\nA central argument is that the term disorder is vague, and giving the police broad discretion to decide what disorder is will lead to discrimination. In Dorothy Roberts's article, \"Foreword: Race, Vagueness, and the Social Meaning of Order Maintenance and Policing\", she says that the broken windows theory in practice leads to the criminalization of communities of color, who are typically disfranchised. She underscores the dangers of vaguely written ordinances that allow for law enforcers to determine who engages in disorderly acts, which, in turn, produces a racially skewed outcome in crime statistics. Similarly, Gary Stewart wrote, \"The central drawback of the approaches advanced by Wilson, Kelling, and Kennedy rests in their shared blindness to the potentially harmful impact of broad police discretion on minority communities.\" According to Stewart, arguments for low-level police intervention, including the broken windows hypothesis, often act \"as cover for racist behavior\".\nThe theory has also been criticized for its unsound methodology and its manipulation of racialized tropes. Specifically, Bench Ansfield has shown that in their 1982 article, Wilson and Kelling cited only one source to prove their central contention that disorder leads to crime: the Philip Zimbardo vandalism study (see Precursor Experiments above). But Wilson and Kelling misrepresented Zimbardo's procedure and conclusions, dispensing with Zimbardo's critique of inequality and community anonymity in favor of the oversimplified claim that one broken window gives rise to \"a thousand broken windows\". Ansfield argues that Wilson and Kelling used the image of the crisis-ridden 1970s Bronx to stoke fears that \"all cities would go the way of the Bronx if they didn't embrace their new regime of policing.\" Wilson and Kelling manipulated the Zimbardo experiment to avail themselves of the racialized symbolism found in the broken windows of the Bronx.\nRobert J. Sampson argues that based on common misconceptions by the masses, it is implied that those who commit disorder and crime have a clear tie to groups suffering from financial instability and may be of minority status: \"The use of racial context to encode disorder does not necessarily mean that people are racially prejudiced in the sense of personal hostility.\" He notes that residents make a clear implication of who they believe is causing the disruption, which has been termed as implicit bias. He further states that research conducted on implicit bias and stereotyping of cultures suggests that community members hold unrelenting beliefs of African Americans and other disadvantaged minority groups, associating them with crime, violence, disorder, welfare, and undesirability as neighbors. A later study indicated that this contradicted Wilson and Kelling's proposition that disorder is an exogenous construct that has independent effects on how people feel about their neighborhoods.\nIn response, Kelling and Bratton have argued that broken windows policing does not discriminate against law-abiding communities of minority groups if implemented properly. They cited \"Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods\", a study by Wesley Skogan at Northwestern University. The study, which surveyed 13,000 residents of large cities, concluded that different ethnic groups have similar ideas as to what they would consider to be \"disorder\".\nMinority groups have tended to be targeted at higher rates by the Broken Windows style of policing. Broken Windows policies have been used more heavily in minority neighborhoods where low-income, poor infrastructure and social disorder were widespread, causing minority groups to perceive that they were being racially profiled under Broken Windows policing.\nClass bias.\nA common criticism of broken windows policing is the argument that it criminalizes the poor and homeless. That is because the physical signs that characterize a neighborhood with the \"disorder\" that broken windows policing targets correlate with the socio-economic conditions of its inhabitants. Many of the acts that are considered legal but \"disorderly\" are often targeted in public settings and are not targeted when they are conducted in private. Therefore, those without access to a private space are frequently criminalized. Critics, such as Robert J. Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush of Harvard University, see the application of the broken windows theory in policing as a war against the poor, as opposed to a war against more serious crimes. Since minority groups in most cities are more likely to be poorer than the rest of the population, a bias against the poor would be linked to a racial bias.\nAccording to Bruce D. Johnson, Andrew Golub, and James McCabe, applying the broken windows theory in policing and policymaking can result in development projects that decrease physical disorder but promote undesired gentrification. Often, when a city is so \"improved\" in this way, the development of an area can cause the cost of living to rise higher than residents can afford, which forces low-income people out of the area. As the space changes, the middle and upper classes, often white, begin to move into the area, resulting in the gentrification of urban, poor areas. The residents are affected negatively by such an application of the broken windows theory and end up evicted from their homes as if their presence indirectly contributed to the area's problem of \"physical disorder\".\nPopular press.\nIn \"More Guns, Less Crime\" (2000), economist John Lott Jr. examined the use of the broken windows approach as well as community- and problem-oriented policing programs in cities over 10,000 in population, over two decades. He found that the impacts of these policing policies were inconsistent across different types of crime. Lott's book has been subject to criticism, while other groups support Lott's conclusions.\nIn the 2005 book \"Freakonomics\", coauthors Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner confirm and question the notion that the broken windows theory was responsible for New York's drop in crime, saying \"the pool of potential criminals had dramatically shrunk\". Levitt had in the \"Quarterly Journal of Economics\" attributed that possibility to the legalization of abortion with \"Roe v. Wade\", which correlated with a decrease, one generation later, in the number of delinquents in the population at large.\nIn his 2012 book \"Uncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society\", Jim Manzi writes that of the randomized field trials conducted in criminology, only nuisance abatement per broken windows theory has been successfully replicated.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars Anna Paquin, Jeff Daniels, and Dana Delany. \"Fly Away Home\" was released on September 13, 1996, by Columbia Pictures. Joseph Caleb Deschanel was nominated for best cinematography at the 69th Academy Awards for his work on the film.\nInspired by true events, \"Fly Away Home\" dramatizes the actual experiences of Bill Lishman who, in 1986, started training Canada geese to follow his ultralight aircraft, and succeeded in leading their migration in 1993 through his program \"Operation Migration\". The film is also based on the experience of Dr. William J. L. Sladen, a British-born zoologist and adventurer, who aided Lishman with the migration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nAfter surviving a car accident, in which her mother Aliane dies swerving out the way of an oncoming truck, 13-year-old Amy Alden is brought from New Zealand to Ontario, Canada, by her estranged father Thomas Alden, a sculptor and inventor, to live with him and his girlfriend Susan.\nWhen a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds an abandoned nest of 16 goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her father's old barn to incubate. When the eggs hatch, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local Animal Regulation officer Glen Seifert on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that an ordinance dictates that all domestic geese must have their wings clipped to render them flightless, so they don't communicate diseases with wild birds. He promptly tries to demonstrate the process with one of the goslings, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them.\nThomas decides to use his ultralight aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry, Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own. David knows someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.\nAmy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amy's aircraft and lands in an isolated forest. While the group goes off to search for the bird, Seifert returns to the Alden farm and confiscates the other geese. The next day, the Aldens free the geese from the government cages, and Amy leads them on their migration to North Carolina, keeping Igor strapped in her cockpit as he is unable to fly in his current condition.\nMaking an emergency landing at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in western New York on the south shore of Lake Ontario, Amy and Thomas almost get arrested. They become national news, with residents cheering them on.\nAfter their flock mingles with a larger wild flock which is being shot at by hunters, Thomas and Amy land and meet an old woman with a vendetta against goose shooting; she invites them to stay the night at her house. That night Amy asks Thomas why he rarely visited her and her mother. From her mother, she knows that her parents were artists, who tend to be selfish, and that her mother left for both of their sakes. Thomas tells her that he was afraid and angry at himself for letting them leave, so he spent the next ten years buried in his work. He apologizes to Amy.\nThirty miles before reaching the bird sanctuary, Thomas's aircraft suffers a structural failure and crashes in a cornfield; having suffered a dislocated shoulder he tells Amy to finish the journey by herself. Thomas hitchhikes to the bird sanctuary. While waiting for the geese, Thomas, Susan, David, Barry, and many animal enthusiasts stand up to developers who are waiting to start the excavation of the site.\nAmy eventually appears with the geese, much to the joy of the townspeople and Amy's family, and to the dismay of the developers. The townspeople and the Aldens celebrate their victory. During the end credits, a note reveals that all 16 geese - including a fully recovered Igor - returned to the Aldens' farm on their own in the following spring.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusic.\nThe film features the song \"10,000 Miles\" performed by Mary Chapin Carpenter. \"Wherever You Are\", also performed by Carpenter, appears during the end credits, though it is not present in the Special Edition DVD version.\nProduction.\nTwo farms near Lindsay in southeastern Ontario were used to recreate the Alden home. Principal photography took place in 1995. The blacksmith shop constructed onsite for the filming of \"The Last Buffalo\" at Purple Hill, Ontario, was reused as part of the Alden homestead.\nCaleb Deschanel, who had previously collaborated with director Carroll Ballard on the films \"The Black Stallion\" and \"Never Cry Wolf\", returned as director of photography for \"Fly Away Home\".\nTwo gliders were featured in the film: The UFM Easy Riser and the Cosmos Trike. The Easy Riser first appears as a foot-launched biplane hang glider. True to Lishman's real-life saga, modifications were made to improve the design including the addition of a motor and seat. Anna Paquin's character meanwhile flies an A-frame Cosmos Trike with a mock goose head mounted to the noseplate of the airframe and a fabric wing covering painted to resemble feathers (features Lishman wanted to add to his own Trike, but never did due to time). The Cosmos Trike was reportedly chosen for its safety, superior engine power, and increased wing size (a feature that was needed to fly slow enough for the birds).\nThe four-day trip home for the geese that would take them to Lake Ontario, over the Appalachians to Pennsylvania, Maryland, finally settling on the North Carolina Shores, had principal photography actually filmed nearly entirely at Port Perry and Sandbanks Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. Additional location shots were the city-fly-through in Toronto, Ontario, standing in for Baltimore, Maryland (with CGI aircraft). At the conclusion of the production, Lishman led the 60 imprinted \"actor-geese\" in migration, to winter at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center off the coast of Georgetown, South Carolina.\nWhile in production, the film was at first titled \"Flying Wild\", but was changed to \"Fly Away Home\" just weeks before its release in movie theaters. The original trailer has the title \"Flying Wild\", and can be found on certain VHS copies of \"Jumanji\" from Columbia TriStar Home Video; the French version title (\"L'Envol\u00e9e sauvage\") is the translated version of this title.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Fly Away Home\" returned US$25 million in the U.S. box office and US$11 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $36.5 million.\nCritical reception.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 48 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Well-acted and beautifully filmed, \"Fly Away Home\" offers heartwarming entertainment for moviegoers of all ages.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on 28 critics' reviews, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nIn a review that awarded 3 and 1/2 stars out of 4, Roger Ebert noted: \"There are individual shots here almost worth the price of admission...[including] a stunning shot in which the towers of Baltimore materialize from the mist, and office workers see the little girl and her geese flying past their windows.\" Janet Maslin from \"The New York Times\" was similarly effusive, writing \"Mr. Ballard turns a potentially treacly children's film into an exhilarating 90's fable.\" Gene Shalit on the \"Today Show\" called the film \"a must see movie\".\nFrederic and Mary Ann Brussat of \"Spirituality &amp; Practice\" stated, \"The movie adds excitement and emotion, turning into a celebration of the creative ways human beings and animals can serve, assist, and love one another.\"\nImpact.\nThe first production of investigative theater group The Civilians, \"Canard, Canard, Goose?,\" was inspired by rumors of animal mistreatment on \"Fly Away Home\"'s set.\nHome media.\n\"Fly Away Home\" was more successful on home video than in theaters. The studio sold an estimated $32 million on video, receiving 75% of the revenue. The film was originally released to VHS in December 1996. A DVD release in August 2001 included the exclusive featurette by Bill Lishman, \"Operation Migration: Birds of a Feather\", along with two documentaries: \"The Ultra Geese\" and the HBO special \"Leading the Flock\". The DVD also provided a link to Lishman's \"Operation Migration\" website. A companion CD audio recording of the music featured in the soundtrack was released in 1996. A Blu-ray edition of \"Fly Away Home\" was released on April 7, 2009.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is also known for his wider contribution to the founding of the British welfare state. He was first elected as MP for Ebbw Vale in 1929, and used his Parliamentary platform to make a number of influential criticisms of Winston Churchill and his government during the Second World War. Before entering Parliament, Bevan was involved in miners' union politics and was a leading figure in the 1926 general strike. Bevan is widely regarded as one of the most influential left-wing politicians in British history.\nRaised in Monmouthshire, in modern day Blaenau Gwent, by a Welsh working-class family, he was the son of a coal miner and left school at 14. Bevan first worked as a miner during his teens where he became involved in local miners' union politics. He was elected head of his Miners' Lodge when aged 19, where he frequently railed against management. He joined the Labour Party and attended Central Labour College in London. On his return to South Wales he struggled to find work, remaining unemployed for nearly three years before gaining employment as a union official, which led to him becoming a leading figure in the 1926 general strike.\nIn 1928, Bevan won a seat on Monmouthshire County Council and he was elected as the MP for Ebbw Vale the following year. He served as an MP for 31 years. In Parliament, he became a vocal critic of numerous other politicians from all parties, particularly Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. After the war, Bevan was chosen as the Minister of Health in Clement Attlee's new Labour government, becoming the youngest member of the cabinet at 47, with his remit also including housing. Inspired by the Tredegar Medical Aid Society in his hometown in South Wales, Bevan led the campaign for a National Health Service to provide medical care free at point-of-need across the UK, regardless of wealth. Despite resistance from opposition parties and the British Medical Association, the National Health Service Act 1946 was passed and launched in 1948, nationalising more than 2,500 hospitals within the United Kingdom.\nBevan was named Minister of Labour in 1951, but resigned after two months in office, when the Attlee government proposed the introduction of prescription charges for dental and vision care and decided to transfer funds from the National Insurance Fund to pay for rearmament. His influence waned after his departure, although a left-wing group within the party became known as \"Bevanites\". Attlee and Labour were ousted from power in a snap election held six months after Bevan's resignation, but Attlee continued on as Labour Party Leader. When Attlee retired from the leadership in 1955, Bevan unsuccessfully contested the party leadership with Hugh Gaitskell, but was appointed Shadow Colonial Secretary and later Shadow Foreign Secretary. In 1959, he was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and held the post for a year until his death in 1960 from stomach cancer, at the age of 62. His death led to \"an outpouring of national mourning\". In 2004, more than 44 years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, having been credited for his contribution to the founding of the welfare state in the UK.\nEarly life.\nAneurin Bevan was born on 15 November 1897 at 32 Charles Street in Tredegar, Monmouthshire, a working-class mining town, where an estimated 90 per cent of the town's inhabitants relied on the local mines for employment. The town was situated in the South Wales Valleys and was on the northern edge of the South Wales coalfield. He was the son of coal miner David Bevan and Phoebe (n\u00e9e Prothero), a seamstress. David Bevan was born in Tredegar but his family had originally hailed from Carmarthenshire, and he followed his own father into the mines, starting work at 5:30am each day and returning home late in the evening. He was adept at construction and added several modern features when the family moved to 7 Charles Street, installing the first gas stove in the street, an inside toilet and running hot water.\nBoth Bevan's parents were Nonconformists: his father was a Baptist and his mother a Methodist, although he became an atheist. He was converted to socialism by the writings of Robert Blatchford in \"The Clarion\" and began attending meetings of the Independent Labour Party following the founding of its branch in Tredegar. It was around this time that he first \"reject[ed] his chapel upbringing\" and became an atheist. He was a member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion and wrote his own poems, one of which won an inter-chapel eisteddfod. Aneurin's mother was also from Tredegar, but had English roots: her grandfather was from Hereford. Bevan's maternal grandfather John was a blacksmith who had moved to Tredegar from Hay-on-Wye to work in the Bedwellty mines.\nThe couple had ten children altogether\u2014six boys and four girls\u2014although four died in infancy and one died at the age of eight. Aneurin Bevan attended Sirhowy Elementary School, where he achieved little. He developed a severe stammer as a child and, according to his younger sister Myfanwy, became \"a lonely chap\", due to the need to shy away from the attention it brought him.\nHis father died by pneumoconiosis (a lung condition caused by long term inhalation of coal dust) but no compensation was paid to him, as it was not classed as an industrial disease under the Workmen's Compensation Act.\nWorking life as a miner.\nAt the age of 13, in his last months of schooling, he worked as a butcher's boy at a local store. He worked at the butcher's for several months before leaving school, instead working in the local Ty-Trist Colliery. There he earned around ten shillings per week with most going to his parents to help support the family. He began attending fortnightly meetings of the local Plebs' League where he studied, among other things, Marxism. Bevan also joined the Tredegar branch of the South Wales Miners' Federation and became a trade union activist: he was head of his local Miners' Lodge at 19 years of age. He was called up for service during the First World War, and was briefly arrested when his sister Blodwen burnt his conscription papers and he failed to report for duty. Bevan appeared in court but was cleared when he produced confirmation that he suffered from nystagmus.\nBevan became a well-known local orator and was seen by his employers, the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company, as a troublemaker. The manager of the colliery found an excuse to get him dismissed. With the support of the Miners' Federation, the case was judged as one of victimisation and the company was forced to re-employ him. He and his brother Billy did eventually leave Ty-Tryst and worked at the Bedwellty pit, but were forced to move again after a disagreement with the site's deputy manager over Bevan reporting information to the miner's inspector. The pair went to work at Whitworth Colliery, but fell foul of management when Bevan refused to use cheaper second-hand timber as he deemed it unsafe. He was later fired for refusing to unload, and successfully challenged the motion but was moved to Pochin, generally considered a punishment due to the poor site conditions.\n1919 saw the foundation of the Tredegar Labour Party and Bevan was selected as one of four Labour delegates to contest the West Ward in the Tredegar Urban District election. Although he was defeated, he gained attention from his peers and he won a scholarship to the Central Labour College in London, sponsored by the South Wales Miners' Federation. There, he spent two years studying economics, politics and history. He read Marxism at the college and was a brief follower of Noah Ablett, developing his left-wing political outlook. Reciting long passages by William Morris with the help of an elocution tutor, Bevan gradually began to overcome the stammer that he had since childhood. Bevan remained at the college until 1921, attending at a time when a number of his contemporaries from South Wales, including Jim Griffiths, were also students at the college. Some historians have questioned how influential the college was on his political development. He was not, apparently, one of the most diligent students, and found it difficult to follow an organised routine, including arising early for breakfast.\nBevan was one of the founding members of the \"Query Club\" with his brother Billy and Walter Conway. Conway was a local miner who had been elected to the Bedwellty Board of Guardians and offered Bevan advice on overcoming his stammer, stating \"if you can't say it, you don't know it\". Bevan followed his advice, often practising his speeches to his friends to perfect his speech and wording, and remarked that Conway's words were the \"best advice I ever had\". The Query club started in 1920 or 1921 and they met in Tredegar. They would collect money weekly for any member who needed it. The club intended to break the hold that the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company had on the town by becoming members of pivotal groups in the community.\nUpon returning home in 1921, he found that the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company refused to re-employ him. Bevan ended up in a fist fight with a group of miners who refused to strike over his rejection. Apart from a six-week period as a labourer for Tredegar Council, he did not find work until 1924 and his employer, the Bedwellty Colliery, closed down ten months later. Bevan then endured another year of unemployment, the family surviving on his sister's wages, when his unemployment benefit was stopped due to her income, and his father's sick pay. In February 1925, his father died of pneumoconiosis, an illness caused by the inhalation of coal dust. In 1926 he found work as a paid union official. His wage of \u00a35 a week was paid by the members of the local Miners' Lodge. His new job arrived in time for him to head the local miners against the colliery companies during the General Strike. When the strike started on 3 May 1926, Bevan soon emerged as one of the leaders of the South Wales miners. The miners remained on strike for six months. Bevan was largely responsible for the distribution of strike pay in Tredegar and the formation of the Council of Action, an organisation that helped to raise money and provide food for the miners.\nParliament.\nMP for Ebbw Vale.\nIn 1928, Bevan won a seat on Monmouthshire County Council in the Tredegar Central Division. He lost the seat in 1931, but regained it in 1932 before deciding against seeking re-election in 1934. With his success in 1928, he was picked as the Labour Party candidate for Ebbw Vale (displacing the sitting MP Evan Davies), and easily held the seat at the 1929 General Election. Bevan gained more than twice the votes of Liberal candidate William Griffiths, receiving 20,000 votes to Griffiths' 8,000. In keeping with his background, Bevan described his initial thoughts on the House of Commons as a shrine to \"the most conservative of all religions \u2013 ancestor worship\". In Parliament, he became noticed as a harsh critic of those he felt opposed the working man and woman. His targets included the Conservative Winston Churchill and the Liberal David Lloyd George, as well as Ramsay MacDonald and Margaret Bondfield from his own Labour party (he targeted the latter for her unwillingness to increase unemployment benefits). He had solid support from his constituency, being one of the few Labour MPs to be unopposed in the 1931 General Election, and this support grew through the 1930s and the period of the Great Depression.\nSoon after Bevan entered Parliament, he was briefly attracted to Smethwick Labour MP Oswald Mosley's arguments, becoming one of the 17 signatories of the Mosley Memorandum in the context of the MacDonald government's repeated economic crises, including the doubling of unemployment levels. In January 1931, Bevan wrote a letter to the government on behalf of the Mosley group, raising concerns over its \"failure to deal with unemployment\". Mosley broke from the Labour Party in early 1931 to form the New Party, but Bevan refused to defect and instead announced that he had no intention of leaving the Labour Party. By 1932, Mosley's New Party had migrated from the left over to the far-right of British politics and was rebranded as the British Union of Fascists. Bevan's past association with Mosley would be used against him in subsequent years by his political rivals.\nHe married fellow Socialist MP Jennie Lee in 1934, after they met in London. Described as \"more left-wing than Nye\", Lee became a considerable influence on Bevan's political career. They were early supporters of the socialists in the Spanish Civil War, and Bevan visited the country in 1938. In 1936 he joined the board of the new socialist newspaper \"Tribune\". His agitations for a united socialist front of all parties of the left (including the Communist Party of Great Britain) led to his expulsion from the Labour Party from March to November 1939 (along with Stafford Cripps, C. P. Trevelyan and three others). Bevan and Cripps had previously been threatened with disciplinary action by the party for sharing a stage with a Communist speaker, and all party members were threatened with expulsion if they were associated with the Popular Front. Bevan and another expelled MP, George Strauss, appealed against the decision. Bevan was readmitted to the party on 20 December 1939, after agreeing \"to refrain from conducting or taking part in campaigns in opposition to the declared policy of the Party\".\nHe strongly criticised the National Government's rearmament plans in the face of the rise of Nazi Germany, saying to the Labour conference in autumn 1937:\nIf the immediate international situation is used as an excuse to get us to drop our opposition to the rearmament programme of the Government, the next phase must be that we must desist from any industrial or political action that may disturb national unity in the face of Fascist aggression. Along that road is endless retreat, and at the end of it a voluntary totalitarian state with ourselves erecting the barbed wire around. You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.\nHis opposition to the Labour leadership's approach was partly based on his view that the leadership of the Labour Party was not demanding assurances from the Government on its foreign policy as a price for the party's support for re-armament as expressed in his speech to the Bournemouth Conference of that year: ...we should say to the country we are prepared to make whatever sacrifices are necessary, to give whatever arms are necessary to fight Fascist powers and in order to consolidate world peace...\nThe Labour conference voted to drop its opposition to rearmament. When Winston Churchill said that the Labour Party should refrain from giving Adolf Hitler the impression that Britain was divided, Bevan rejected this as sinister: The fear of Hitler is to be used to frighten the workers of Britain into silence. In short Hitler is to rule Britain by proxy. If we accept the contention that the common enemy is Hitler and not the British capitalist class, then certainly Churchill is right. But it means abandonment of the class struggle and the subservience of the British workers to their own employers.\nOpposition to the war-time government.\nBy March 1938, Bevan was writing in \"Tribune\" that Churchill's warnings about German intentions for Czechoslovakia were \"a diapason of majestic harmony\" compared to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's \"thin, listless trickle\". Bevan now called unsuccessfully for a Popular Front against fascism under the leadership of the Labour Party, including even anti-fascist Tories. When the government introduced voluntary national service in December 1938, Bevan argued that Labour should demand the nationalisation of the armaments industry, support the democratic government of Spain and sign an Anglo-Soviet pact in return for its support. When Labour supported the government's scheme with no such conditions, Bevan denounced Labour for imploring the people on recruiting platforms to put themselves under the leadership of their opponents. The Military Training Act 1939 reintroduced conscription six months later, and Bevan joined the rest of the Labour Party in opposing it, calling it \"the complete abandonment of any hope of a successful struggle against the weight of wealth in Great Britain\". He emphasised that the government had no arguments to persuade young men to fight \"except merely in another squalid attempt to defend themselves against the redistribution of international swag\".\nIn August 1939 came the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression pact between the Nazi and Soviet governments that shocked democratic governments around the world. In Parliament, Bevan argued that this was the logical outcome of the government's foreign policy. He wanted the war to be not just a fight against fascism but a war for socialism. Bevan was relieved that the country had united against Nazi Germany in the fight against fascism to provide a common enemy away from the working class. He was a strong critic of Chamberlain, arguing that his old rival Winston Churchill should become prime minister.\nDuring the Second World War he was one of the main leaders of the left in the Commons, opposing the wartime Coalition government. Bevan opposed the heavy censorship imposed on radio and newspapers and wartime Defence Regulation 18B, which gave the Home Secretary the powers to intern citizens. Bevan called for the nationalisation of the coal industry and advocated the opening of a Second Front in Western Europe to help the Soviet Union in its fight with Germany. In one of his most noted speeches made against Churchill, he railed that the prime minister \"wins debate after debate and loses battle after battle\". Churchill would later label Bevan \"a squalid nuisance\". Churchill was a frequent target of Bevan's, who already held a dislike of him following his intervention in the Tonypandy riots and the 1926 United Kingdom general strike which Bevan considered heavy handed. Bevan believed that the key to the war was the involvement of Russia and considered Churchill was too focused on the intervention of the United States. Bevan also feared that allowing Churchill to continue unopposed and unchallenged in Parliament during the war would leave him almost unbeatable for the Labour Party in future elections. Historian Max Hastings described Bevan's role in Parliament during the war as \"his figures were accurate but his scorn was at odds with the spirit of the moment\u2014full of gratitude, as was the prime minister\". His fierce opposition made him unpopular with some portions of the public at the time; his wife later described how the couple would frequently receive parcels filled with excrement at their home.\nBevan was critical of the leadership of the British Army, which he felt was class bound and inflexible. After General Neil Ritchie's retreat across Cyrenaica early in 1942 and his disastrous defeat by General Erwin Rommel at Gazala, Bevan made one of his most memorable speeches in the Commons in support of a motion of censure against the Churchill government.\n\"The Prime Minister must realise that in this country there is a taunt on everyone's lips that if Rommel had been in the British Army he would still have been a sergeant ... There is a man in the British Army who flung 150,000 men across the Ebro in Spain, Michael Dunbar. He is at present a sergeant\u00a0... He was Chief of Staff in Spain, he won the Battle of the Ebro, and he is a sergeant.\" Dunbar had been recommended for a commission, but rejected it himself to remain with his unit.\nBevan was subject to further disciplinary action in 1944, when he deliberately voted against Labour's stance on new defence regulations. He also voiced criticism of trade union leaders, which drew complaints from both the Miners' Federation and the Trades Union Congress. An administrative committee voted 71 to 60 in favour of retaining Bevan as an MP, although it was announced that party discipline was to be strengthened in future.\nHe believed that the Second World War would give Britain the opportunity to create \"a new society\". He often quoted an 1855 passage from Karl Marx that was published in \"The New York Times\" in 1865: \"The redeeming feature of war is that it puts a nation to the test. As exposure to the atmosphere reduces all mummies to instant dissolution, so war passes supreme judgment upon social systems that have outlived their vitality.\" At the beginning of the 1945 general election campaign, Bevan told his audience that his goal was to eliminate any opposition to the Labour programme: \"We have been the dreamers, we have been the sufferers, now we are the builders. We enter this campaign at this general election, not merely to get rid of the Tory majority. We want the complete political extinction of the Tory Party, and twenty-five years of Labour Government.\"\nGovernment.\nThe 1945 general election resulted in a landslide victory for the Labour Party, giving it a large enough majority to allow the implementation of the party's manifesto commitments and to introduce a programme of far-reaching social reforms, that were collectively dubbed the \"Welfare State\". These reforms were achieved in the face of great financial difficulty following the war. The new Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, appointed Bevan as Minister of Health, with a remit that also covered housing. Thus, the responsibility for instituting a new and comprehensive National Health Service, as well as tackling the country's severe post-war housing shortage, was given to Bevan, the youngest member of Attlee's Cabinet in his first ministerial position at the age of 47. Although described in \"The Times\" as \"an outstanding back-bench critic\" and \"one of (Labour's) most brilliant members in debate\", his appointment was regarded as a relative surprise, given his previous disciplinary issues. Bevan had clashed frequently with Attlee during his time as an MP, believing that the Labour leader failed to apply enough pressure on the Tory government during the war. He had also seen disputes with some of Attlee's closest allies, Ernest Bevin and Herbert Morrison, who were appointed Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House respectively. However, Attlee commented that Bevan was \"starting with me with a clean sheet\" following his appointment. Bevan tested this newfound solidarity early on by arriving to a royal banquet at St James's Palace wearing a navy lounge suit. He earned a rebuke from Attlee, but Bevan contended that his Welsh mining constituency did not send him to Parliament to \"dress up\", and he declined to wear formal attire at further Buckingham Palace functions.\nMinister of Health (1945\u20131951).\nThe free National Health Service was paid for directly through public money. Bevan had been inspired by the Tredegar Medical Aid Society in his hometown, where residents would pay a subscription to enable all subscribers and their dependants to have free access to medical services such as nursing or dental care. This system proved so popular that 20,000 people supported the organisation during the 1930s. Government income was increased for the welfare state expenditure by a large increase in marginal tax rates for wealthy business owners in particular, as part of what the Labour government largely saw as the redistribution of the wealth created by the working-class from the owners of large-scale industry to the workers. Having been a member of the Cottage Hospital Management Committee around 1928 and serving as chairman in 1929\u201330, Bevan had received an insight into the management of health services by local authorities, which proved to be a bedrock of his work in founding the National Health Service.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The collective principle asserts that\u00a0... no society can legitimately call itself civilised if a sick person is denied medical aid because of lack of means.\u2014\u200a\nOn the \"appointed day\", 5 July 1948, Bevan's National Health Service Act 1946 came into force. On the day, Bevan attended a ceremony at the Park Hospital, Trafford (now Trafford General), at which he symbolically received the keys to the hospital. The scheme was achieved having overcome political opposition from both the Conservative Party and from within his own party. Confrontation with the British Medical Association (BMA) was led by Charles Hill, who published a letter in the \"British Medical Journal\" describing Bevan as \"a complete and uncontrolled dictator\". Members of the BMA had dubbed him the \"Tito of Tonypandy\". They threatened to derail the National Health Service scheme before it had even begun, as medical practitioners continued to withhold their support just months before the launch of the service. After eighteen months of ongoing dispute between the Ministry of Health and the BMA, Bevan finally managed to win over the support of the vast majority of the medical profession by offering a couple of minor concessions, including allowing consultants to keep their own private practices and continuing to allow doctors to be paid in capitation fees rather than salaries, but without compromising the fundamental principles of his National Health Service proposals. At a dinner in late 1955 or early 1956 to celebrate the publication of the Guillebaud Report into NHS costs Bevan remarked to Julian Tudor Hart \"ultimately I had to stuff their mouths with gold\" about his handling of the consultants. This is often quoted as \"I stuffed their mouths with gold\". Some 2,688 voluntary and municipal hospitals in England and Wales were nationalised and came under Bevan's supervisory control as Health Minister. Two of the key elements of Bevan's proposals were this nationalisation of the hospital services and the abolition of the sale and purchase of goodwill by general practitioners. The former aimed to provide a uniform standard of consultant led care and expertise throughout the country and to replace the patchwork of voluntary and municipal hospitals which existed at that point. The latter \u2013 sale and purchase of goodwill \u2013 often placed new entrants to the GP profession under large amounts of debt. Along with this, the Medical Practices Committee was to oversee the distribution of GP practices \u2013 a proposal which the previous Coalition Minister had withdrawn after opposition from the British Medical Association.\nBevan said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The National Health Service and the Welfare State have come to be used as interchangeable terms, and in the mouths of some people as terms of reproach. Why this is so it is not difficult to understand, if you view everything from the angle of a strictly individualistic competitive society. A free health service is pure Socialism and as such it is opposed to the hedonism of capitalist society.\u2014\u200a\nConservative opposition of the National Health Service scheme feared that the sudden access to free health care would be overrun. In its early stages this proved true, as the service went vastly over budget in its inaugural year, and Attlee was forced to make a radio address to the nation in an attempt to limit the strain on the system. Bevan countered that the initial overspending was down to years of underinvestment in the British medical system prior to the Second World War: by the start of the 1950s, the early overspending had come to an end.\nHousing reform.\nWhen Bevan was made a minister in 1945, he envisaged the social housing sector as a housing service similar to the National Health Service, ensuring that everyone had access to decent and affordable homes, with people still having the option to live in owner occupation or the private sector if they so chose (with grants made available to owner-occupiers and private landlords to bring dwellings up to decent standards). The removal of the criteria of \"working class\" from local authority housing provision was seen as a first step, widening access to the council housing that was becoming an ever larger part of the UK housing stock and which made up a majority of new homes built after the war. The aim was to create new homes and communities with a place for all sections of society :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We should try to introduce in our modern villages and towns what was always the lovely feature of English and Welsh villages, where the doctor, the grocer, the butcher and the farm labourer all lived in the same street. I believe that is essential for the full life of citizen\u00a0... to see the living tapestry of a mixed community.\u2014\u200a\nSubstantial bombing damage, with over 700,000 homes needing repair in London alone, and the continued existence of pre-war slums in many parts of the country made the task of housing reform particularly challenging for Bevan. Indeed, these factors, exacerbated by post-war restrictions on the availability of building materials and skilled labour, collectively served to limit Bevan's achievements in this area. Bevan was also limited due to his desire for new homes to be bigger and of better quality than the ones they were being built to replace, based on the recommendations of a 1943 report by the Dudley Committee, and a shortage of skilled workers to undertake the work. 1946 saw the completion of 55,600 new homes; this rose to 139,600 in 1947 and 227,600 in 1948. While this was not an insignificant achievement \u2013 the 850,000 homes built in the four years immediately after the war ended was the biggest housing programme ever introduced \u2013 Bevan's rate of house-building was exceeded by his Conservative (indirect) successor, Harold Macmillan, who was able to complete some 300,000 new homes a year as Minister for Housing in the 1950s. These numbers were reached by lowering the quality standards originally put forward by Bevan, with council houses featuring gardens being largely dropped in favour of tower blocks and flats. Macmillan was also able to concentrate full-time on the housing crisis, instead of being obliged, like Bevan, to combine his housing portfolio with that for Health (which for Bevan took the higher priority: he once stated tongue-in-cheek that he devoted \"five minutes a week to housing\").\nAt a party rally in 1948, during a speech, Bevan stated: \"That is why no amount of cajolery, and no attempts at ethical or social seduction, can eradicate from my heart a deep burning hatred for the Tory Party that inflicted those bitter experiences on me. So far as I am concerned they are lower than vermin. They condemned millions of first-class people to semi-starvation.\" The comment inspired the creation of the Vermin Club by angry Conservatives, who attacked Bevan for years for the metaphor. Labour Party deputy leader Herbert Morrison complained that Bevan's attack had backfired, for his words \"did much more to make the Tories work and vote\u00a0... than Conservative Central Office could have done\". It was later claimed that his words had cost Labour more than two million votes.\nIn 1951, with the retirement of Ernest Bevin, Bevan was a leading candidate for Foreign Secretary. Prime Minister Attlee rejected Bevan in favour of Herbert Morrison because he distrusted Bevan's personality. In his biography of Bevan, John Campbell wrote: \"Bevan's impetuous temperament, undiplomatic tone and reputation as an extreme left-winger combined to make the Foreign Office seem the last place a prudent Prime Minister would think of putting him at any time. His 'vermin' speech still resonated: imagination shuddered at a repetition of that on the international stage.\"\nMinister of Labour and National Service (1951).\nBevan was instead appointed Minister of Labour in January 1951 in place of George Isaacs. The move was seen by some as a sideways or backwards step, although a potential rearmament programme was expected to make the post of future importance. During his tenure, Bevan helped to secure a deal for railwaymen which provided them with a significant pay increase. However, three months after his appointment, Hugh Gaitskell introduced a proposal of prescription charges for dental care and spectacles\u2014created to save a potential \u00a325m to meet the financial demands imposed by the Korean War. An infuriated Bevan stated that he would never be a member of a government that imposed charges on the National Health Service. The Labour MP David Marquand has stated that the savings were introduced by Gaitskell simply to \"impose his will\" upon Bevan who he saw as a political rival. Bevan resigned from his position two weeks later, stating both the proposed changes and the increase in military expenditure that necessitated the need for such proposals. Two other ministers, John Freeman and Harold Wilson, resigned at the same time. Bevan received unanimous support for his actions from his local Labour constituency leaders.\nLater the same year, the Labour Party were defeated at the general election. After Bevan left the Health ministry in 1951 he could never regain his level of success and feuded with fellow Labour leaders, using his strong political base as a weapon. Historian Kenneth O. Morgan says: \"Bevan alone kept the flag of left-wing socialism aloft throughout\u2014which gave him a matchless authority amongst the constituency parties and in party conference\".\nOpposition.\nBevan's last decade saw his political position weaken year by year as he failed to find a winning issue that would make use of his skills. In 1952 Bevan published \"In Place of Fear\", \"the most widely read socialist book\" of the period, according to a highly critical right-wing Labour MP Anthony Crosland. According to \"The Times Literary Supplement\", the book was a \"dithyramb with meanderings into the many side-tracks of Mr Bevan's private and public experience\". In the opening page of the book, Bevan begins: \"A young miner in a South Wales colliery, my concern was with the one practical question: Where does power lie in this particular state of Great Britain, and how can it be attained by the workers?\"\nIn March 1952, a poorly prepared Bevan came off the worse in an evening Commons debate on health with Conservative backbencher Iain Macleod, whose performance led Churchill to appoint him as Minister of Health some six weeks after the debate.\nOut of office, Bevan soon exacerbated the split within the Labour Party between the right and the left which weakened the party in the 1950s. For the next five years, he was the leader of the left wing of the Labour Party, who became known as Bevanites. They criticised the right-wing \"Gaitskellites\" high defence expenditure (especially for nuclear weapons), called for better relations with the Soviet Union, and opposed the party leader, Clement Attlee, on most issues. According to Richard Crossman, Bevan hated \"the in-fighting which you have to do in politics... He wasn't cut out to be a leader, he was cut out to be a prophet\". In April 1954, Bevan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet, having been rebuked by Attlee after accusing the Labour leader of surrendering to American pressure over a proposed multi-national defence organisation in Asia and the Pacific. He later said that he had resigned his position to \"call attention to the fact that their movement was in grave crisis\", and stated his belief that he would have been party chairman by the following year if he had remained. In July of the same year, Bevan announced his intention to stand for election as the Treasurer of the Labour Party against Hugh Gaitskell. His nomination received a severe blow on the same day it was announced, when two unions that traditionally sided with the left, the National Union of Mineworkers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, pledged their support for his opponent. Although unsuccessful in his bid, he did celebrate 25 years as the MP for Ebbw Vale.\nIn March 1955, when Britain was preparing for Operation Grapple, the testing of its first hydrogen bomb, Bevan led a revolt of 57 Labour MPs and abstained on a key vote. The Parliamentary Labour Party voted 141 to 113 to withdraw the whip from him, but it was restored within a month, due to his popularity. After the 1955 general election, Attlee retired as Labour leader. Bevan contested the leadership against both Morrison and Labour right-winger Gaitskell, but it was Gaitskell who emerged victorious with more than half of the ballots. Bevan's remark that \"I know the right kind of political Leader for the Labour Party is a kind of desiccated calculating machine\" was assumed to refer to Gaitskell, although Bevan denied it (commenting upon Gaitskell's record as Chancellor of the Exchequer as having \"proved\" this). Bevan also failed in a bid to become deputy leader, losing out to Jim Griffiths. He instead stood again for the role of party treasurer and was duly elected, beating George Brown.\nDespite Bevan's criticism of the new party leader, Gaitskell decided to appoint him as Shadow Colonial Secretary, and then Shadow Foreign Secretary in 1956. Bevan was as critical of Nasserist Egypt's seizure of the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 as he was of the subsequent Anglo-French military response. He compared Gamal Abdel Nasser with Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, from \"One Thousand and One Nights\". He was a vocal critic of the Conservative government's actions in the Suez Crisis, noticeably delivering high-profile speeches at a protest rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, and criticising the government's actions and arguments in the Commons on 5 December 1956. Bevan accused the government of a \"policy of bankruptcy and despair\", stating at the Trafalgar rally: We are stronger than Egypt but there are other countries stronger than us. Are we prepared to accept for ourselves the logic we are applying to Egypt? If nations more powerful than ourselves accept the absence of principle, the anarchistic attitude of Eden and launch bombs on London, what answer have we got, what complaint have we got? If we are going to appeal to force, if force is to be the arbiter to which we appeal, it would at least make common sense to try to make sure beforehand that we have got it, even if you accept that abysmal logic, that decadent point of view.We are in fact in the position today of having appealed to force in the case of a small nation, where if it is appealed to against us it will result in the destruction of Great Britain, not only as a nation, but as an island containing living men and women. Therefore I say to Anthony [Eden], I say to the British government, there is no count at all upon which they can be defended.They have besmirched the name of Britain. They have made us ashamed of the things of which formerly we were proud. They have offended against every principle of decency and there is only one way in which they can even begin to restore their tarnished reputation and that is to get out! Get out! Get out!\nBevan dismayed many of his supporters when he suddenly reversed his opposition to nuclear weapons. Speaking at the 1957 Labour Party conference, he decried unilateral nuclear disarmament, saying \"It would send a British Foreign Secretary naked into the conference-chamber\". This statement is often misconstrued: Bevan argued that unilateralism would result in Britain's loss of allies, and one interpretation of his metaphor is that nakedness would come from the lack of allies, not the lack of weapons. According to the journalist Paul Routledge, Donald Bruce, a former MP and Parliamentary Private Secretary and adviser to Bevan, had told him that Bevan's shift on the disarmament issue was the result of discussions with the Soviet government, where they advised him to push for British retention of nuclear weapons so they could possibly be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the United States.\nIn 1957, Bevan, Richard Crossman and the Labour Party's General Secretary Morgan Phillips sued \"The Spectator\" magazine for libel, after one of its writers described them as drinking heavily during an Italian Socialist Party conference. The article wrote that the three men:\n...puzzled the Italians by their capacity to fill themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee... Although the Italians were never sure the British delegation were sober, they always attributed to them an immense political acumen.\nThe three won their case, and obtained financial damages of \u00a32,500 each. Crossman later acknowledged that they had perjured themselves to do so.\nBevan was elected unopposed as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in 1959, succeeding Griffiths. His last speech in the House of Commons, in the debate of 3 November 1959 on the Queen's Speech, referred to the difficulties of persuading the electorate to support a policy which would make them less well-off in the short term, but more prosperous in the long term.\nDeath.\nBevan had said \"I would rather be kept alive in the efficient if cold altruism of a large hospital than expire in a gush of warm sympathy in a small one\". He checked into the Royal Free Hospital in London on 27 December 1959 to undergo surgery for an ulcer, but malignant stomach cancer was discovered instead in a major operation two days later.\nAfter a lengthy period in hospital, on 14 February 1960 Bevan returned home and announced he would not be returning to politics in the near future, so as to be able to recuperate and plan an extended holiday. In May 1960 Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, while in England visited Bevan at his home in Asheridge Farm (where Bevan was a keen amateur farmer, keeping cattle and pigs).\nBevan died in his sleep at 4.10pm on 6 July 1960, at the age of 62, at his home, Asheridge Farm, Chesham, Buckinghamshire. His remains were cremated at Gwent Crematorium in Croesyceiliog in a private family ceremony. An open-air service was held in his constituency of Ebbw Vale and was presided over by Donald Soper. Jennie Lee explained in a letter to Michael Foot, who would be elected to Bevan's seat in the by-election that ensued following his death, that Bevan had specifically chosen to have a non-religious funeral and not a Christian service, because he was a firm humanist.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;'Nye is asleep next door. Later today he will be taken home to Wales. Tomorrow he will be cremated in keeping with his known views. [Nye] was never a hypocrite. No falsity must touch him once he is no longer available to defend his views. He was not a cold-blooded rationalist. He was no calculating machine. He was a great humanist whose religion lay in loving his fellow men and trying to serve them... He knelt reverently in respect to a friend or friend's faith, but he never pretended to be anything other than what he was, a humanist.\u2014\u200a\nIn his 2014 biography, Nick Thomas-Symonds described \"an outpouring of national mourning\" that followed Bevan's death. \"The Daily Herald\" stated that some MPs were seen to be crying in Parliament and described how there was \"sorrow at every street corner\" in the South Wales Valleys. Harold Macmillan ended his Prime Minister's Questions session in Parliament two days after Bevan's death by paying tribute to the opposition MP, describing him as \"a great personality and a great national figure\". Macmillan said that despite being a \"controversial figure\" during his career, Bevan's death had seen an outpouring of genuine \"admiration and affection\". Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell also paid tribute to his former shadow cabinet member and ended his speech by labelling Bevan as \"one of the great men of our day\".\nLegacy.\nBevan's most significant legacy is the National Health Service. Bevan foresaw that it would always be the subject of public debate, warning that \"This service must always be changing, growing and improving; it must always appear to be inadequate.\" However, seven decades after it was founded, a 2013 opinion poll conducted on behalf of British Future found that the NHS was more popular than at its creation, and more popular than the monarchy, the BBC, and the British Armed Forces.\nBevan was particularly noted for his public speaking, being described by Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell, as \"the greatest parliamentary speaker since Charles James Fox\". Winston Churchill, the target of numerous diatribes from Bevan during his career, commented that Bevan was \"one of the few members that I will sit still and listen to\". Bevan's reputation as a hard-line socialist typically preceded him: Sir William Douglas, who served as Bevan's deputy in the Ministry of Health, had initially stated that he would \"never work with a man like that\". However, by the end of his tenure, he had declared Bevan as \"the best minister we have had\". Clement Attlee expressed his support that Bevan should have been the leader of the Labour Party during his lifetime but was held back by his demeanour, stating \"he wants to be two things simultaneously, rebel and official leader, and you can't be both\".\nA bronze statue was commissioned by South Glamorgan County Council and erected in 1987 in the city centre of Cardiff. The Nye Bevan Estate in Clapton Park, Hackney, London, was named after Bevan, and was opened in October 1962 by his friend and biographer Michael Foot.\nIn November 1997 BBC One broadcast the drama profile \"Food for Ravens\", with Brian Cox as Bevan and Sin\u00e9ad Cusack as Jennie Lee.\nThe Aneurin Bevan Memorial Stones were erected at the beginning of the Sirhowy Valley Walk with three smaller stones (representing three towns of his constituency Ebbw Vale, Rhymney and Tredegar) surrounding a larger stone representing Bevan. In 2002, Bevan was voted as the 45th greatest Briton of all time by the BBC public opinion poll, \"100 Greatest Britons\". The following year, Bevan was voted number one in the 100 Welsh Heroes poll, a response to find the public's favourite Welsh people of all time. Numerous institutions bear Bevan's name, including the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, and Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan, a hospital located within his old Ebbw Vale constituency. In July 2023 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the National Health Service, Great Western Railway named a train after Bevan in a ceremony at Newport station. The train was unveiled by Aneria Thomas, the first baby born under the NHS.\nIn 2015, Welsh actor Michael Sheen gave a speech in which he described Bevan as a mythical creature, stating, \"He had cast-iron integrity and a raging passion\". In 2017, Sheen gave his Aneurin Bevan Lecture at the Hay Festival about the culture and society and the humane vision and tradition that Bevan inspires. Sheen portrayed Bevan in Tim Price's play \"Nye\" at the National Theatre in London from March until May 2024 and at Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff from May until June 2024. The play was revived with Sheen reprising the role at the National Theatre and Wales Millennium Centre in July and August 2025.\nIn 2024, a new health centre opened in Tredegar, Bevan's hometown. Named \"The Bevan Health and Wellbeing Centre\", it provides primary care and some secondary care to those in the catchment area of the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.\nBibliography.\nExcerpts from Bevan's speeches are included in Greg Rosen's book \"Old Labour to New : the dreams that inspired, the battles that divided\" (published by Methuen in 2005 ()).\nBevan's key speeches in the legislative arena are to be found in:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The magazine is known primarily for its blend of dark fantasy, science fiction, erotica, and steampunk comics. Following a brief hiatus in 2023, it relaunched in 2024 with new owners and a new editorial team consisting of Dave Kelly, Frank Forte, and Chris Thompson.\nUnlike the traditional American comic books of that time bound by the restrictive Comics Code Authority, the magazine-format \"Heavy Metal\" featured explicit nudity, sexual situations, and graphic violence. The magazine started out primarily as a licensed translation of the French science-fantasy magazine \"M\u00e9tal hurlant\", marking for many Americans their first introduction to the work of European cartoonists like Enki Bilal, Philippe Caza, Guido Crepax, Philippe Druillet, Jean-Claude Forest, Jean Giraud (a.k.a. Moebius), Chantal Montellier, and Milo Manara.\nPublication history.\nNational Lampoon.\nAfter a 1975 European trip by \"National Lampoon\" contributor Tony Hendra expressing interest in European comics, the magazine's New York offices attracted significant European comic material. On 2 September 1976, editor Sean Kelly singled out the relatively new French comics anthology \"M\u00e9tal hurlant\" (lit.\u2009'Howling Metal', though Kelly translated it as \"Screaming Metal\") and brought it to the attention of company president Leonard Mogel on 3 September, as Mogel was departing for Germany and France to jump-start the French edition of \"National Lampoon\". (\"M\u00e9tal hurlant\" had debuted in early 1975 from Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s (lit.\u2009'United Humanoids'), an association of Philippe Druillet, Jean-Pierre Dionnet, Jean Giraud (M\u0153bius), and financial director Bernard Farkas formed on 19 December 1974.) Upon Mogel's return from Paris on 27 September, he reported that the French publishers had agreed to an English language version, and he suggested the title \"Heavy Metal\" for an April issue to be released in March 1977.\n\"Heavy Metal\" debuted in the US as a glossy, full-color monthly published by HM Communications, Inc., a subsidiary of Matty Simmons' Twenty First Century Communications, Inc. The cover of the initial April 1977 issue declared itself to be \"From the people who bring you the \"National Lampoon\"\", and the issue primarily featured reprints from \"M\u00e9tal hurlant\", as well as material from \"National Lampoon\", a colorized portion of Vaughn Bod\u0113's \"Sunpot\" (1971), and an excerpt from Terry Brooks' \"The Sword of Shannara\" (1977). Since the color pages from \"M\u00e9tal hurlant\" had already been shot in France, the budget to reproduce them in the US version was greatly reduced.\nIn the late spring of 1980, \"M\u00e9tal hurlant\" went bankrupt and \"Heavy Metal\" severed its ties with its content partner. \"M\u00e9tal hurlant\" managed to keep publishing, however, and the two magazines reconciled in the summer of 1981.\nAfter running as a monthly for its first nine years up to the December 1985 issue, the magazine dropped to a quarterly schedule (winter, spring, summer, and fall) beginning in 1986, promising an increase in length and to feature only complete (rather than serialized) stories.\n\"M\u00e9tal hurlant\" folded in the summer of 1987, forcing \"Heavy Metal\" to expand its reach for new content.\nOther HM Communications publications.\nIn 1977\u20131978, HM Communications published a number of trade paperbacks featuring \"Heavy Metal Presents\" on their covers, collecting translated material it had previously serialized in the pages of \"Heavy Metal\":\nIn 1978\u20131979, HM Communications released a number of trade paperbacks of original content that had been serialized in the pages of \"Heavy Metal\". These projects also featured \"Heavy Metal Presents\" on their covers:\nIn 1981, the company launched a new series, Heavy Metal Special Editions, which consisted of fifty seasonal \"Heavy Metal\" specials published until 2008. These began with \"Heavy Metal Presents Moebius\" (1981), followed by \"The Best of Heavy Metal\" (1982), \"Even Heavier Metal\" (1983), \"Son of Heavy Metal\" (1984), \"Bride of Heavy Metal\" (1985), and \"The Best of Heavy Metal 2\" (1986). Beginning with \"The Venus Interface\" (1989, v5 no. 4), the indicia began to feature volume and issue numbers, as well as the phrase \"a series of special editions published four times a year by \"Heavy Metal\" magazine.\" After the fiftieth issue, \"Overload Special\" (Summer 2008, v22 no. 2), the numbering of the seasonal specials was merged into the main series, and continued for another nine issues until the \"War of the Worlds Special\" (2011).\nGrodnik/Matheson, J2 Communications.\nIn late 1988/early 1989, film producer Daniel Grodnik and actor/producer Tim Matheson acquired voting control of 21.3 percent of National Lampoon Inc. stock, were named to the company's board, and eventually took control of the company (by purchasing the ten-percent share \u2014 worth $760,000\n\u2014\u00a0of Matty Simmons, who departed the company).\nDuring this period, publication of \"Heavy Metal\" increased from a quarterly to a bi-monthly schedule, citing a thirty-percent increase in circulation. \nA year later, Grodnik/Matheson Co. sold the properties to J2 Communications, a home video producer and distributor founded by James P. Jimirro, with Grodnik and Matheson staying on for a period to run the new division.\nKevin Eastman.\nKevin Eastman, co-creator of the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", who had grown up reading \"Heavy Metal\", bought the magazine for $500,000 in May 1992. (In total, HM Communications published 137 issues in 15 volumes from April 1977 to March 1992.) Eastman's publishing entity Metal Mammoth, Inc., published the magazine from 1992 to 2014. Eastman also served as \"Heavy Metal\"'s editor-in-chief for the bulk of this time (even into 2016, after he was no longer the owner).\nLater developments.\nIn January 2014, Eastman sold the magazine to digital and music veteran David Boxenbaum and film producer Jeff Krelitz. Eastman continued to serve as publisher of the magazine (until early 2020) and was a minority investor in the new \"Heavy Metal\", which became at that point published by Heavy Metal Media, LLC. \nIn late 2019, Krelitz was no longer with the magazine, which was undergoing leadership churn. In early 2020, \"Heavy Metal\" saw a regime change to CEO Matthew Medney and \"Creative Overlord\" David Erwin (formerly of DC Entertainment). Medney and Erwin announced two new comics publishing ventures, Virus and Magma Comix, though neither line produced much material.\n\"Heavy Metal\"'s 300th issue, published in 2021, featured work by Tanino Liberatore, Mark Bod\u00e9, and Kent Williams, among others; and posthumous work by Richard Corben, Moebius, and Vaughn Bod\u0113. It had interviews and testimonials from writers discussing the impact the magazine had on them as teenagers.\nCancellation.\nIn the fall of 2022, the magazine entered into an agreement with online marketplace Whatnot to publish the following 12 issues of the magazine. Soon afterward, the magazine announced it was \"ceasing publication of what they described as the first volume of the magazine, which had been published continuously since 1977. The last issue of the first volume, number 320, was scheduled for publication in late October 2022 and the successor, Volume 2, would be published by WhatNot Publishing starting with issue 1 in February 2023.\"\nAmid cash flow problems, however, \"Heavy Metal\" shut down in December 2022. Initially intended to be a temporary suspension, the magazine worked to rectify subscription non-fulfillments and non-payments to artists and vendors. Medney stepped down as CEO, replaced by Marshall Lees and Jamie Penrose.\nIn July 2023, with Whatnot's publishing division, Massive Publishing, only having produced one issue of \"Heavy Metal\"\u2014#320, released in April of that year and still listing Heavy Metal Entertainment LLC in the indicia\u2014it was announced that the publisher had decided to cancel the magazine and that #320 had been the final issue.\nRelaunch.\nOn October 15, 2024, Heavy Metal International, LLC announced that they would be relaunching the magazine in 2025, and began a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for the first issue on November 25, 2024.\nArtists and features.\n\"Heavy Metal\"'s high-quality artwork was notable. Work by international fine artists such as H. R. Giger, Frank Frazetta, and Esteban Maroto were featured on the covers of various issues. Stefano Tamburini and Tanino Liberatore's \"RanXerox\" series debuted in the States. Terrance Lindall's illustrated version of Milton's epic poem \"Paradise Lost\" appeared in the magazine in 1980. Many stories were presented as long-running serials, such as those by Richard Corben, Pepe Moreno and Matt Howarth. Illustrators like Luis Royo and Alex Ebel contributed artwork over the course of their careers. An adaptation of the film \"Alien\" named \"\", written by Archie Goodwin and drawn by Walter Simonson, was published in the magazine in 1979.\nHere is a starting list of contributing artists featured in \"Heavy Metal\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEditors.\nThe founding editors of the American edition of \"Heavy Metal\" were Sean Kelly and Valerie Marchant. Over the life of the magazine, the two editors with the longest tenures were Julie Simmons-Lynch (who was publisher Matty Simmons' daughter) and Kevin Eastman, who was also the magazine's owner/publisher for more than 20 years.\nThe founding design director was Peter Kleinman (who served in the same capacity for \"National Lampoon\"). He created the original \"Heavy Metal\" logo design, at the request of Mogel, and was responsible for the launch and art direction of the first issue. Kleinman later hired designer and letterer John Workman, who brought to the magazine a background of experience at DC Comics and other publishers. Workman served as the magazine's art director from 1977 to 1984. (His comics art, writing, lettering, coloring, and design work are evident throughout issues from that period.)\nFounding editors Kelly and Marchant were replaced in August 1979 by Ted White, who was hired to introduce non-fiction and prose fiction into the magazine. White was fired in August 1980, replaced as editor by magazine founder Leonard Mogel.\nJulie Simmons-Lynch took over from Mogel in late 1981, serving as \"Heavy Metal\"'s editor-in-chief for more than eleven years, stepping down when Kevin Eastman bought the magazine.\nWith a few breaks, Eastman was chief editor for \"Heavy Metal\" from early 1993 until mid-2016. Most of these breaks were packaged and edited by A1 co-creator Dave Elliott. Comics writer Grant Morrison became the magazine's editor-in-chief beginning with the April 2016 issue, serving through 2018. They later served as creative advisor.\nBy issue #298 (2020), Tim Seeley had become editor-in-chief but was out by the end of that year. In 2021, Joseph Illidge took over as Executive Editor but left the company entirely by the end of 2022.\nFollowing the hiatus, all employees were let go and the company was dissolved. Heavy Metal International, LLC revived the brand in 2024 and subsequently announced new editors Dave Kelly, Frank Forte, and Chris Thompson would helm the magazine going forward.\nLegacy.\n\"Heavy Metal\" was widely credited for exposing many Americans/English-speakers to European comics and the continent's top cartoonists. As cartoonist and publisher Kevin Eastman said of the magazine, \"\"Heavy Metal\" published European art that had not been previously seen in the United States, as well as demonstrating an underground comix sensibility that nonetheless wasn't as harsh or extreme as some of the underground comix \u2013 but ... definitely intended for an older readership\".\nCreators like George Lucas, Neil Gaiman, and Steven Lisberger have all discussed the influence of \"Heavy Metal\" on their later work.\nThe magazine was taken to task, however, for its juvenile stories, violence, and misogynist portrayals of women. \"Entertainment Weekly\" described the magazine as, \"a legendary sci-fi and fantasy comic magazine for adults... and perhaps precocious teens interested in more daring material, or who consider Wonder Woman a tad underdressed.\" Critic R. M. Rhodes pointed out \"the abundance of breasts in the magazine [was] somewhat of a running joke over the years.\"\nSheila Benson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Heavy Metal\" had \"charm\" but decried its \"sadism.\" Writing about the magazine's early years, Rhodes discussed the voluminous number of pieces in which \"the amount of rape (and stories where attempted rape drives the action)... I really didn't keep track of how often it happens, but any number more than 'none' is usually a bad sign. Tragically, it's mostly used as just another plot point, with no mention or indication of the consequences.\"\nIn other media.\nFilms.\nIn 1981, an animated feature film was adapted from several of the magazine's serials. Made on a budget of U.S. $9.3\u00a0million and under production for three years, \"Heavy Metal\" features animated segments from several different animation houses, with each contributing a single story segment. Another house animated the frame story which ties all the disparate stories together. Another animated feature film called \"Heavy Metal 2000\" was released in 2000.\nDuring 2008 and into 2009, reports circulated that David Fincher and James Cameron would executive produce and, each, direct two of the eight to nine segments of a new animated \"Heavy Metal\" feature. Kevin Eastman was to also direct a segment, as well as animator Tim Miller, Zack Snyder, Gore Verbinski and Guillermo del Toro. Paramount Pictures decided to stop funding the film by August 2009 and no distributor or production company has shown interest in the second sequel, since. In 2011, filmmaker Robert Rodriguez purchased the film rights to \"Heavy Metal\" and planned to develop a new animated film at the new Quick Draw Studios.\nAn animated 3D film entitled \"\", created as a sequel to H.G. Wells' \"The War of the Worlds\" and based on a story previously published in the magazine, was produced by The Tripod Group and released in Malaysia in 2012.\nThe series \"Interceptor\" is being adapted into a film.\nIn March 2019, the Fincher project was released as a reimagining television series, titled \"Love, Death &amp; Robots\".\nIn March 2021, \"Heavy Metal\" announced its first move into television with an adaptation of Blake Northcott's trilogy of novels, the \"Arena Mode Saga\". The first book was in active development after optioning the rights to the sci-fi thriller. As of 2025 there have been no further developments on these film projects.\nVideo games.\n\"Heavy Metal 2000\" inspired a video game sequel released in 2000, the PC action-adventure \". It was developed by Ritual Entertainment.\nIn 2001, Capcom released \", an arcade fighting game that later made its way to Sega's Dreamcast console. Though not based on any specific material from \"Heavy Metal\", it featured character designs by frequent contributor Simon Bisley and a style generally inspired by the magazine.\nIn 2020, Stern Pinball and the production company Incendium released a pinball machine commemorating the 300th issue of \"Heavy Metal\", featuring \"Taarna\" and \"Cold Dead War\" (2021). The made to order machine, with a playfield based on the Stern \"Star Wars\" release, sold for eight-thousand dollars and shipped in late 2020 along with an exclusive variant cover edition of \"Heavy Metal\" issue #300.\nPodcast network.\nIn 2021, \"Heavy Metal\" launched a podcast network featuring scripted and unscripted shows that focused on horror, fantasy, sci-fi, comedy, and pop culture. The podcast ran for only one season of 20 episodes. The podcast is not currently archived on the Heavy Metal website.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66853", "revid": "44220063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66853", "title": "The Conversation", "text": "1974 film by Francis Ford Coppola\nThe Conversation is a 1974 American neo-noir mystery thriller film written, produced, and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It stars Gene Hackman as surveillance expert Harry Caul who faces a moral dilemma when his recordings reveal a potential murder. Supporting cast members include John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams, and Frederic Forrest. Harrison Ford and Teri Garr appear in credited roles, and Robert Duvall in an uncredited role. Mackenzie Phillips, who had just worked for Coppola on American Graffiti along with Williams and Ford, had a supporting role as Harry Caul's niece that was dropped during the film's editing stage. Likewise, Abe Vigoda's role as Caul's lawyer also ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\"The Conversation\" premiered at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or, and was released theatrically on April 7, 1974, by Paramount Pictures to critical acclaim. It made $4.4 million during its original release, and after several re-releases, its total rose to $4.8 million on a $1.6 million budget. The film received three nominations at the 47th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound.\nSince its release in 1974, the film has not lost its current relevance to the subject matter. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nHarry Caul, a surveillance expert in San Francisco, specializes in audio recordings. He and his team are hired by a client known as \"the Director\" to eavesdrop on a couple, whom they record walking in circles in Union Square. Despite the background noise, Harry filters and merges the tapes to create a clear recording with ambiguous meaning. Harry is intensely private, obsessively guarding his personal life; though he insists that he is not responsible for how his clients use the surveillance he creates, he is haunted by guilt from a past job that resulted in three deaths.\nWhen he discovers a potentially dangerous phrase in the recording, \"He'd kill us if he got the chance,\" Harry becomes increasingly anxious. His attempt to deliver the recording is thwarted, and he is both followed and threatened.\nAfter a party at his workshop, Harry spends the night with a woman he has just met and the tapes are stolen. He receives a call from Martin Stett, the Director's assistant, informing him that the Director could not wait any longer and they have the tapes. Harry is tasked with delivering the pictures taken and collecting his money in a meeting with the Director that afternoon. There he learns that the woman in the recording is the Director's wife, involved in an affair. Harry, suspecting murder, books a hotel room next to the one the couple had mentioned for a planned rendezvous in the recording, and overhears a heated argument. Convinced there was a murder, Harry breaks into the room; he initially finds no evidence, until he flushes the toilet and finds it clogged and overflowing with blood.\nAttempting to confront the Director, Harry discovers the wife is alive and unharmed, as is her lover. A newspaper headline reports that an executive has supposedly died in a car accident. Harry realizes that the couple actually murdered the Director, having missed the emphasis on the word \"us\" in the recording, which not only expressed the couple's fear of being killed by the Director if he discovered the affair, but was also an attempt to justify killing him first as a defensive move.\nStett calls Harry at his apartment, and warns him not to investigate. He plays a freshly made recording of Harry playing his saxophone to prove they are listening. Harry frantically searches for bugs in his apartment, destroying nearly everything in it. Having failed to locate the bug, Harry sits alone amid the wreckage, playing his saxophone.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*Gene Hackman as Harry R. Caul\nProduction.\nPrincipal photography began November 27, 1972, and finished in late February 1973. The original cinematographer of \"The Conversation\" was Haskell Wexler. Severe creative and personal differences with Coppola led to Wexler's firing shortly after production began, and Coppola replaced him with Bill Butler, who he had previously worked with on \"The Rain People\" and \"The Godfather\". Wexler's footage on \"The Conversation\" was completely reshot except for the technically complex surveillance scene in Union Square. This movie was the first of two Oscar-nominated films where Wexler would be fired and replaced by Butler, the second being \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975), where Wexler had similar problems with Milo\u0161 Forman.\nWalter Murch served as the supervising editor and sound designer. Murch had more or less a free hand during the editing process because Coppola was working on \"The Godfather Part II\" at the time. Coppola noted in the DVD commentary that Hackman had a very difficult time adapting to the Harry Caul character because he was so much unlike himself. Coppola says that Hackman was at the time an outgoing and approachable person who preferred casual clothes, whereas Caul was meant to be a socially awkward loner who wore a rain coat and out-of-style glasses. Coppola said that Hackman's efforts to tap into the character made the actor moody and irritable on set, but otherwise Coppola got along well with his leading man. Coppola also notes on the commentary that Hackman considers this one of his favorite performances.\nCoppola has cited Michelangelo Antonioni's \"Blowup\" (1966) as a key influence on his conceptualization of the film's themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. \"Francis had seen [it] a year or two before, and had the idea to fuse the concept of \"Blowup\" with the world of audio surveillance.\"\nPrivate investigator Hal Lipset is credited as a technical advisor on the film. He chose state-of-the-art surveillance equipment, and had Caul's surveillance follow methods which were mostly realistic. In the film, Lipset and Caul are mentioned as two of the pre-eminent surveillance experts who will be attending a convention.\nOn the DVD commentary, Coppola says he was shocked to learn that the film used the same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the Nixon Administration used to spy on political opponents prior to the Watergate scandal. Coppola has said this reason is partially why the film gained the recognition it has received, but it was entirely coincidental. Not only was the script for \"The Conversation\" completed in the mid-1960s, before Nixon became president, but the spying equipment used in the film was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers, and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. Coppola also noted that filming of \"The Conversation\" had been completed several months before the most revelatory Watergate stories broke in the press. Because the film was released to theaters just a few months before Richard Nixon resigned as president, Coppola felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out.\nScore.\n\"The Conversation\"'s piano score is composed and performed by David Shire. The score was created before the film was shot. On some cues, Shire used \"musique concr\u00e8te\" techniques, taking the taped sounds of the piano and distorting them in different ways to create alternative tonalities to round out the score. The score was released on CD by Intrada Records in 2001.\nInspiration.\nAccording to surveillance technology expert Martin Kaiser, his colleagues consider him to be the inspiration for the character of Harry Caul. Kaiser also says that he served as a technical consultant on the film, though he was not listed in the credits. According to Kaiser, the final scene of the film\u2014in which Caul is convinced he is being eavesdropped in his apartment, cannot find the listening device, and consoles himself by playing his saxophone\u2014was inspired by the passive covert listening devices created by L\u00e9on Theremin, such as the Great Seal bug. \"He couldn't find out where [the bug] was because it was the instrument itself.\"\nCoppola also based Caul on the protagonist of Herman Hesse's 1927 novel \"Steppenwolf\", Harry Haller, a \"total cipher\" who lives alone in a boarding house. Coppola also made Caul religious, including a confession scene; Coppola has said that the practice of confession is \"one of the earliest forms of the invasion of privacy\u2014earliest forms of surveillance.\"\nCaul was also inspired by Karl Schnazer; a private investigator and occasional actor who appeared in Coppola's early films \"Tonight for Sure\" and \"Dementia 13\". Schnazer recounted to Coppola an incident where a man he had tailed for months failed to recognize him at a party, which later inspired a sequence in the film.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film had a $1.6 million budget and grossed $4.42 million in the U.S. Various re-releases over the years have brought the film's gross to $4.9 million.\nCritical response.\n\"The Conversation\" has a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 139 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"This tense, paranoid thriller presents Francis Ford Coppola at his finest\u2014and makes some remarkably advanced arguments about technology's role in society that still resonate today.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nRoger Ebert's contemporary review gave \"The Conversation\" four out of four stars and described Hackman's portrayal of Caul as \"one of the most affecting and tragic characters in the movies\". In 2001, Ebert added \"The Conversation\" to his \"Great Movies\" list, describing Hackman's performance as a \"career peak\" and writing that the film \"comes from another time and place than today's thrillers, which are so often simple-minded\".\nIn 1995, \"The Conversation\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Gene Hackman has named the film his favorite of all those he has made. His performance in the lead role was listed as the 37th greatest in history by \"Premiere\" magazine in 2006. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the eleventh-best edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.\nThe film ranked 33rd on the BBC's 2015 list of \"100 Greatest American Films\", voted by film critics from around the world. In 2016, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ranked the film 8th among 69 counted winners of the Palme d'Or to date, concluding: \"Made in a flash between the first two \"Godfather\" movies, Coppola\u2019s existential spy thriller has since become a pinnacle of the genre.\"\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"The Conversation\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nAccolades.\n\"The Conversation\" won the Palme d'Or, the highest honor at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. The film was also nominated for three Academy Awards for 1974, but lost to Coppola's own \"The Godfather Part II.\" It won the National Board of Review Award for Best Film.\n\"Enemy of the State\".\nAccording to film critic Kim Newman, the 1998 film \"Enemy of the State\", which also stars Gene Hackman as co-protagonist, could be construed as a \"continuation of \"The Conversation\"\". Hackman's character Edward Lyle in \"Enemy of the State\" closely resembles Caul: he dons the same translucent raincoat, and his workshop is nearly identical to Caul's. Also, the photograph used for Lyle in his NSA file is actually a photograph of Caul. \"Enemy of the State\" also includes a scene which is very similar to \"The Conversation\"'s opening surveillance scene in San Francisco's Union Square.\nIn other media.\nA television pilot starring Kyle MacLachlan as Harry Caul was produced for NBC. It was not picked up for a full series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66856", "revid": "7471214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66856", "title": "Entebbe raid", "text": "1976 Israeli counter-terrorist operation\nThe Entebbe raid, also known as the Operation Entebbe and officially codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (also retroactively codenamed Operation Yonatan), was a 1976 Israeli counter-terrorist mission in Uganda. It was launched in response to the hijacking of an international civilian passenger flight (an Airbus A300) operated by Air France between the cities of Tel Aviv and Paris. During a stopover in Athens, the aircraft was hijacked by two Palestinian PFLP\u2013EO and two German RZ members, who diverted the flight to Libya and then to Uganda, where they landed at Entebbe International Airport to be joined by other terrorists. Once in Uganda, the group enjoyed support from Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.\nA week earlier, on 27 June, an Air France Airbus A300 jet airliner with 248 passengers had been hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 External Operations (PFLP-EO) under orders of Wadie Haddad (who had earlier broken away from the PFLP of George Habash), and two members of the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers took hostages with the stated objective of compelling the release of 40 Palestinian and affiliated militants imprisoned in Israel as well as the release of 13 prisoners in four other countries. Over 100 Ugandan soldiers were deployed to support the hijackers after the flight landed, and Amin, who had been informed of the hijacking from the beginning, had personally welcomed the terrorists at Entebbe. After moving all of the hostages to a defunct airport, the hijackers separated all Israelis and several non-Israeli Jews from the larger group of passengers, subsequently moving them into a separate room. Over the next two days, 148 non-Israeli hostages were released and flown out to Paris. The 94 remaining passengers, most of whom were Israelis, and the 12-member Air France crew continued to be held as hostages.\nRepresentatives within the Israeli government initially debated over whether to concede or respond by force, as the hijackers had threatened to kill the 106 captives if the specified prisoners were not released. Acting on intelligence provided by Mossad, the decision was made to have the Israeli military undertake a rescue operation. The Israeli plans included preparation for an armed confrontation with Amin's Uganda Army.\nInitiating the operation at nightfall on 3 July 1976, Israeli transport planes flew 100 commandos over to Uganda for the rescue effort. Over the course of 90 minutes, 102 of the hostages were rescued successfully, with three having been killed. One of the dead hostages, Dora Bloch, was murdered by Ugandan authorities at a hospital in Kampala shortly after the Israeli rescue operation; she had fallen ill during the hijacking and was removed from the plane for treatment prior to the commandos' arrival. The Israeli military suffered five wounded and one killed; Yonatan Netanyahu was Israel's sole fatality of Operation Entebbe, and had led Sayeret Matkal during the rescue effort \u2013 he was the older brother of Benjamin Netanyahu, who would later become Israel's prime minister. The Israeli commandos killed all of the hijackers and 45 Ugandan soldiers, and 11 of Uganda's MiG-17s and MiG-21s were destroyed. Over the course of the operation in Uganda, Israel received support from neighbouring Kenya. Idi Amin, the then President of Uganda, subsequently issued orders for the Ugandan army to kill all Kenyans living in Uganda, leading to the deaths of 245 Kenyan-Ugandans and the exodus of around 3000 Kenyans from Uganda.\nHijacking.\nOn 27 June 1976, Air France Flight 139, an Airbus A300B4-203 registered as F-BVGG with serial number 019, departed from Tel Aviv, Israel, carrying 246 mainly Jewish and Israeli passengers and a crew of 12. The plane flew to Athens, Greece, where it picked up an additional 58 passengers, including four hijackers. It departed for Paris at 12:30\u00a0pm. Just after takeoff, the flight was hijacked by two Palestinians from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 External Operations (PFLP-EO), Jayel al-Arja and Fayez Abdul-Rahim al Jaber, and two Germans, Wilfried B\u00f6se and Brigitte Kuhlmann, from the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers diverted the flight to Benghazi, Libya. There it was held on the ground for seven hours for refuelling. During that time the hijackers released British-born Israeli citizen Patricia Martell, who pretended to have a miscarriage. The plane left Benghazi and at 3:15\u00a0pm on the 28 June, more than 24 hours after the flight's original departure, it arrived at Entebbe International Airport in Uganda.\nSituation at Uganda's Entebbe International Airport.\nAt Entebbe, the four hijackers were joined by at least four others, supported by the forces of Uganda's president, Idi Amin. The hijackers transferred the passengers to the transit hall of the disused former airport terminal where they kept them under guard for the following days. Amin came to visit the hostages almost on a daily basis, updating them on developments and promising to use his efforts to have them freed through negotiations.\nOn 28 June, a PFLP-EO hijacker issued a declaration and formulated their demands. In addition to a ransom of US$5\u00a0million for the release of the airplane, they demanded the release of 53 Palestinian and pro-Palestinian militants, 40 of whom were prisoners in Israel. They threatened that if these demands were not met, they would begin to kill hostages on 1 July 1976.\nSeparation of hostages.\nOn 29 June, after Ugandan soldiers had opened an entrance to a room next to the crowded waiting hall by destroying a separating wall, the hijackers separated the Israelis (including those holding dual citizenship) from the other hostages and told them to move to the adjoining room. As they did so, a Holocaust survivor showed hijacker Wilfried B\u00f6se a camp registration number tattooed on his arm. B\u00f6se protested \"I'm no Nazi!\u00a0... I am an idealist.\" In addition, five non-Israeli hostages \u2013 two ultra-orthodox Jewish couples from the US and Belgium and a French resident of Israel \u2013 were forced to join the Israeli group. According to Monique Epstein Khalepski, the French hostage among the five, the captors had singled them out for questioning and suspected them of hiding their Israeli identities. On the other hand, according to French hostage Michel Cojot-Goldberg, the captors failed to identify at least one Israeli among the passengers who was a military officer with dual citizenship then using his non-Israeli passport and he was later freed as part of the second release of non-Israeli hostages. US citizen Janet Almog, Frenchwoman Jocelyne Monier (whose husband or boyfriend was Israeli), and French-Israeli dual citizen Jean-Jacques Mimouni, whose name had not been called up during the reading of the original passport-based list, reportedly joined the Israeli hostage group by their own choice.\nRelease of most non-Israeli hostages.\nOn 30 June, the hijackers released 48 hostages. The released were picked from among the non-Israeli group \u2013 mainly elderly and sick passengers and mothers with children. Forty-seven of them were flown by a chartered Air France Boeing 747 out of Entebbe to Paris, and one passenger was treated in hospital for a day. On 1 July, after the Israeli government had conveyed its agreement to negotiations, the hostage-takers extended their deadline to noon on 4 July and released another group of 100 non-Israeli captives who again were flown to Paris a few hours later. Among the 106 hostages staying behind with their captors at Entebbe airport were the 12 members of the Air France crew who refused to leave, about ten young French passengers, and the Israeli group of some 84 people.\nIsraeli response.\nDiplomatic efforts.\nIn the week before the raid, Israel tried using political avenues to obtain the release of the hostages. Many sources indicate that the Israeli cabinet was prepared to release Palestinian prisoners if a military solution seemed unlikely to succeed. A retired IDF officer, Baruch \"Burka\" Bar-Lev, had known Idi Amin for many years and was considered to have a strong personal relationship with him. At the request of the cabinet, he spoke with Amin on the phone many times, trying to gain the release of the hostages, without success. The Israeli government also approached the United States government to deliver a message to Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, asking him to request that Amin release the hostages. Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and defence minister Shimon Peres spent one week disagreeing on whether to give in to the hijackers' demands (Rabin's position) or not, to prevent more terrorism (Peres' position).\nAt the 1 July deadline the Israeli cabinet offered to negotiate with the hijackers to extend the deadline to 4 July. Amin also asked them to extend the deadline until that date. This meant he could take a diplomatic trip to Port Louis, Mauritius, to officially hand over chairmanship of the Organisation of African Unity to Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. This extension of the hostage deadline proved crucial to providing Israeli forces enough time to get to Entebbe.\nOn 3 July at 18:30, the Israeli cabinet approved a rescue mission, presented by Major General Yekutiel Adam and Brigadier General Dan Shomron. Shomron was appointed as the operation commander.\nEgyptian\u2013PLO involvement and failure of diplomacy.\nAs the crisis unfolded, attempts were made to negotiate the release of the hostages. According to declassified diplomatic documents, the Egyptian government under Sadat tried to negotiate with both the PLO and the Ugandan government. PLO chairman Yasser Arafat sent his political aide Hani al-Hassan to Uganda as a special envoy to negotiate with the hostage takers and with Amin. However, the PFLP-EO hijackers refused to see him.\nIsrael's military preparations.\nWhen Israeli authorities failed to negotiate a political solution, they decided that their only option was an attack to rescue the hostages. Lt. Col. Joshua Shani, lead pilot of the operation, later said that the Israelis had initially conceived of a rescue plan that involved dropping naval commandos into Lake Victoria. The commandos would have ridden rubber boats to the airport on the edge of the lake. They planned to kill the hijackers and after freeing the hostages, they would ask Amin for passage home. The Israelis abandoned this plan because they lacked the necessary time and also because they had received word that Lake Victoria was inhabited by the Nile crocodile.\nAmnon Biran, the mission's intelligence officer, later stated that the proper layout of the airport was unknown, as was the exact location of the hostages and whether the building had been prepared with explosives.\nAircraft refuelling.\nWhile planning the raid, the Israeli forces had to plan how to refuel the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft they intended to use while en route to Entebbe. The Israelis lacked the logistical capacity to aerially refuel four to six aircraft so far from Israeli airspace. While several East African nations, including the logistically preferred choice Kenya, were sympathetic, none wished to incur the wrath of Amin or the Palestinians by allowing the Israelis to land their aircraft within their borders.\nThe raid could not proceed without assistance from at least one East African government. The Israeli government secured permission from Kenya for the IDF task force to cross Kenyan airspace and refuel at what is today Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Kenyan Minister of Agriculture Bruce MacKenzie persuaded Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta to permit Mossad to collect intelligence prior to the operation, and to allow the Israeli Air Force access to the Nairobi airport. MacKenzie's support for the operation came after Sir Maurice Oldfield, the then head of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency, put his contacts in Mossad in touch with MacKenzie, who had been an MI6 contact for some time. The Jewish owner of the Block hotels chain in Kenya, along with other members of the Jewish and Israeli community in Nairobi, may also have used their political and economic influence to help persuade Kenya's President Jomo Kenyatta to help Israel.\nUganda's ambassador to Lesotho, Isaac Lumago, overheard some of the details of the operation from Kenya Air Force officers who were discussing the possibility of Israeli compensation for the assistance and forwarded the information to Ugandan commander Isaac Maliyamungu. Maliyamungu did not alert Amin or take any action on the intelligence, allegedly dismissing the report as \"gasiya\" (rubbish). According to Amin's son, Jaffar Remo, the Ugandan president still managed to receive Lumago's warning via telephone and, after completing his responsibilities at the OAU meeting, boarded a plane and flew back to Uganda. An ex-agent of Uganda's intelligence service, the State Research Bureau, also claimed that Amin was informed by Lumago of the imminent raid. The agent stated that Amin was terrified of possible reprisals in case his troops actually fought the Israeli military, allegedly resulting in his ordering that the Uganda Army should not open fire on Israeli aircraft during a possible raid.\nMossad intelligence.\nMossad built an accurate picture of the whereabouts of the hostages, the number of hijackers, and the involvement of Ugandan troops, based on information from the released hostages in Paris. Further, Israeli firms had been involved in construction projects in Africa during the 1960s and 1970s: while preparing the raid, the Israeli army consulted with Solel Boneh, a large Israeli construction firm that had built the terminal where the hostages were held. While planning the military operation, the IDF erected a partial replica of the airport terminal with the assistance of civilians who had helped build the original.\nIDF major Muki Betser later remarked in an interview that Mossad operatives extensively interviewed the hostages who had been released. He said that a French-Jewish passenger who had a military background and \"a phenomenal memory\" had provided detailed information about the number of weapons carried by the hostage-takers.\nTask force.\nThe Israeli ground task force numbered approximately 100 personnel, and comprised the following elements:\nThis small group comprised the operation and overall ground commander, Brigadier General Dan Shomron, the air force representative Colonel Ami Ayalon, and the communications and support personnel.\nA 29-person assault unit led by Lt. Col. Yonatan Netanyahu \u2013 this force was composed entirely of commandos from Sayeret Matkal, and was given the primary task of assaulting the old terminal and rescuing the hostages. Major Betser led one of the element's assault teams, and took command after Lt. Col. Netanyahu was killed.\nRaid.\nAttack route.\nTaking off from Sharm el-Sheikh, the task force flew along the international flight path over the Red Sea, mostly flying at a height of no more than 30\u00a0m (100\u00a0ft) to avoid radar detection by Egyptian, Sudanese, and Saudi Arabian forces. Near the south outlet of the Red Sea the C-130s turned south and crossed into Ethiopian territory, passing west of Djibouti. From there, they went to a point northeast of Nairobi, Kenya. They turned west, passing through the African Rift Valley and over Lake Victoria.\nTwo Boeing 707 jets followed the cargo planes. The first Boeing contained medical facilities and landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. The commander of the operation, General Yekutiel Adam, was on board the second Boeing, which circled over Entebbe Airport during the raid.\nThe Israeli forces landed at Entebbe on 3 July at 23:00 IST, with their cargo bay doors already open. Because the proper layout of the airport was not known, the first plane almost taxied into a ditch. A black Mercedes car that looked like President Idi Amin's vehicle and Land Rovers that usually accompanied Amin's Mercedes were brought along. The Israelis hoped they could use them to bypass security checkpoints. When the C-130s landed, Israeli assault team members drove the vehicles to the terminal building in the same fashion as Amin. As they approached the terminal, two Ugandan sentries, aware that Idi Amin had recently purchased a white Mercedes, ordered the vehicles to stop. The first commandos shot the sentries using silenced pistols. This was against the plan and against the orders \u2013 the Ugandans were to be ignored, as they were believed not to be likely to open fire at this stage. An Israeli commando in one of the following Land Rovers opened fire with an unsuppressed rifle. Fearing the hijackers would be alerted prematurely, the assault team quickly approached the terminal.\nHostage rescue.\nThe Israelis left their vehicles and ran towards the terminal. The hostages were in the main hall of the airport building, directly adjacent to the runway. Entering the terminal, the commandos shouted through a megaphone, \"Stay down! Stay down! We are Israeli soldiers,\" in both Hebrew and English. Jean-Jacques Maimoni, a 19-year-old French immigrant to Israel, stood up and was killed when Muki Betser and another soldier mistook him for a hijacker and fired at him. Another hostage, Pasco Cohen, 52, was also fatally wounded by gunfire from the commandos. In addition, a third hostage, 56-year-old Ida Borochovitch, a Russian Jew who had emigrated to Israel, was killed by a hijacker in the crossfire.\nAccording to hostage Ilan Hartuv, Wilfried B\u00f6se was the only hijacker who, after the operation began, entered the hall housing the hostages. At first he pointed his Kalashnikov rifle at hostages, but \"immediately came to his senses\" and ordered them to find shelter in the restroom, before being killed by the commandos. According to Hartuv, B\u00f6se fired only at Israeli soldiers and not at hostages.\nAt one point an Israeli commando called out in Hebrew, \"Where are the rest of them?\" referring to the hijackers. The hostages pointed to a connecting door of the airport's main hall, into which the commandos threw several hand grenades. They then entered the room and shot dead the three remaining hijackers, ending the assault. Meanwhile, the other three C-130 Hercules aeroplanes had landed and unloaded armoured personnel carriers to provide defence during the anticipated hour of refuelling. The Israelis then destroyed Ugandan MiG fighter planes to prevent them from pursuing, and conducted a sweep of the airfield to gather intelligence.\nDeparture.\nAfter the raid, the Israeli assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages. Ugandan soldiers shot at them in the process. The Israeli commandos returned fire, inflicting casualties on the Ugandans. During this brief but intense firefight, Ugandan soldiers fired from the airport control tower. At least five commandos were wounded, and the Israeli unit commander, Yonatan Netanyahu, was killed. Israeli commandos fired light machine guns and a rocket-propelled grenade back at the control tower, suppressing the Ugandans' fire. According to one of Idi Amin's sons, the soldier who shot Netanyahu, a cousin of the Amin family, was killed by return fire. The Israelis finished evacuating the hostages, loaded Netanyahu's body into one of the planes, and left the airport. The entire operation lasted 53\u00a0minutes \u2013 of which the assault lasted only 30\u00a0minutes. All seven hijackers present, and 45 Ugandan soldiers, were killed. Eleven Soviet-built MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighter planes of the Uganda Army Air Force were destroyed on the ground at Entebbe Airport. Out of the 106 hostages, 3 were killed, 1 was left in Uganda (74-year-old Dora Bloch), and approximately 10 were wounded. The 102 rescued hostages were flown to Israel via Nairobi, Kenya, shortly after the raid.\nUgandan reaction.\nAmin was furious upon learning of the raid, and reportedly boasted that he could have taught the Israelis a lesson if he had known that they would strike. Following the raid, Maliyamungu had 14 soldiers arrested under suspicion of collaborating with the Israelis. Once they were gathered in a room at Makindye Barracks, he shot 12 of them with his pistol. Uganda Army Chief of Staff Mustafa Adrisi reportedly wanted to incarcerate or execute Godwin Sule, the Entebbe Air Base commander, who was absent from his post during the raid. Sule had left the air base early that day to meet a female companion at Lake Victoria Hotel on 4 July. Despite Adrisi's demands, Sule's closeness to President Amin guaranteed his safety.\nMurder of Dora Bloch.\nDora Bloch, a 74-year-old Israeli who also held British citizenship, was taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala after choking on a chicken bone. After the raid she was murdered by officers of the Uganda Army, as were some of her doctors and nurses, apparently for trying to intervene. In April 1987, Henry Kyemba, Uganda's Attorney general and Minister of Justice at the time, told the Uganda Human Rights Commission that Bloch had been dragged from her hospital bed and killed by two army officers on Amin's orders. Bloch was shot and her body was dumped in the trunk of a car that had Ugandan intelligence services number plates. Her remains were recovered near a sugar plantation 20\u00a0miles (32\u00a0km) east of Kampala in 1979, after the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War ended Amin's rule.\nIdi Amin's anti-Kenyan crackdown.\nAmin also ordered the killing of hundreds of Kenyans living in Uganda in retaliation for Kenya's assistance to Israel in the raid. Uganda killed 245 Kenyans, including airport staff at Entebbe. To avoid massacre, approximately 3000 Kenyans fled Uganda as refugees.\nOn 24 May 1978, Kenya's former agriculture minister, Bruce MacKenzie, was killed when a bomb attached to his aircraft exploded as MacKenzie departed a meeting with Amin. Some have asserted that Ugandan president Idi Amin ordered Ugandan agents to assassinate MacKenzie in retaliation for Kenya's involvement and MacKenzie's actions prior to the raid. Others have indicated various other possible causes for the bombing, including that another person aboard the plane may have been the target. Later, Mossad Chief Director Meir Amit had a forest planted in Israel in MacKenzie's name.\nAftermath and reactions.\nUnited Nations.\nThe United Nations Security Council convened on 9 July 1976, to consider a complaint from the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity charging Israel with an \"act of aggression\". The Council allowed Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Chaim Herzog, and Uganda's foreign minister, Juma Oris Abdalla, to participate without voting rights. UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim told the Security Council that the raid was \"a serious violation of the sovereignty of a Member State of the United Nations\" though he was \"fully aware that this is not the only element involved ... when the world community is now required to deal with unprecedented problems arising from international terrorism.\" Abdalla, the representative of Uganda, alleged that the affair was close to a peaceful resolution when Israel intervened while Herzog, the representative of Israel, accused Uganda of direct complicity in the hijacking. The US and UK sponsored a resolution which condemned hijacking and similar acts, deplored the loss of life arising from the hijacking (without condemning either Israel or Uganda), reaffirmed the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, and called on the international community to enhance the safety of civil aviation. However, the resolution failed to receive the required number of affirmative votes because two voting members abstained and seven were absent. A second resolution sponsored by Benin, Libya and Tanzania, that condemned Israel, was not put to a vote.\nWestern Bloc.\nWestern nations spoke in support of the raid. Switzerland and France publicly praised the operation.\nWest Germany praised the raid and used it to advance its push for a multilateral U.N. convention against hostage-taking. Although the United States strongly backed the initiative, its support alienated many developing nations, which feared the convention could give great powers cover to infringe on weaker states' sovereignty. Despite the setback, West Germany persisted in its efforts, later leading the 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages.\nIn the United States, the raid\u2019s coincidence with the American bicentennial sparked the \"Entebbe Derby,\" a dramatic surge in media attention, books, films, and television portrayals. President Gerald Ford publicly congratulated Israel, while members of Congress introduced 12 separate resolutions praising the operation and urging an international conference on terrorism. Under Colonel Charles Beckwith's leadership, the Army began laying the groundwork for the Delta Force, though it only received full authorization after the GSG 9 antiterrorist raid on Lufthansa Flight 181 in 1977. Despite blanket public support for the raid, Henry Kissinger privately criticized Israeli use of U.S. equipment during the operation during a conversation with Israeli Ambassador Simcha Dinitz. In mid-July 1976, the supercarrier and her escorts entered the Indian Ocean and operated off the Kenyan coast in response to a threat of military action by forces from Uganda.\nThe hijacked aircraft's pilot, Captain Michel Bacos, was awarded the Legion of Honour, and the other crew members were awarded the French Order of Merit.\nIn the ensuing years, Betser and the Netanyahu brothers \u2013 Iddo and Benjamin, all Sayeret Matkal veterans \u2013 argued in increasingly public forums about who was to blame for the unexpected early firefight that caused Yonatan's death and partial loss of tactical surprise.\nIn a letter dated 13 July 1976, the Supreme Commander's Staff of the Imperial Iranian Armed Forces praised the Israeli commandos for the mission and extended condolences for \"the loss and martyrdom\" of Netanyahu.\nF-BVGG, the aircraft in the hijacking of Air France Flight 139, was repaired and returned to service with Air France. In April 1996, the aircraft was leased to Vietnam Airlines for three months. In December the same year, the aircraft was converted into a freighter and was delivered to S\u2013C Aviation, having been re-registered as N742SC. In 1998, the aircraft was delivered to MNG Airlines and re-registered as TC-MNA. In 2009, the aircraft was placed into storage at Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport and was scrapped in 2020.\nBombing of Kenya's Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi.\nThe Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi, owned by a prominent member of the local Jewish community, was bombed on 31 December 1980. The bomb flattened the hotel, killing 20 people, of several nationalities, and injuring 87 more. It was believed to be an act of revenge by pro-Palestinian militants for Kenya's supporting role in Operation Entebbe.\nCommemorations.\nIn August 2012, Uganda and Israel commemorated the raid at a somber ceremony at the base of the tower at the old terminal, where Yonatan Netanyahu was killed. Uganda and Israel renewed their commitment to \"fight terrorism and to work towards humanity\". In addition, wreaths were laid, a moment of silence was held, speeches were given, and a poem was recited. The flags of Uganda and Israel were flown side by side, symbolising the two countries' strong bilateral relations, next to a plaque bearing a history of the raid. The ceremony was attended by Ugandan State Minister for Animal Industry Bright Rwamirama and the deputy Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Daniel Ayalon, who laid wreaths at the site.\nIn 2016, forty years to the day after the rescue operation, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, brother of slain Israeli commando Yonatan Netanyahu, visited Entebbe with an Israeli delegation, and laid the groundwork for further Israeli\u2013sub-Saharan African bilateral relations. In the U.S., the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the operation was held at Temple Mikvah Israel, in Philadelphia, PA where a memorial to Yonatan Netanayahu who was killed in the operation was built in 1982.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66857", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66857", "title": "International Whaling Commission", "text": "International body regulating whaling\nThe International Whaling Commission (IWC) is a specialised regional fishery management organisation, established under the terms of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) to \"provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry\".\nAs the decision-making body of the convention, the IWC reviews and revises measures laid down in the \"Schedule to the Convention\", which govern the conduct of whaling throughout the world. These measures include: confer complete protection of certain species; designate specific areas as whale sanctuaries; set limits on the numbers and size of whales which may be taken; prescribe open and closed seasons and areas for whaling; and prohibit the capture of suckling calves and female whales accompanied by calves. The Commission also mandates the compilation of catch reports and other statistical and biological records, and is actively involved in whale research, including funding and promoting studies, publishing the results of scientific research, and encouraging studies into related matters, such as the humaneness of the killing operations.\nThrough the \"Florian\u00f3polis Declaration\" of 2018, members of the organization concluded that the purpose of the IWC is the conservation of whales and that they would now safeguard the marine mammals in perpetuity and would allow the recovery of all whale populations to pre-industrial whaling levels. In response, Japan announced on 26 December 2018, that since the IWC failed its duty to promote sustainable hunting, which is one of its stated goals, Japan is withdrawing its membership and will resume commercial hunting in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone from July 2019, but will cease whaling activities in the Southern Hemisphere.\nStructure and membership.\nThe IWC was created by voluntary agreement among the member states to function as the sole governing body with authority to act under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which is an international environmental agreement signed in 1946 in order to \"provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry\" and to implement its economic and environmental goals. The role of the commission is to periodically review and revise the \"Schedule to the Convention\", controlling the conduct of whaling by setting the protection of certain species; designating areas as whale sanctuaries; setting limits on the numbers and size of catches; prescribing open and closed seasons and areas for whaling; methods and intensity of whaling, types of gear to be used, methods of measurement and maximum catch returns. Under its constitutive document, the IWC is given the task of adopting regulations \"to provide for the conservation, development, and optimum utilization of the whale resources\" with the condition that such regulations \"shall be based on scientific findings.\"\nThe headquarters of the IWC is in Impington, near Cambridge, England. The Secretariat publishes the \"Journal of Cetacean Research and Management\", reports, press releases, and a calendar of meetings.\nThe commission has three main committees\u2014Scientific, Conservation,\nand Finance and Administration.\nA Technical Committee is established, but has stopped meeting.\nParticipation in the IWC is not limited to states involved in whaling. Membership in the IWC has doubled since 2001 with an average of almost six states per year joining the IWC from 2002 to 2008. As of February 2024 there were 88 members. Current (2024) members are: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, China, Colombia, Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Ivory Coast, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark (which also acts as the Kingdom with the Faroe Islands and Greenland), Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Eritrea, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, the Gambia, Germany, Ghana, Grenada, Republic of Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kenya, South Korea, Kiribati, Laos, Liberia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mali, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Nauru, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Palau, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Togo, Tuvalu, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay.\nSince 2012 the IWC has met in even-numbered years, in September or October.\nMeetings are composed of one voting representative (called a Commissioner) from each state party who may be accompanied by experts and advisors. They are generally extremely divisive\u2014demonstrating a complete split on all major issues between the pro-whaling governments and their supporters and the anti-whaling countries. The IWC's Rules of Procedure allow non-parties and intergovernmental organisations to attend the meetings and to be represented by observers if they have submitted a written request to the Secretary thirty days before the meeting or if they have attended previous meetings. Non-governmental organisations that maintain offices in more than three countries may also attend the meetings of the IWC.\nIn 2012, the Commission agreed to move from annual to biennial Commission Meetings. The Scientific Committee continues to meet annually. In years where both meetings are held, a period of at least 100 days separates the two. This is to allow time to read and digest the reports of the Scientific Committee Meeting, before the Commission Meeting begins.\nAnnual meetings.\nMembers of the International Whaling Commission have met every year since 1949, in addition to having occasional intersessional 'special meetings' (these are not 'annual meetings').\nIn recent years, the meetings have attracted international media attention due to the growth of the anti-whaling movement.\nThe IWC also holds occasional \"special meetings\" (there were five between 1949 and 2007).\nFrom 2012 onwards, it was decided that the annual Commission Meetings would go to biennial Commission Meetings, while the IWC Scientific Committee would still meet annually.\nIWC meeting in 2005.\nThe International Whaling Commission meeting in 2005 was held in Ulsan, South Korea from 20\u201324 June 2005. This meeting saw discussion and vote upon several particularly divisive matters. Notable among them were three defeated Japanese proposals:\nResponding to Japan's stated intentions of increasing their scientific whaling quota, Australia also introduced a non-binding resolution that calls on Japan to halt the expansion of its scientific whaling program, which was supported by 30 votes to 25. Opponents of scientific whaling claim it is commercial whaling under a different name. New Zealand's Minister of Conservation, Chris Carter, said, \"We find (the) whole use of the phrase 'scientific whaling' an outrage.\" Japan, however, claims that their research activities contribute to scientific knowledge of the management of whales. In the face of these setbacks, Japan has not ruled out withdrawing from the IWC, but this would require approval by the Japanese parliament.\nIWC meeting in 2006.\nThe International Whaling Commission meeting in 2006 was held 16 June\u201320 June in St Kitts and Nevis. Pro whaling countries unsuccessfully challenged the 1982 moratorium, yet succeeded in shifting the IWC focus from whale conservation to management of commercial whaling.\nOf the two votes proposed by Japan on the first day, both were defeated by narrow majorities. 30\u201332 in the case of removing small cetaceans from IWC competence and 30\u201333 on the proposal to introduce secret ballots. A number of countries, including Costa Rica, Gambia, Peru, and Togo were not present at the vote or had not completed their registration procedures/fees payments before the votes.\nGreenland voluntarily introduced a reduction in fin whales taken following advice from the IWC Scientific committee (IWC SC) that the catch of 19 animals may not be a safe level of catch and noted that this left Greenland with a shortfall of 220 tons of whale meat from their quota of 670 tons. They made enquiries into the stock levels of Humpback whales and Bowhead whales around Greenland, with the possible intent of opening up a hunt eventually on these two species to make up the shortfall. This of course alarmed anti-whaling countries and NGO's immediately . \nThe RMS was discussed yet again in depth to no avail, with the chairman of the IWC, Henrik Fischer, noting that RMS discussions are at an impasse and that he will close discussion on the RMS on the afternoon of 18 June if nobody comes up with any new ideas.\nJapan proposed a schedule amendment regarding its coastal whaling communities to take a small number of Minke whales From the \"O\" Stock. After much discussion, the proposal was defeated with 30 votes for the proposal and 31 votes against with 4 abstentions.\nDiscussion of the southern ocean sanctuary continued, as well as a Caribbean sanctuary proposed by France. The vote on whether to remove the southern ocean sanctuary was defeated by 28\u201333 with 5 abstentions. The French delegate was verbally denounced by a number of Caribbean nations for not discussing their proposed sanctuary with any of the other Caribbean nations in advance of their proposal and the proposal was not voted upon.\nThe St Kitts and Nevis Declaration was discussed and voted upon, and adopted with 33 votes in favour, 32 against, and one abstention, the first time in more than two decades that the Whaling Commission has expressed support for commercial whaling. The Declaration declared the moratorium on whaling \"no longer necessary\".\n1982 moratorium.\nThe 1970s saw the beginning of the global anti-whaling movement. In 1972 the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm adopted a proposal that recommended a ten-year moratorium on commercial whaling to allow whale stocks to recover. The reports of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in 1977 and 1981 identified many species of whales as being in danger of extinction.\nAt the same time, a number of non-whaling and anti-whaling states began to join the IWC and eventually gained a majority over the whaling states. Some countries who were previously major whaling forces, like the United States, became strong proponents of the anti-whaling cause. These countries called for the IWC to reform its policies and to incorporate newly discovered scientific data regarding whales in its proposed regulations.\nOn 23 July 1982, members of the IWC voted by the necessary three-quarters majority to implement a pause on commercial whaling. The relevant text reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Notwithstanding the other provisions of paragraph 10, catch limits for the killing for commercial purposes of whales from all stocks for the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons and thereafter shall be zero. This provision will be kept under review, based upon the best scientific advice, and by 1990 at the latest the Commission will undertake a comprehensive assessment of the effects of this decision on whale stocks and consider modification of this provision and the establishment of other catch limits.\nThe measure passed by 25 votes to seven, with five abstentions.\nJapan, Norway, Peru, and the Soviet Union (later replaced by Russia) lodged formal objections, since the moratorium was not based on advice from the Scientific Committee. Japan and Peru later withdrew their objections (Japan's withdrawal was precipitated by the US threatening to reduce their fishing quota within US waters if the objection was not withdrawn. However, by 1988 the US had eliminated Japanese fishing quotas anyway. It was after this that the Japanese began scientific whaling.). In 2002, Iceland was allowed to rejoin IWC with a reservation to the moratorium (Iceland withdrew from IWC in 1992), but this reservation is not recognised as a valid objection by many IWC members. In addition, Italy, Mexico, and New Zealand do not consider the ICRW to be in force between their countries and Iceland. None of these countries, however, has mounted any legal challenge to Iceland's membership of the IWC.\nAs the moratorium applies only to commercial whaling, whaling under the scientific-research and aboriginal-subsistence provisions of the ICRW is still allowed. However, environmental groups dispute the claim of research \"as a disguise for commercial whaling, which is banned.\" Since 1994, Norway has been whaling commercially and Iceland began hunting commercially in September 2006. Since 1986, Japan has been whaling under scientific research permits. The US and several other countries are whaling under aboriginal whaling auspices. Norway lodged a protest to the zero catch limits in 1992 and is not bound by them. Anti-whaling countries and lobbies accuse Japan's scientific whaling of being a front for commercial whaling. The Japanese government argues that the refusal of anti-whaling states to accept simple head counts of whale population as a measure of recovery of whale species justifies its continuing studies on sex and age of population distributions, and further points out that IWC regulations specifically require that whale meat obtained by scientific whaling not go to waste. Japan, on the other hand, has raised objections to U.S. aboriginal subsistence whaling, generally seen to be in retaliation to anti-whaling states' (including the United States') objections to aboriginal subsistence whaling for several Japanese fishing communities, which traditionally hunted whales until the imposition of the moratorium.\nIn May 1994, the IWC also voted to create the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The vote to adopt the sanctuary resolution was twenty-three in favour, one opposed (Japan) and six abstaining.\n2018 Florian\u00f3polis Declaration.\nOn 13 September 2018, IWC members gathered in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil, where they discussed and rejected a proposal by Japan to renew commercial whaling. Through the \"Florian\u00f3polis Declaration\", it was concluded that the purpose of the IWC is the conservation of whales and that they would now safeguard the marine mammals in perpetuity and would allow the recovery of all whale populations to pre-industrial whaling levels. It also concluded that the use of lethal research methods is unnecessary. The non-binding agreement was backed by 40 countries, with 27 pro-whaling states voting against. Under this resolution, limited hunts by some indigenous communities are still permitted.\nOn 26 December 2018, Japan announced that since the IWC failed its duty to promote sustainable hunting, which is one of its stated goals, Japan was withdrawing its membership. Japanese officials also announced they would resume commercial hunting within its territorial waters and its 200-mile exclusive economic zones starting in July 2019, but it would cease whaling activities in the Antarctic Ocean, the northwest Pacific Ocean, and the Australian Whale Sanctuary.\nEnforcement under the IWC.\nIWC is a voluntary international organization and is not backed up by treaty, therefore, the IWC has substantial practical limitations on its authority. First, any member countries are free to simply leave the organization and declare themselves not bound by it if they so wish. Second, any member state may opt out of any specific IWC regulation by lodging a formal objection to it within 90 days of the regulation coming into force (such provisions are common in international agreements, on the logic that it is preferable to have parties remain within the agreements than opt out altogether). Third, the IWC has no ability to enforce any of its decisions through penalty imposition.\nInternational Observer Scheme.\nIn 1971, Australia and South Africa agreed to supply observers to each other (International Observer Scheme, IOS) to ensure their land-based whaling stations were in compliance of the IWC. A similar agreement was drawn up between Canada, Iceland and Norway covering the North Atlantic area. This was shortly followed by an agreement between Japan and the United States in the North Pacific Ocean. The introduction of the IOS had a positive effect on quality of the reported catch data, according to the Royal Society, despite no significant change in regulations, indicating false reporting may have been prevalent in the Japanese whaling industry prior to the IOS.\nPolitics.\nThere has been concern that the conflict between those who seek renewed utilisation of whales and those who seek protection for every whale has placed a dangerous strain on the IWC. Oran Young and eight other noted scholars in the field assert that \"changes in the current [IWC] arrangements are inevitable\" and that \"the killing of whales for human consumption will continue, whether whalers operate within a reconstructed international whaling regime, opt to join alternative arrangements like NAMMCO, or seek to establish a hybrid system\". The BBC also reports that \"[c]onservationists argue that the IWC should be devoting far more of its attention to issues such as whales being hit by ships, the effects of pollution and climate change, and the pressures that drive species such as the baiji (or Yangtse river dolphin) to extinction. As things stand, it cannot. The logjam of hunting has to be overcome first.\"\nAllegation of politicising science.\nThe pro-whaling governments accuse the IWC of basing these decisions upon \"political and emotional\" factors rather than upon scientific knowledge given that the IWC prohibits all whaling, even though its own Scientific Committee has concluded since 1991 that quotas on some species of whale would be sustainable. They argue the IWC has swayed from its original purpose and is attempting, under the guise of conservation, to essentially grant whales an entitlement to life via an absolute protection from being killed by humans for commercial purposes.\nNon-IWC whaling countries have expressed similar sentiments. Canada withdrew from the IWC after the vote to impose the moratorium, claiming that \"[t]he ban was inconsistent with measures that had just been adopted by the IWC that were designed to allow harvests of stocks at safe levels.\"\nAfter the moratorium came into force in 1986, the Scientific Committee was commissioned to review the status of the whale stocks and develop a calculation method for setting safe catch limits. At the IWC's annual meeting in 1991, the Scientific Committee submitted its finding that there existed approximately 761,000 minke whales in Antarctic waters, 87,000 in the northeast Atlantic, and 25,000 in the North Pacific. With such populations, it was submitted, 2000 minke whales could be harvested annually without endangering the population. Despite this, the IWC Plenary Committee voted to maintain the blanket moratorium on whaling, arguing that formulas for determining allowable catches had not yet been adequately evaluated.\nIn 1991, acting on the recommendation of the Scientific Committee, the IWC adopted a computerized formula, the Revised Management Procedure (RMP), for determining allowable catches of some whale species. Despite the fact that the RMP indicated that it would be possible to authorize a catch that year, the moratorium was not lifted. The IWC noted the need to agree on minimum standards for data, to prepare guidelines on the conduct of population surveys, and to devise and approve a system of measures for monitoring and inspection.\nThe IWC Plenary committee adopted the RMP in 1994, but decided not to implement it before an inspection and control scheme had been developed. This scheme, together with the RMP, is known as the Revised Management Scheme (RMS). Since then it has been all but impossible for the member countries in the Plenary committee to agree on an RMS.\nAustralia is the only member country of IWC which has officially announced its opposition to any RMS and is therefore not participating in the discussions. Anti-whaling NGOs, such as Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace, are also generally against the RMS. \nRay Gambell, then the Secretary of the IWC, agreed at least in part with the argument of the pro-whaling countries: \"In all reasonableness, we would have to say that a commercial catch could be taken without endangering [Minke] stocks.\" In June 1993 the Chairman of the Scientific Committee, Dr Philip Hammond, resigned in protest to what he saw as contempt of the Scientific Committee's recommendations. The same year Norway became the only state in the world to resume commercial whaling, on the grounds that they had objected to, and thus opted out, of the moratorium.\nIWC membership.\nThe purpose of the IWC as specified in its constitution is \"in safeguarding for future generations the great natural resources represented by the whale stocks;\" and the original members consisted only of the 15 whale-hunting countries. However, since the late 1970s and early 1980s, many countries which have no previous history of whaling (some of which are landlocked such as Switzerland and Mongolia) have joined the IWC. This shift was first initiated by Sir Peter Scott, the then head of the World Wildlife Fund. Labelling the IWC a \"butchers' club\", he mounted lobbying campaigns in developed countries with support from the green lobby and anti-whaling block of IWC members to change the composition of the IWC's membership, which was instrumental in obtaining the necessary three-quarters majority vote to implement the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. This campaign triggered the first accusations of vote-buying in IWC. According to Scott's biographer, Elspeth Huxley, China's decision to join was influenced by a World Wildlife Fund promise to provide $1 million to fund a panda reserve. Michael Tillman, former IWC Commissioner of the United States, said in a radio interview that \"there was what we called 'common knowledge,' that a number of countries joined and that their dues and the travel support was reportedly due to conservation groups providing it. So that, in a sense, one could say that the conservation groups set out a strategy that the Japanese copied.\"\nSince the moratorium was adopted, the support for it has dropped from a 75% majority to a 50\u201350 split, with many of the countries initially recruited by the anti-whaling side now voting with the pro-whaling block. (A 75% majority is needed to overturn the moratorium.) Anti-whaling campaign groups and some governments claim that the Japanese Fisheries Agency has carried out a programme of \"vote-buying\"\u2014i.e. offering aid to poorer countries in return for them joining the IWC and supporting Japanese positions on whaling. Japan claims, however, that this accusation itself is politically motivated because Japan's overseas aid is not only given to pro-whaling countries. Japan has given US$320 million in overseas aid to Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Guinea, Morocco, Panama, St. Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St Kitts and Nevis and the Solomon Islands. Caribbean countries have consistently sided with Japan in each IWC vote since 2001 though the Caribbean governments admit the rules may possibly impact on their fishing activities as well. Pacific countries' voting patterns vary even for each motion, as they are lobbied by neighbouring pro-whaling Japan and anti-whaling New Zealand and Australia. Greenpeace alleges that Japan's aid activities and these countries' voting patterns are correlated. These allegations of tying aid to votes are based on public admissions by government officials both inside and outside Japan, as well as an analysis of voting patterns compared to Japanese Fisheries Aid received.\nIn 2005, The Environmental Investigation Agency approached Lord Ashcroft of the UK to use his influence in Belize to assure support for the anti-whaling camp. It was reported that Ashcroft paid Belize's IWC subscription fees:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Every month I'm on the water somewhere,\" he says. \"I've grown a close affinity, not just for whales, but for dolphins and porpoises. So it wasn't difficult for me to approach the Belizean authorities with such a brief.\" He discovered that Belize's annual subscription to the IWC\u2014\u00a310,000\u2014had lapsed and came up with the cash. That backing yielded swift results when a crucial vote was won by the anti-whaling nations by a majority of one.\nBoth sides accuse each other of using underhanded tactics to pack the commission with countries sympathetic to their position. Edwin Snagg, the IWC commissioner for St Vincent and the Grenadines stated, \"It's a question of respect...Because you are small and because you are underdeveloped there is this view and there is this feeling that you can easily be bought and you can easily be sold. We in the Caribbean feel highly offended.\" Moreover, there are no developing countries who support an anti-whaling stance. The BBC reported that \"Some countries recently admitted to the European Union have been advised by a \"word in the ear\" that it would be \"a good idea\" for them to join the IWC. Some activists believe that Britain and its fellow EU old-timers such as France and Germany should recruit all member states into the commission.\" In Australia, National Nine News reported that \"New Zealand is questioning pro-whaling support among Pacific Island states with the opposition calling for a rethink of foreign aid.\" It is expected that more countries in the future will join the IWC including some landlocked countries. Currently, there are nine landlocked IWC members. Mali and Mongolia voted with other pro-whaling countries. Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Switzerland and San Marino voted with other anti-whaling countries.\nBoth pro- and anti-whaling countries claim that their recruiting activities are restricted to lobbying and persuasion based on the merits of their cause. Anti-whaling campaigners argue that scientific studies are not currently clear enough to warrant resumption of commercial whaling. Moreover, there are various other issues such as welfare of whales which is beyond the simple matter of conservation. (See The arguments for and against whaling) These issues have global relevance which is not restricted only to whaling and whaling countries. Moreover, public opinion in many anti-whaling countries is solidly behind the governmental position on whaling within the IWC. Pro-whaling countries, on the other hand, argue that the public's anti-whaling stance is often based on misinformation \u2013 a 2003 article in \"The Economist\" noted that surveys in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States had found that a majority of respondents incorrectly believe that all whale species are endangered.\nMoreover, coastal countries have a vested interest in conserving their fish stocks which may be threatened by whales (this claim is strongly contested by the anti-whaling lobby). Japan, particularly when lobbying African governments, argues that diversification of the anti-whaling argument outside of conservation is a threat to their national interest. Exploitation of wildlife resources (such as elephant ivory, sea turtles or primates) is restricted supposedly on the ground of sustainable management. Alleged filibustering of the Revised Management Scheme and diversification of arguments outside of conservation by the anti-whaling side are claimed to be signs that anti-whaling countries no longer adhere to this principle (of sustainable management and exploitation of natural resources). The Japanese argue that the African countries and whaling countries have a shared interest in preventing the principle of sustainable management being exploited as a cover for animal rights arguments:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Owing to the economic power of the US and the UK, CITES was forced to list perfectly healthy species of whales (over the objections of its secretariat), along with legitimately endangered species, on its banned list. This has severely eroded CITES' credibility, especially in the world's developing countries, where hundreds of animal species are mortally endangered.\nAt the London IWC meeting in 2001 Sandra Lee-Vercoe, the New Zealand delegate to the commission, accused Japan of buying votes. The Japanese delegate denied the allegations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Japan gives foreign aid to more than 150 nations around the world and that includes strong anti-whaling nations such as Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and others who receive far more aid than the Caribbean nations [...] If Japan was buying votes, you would see 150 nations in the IWC and as a consequence the unnecessary moratorium would have been lifted years ago. \u2014\u200a\nKomatsu also said that Caribbean countries naturally supported pro-whaling resolutions as they are whaling countries themselves (mostly of smaller cetaceans) and that the New Zealand commissioner was inventing \"fairy stories\".\nAnti-whaling groups cite several statements in response to this rebuttal. In an interview reported in \"The Observer\" newspaper in May 2001, Atherton Martin, Dominica's former Environment and Fisheries Minister who publicly opposes whaling, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They [Japan] make it clear, that if you don't vote for them, they will have to reconsider the aid. They use money crudely to buy influence.\u2014\u200a\nGreenpeace also quotes Tongan parliamentarian Samiu K Vaipulu as saying at a workshop on the proposed South Pacific Whale Sanctuary in Samoa that Japan had linked whale votes to aid. Lester Bird, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, had said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So as long as the whales are not an endangered species, I don't see any reason why if we are able to support the Japanese and the quid pro quo is that they will give us some assistance. I'm not going to be a hypocrite.\u2014\u200a\nIn an interview with Australian ABC television in July 2001, Japanese Fisheries Agency official Maseyuku Komatsu described minke whales as \"cockroaches of the sea\". \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reported that he further stated \"lacking military might, his country had to use the tools of diplomacy and promises of development aid to \"get appreciation of Japan's position\" on whaling. Billions of yen have flowed to countries that joined the IWC from both pro- and anti-whaling countries. \"It already brings back the time when we were colonised,\" says Clarice Charles, of Grenada. \"Would these rich nations give a poor fisherman a revolving loan or a grant or a gift so that he can buy [a tourist boat] to go whale watching?\"\nIn Japan, conservative media outlets (the most vocal ones being \"Sankei Shimbun\" and \"Bungei Shunju\") argue that countries which oppose commercial whaling altogether should not be in the IWC at all and that the anti-whaling side has subverted the purpose of the IWC by exploiting the (lack of) membership requirements. Moreover, they point out that the anti-whaling lobby within the IWC is also led by wealthy developed countries and is equally susceptible to accusations of vote-buying and influence-peddling. They accuse the anti-whaling side within the IWC of using conservation as a cover for its ideological opposition to whaling itself, which mirrors the accusation from the anti-whaling side that Japan's scientific whaling is a cover for commercial whaling. Since 2000, 29 new countries have joined the IWC, 18 of them pro-whaling, 11 anti. Japan notes that major anti-whaling countries such as the U.S., Australia, UK and New Zealand also donate aid to poor countries on the IWC and wield far more influence than Japan alone and thus they could easily be accused of the same tactics.\nJapan is pushing to have secret ballot voting introduced at IWC meetings. Secret ballot voting would weaken accusations of Japanese vote-buying by making it impossible to monitor so-called client members' votes. From Japan's point of view, secret ballot voting would also reduce the powerful collective influence of the anti-whaling lobby on IWC members. One of the new 2006 members, Israel, which had been asked specifically to join by the US, voted consistently with the anti-whaling bloc. Belize, a country previously accused of having its vote bought and paid for by Japan by a number of countries and NGOs, shifted sides and consistently voted with the anti-whaling block at the 2006 IWC meeting. Anti-whaling governments oppose secret ballot voting on the grounds that it is without precedent in other international bodies and that it would remove accountability and make behind-the-scenes deals between delegations more likely. However, St Kitts and Nevis Commissioner, Cedric Liburd, argued during a debate on the secret ballot vote at the 2006 meeting that it was hypocritical of anti-whaling countries to pontificate on the need for transparency within the IWC by open voting when the same countries happily voted via secret ballot in CITES, a similar management body.\nThe role of the United States.\nThe effectiveness of IWC decisions (at least on smaller whaling states) may be explained in large part by the fact that the United States has been willing to act unilaterally in support of them. The pro-whaling countries often see the U.S.'s propensity to act outside the IWC framework as \"bullying\" tactics, while environmentalists and the conservation lobby tend to applaud the U.S.'s approach.\nThe United States first incorporated the IWC's r\u00e9gime into domestic law in the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967. This amendment provides that when the Secretary of Commerce determines that the nationals of a foreign country are diminishing the effectiveness of an international fishery conservation program (including the IWC's program), the Secretary shall certify this fact to the President. The President then has the discretion to ban importation of fishing products from the offending country. The United States has threatened sanctions under the Pelly Amendment on a number of occasions. In November 1974, pressure from the United States contributed to Japan and the Soviet Union complying with the 1974\u20131975 quotas. Similarly, in December 1978, Chile, South Korea and Peru acceded to the IWC after the United States certified them under the Amendment. The threatened certification of Spain also led that country to observe a fin whale quota to which it had objected.\nThese measures were further strengthened by the 1979 Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976. It provides that, when the Secretary of Commerce certifies that a country is diminishing the effectiveness of the work of the IWC, the Secretary of State must reduce that country's fishing allocation in U.S. waters by at least 50%. Certification under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment also serves as certification under the Pelly Amendment. The threatened application in 1980 of the Packwood-Magnuson and Pelly Amendments led South Korea to agree to follow IWC guidelines restricting the use of cold (i.e. non-explosive) harpoons. Faced with similar pressure, the Republic of China (Taiwan) placed a complete ban on whaling in 1981. Without United States support, it is possible that the 1986 moratorium would have been substantially limited, as countries such as Iceland, Japan, Norway and the Soviet Union would have opted out and continued commercial whaling.\nThe North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission.\nThe moratorium on commercial whaling led Iceland to withdraw in protest from the IWC, as it had threatened to do if the moratorium was extended. Japan and Norway also threatened to leave the organisation. In April 1992, the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) was established by the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, and Norway under the Agreement on Cooperation in Research, Conservation and Management of Marine Mammals in the North Atlantic. The document clearly responded to what the drafters regarded as the inappropriate whale protectionist tendencies of the IWC. Gu\u00f0mundur Eir\u00edksson of Iceland stated at NAMMCO's inaugural meeting that the organisation was established in part out of dissatisfaction with the IWC's zero-catch quota. Although NAMMCO does not conflict directly with the obligations of membership states under the IWC, it nonetheless presented a challenge to the legitimacy of the IWC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He translated La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie in Latin and wrote commentaries and explanations to it. Because most contemporary scientists and mathematicians in Europe knew the invention of analytic geometry through Van Schooten's edition, with its extensive commentaries by Johannes Hudde, Johan de Witt, and Hendrik van Heuraet, he had a significant influence on the science and mathematics of Europe at the time; especially on the invention of calculus by Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton.\nLife.\nVan Schooten's father, Frans van Schooten Senior was a professor of mathematics at the University of Leiden, having Christiaan Huygens, Johann van Waveren Hudde, and Ren\u00e9 de Sluze as students.\nVan Schooten met Descartes in 1632 and read his \"G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\" (an appendix to his \"Discours de la m\u00e9thode\") while it was still unpublished. Finding it hard to understand, he went to France to study the works of other important mathematicians of his time, such as Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te and Pierre de Fermat. Frans van Schooten returned home to Leiden in 1643 to assist his father and, two years later, inherited his father's position as professor at Leiden's Engineering School. One of his most important pupils at this time was Huygens.\nThe pendant marriage portraits of him and his wife Margrieta Wijnants were painted by Rembrandt and are kept in the National Gallery of Art:\nWork.\nVan Schooten's 1649 Latin translation of and commentary on Descartes' \"G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\" was valuable in that it made the work comprehensible to the broader mathematical community, and thus was responsible for the spread of analytic geometry to the world.\nOver the next decade he enlisted the aid of other mathematicians of the time, de Beaune, Hudde, Heuraet, de Witt and expanded the commentaries to two volumes, published in 1659 and 1661. This edition and its extensive commentaries was far more influential than the 1649 edition. It was this edition that Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton knew.\nVan Schooten was one of the first to suggest, in exercises published in 1657, that these ideas be extended to three-dimensional space. Van Schooten's efforts also made Leiden the centre of the mathematical community for a short period in the middle of the seventeenth century.\nIn elementary geometry Van Schooten's theorem is named after him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ensslin was perhaps the intellectual head of the RAF. She was involved in five bomb attacks, with four deaths, was arrested in 1972 and died on 18 October 1977 in what has been called Stammheim Prison's \"Death Night\".\nEarly life and education.\nEnsslin was the fourth of seven children, and grew up in Bad Cannstatt, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stuttgart, where her father Helmut Ensslin () was a pastor of the Evangelical Church.\nEnsslin was a well-behaved child who did well at school and enjoyed working with the Protestant Girl Scouts, and doing parish work such as organizing Bible studies. In her family, the social injustices of the world were often discussed, and she is said to have been sensitized to social problems in West Germany and the world as a whole.\nAt the age of eighteen, Ensslin spent a year in the United States, where she attended high school in Warren, Pennsylvania. She graduated in the honors group at the high school in 1959. After returning home, she finished the remaining requirements for her secondary education.\nLike her partner Bernward Vesper () and other members of the Red Army Faction, including Ulrike Meinhof and Horst Mahler, Ensslin had excellent exam scores and received a scholarship from the German National Academic Foundation. Studying at the University of T\u00fcbingen, she read education, English studies, and German studies. Ensslin also met Vesper in February 1962.\nIn T\u00fcbingen, together with two other students, Ensslin and Vesper organized a student workshop for new literature which led to a shoestring publishing business called \"Studio neue Literatur\". The first book produced was an anthology of poems against atomic weapons, with prominent poets from all German-speaking countries as well as a bilingual edition of poems by Gerardo Diego.\nIn 1963 and 1964, Ensslin earned her elementary school teacher's diploma. In the summer of 1964, the couple moved to West Berlin where Ensslin began her thesis on Hans Henny Jahnn.\nCareer.\nIn 1965, Gudrun's younger sister Johanna married G\u00fcnter Maschke, then a revolutionary Marxist poet and member of the Situationist International group , which included Rudi Dutschke as a member. Maschke became later in life a leading conservative antidemocratic intellectual and commentator of the work of Carl Schmitt. Later that year, Gudrun and Bernward were engaged to be married. Both were active in the democratic left-wing, they had well-paid jobs working for the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The couple demonstrated together against new security laws, the Vietnam War, an Allied Powers arms show, and for the right to demonstrate. Vesper neglected his studies, read voraciously, and in 1966 published, with a group of friends, a serious and important series of pamphlets and paperbacks, the \"Voltaire Flugschriften\". In May 1967, Ensslin gave birth to their son Felix Ensslin ().\nIn July or August 1967, Ensslin met Andreas Baader and they soon began a love affair. Baader had come to Berlin in 1963, to escape ongoing troubles with the Munich justice system and also to avoid conscription. Baader, who drifted in and out of youth detention centers and prison soon became the man of Ensslin's life. In February 1968, Ensslin broke up with Vesper by phone, informing him that the relationship was already finished before Felix was born. An artifact from this time is an experimental film Ensslin participated in entitled \"\" (\"The Subscription\").\nRed Army Faction leader.\nIn June 1967, Ensslin participated in political protests against the Shah of Iran during his visit to Germany. Though Western governments viewed the Shah as a reformer, his regime was also being criticized for oppression, brutality, corruption, and extravagance. In what started as a peaceful but unauthorised demonstration at Deutsche Oper Berlin, fights broke out between pro-Shah and anti-Shah demonstrators and an unarmed protestor named Benno Ohnesorg was fatally shot in the back of the head by a police officer, Karl-Heinz Kurras. On the night following Ohnesorg's death, Ensslin angrily denounced West Germany as a fascist police state at a Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund meeting. Also, West Berlin's own urban guerrilla organization, Movement 2 June, named itself after this event.\nKurras was charged with manslaughter and acquitted on grounds of self-defense on 23 November 1967, which caused further public outrage. Matters eventually cooled, which enraged Baader and Ensslin. She had left Vesper and her child for good early in 1968 and now she, Baader and Thorwald Proll decided to escalate their fight against the system. They left West Berlin around 20 March, and in Munich decided to firebomb department stores in Frankfurt, where a Socialist German Student Union congress was taking place. Together with Horst S\u00f6hnlein, they left for Frankfurt on 1 April.\nThe night of 2 April 1968, a department store in Frankfurt was set ablaze, for which Baader, Ensslin, Proll and S\u00f6hnlein were subsequently arrested and prosecuted. In October 1968 they were sentenced to three years in prison for arson. After being released pending an appeal in June 1969, Baader, Ensslin and Proll fled Italy via France when the appeal was denied.\nBaader was arrested on 4 April 1970 in Berlin. Ensslin, Meinhof, who was at that time a well-known leftist journalist, and two other women freed him on 14 May 1970. One person was wounded. This was the beginning of the gang's violent actions, and the Red Army Faction. Ensslin became one of the most wanted people in Germany.\nIn May 1971, Vesper committed suicide in a mental hospital and Felix was sent to live with foster parents.\nEnsslin was arrested in a boutique on 7 June 1972 in Hamburg.\nDeath.\nThe Red Army Faction's second generation made several attempts to free Ensslin and her comrades from prison. One attempt involved the kidnapping of Hanns-Martin Schleyer on 5 September 1977, and a proposed prisoner exchange. When this failed to work, the RAF orchestrated the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181 on 17 October. After the airplane was stormed by a German anti-terrorist unit, Schleyer was killed and put inside the trunk of a car in France.\nHours after the storming, in a night that became known as \"Death Night of Stammheim\", Ensslin, Baader, and Jan-Carl Raspe were found dead in the high security block of Stammheim Prison in Stuttgart. Like Meinhof, Ensslin was found dead by hanging in her cell. Baader and Raspe were found shot. A fourth member, Irmgard M\u00f6ller, allegedly stabbed herself four times in the chest with a stolen knife. She recovered from her wounds and has since stated that the deaths were not suicides but extrajudicial killings undertaken by the government of the time, a claim strongly denied by the governments former and present. One exhaustive study of the RAF by Stefan Aust (revised in 2009 as \"Baader-Meinhof: the inside story of the RAF\") ultimately accepts the state's official ruling that the deaths were suicides, while highlighting serious shortcomings in the investigations.\nOn 27 October 1977, Ensslin was buried in a common grave with Baader and Raspe in the Dornhalden Cemetery in Stuttgart.\nIn film.\nIn 1981, Margarethe von Trotta's feature film \"Marianne and Juliane\" presented a fictionalised portrayal of an incarcerated Ensslin (Barbara Sukowa) and her sister (Jutta Lampe).\nIn 1986, Sabine Wegner played Ensslin in Reinhard Hauff's \"Stammheim\", a detailed account of the trial against Ensslin, Baader, Meinhof and others.\nAlso in 1986, Corinna Kirchhoff played Ensslin in Markus Imhoof's \"The Journey\" (\"Die Reise\"), based on the memoirs of Ensslin's companion Bernward Vesper.\nIn 1997, Anya Hoffmann was Ensslin in Heinrich Breloer's award-winning TV docudrama \"Death Game\".\nIn 2008, Ensslin was portrayed by Johanna Wokalek in Uli Edel's \"The Baader Meinhof Complex\", an adaptation of the non-fiction book of the same name by Stefan Aust. Wokalek's performance in the film was rewarded with a nomination for the German Film Award 2009 and a Bambi award as best German actress. The film was chosen as Germany's submission to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, and was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for the 66th Golden Globe Awards.\nIn February 2011, Andres Veiel's feature film \"If Not Us, Who?\", in which Lena Lauzemis plays Gudrun Ensslin, won the Alfred Bauer Prize and the Prize of the German Art House Cinemas at the Berlin International Film Festival.\nIn theatre.\nEnsslin appears as a character in Elfriede Jelinek's play \"Ulrike Maria Stuart\".\nHer writings feature in German avant-garde composer Helmut Lachenmann's opera \"Das M\u00e4dchen mit den Schwefelh\u00f6lzern\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Active from January 1972 to 1980, the anarchist group was one of the few militant groups at the time in Germany. Although the 2 June Movement did not share the same ideology as the Red Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof Gang), these organizations were allies. The 2 June Movement did not establish as much influence in Germany as their Marxist counterparts, and is best known for kidnapping West Berlin mayoral candidate Peter Lorenz.\nRising from the ashes of political group Kommune 1 and militant group Tupamaros West-Berlin, the 2 June Movement was formed in July 1971. During the trial of Thomas Weissbecker, Michael Baumann, and Georg von Rauch for an assault on Horst Rieck, Baumann and Weissbecker were ordered to be released on bail. When the release was announced, Rauch, who was facing a probable ten-year sentence for other charges, pretended to be Weissbecker, and left the courtroom with Baumann. The two immediately went underground. Once Weissbecker revealed his identity, he was released from custody. Following their escape, the 2 June Movement was formed.\nIn contrast to the Red Army Faction (RAF), the 2 June Movement was anarchist rather than Marxist. The organization derived its name from the date that German university student Benno Ohnesorg was shot by West Berlin Police officer Karl-Heinz Kurras while participating in a protest against the Shah of Iran Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's state visit to Germany, as the demonstrators were attacked by the police. His death ignited the left-wing movement in West Germany, influencing politicians and political activists, and leading to the establishment of violent non-state actors. Although the organization never became as notorious as the RAF, the 2 June Movement was the most prominent in the first phase of German leftist post-World War II militarism.\nFritz Teufel.\nPolitical activist Fritz Teufel became one of the leaders of the 2 June Movement. Originally taking part in Kommune 1, his comical take on revolutionary activity had him dubbed \"fun guerilla\" by himself and the general public. In 1967, Teufel became a quasi-icon in West Germany after being arrested. Charged with treason and the attempted assassination of United States Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Teufel was eventually acquitted. His humorous image was constructed following his arrest, as he and his associates were brought into questioning with a flour-pudding-yogurt concoction that was to be used as a \"bomb\". On 2 June 1967, Teufel was arrested again, this time falsely accused of throwing a rock at police and provoking the riot at which Benno Ohnesorg was killed. This time, he served six months in jail.\nIn 1975, Teufel was arrested and charged with kidnapping Peter Lorenz, spending five years in pre-trial detention. When he came to trial, he was able to prove he was working in a toilet seat factory at the time, yet was still convicted of various charges and given a sentence of five years, which he had already served.\nAlthough the 2 June Movement never developed a clear ideology or purpose for its existence, Teufel's political activism was rooted in his hatred for his parents' generation. Just like many students and activists of his age, Teufel was angered by the Nazi regime of the previous generation, and fought to eliminate that image from Germany. Much of the resentment was directed towards those who had played a role in the Nazi regime, especially those who had never taken any responsibility for their actions.\nBombings, kidnappings, and other violent acts.\nAside from the kidnapping of Peter Lorenz, the group is known for many other attacks. The 2 June Movement predominantly used firearms when carrying out their attacks, but also used explosive devices.\nOn 4 December 1971 during a massive search throughout the city of West Berlin following the discovery of a Red Army Faction safe house, three members of the 2 June Movement got into a shootout with a plainclothes policeman. George von Rauch was killed, while Michael Baumann and another guerrilla managed to escape. Before this confrontation they had carried out an assault on Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin a month prior.\nOn 2 February 1972, the 2 June Movement declared responsibility for a bombing at the Deutsch-Britischer Yacht Club in West Berlin. The attack, which killed the German club boatman, was later found out to be an act of assistance for the Irish Republican Army. During the trial, which took place in February 1974, 2 June Movement and other militants started a riot at the court's exterior.\nOn 2 March 1972 Thomas Weisbecker was killed in Augsburg, Germany during a shootout with two Munich policeman.\nOn the fifth anniversary of Benno Ohnesorg's death, a bomb exploded in West Berlin. To this day, no group has taken responsibility for the bombing, although it was inferred that attack was the action of 2 June Movement.\nIn West Berlin on 27 July 1973, the 2 June Movement stole 200,000 Deutsch Marks from a local bank.\nIn mid-1974, 2 June Movement member Ulrich Schm\u00fccker was shot to death by others in the organization. Although it is not clear what the rationale was for the shooting, Schm\u00fccker was believed to be an informant. The opposing argument was that the murder was an accident.\nAfter Red Army Faction member Holger Meins died of starvation in prison in 1974, the 2 June Movement attempted a kidnapping of Superior Court Justice G\u00fcnter von Drenkmann, who was killed in the process.\nArrests and escapes.\nThroughout the course of the organization's history, several notable arrests resulted in the imprisonment of 2 June Movement members.\nAssociate Till Meyer was taken into custody after a 29 March 1972 shooting in Bielefeld at which no one was wounded. By December, he was convicted of the attempted murder of a policeman, and imprisoned for three years.\nOn 19 April 1972 four hundred police raid the Georg von Rauch Haus. Evidence related to recent bombings were discovered, but members of the 2 June Movement who had been living there were elsewhere at the time of the raid. Twenty-seven people were taken in for questioning.\nLater that June, Bernhard Braun was discovered and arrested for his activity in violent attacks, along with Red Army Faction member Brigitte Mohnhaupt.\nIn 1973, 2 June Movement member Gabi Kr\u00f6cher-Tiedemann was arrested after shooting a policeman and sentenced to eight years in prison. She was set free in 1975 as a part of the bargain in the Peter Lorenz kidnapping.\nWithin a few months of each other in late 1973, Inge Viett and Till Meyer escaped from prison.\nKidnapping of Peter Lorenz.\nThree days before mayoral election in West Berlin in 1975, candidate Peter Lorenz of the Christian Democratic Union party was kidnapped by 2 June Movement members. Lorenz was cornered while on the road, and was thrown into another vehicle after his driver was knocked unconscious from the vehicle collision involving the kidnappers. In an effort to free several imprisoned Red Army Faction and 2 June Movement affiliates, the extremists publicized a photo which showed Lorenz with a sign around his neck that read \"Peter Lorenz, prisoner of the 2nd June Movement\". The photo also contained a message that demanded the release of Gabriele Kr\u00f6cher-Tiedemann, Horst Mahler, Ingrid Siepmann, Rolf Heissler, Rolf Pohle, and Verena Becker from prison. Along with the release of these members, 2 June Movement also demanded that a jet be provided to fly the radicals out to Aden located in South Yemen, and 9,000 German marks should be given to the 2 June Movement. The West German government met their demands, releasing all but Horst Mahler, who did not want to be set free. On 5 March 1975 Peter Lorenz was released at midnight, six hours after the West German Government had fulfilled the demands made by his abductors. He was dropped off in Wilmersdorf district, walked to a telephone booth, and called his wife, Marianne, to tell her that their six-day ordeal was over.\nDissolution.\nOn 2 June 1980, the 2 June Movement declared that they had disbanded and merged with the Red Army Faction in a letter to the German daily newspaper, Frankfurter Rundschau. Anti-imperialism was a common cause that brought the 2 June Movement to join forces with the Red Army Faction. The 2 June movement ended their statement with \"Unity in the Anti-Imperialist Armed Struggle\" conveying their solidarity with the Red Army Faction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Joffe. The film stars Allen as Alvy Singer, who tries to figure out the reasons for the failure of his relationship with the eponymous female lead, played by Diane Keaton in a role written specifically for her.\nPrincipal photography for the film began on May 19, 1976, on the South Fork of Long Island, and continued periodically for the next ten months. Allen has described the result, which marked his first collaboration with cinematographer Gordon Willis, as \"a major turning point\", in that, unlike the farces and comedies that were his work to that point, it introduced a new level of seriousness. Academics have noted the contrast in the settings of New York City and Los Angeles, the stereotype of gender differences in sexuality, the presentation of Jewish identity, and the elements of psychoanalysis and modernism.\n\"Annie Hall\" was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival on March 27, 1977, before its official release in the United States on April 20, 1977. The film received widespread critical acclaim, and was nominated for the Big Five Academy Awards, winning four: the Academy Award for Best Picture, two for Allen (Best Director and, with Brickman, Best Original Screenplay), and Best Actress for Keaton. The film additionally won four BAFTA Awards, including Best Film, Best Direction (for Allen), Best Screenplay (for both Allen and Brickman) and Best Actress in a Leading Role (for Keaton), in addition to the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical (for Keaton). The film's box office receipts in the United States and Canada of $38,251,425 are fourth-best of Allen's works when not adjusted for inflation.\nRegarded among the greatest films ever made, it ranks 31st on AFI's list of the 100 greatest films in American cinema, 4th on their list of the greatest comedy films and 28th on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\". Film critic Roger Ebert called it \"just about everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie\". The film's screenplay was also named the funniest ever written by the Writers Guild of America in its list of the \"101 Funniest Screenplays\". In 1992, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". It is also regarded by critics as a landmark \"transitional\" film in Allen's career, moving his work from more \"accessible\" and surreal parody towards more \"naturalistic\" comic filmmaking.\nPlot.\nComedian Alvy Singer is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall ended a year earlier. Growing up in Brooklyn, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, and was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity, suddenly kissing a classmate at six years old and not understanding why she was not keen to reciprocate.\nAnnie and Alvy, waiting in a movie theater line to see \"The Sorrow and the Pity\", overhear another man deriding the work of Federico Fellini and referencing Marshall McLuhan. Alvy imagines McLuhan himself stepping in at his invitation to criticize the man's comprehension of his work. That night, Annie shows no interest in sex with Alvy. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whom he devalued because of her interest in him. His second marriage was to a New York writer who did not share his enthusiasm for sports and was unable to reach orgasm.\nWith Annie, it is different. The two of them have fun cooking a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. They had met playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk leads her to offer him a ride uptown, and then a glass of wine on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in \"mental subtitles\" as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a nightclub (\"It Had to Be You\"). After having sex that night, Alvy is \"a wreck\", while Annie relaxes with a joint.\nSoon, Annie admits she loves Alvy, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love. When Annie moves in with him, things become very tense. Eventually, Alvy finds her arm-in-arm with one of her adult-education professors, and the two begin to argue about whether this is the \"flexibility\" they had discussed. They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, and imagining a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon Annie portrayed as the Evil Queen in \"Snow White\".\nAlvy attempts a return to dating, but the effort is marred by neurosis and an underwhelming sexual encounter that is interrupted when Annie calls in the middle of the night, urging him to come over immediately to kill a spider in her bathroom. A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together, come what may. However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken and unbridgeable divide. When Alvy accepts an offer to present an award on television, they travel to Los Angeles with Alvy's friend Rob. However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working. After losing Annie to her record producer Tony Lacey, Alvy unsuccessfully tries to rekindle the flame with a marriage proposal. Back in New York, he stages a play of their relationship, but he changes the ending: now she accepts.\nThe last meeting between Annie and Alvy takes place on Manhattan's Upper West Side after they have both moved on to someone new. Alvy's voice returns with the summation that though relationships are irrational, crazy, and absurd, we just need to have them. Annie sings \"Seems Like Old Times\".\nCast.\nTruman Capote has a cameo in the film. Alvy is making quips about people walking by. He says, \"There's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest\" as Capote walks through the frame. Several actors who later gained a higher profile had small parts in the film: John Glover as Annie's actor boyfriend, Jerry; Jeff Goldblum as a man who \"forgot [his] mantra\" at Tony Lacey's Christmas party; Beverly D'Angelo as an actress in Rob's TV show; and Sigourney Weaver, in her film debut, in the closing sequence as Alvy's date at the movie theater. Shelley Hack has a brief role, and Laurie Bird also appears, two years before her suicide.\nStyle and technique.\nTechnically, the film marked an advance for the director. He selected Gordon Willis as his cinematographer\u2014for Allen \"a very important teacher\" and a \"technical wizard\", saying, \"I really count \"Annie Hall\" as the first step toward maturity in some way in making films\". At the time, it was considered an \"odd pairing\" by many, Keaton among them. The director was known for his comedies and farces, while Willis was known as \"the prince of darkness\" for work on dramatic films like \"The Godfather\" (1972). Despite this, the two became friends during filming and continued the collaboration on several later films, including \"Zelig\" (1983), which earned Willis his first Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.\nWillis described the production for the film as \"relatively easy\". He shot in varying styles; \"hot golden light for California, grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for\u00a0... dream sequences,\" most of which were cut. It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual split screen method. He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Roger Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: \"Few viewers probably notice how much of \"Annie Hall\" consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be\u00a0... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship.\" He cites a study that calculated the average shot length of \"Annie Hall\" to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4\u20137 seconds. Peter Cowie suggests that \"Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained.\" Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation in the use of the split-screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.\nAlthough the film is not essentially experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one scene, Allen's character, in line to see a movie with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off-camera to correct the man's errors personally. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, \"mental subtitles\" convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene\u2014with artwork based on the comic strip \"Inside Woody Allen\"\u2014depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from \"Snow White\". Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the \"fourth wall\" is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another, he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable \"wish-fulfillment\". Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, \"because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them.\"\nProduction.\nWriting.\nThe idea for what became \"Annie Hall\" was developed as Allen walked around New York City with co-writer Marshall Brickman. The pair discussed the project frequently, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on a man in his forties, someone whose life consisted \"of several strands\". One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of the life that we all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find out what kind of character he had. Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that \"advancing age\" and \"worries about death\" had influenced Allen's philosophical, personal approach to complement his \"commercial side\". Allen made the conscious decision to \"sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings\". He recognized that for the first time he had the courage to abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience. He was also influenced by Federico Fellini's comedy drama \"8\u00bd\" (1963), created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director's psychoanalysis.\nBrickman and Allen sent the screenplay back and forth until they were ready to ask United Artists for $4\u00a0million. Many elements from the early drafts did not survive. It was originally a drama centered on a murder mystery with a comic and romantic subplot. According to Allen, the murder occurred after a scene that remains in the film, the sequence in which Annie and Alvy miss the Ingmar Bergman film \"Face to Face\" (1976). Although they decided to drop the murder plot, Allen and Brickman made a murder mystery many years later: \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" (1993), also starring Diane Keaton. The draft that Allen presented to the film's editor, Ralph Rosenblum, concluded with the words, \"ending to be shot.\"\nAllen suggested \"Anhedonia\", a term for the inability to experience pleasure, as a working title, and Brickman suggested alternatives including \"It Had to Be Jew\", \"Rollercoaster Named Desire\" and \"Me and My Goy\". An advertising agency, hired by United Artists, embraced Allen's choice of an obscure word by suggesting the studio take out newspaper advertisements that looked like fake tabloid headlines such as \"Anhedonia Strikes Cleveland!\" However, Allen experimented with several titles over five test screenings, including \"Anxiety\" and \"Annie and Alvy\", before settling on \"Annie Hall\".\nCasting.\nSeveral references in the film to Allen's own life have invited speculation that it is autobiographical. Both Alvy and Allen were comedians. His birthday appears on the blackboard in a school scene, and \"Alvy\" was one of Allen's childhood nicknames; certain features of his childhood are found in Alvy Singer's; Allen went to New York University and so did Alvy. Diane Keaton's real surname is \"Hall\" and \"Annie\" was her nickname, and she and Allen were once romantically involved. However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions. \"The stuff that people insist is autobiographical is almost invariably not,\" Allen said. \"It's so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people upon whom these little nuances are based. People got it into their heads that \"Annie Hall\" was autobiographical, and I couldn't convince them it wasn't\". Contrary to various interviewers and commentators, he says, Alvy is not the character that is closest to himself; he identified more with the mother (Eve, played by Geraldine Page) in his next film, \"Interiors\". Despite this, Keaton has stated that the relationship between Alvy and Annie was partly based on her relationship with the director.\nThe role of Annie Hall was written specifically for Keaton, who had worked with Allen on \"Play It Again, Sam\" (1972), \"Sleeper\" (1973) and \"Love and Death\" (1975). She considered the character an \"affable version\" of herself\u2014both were \"semi-articulate, dreamed of being a singer and suffered from insecurity\"\u2014and was surprised to win an Oscar for her performance. The film also marks the second film collaboration between Allen and Tony Roberts, their previous project being \"Play It Again, Sam\".\nFederico Fellini was Allen's first choice to appear in the cinema lobby scene because his films were under discussion, but Allen chose cultural academic Marshall McLuhan after both Fellini and Luis Bu\u00f1uel declined the cameo. Some cast members, biographer John Baxter claims, were aggrieved at Allen's treatment of them. The director \"acted coldly\" towards McLuhan, who had to return from Canada for reshooting, and Mordecai Lawner, who played Alvy's father, claimed that Allen never spoke to him. However, during the production, Allen began a two-year relationship with Stacey Nelkin, who appears in a single scene.\nFilming, editing and music.\nPrincipal photography began on May 19, 1976, on the South Fork of Long Island with the scene in which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically for the next ten months, and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he \"saw this roller-coaster, and\u00a0... saw the house under it. And I thought, we have to use this.\" Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.\nEditor Ralph Rosenblum's first assembly of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. \"I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions\", Brickman recalled. \"It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled.\" Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes, as \"the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life and in the process satirizing much of our culture... a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of \"Take the Money and Run\"\". Brickman found it \"nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise.\" He suggested a more linear narrative.\nThe present-tense relationship between Alvy and Annie was not the narrative focus of this first cut, but Allen and Rosenblum recognized it as the dramatic spine, and began reworking the film \"in the direction of that relationship\". Rosenblum recalled that Allen \"had no hesitation about trimming away much of the first twenty minutes in order to establish Keaton more quickly.\" According to Allen, \"I didn't sit down with Marshall Brickman and say, 'We're going to write a picture about a relationship.' I mean the whole concept of the picture changed as we were cutting it.\"\nAs the film was budgeted for two weeks of post-production photography, late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but only some of this material was used. The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.\nThe credits call the film \"A Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe Production\"; the two men were Allen's managers and received this same credit on his films from 1969 to 1993. However, for this film, Joffe took producer credit and therefore received the Academy Award for Best Picture. The title sequence features a black background with white text in the Windsor Light Condensed typeface, a design that Allen used on his subsequent films. Stig Bj\u00f6rkman sees some similarity to Ingmar Bergman's simple and consistent title design, although Allen says that his own choice is a cost-saving device.\nVery little background music is heard in the film, a departure for Allen influenced by Ingmar Bergman. Diane Keaton performs twice in the jazz club: \"It Had to be You\" and \"Seems Like Old Times\" (the latter reprises in voiceover on the closing scene). The other exceptions include a boy's choir \"Christmas Medley\" played while the characters drive through Los Angeles, the Molto allegro from Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (heard as Annie and Alvy drive through the countryside), Tommy Dorsey's performance of \"Sleepy Lagoon\", and the anodyne cover of the Savoy Brown song \"A Hard Way to Go\" playing at a party in the mansion of Paul Simon's character.\nRelease.\n\"Annie Hall\" was shown at the Los Angeles Film Festival on March 27, 1977, before its official release in the United States on April 20, 1977. The film ultimately earned $38,251,425 ($ million in 2024 dollars) in the United States and Canada against a $4-million budget, making it the 11th highest-grossing picture of 1977. On raw figures, it currently ranks as Allen's fourth-highest-grossing film in the United States, after \"Manhattan\", \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" and \"Midnight in Paris\"; when adjusted for inflation, the gross figure makes it Allen's biggest box office hit. It played for over 100 consecutive weeks in London and grossed over $5.6 million in the United Kingdom. It was first released on Blu-ray on January 24, 2012, alongside Allen's film \"Manhattan\" (1979). Both releases include their original theatrical trailers.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Annie Hall\" met with widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with major praise directed towards the film's script and the performances of Allen and Keaton.\nTim Radford of \"The Guardian\" called the film \"Allen's most closely focused and daring film to date\". \"The New York Times\"' Vincent Canby preferred \"Annie Hall\" to Allen's second directorial effort, \"Take the Money and Run\", since the former is more \"humane\" while the latter is more a \"cartoon\". Several critics have compared the film favorably to Bergman's \"Scenes from a Marriage\" (1973), including Joseph McBride in \"Variety\", who found it Allen's \"most three-dimensional film to date\" with an ambition equal to Bergman's best even as the co-stars become the \"contemporary equivalent of\u00a0... Tracy-Hepburn.\"\nMore critically, Peter Cowie commented that the film \"suffers from its profusion of cultural references and asides\". Writing for \"New York\" magazine, John Simon called the film \"unfunny comedy, poor moviemaking, and embarrassing self-revelation\", and wrote that Keaton's performance was \"in bad taste to watch and indecency to display\", saying that the part should have been played by Robin Mary Paris, the actress who appears briefly in the scene where Alvy Singer has written a two-character play nakedly based on himself and Annie Hall. Simon's review of \"Annie Hall \" concluded: \"It is a film so shapeless, sprawling, repetitious, and aimless as to seem to beg for oblivion. At this, it is successful.\"\nThe film has continued to receive positive reviews. In his 2002 lookback, Roger Ebert added it to his Great Movies list and commented with surprise that the film had \"an instant familiarity\" despite its age, and \"Slant\" writer Jaime N. Christley found the one-liners \"still gut-busting after 35 years\". A later \"Guardian\" critic, Peter Bradshaw, named it the best comedy film of all time, commenting that \"this wonderfully funny, unbearably sad film is a miracle of comic writing and inspired film-making\". John Marriott of the \"Radio Times\" believed that \"Annie Hall\" was the film where Allen \"found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection\", referring to the \"comic delight\" derived from the \"spirited playing of Diane Keaton as the kooky innocent from the Midwest, and Woody himself as the fumbling New York neurotic\". \"Empire\" magazine rated the movie five out of five stars, calling it a \"classic\". In 2017, Claire Dederer wrote, \"\"Annie Hall\" is the greatest comic film of the twentieth century [...] because it acknowledges the irrepressible nihilism that lurks at the center of all comedy.\"\nThe Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited \"Annie Hall\" as one of his favorite films.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 97% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 9.10/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, \"Annie Hall\" represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 20 critical reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nCritical analysis.\nLove and sexuality.\nSociologists Virginia Rutter and Pepper Schwartz consider Alvy and Annie's relationship to be a stereotype of gender differences in sexuality. The nature of love is a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as \"the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on.\" Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise of his relationship with Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that \"It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades\", a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable. By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately \"irrational and crazy and absurd\", but a necessity of life. Christopher Knight believes Alvy's quest upon meeting Annie is carnal, whereas hers is on an emotional note.\nRichard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" notes the film's \"Eurocentric art-house self-awareness\" and Alvy Singer's \"psychoanalytic obsession in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions\".\nJewish identity.\nSinger is identified with the stereotypical neurotic Jewish male, and the differences between Alvy and Annie are often related to the perceptions and realities of Jewish identity. Vincent Brook notes that \"Alvy dines with the WASP-y Hall family and imagines that they must see him as a Hasidic Jew, complete with payot (ear locks) and a large black hat.\" Robert M. Seltzer and Norman J. Cohen highlight the scene in which Annie remarks that Annie's grandmother \"hates Jews. She thinks they just make money, but she's the one. Is she ever, I'm telling you.\", revealing the hypocrisy in her grandmother's stereotypical American view of Jews by arguing that \"no stigma attaches to the love of money in America\". Bernd Herzogenrath also considers Allen's joke, \"I would like to but we need the eggs\", to the doctor at the end when he suggests putting him in a mental institution, to be a paradox of not only the persona of the urban neurotic Jew but also of the film itself.\nWoody Allen persona.\nChristopher Knight points out that \"Annie Hall\" is framed through Alvy's experiences. \"Generally, what we know about Annie and about the relationship comes filtered through Alvy, an intrusive narrator capable of halting the narrative and stepping out from it in order to entreat the audience's interpretative favor.\" He suggests that because Allen's films blur the protagonist with \"past and future protagonists as well as with the director himself\", it \"makes a difference as to whether we are most responsive to the director's or the character's framing of events\". Despite the narrative's framing, \"the joke is on Alvy.\" Emanuel Levy believes that Alvy Singer became synonymous with the public perception of Woody Allen in the United States. \"Annie Hall\" is viewed as the definitive Woody Allen film in displaying neurotic humor.\nLocation.\n\"Annie Hall\" \"is as much a love song to New York City as it is to the character,\" reflecting Allen's adoration of the island of Manhattan. It was a relationship he explored repeatedly, particularly in films like \"Manhattan\" (1979) and \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986). Annie Hall's apartment, which still exists on East 70th Street between Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue, is by Allen's own confession his favorite block in the city. Peter Cowie argues that the film shows \"a romanticized view\" of the borough, with the camera \"linger[ing] on the Upper East Side [... and where] the fear of crime does not trouble its characters.\" By contrast, California is presented less positively, and David Halle notes the obvious \"invidious intellectual comparison\" between New York City and Los Angeles. While Manhattan's movie theaters show classic and foreign films, Los Angeles theaters run less-prestigious fare such as \"The House of Exorcism\" and \"Messiah of Evil\". Rob's demonstration of adding canned laughter to television demonstrates the \"cynical artifice of the medium\". New York City serves as a symbol of Alvy's personality (\"gloomy, claustrophobic, and socially cold, but also an intellectual haven full of nervous energy\") while Los Angeles is a symbol of freedom for Annie.\nPsychoanalysis and modernism.\n\"Annie Hall\" has been cited as a film which uses both therapy and analysis for comic effect. Sam B. Girgus considers \"Annie Hall\" to be a story about memory and retrospection, which \"dramatizes a return via narrative desire to the repressed and the unconscious in a manner similar to psychoanalysis\". He argues that the film constitutes a self-conscious assertion of how narrative desire and humor interact in the film to reform ideas and perceptions and that Allen's deployment of Freudian concepts and humor forms a \"pattern of skepticism toward surface meaning that compels further interpretation\". Girgus believes that proof of the pervasiveness of Sigmund Freud in the film is demonstrated at the beginning through a reference to a joke in \"Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious\", and makes another joke about a psychiatrist and patient, which Girgus argues is also symbolic of the dynamic between humor and the unconscious in the film. Further Freudian concepts are later addressed in the film with Annie's recall of a dream to her psychoanalyst in which Frank Sinatra is smothering her with a pillow, which alludes to Freud's belief in dreams as \"visual representations of words or ideas\".\nPeter Bailey in his book \"The Reluctant Film Art of Woody Allen\", argues that Alvy displays a \"genial denigration of art\" which contains a \"significant equivocation\", in that in his self-deprecation he invites the audience to believe that he is leveling with them. Bailey argues that Allen's devices in the film, including the subtitles which reveal Annie's and Alvy's thoughts \"extend and reinforce \"Annie Hall\"'s winsome ethos of plain-dealing and ingenuousness\". He muses that the film is full of antimimetic emblems such as McLuhan's magical appearance which provide quirky humor and that the \"disparity between mental projections of reality and actuality\" drives the film. His view is that self-reflective cinematic devices intelligently dramatize the difference between surface and substance, with visual emblems \"incessantly distilling the distinction between the world mentally constructed and reality\".\nIn his discussion of the film's relation to modernism, Thomas Schatz finds the film an unresolved \"examination of the process of human interaction and interpersonal communication\" and \"immediately establishes [a] self-referential stance\" that invites the spectator \"to read the narrative as something other than a sequential development toward some transcendent truth\". For him, Alvy \"is the victim of a tendency toward overdetermination of meaning \u2013 or in modernist terms 'the tyranny of the signified' \u2013 and his involvement with Annie can be viewed as an attempt to establish a spontaneous, intellectually unencumbered relationship, an attempt which is doomed to failure.\"\nAccolades and recognition.\n\"Annie Hall\" won four Oscars at the 50th Academy Awards on April 3, 1978, and was nominated for five (the Big Five) in total. Producer Charles H. Joffe received the statue for Best Picture, Allen for Best Director and, with Brickman, for Best Original Screenplay, and Keaton for Best Actress. Allen was also nominated for Best Actor. Many had expected \"Star Wars\" to win the major awards, including Brickman and executive producer Robert Greenhut.\nThe film was also honored five times at the BAFTA awards. Along with the top award for Best Film and the award for Best Editing, Keaton won for Best Actress, Allen won for Best Direction and Best Original Screenplay alongside Brickman. The film received one Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical (Keaton), in addition to four nominations: Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (the latter three for Allen).\nIn 1992, the United States' Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in its National Film Registry that includes \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" films. The film is often mentioned among the greatest comedies of all time. The American Film Institute lists it 31st in American cinema history. In 2000, they named it second greatest romantic comedy in American cinema. Keaton's performance of \"Seems Like Old Times\" was ranked 90th on their list of greatest songs included in a film, and her line \"La-dee-da, la-dee-da.\" was named the 55th greatest movie quote. The screenplay was named the sixth greatest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America, West while IGN named it the seventh greatest comedy film of all time. In 2000, readers of \"Total Film\" magazine voted it the forty-second greatest comedy film of all time, and the seventh greatest romantic comedy film of all time. Several lists ranking Allen's best films have put \"Annie Hall\" among his greatest work.\nIn June 2008, AFI revealed its 10 Top 10\u2014the best ten films in ten classic American film genres\u2014after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community and \"Annie Hall\" was placed second in the romantic comedy genre. AFI also ranked \"Annie Hall\" on several other lists. In November 2008, \"Annie Hall\" was voted in at No. 68 on \"Empire\" magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". It is also ranked No. 2 on Rotten Tomatoes' 25 Best Romantic Comedies, second only to \"The Philadelphia Story\".\nIn 2012, the film was listed as the 127th best film of all time by the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" critics' poll. The film was also named the 132nd best film by the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" directors' poll. In 2022, it dropped to 243rd in the main poll, tied with 21 other films. It did not appear in the top 100 films in that year's directors' poll.\nIn October 2013, the film was voted by the \"Guardian\" readers as the second best film directed by Woody Allen. In November 2015, the film was named the funniest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America in its list of \"101 Funniest Screenplays\".\nAmerican Film Institute recognition.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n1992 \u2013 National Film Registry.\nIn 2006, \"Premiere\" magazine ranked Keaton in Annie Hall as 60th in its list of the \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time\", and noted:\nIt's hard to play ditzy. ... The genius of Annie is that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she's also a complicated, intelligent woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, especially when she yammers away on a first date with Alvy (Woody Allen), while the subtitle reads, \"He probably thinks I'm a yoyo.\" Yo-yo? Hardly.\nLegacy and influence.\nAlthough the film received widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, and said in an interview, \"When \"Annie Hall\" started out, that film was not supposed to be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind\u00a0... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about\u00a0... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie\". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that \"Sequelism has become an annoying thing. I don't think Francis Coppola should have done \"Godfather III\" because \"Godfather II\" was quite great. When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much\".\nDiane Keaton has stated that Annie Hall was her favorite role and that the film meant everything to her. When asked if being most associated with the role concerned her as an actress, she replied, \"I'm not haunted by Annie Hall. I'm happy to be Annie Hall. If somebody wants to see me that way, it's fine by me\". Costume designer Ruth Morley, working with Keaton, created a look which had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with women adopting the style: layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, a man's tie, and boots. The look was often referred to as the \"\"Annie Hall\" look\". Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film. Morley and Keaton may have been aware that an oversized menswear look for women was popular in Paris at about the same time, inspired by designer Kenzo, who had been responsible for the move toward oversized clothes a few years earlier; the esthetic was in the air at the time. Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton's dress style almost did not end up in the film. \"She came in,\" he recalled in 1992, \"and the costume lady on \"Annie Hall\" said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that. It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'\"\nThe film's script topped the Writers Guild of America's list of 101 funniest screenplays ever, surpassing \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), \"Groundhog Day\" (1993), \"Airplane!\" (1980), and \"Tootsie\" (1982). James Bernardoni states that the film is \"one of the very few romantic comedy-dramas of the New Hollywood era and one that has rightly taken its place among the classics of that revered genre\", likening the seriocomic meditation on the couple relationship to George Cukor's \"Adam's Rib\" (1949), starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Since its release, other romantic comedies have inspired comparison. \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (1989), \"Chasing Amy\" (1997), \"Burning Annie\" (2007), \"500 Days of Summer\" (2009) and Allen's 2003 film, \"Anything Else\", are among them, while film director Rian Johnson said in an interview for the book, \"The Film That Changed My Life\", that \"Annie Hall\" inspired him to become a film director. Karen Gillan stated that she watched \"Annie Hall\" as part of her research for her lead role in \"Not Another Happy Ending\". In 2018, Matt Starr and Ellie Sachs released a short film remake starring senior citizens.\nNote.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was shot by Jules Buck. It was released in the US in 1945 but shown to US troops earlier.\nHuston and his crew\u2014which included the British novelist and screenwriter Eric Ambler\u2014were attached to the U.S. Army\u2019s 143rd Regiment of the 36th Division. Unlike with many other military documentaries, it was claimed Huston\u2019s cameramen filmed alongside the infantrymen as they fought their way up the hills to reach San Pietro. However, Huston's claim that the film was made during the battle was proven false by the research of Peter Maslowski in his 1993 book, \"Armed With Cameras\".\nProduction.\nThe film was made to be intentionally more realistic than other examples of its genre. One scene includes close-up views of the faces of dead soldiers as they are being loaded into body bags, a level of realism unheard of in both fictional portrayals as well as newsreel footage of the time.\nThe United States Army delayed its release to the public because it showed dead GIs wrapped in mattress covers; some officers tried to prevent soldiers in training from seeing it, for fear of damaging morale. General George Marshall came to Huston and took the film's defense, stating that because of the film's gritty realism, it would make a good training film. The depiction of death would inspire soldiers to take their training more seriously.\nHuston quickly became unpopular with the Army, not only for the film but also for his response to the accusation that the film was anti-war. Huston responded that if he ever made a pro-war film, he should be shot. The film was screened to U.S. troops in North Africa in 1944, where John Horne Burns described it in a letter as \"almost more than any heart can stand\". Huston was no longer considered a pariah; he was decorated and eventually promoted to major.\nReception.\nIn 1991, \"The Battle of San Pietro\" was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2005.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her parents were actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and his wife, actress Muriel Beaumont. Her grandfather George du Maurier was a writer and cartoonist.\nAlthough du Maurier is classed as a romantic novelist, her stories have been described as \"moody and resonant\" with overtones of the paranormal. Her bestselling works were not at first taken seriously by critics, but have since earned an enduring reputation for narrative craft. Many have been successfully adapted into films, including the novels \"Rebecca\", \"Frenchman's Creek\", \"My Cousin Rachel\" and \"Jamaica Inn\", and the short stories \"The Birds\" and \"Don't Look Now\". Du Maurier spent much of her life in Cornwall, where most of her works are set. As her fame increased, she became more reclusive.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nDaphne du Maurier was born on 13 May 1907 at 24 Cumberland Terrace, Regent's Park, London, the middle of three daughters of prominent actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and actress Muriel Beaumont. Her paternal grandfather was author and \"Punch\" cartoonist George du Maurier, who created the character of Svengali in the 1894 novel \"Trilby\". Her paternal uncle Guy du Maurier was a playwright. Her mother was a paternal niece of journalist, author, and lecturer Comyns Beaumont. Her elder sister, Angela du Maurier, became an actress and later also a writer, and her younger sister Jeanne du Maurier was a painter. She was a first cousin of the Llewelyn Davies boys, who were J. M. Barrie's inspiration for the characters in the play \"Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\". She was also a cousin of director Gabrielle Beaumont.\nAs a child, du Maurier met many prominent theatre actors, because of the celebrity of her father. On meeting Tallulah Bankhead, du Maurier was quoted as saying that Bankhead was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen.\nDu Maurier spent her childhood at Cannon Hall, Hampstead, the family's London residence, and summers at their home in Fowey, Cornwall, where they also lived during the war years.\nPersonal life.\nDu Maurier married Major (later Lieutenant-General) Frederick \"Boy\" Browning in 1932. They had three children:\nShe was known as Daphne du Maurier from 1907 to 1932, when she married Frederick Browning. Still writing as Daphne du Maurier during her marriage, she was also known as Lady Browning after her husband was knighted in 1946.\nBiographers have claimed that du Maurier's marriage was at times somewhat chilly, and that she could be aloof and distant to her children, especially the girls, when immersed in her writing. She has often been painted as a frostily private recluse who rarely mixed in society or gave interviews, but many people remembered her as a warm and immensely funny person in private who was a welcoming hostess to guests at Menabilly, the house that she had leased for many years, from the Rashleigh family in Cornwall.\nHer husband died in 1965 and soon afterward Daphne moved to Kilmarth, near Par, Cornwall, which became the setting for \"The House on the Strand\", and where she became an early member of Mebyon Kernow, a Cornish nationalist party.\nAn exception to her reticence to give interviews came after the release of the film \"A Bridge Too Far\", based on a book by Cornelius Ryan, in which her late husband was portrayed in a less-than-flattering light. Incensed, she wrote to the national newspapers, decrying what she considered unforgivable treatment. \nShe appeared as a castaway in the BBC Radio programme \"Desert Island Discs\" broadcast on 3 September 1977. Her chosen book was \"The Collected Works of Jane Austen\", and her luxury was whisky and ginger ale.\nWhen she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969, she was titled Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning, DBE, but she never used the title. According to her biographer Margaret Forster, she told no one about the honour, so that even her children learned of it only from the newspapers. \"She thought of pleading illness for the investiture, until her children insisted it would be a great day for the older grandchildren. So she went through with it, though she slipped out quietly afterwards to avoid the attention of the press.\"\nRelationships.\n\"The Daphne du Maurier Companion\", edited by Helen Taylor, includes Taylor's claims that du Maurier confessed to her in 1965 that she had had an incestuous relationship with her father and that he had been a violent alcoholic. Du Maurier stated in her memoirs that because her father had wanted a son, she became a tomboy, in an attempt to get the parental approval she would have had, had she been born a boy.\nIn correspondence that her family released to biographer Margaret Forster, du Maurier explained to a trusted few people that she felt her personality comprised two distinct people \u2013 the loving wife and mother side she showed to the world, and the lover side, a \"decidedly male energy\", hidden from virtually everyone, which was the power behind her artistic creativity. According to Forster's biography, du Maurier believed the \"male energy\" propelled her writing.\nAfter du Maurier's death in 1989, some writers speculated about her alleged intimate physical relationships with a number of women, including Ellen Doubleday, the wife of her U.S. publisher Nelson Doubleday, and the actress Gertrude Lawrence, as detailed in the 2007 BBC Two film, \"Daphne\". The children of both du Maurier and Lawrence have objected strongly to the stories about the alleged relationship between their mothers.\nTwo years after Lawrence died, a biography of her written by her widower, Richard Aldrich, went into detail about a friendship between her and du Maurier that had begun in 1948 when Lawrence had accepted the lead role in du Maurier's new play \"September Tide\". Aldrich said that Lawrence had toured Britain in the play in 1948 and continued with it in London's West End theatre district through 1949, and that later du Maurier visited them at their home in the United States. Aldrich made no mention of a possible same-sex relationship.\nDeath.\nDu Maurier died from heart failure in her sleep on 19 April 1989, aged 81, at her home in Par, Cornwall, which had been the setting for many of her books. Her body was cremated in private and without a memorial service (at her request) and her ashes scattered off the cliffs around Kilmarth and Menabilly, Cornwall.\nWriting career.\nNovels, short stories, and biographies.\nHer family connections helped her establish her literary career, and she published some of her early work in her great-uncle Comyns Beaumont's \"Bystander\" magazine. Her first novel, \"The Loving Spirit,\" was published in 1931.\nThe novel \"Rebecca\" (1938) was du Maurier's most successful work. It was an immediate hit, selling nearly 3 million copies between 1938 and 1965. The novel has never gone out of print. In the United States, du Maurier won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1938, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. In the UK, it was listed at number 14 of the \"nation's best-loved novel\"s on the BBC's 2003 survey The Big Read.\nOther significant works include \"Jamaica Inn\", \"Frenchman's Creek\", \"Hungry Hill\", \"My Cousin Rachel\", \"The Scapegoat\", \"The House on the Strand\", and \"The King's General\". The last is set in Cornwall during the English Civil War, and is written from the Royalist perspective. \nDu Maurier was often categorised as a \"romantic novelist\", a term that she deplored, given that her novels rarely have a happy ending, and often have sinister overtones and shadows of the paranormal. In this light, she has more in common with the \"sensation novels\" of Wilkie Collins and others, which she admired. The critic Kate Kellaway wrote: \"Du Maurier was mistress of calculated irresolution. She did not want to put her readers' minds at rest. She wanted her riddles to persist. She wanted the novels to continue to haunt us beyond their endings.\"\nDu Maurier's novel \"Mary Anne\" (1954) is a fictionalised account of her great-great-grandmother, Mary Anne Clarke n\u00e9e Thompson (1776\u20131852), who, from 1803 to 1808, was mistress of Frederick Augustus, Duke of York and Albany (1763\u20131827). He was the \"Grand Old Duke of York\" of the nursery rhyme, a son of King George III, and brother of King George IV and King William IV. The central character of her last novel, \"Rule Britannia\", is an aging actress, thought to be based on Gladys Cooper (to whom it is dedicated).\nDu Maurier's short stories are darker: \"The Birds\", \"Don't Look Now\", \"The Apple Tree\", and \"The Blue Lenses\" are finely crafted tales of terror that shocked and surprised her audience in equal measure. As her biographer Margaret Forster wrote, \"She satisfied all the questionable criteria of popular fiction, and yet satisfied too the exacting requirements of 'real literature'.\"\nThe discovery, in 2011, of a collection of du Maurier's forgotten short stories, written when the author was 21, provides some insight into her mature style. One of them, \"The Doll\", concerns a young woman's obsession with a mechanical male sex doll; it has been deemed by du Maurier's son Kit Browning to be \"quite ahead of its time\".\nShe also wrote non-fiction, including several biographies such as \"Gerald\", her father's biography. \"The Glass-Blowers\" traces her French Huguenot ancestry and vividly depicts the French Revolution. \"The du Mauriers\" traces the family's move from France to England in the 19th century.\n\"The House on the Strand\" (1969) combines elements of \"mental time-travel\", a tragic love affair in 14th-century Cornwall, and the dangers of using mind-altering drugs. Her final book, \"Rule Britannia\" (1972), was not well-received, her biographer, Margaret Forster, considering it to be the author's poorest novel.\nFilm adaptations.\n\"Rebecca\" has been adapted for both stage and screen several times, most notably by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1940 film \"Rebecca\". Several of du Maurier's other novels have also been adapted for the screen, including \"Jamaica Inn\", \"Frenchman's Creek\", \"Hungry Hill\", and \"My Cousin Rachel\" in both 1952 and 2017. The Hitchcock film \"The Birds\" (1963) is based on a treatment of the short story of that name, as is the film \"Don't Look Now\" (1973). Of the films, du Maurier often complained that the only ones she liked were Hitchcock's \"Rebecca\" and Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now\".\nHitchcock's treatment of \"Jamaica Inn\" was disavowed by both director and author, due to a complete re-write of the ending to accommodate the ego of its star, Charles Laughton. Du Maurier also felt that Olivia de Havilland was wrongly cast as the anti-heroine of \"My Cousin Rachel (1952)\". \"Frenchman's Creek\" fared better in a lavish Technicolor version released in 1944. Du Maurier later regretted her choice of Alec Guinness as the lead in the film of \"The Scapegoat\", which she partly financed.\nPlaywright.\nDu Maurier wrote three plays. Her first was an adaptation of her novel \"Rebecca\", which opened at the Queen's Theatre in London on 5 March 1940 in a production by George Devine, starring Celia Johnson and Owen Nares as the De Winters and Margaret Rutherford as Mrs Danvers. After 181 performances, the production transferred to the Strand Theatre, with Jill Furse taking over as the second Mrs De Winter and Mary Merrall as Mrs Danvers, with a further run of 176 performances.\nIn 1943 she wrote the autobiographically inspired drama \"The Years Between\" about the unexpected return of a senior officer, thought killed in action, who finds that his wife has taken his seat as Member of Parliament (MP) and has started a romantic relationship with a local farmer. It was first staged at the Manchester Opera House in 1944 and then transferred to London, opening at Wyndham's Theatre on 10 January 1945, starring Nora Swinburne and Clive Brook. The production, directed by Irene Hentschel, became a long-running hit, completing 617 performances. It was revived by Caroline Smith at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond upon Thames on 5 September 2007, starring Karen Ascoe and Mark Tandy.\nHer third play, \"September Tide\", portrays a middle-aged woman whose bohemian artist son-in-law falls in love with her. Again directed by Irene Hentschel, it opened at the Aldwych Theatre on 15 December 1948 with Gertrude Lawrence as Stella. It closed in August 1949 after 267 performances.\nAccusations of plagiarism.\nTwo authors accused Du Maurier of plagiarism, but were unable to prove their claims.\n\"Rebecca\".\nShortly after \"Rebecca\" was published in Brazil, critic \u00c1lvaro Lins and other readers pointed out many resemblances to the 1934 book, \"A Sucessora\" (\"The Successor\"), by Brazilian writer Carolina Nabuco. According to Nabuco and her editor, not only the main plot, but also situations and entire dialogues had been copied. Du Maurier denied having copied Nabuco's book, as did her publisher, pointing out that the plot elements said to have been plagiarised were quite common.\nThe controversy was examined in a 2002 article by Larry Rohter in \"The New York Times\". According to Nabuco's memoirs, when the Hitchcock film \"Rebecca\" was first shown in Brazil, United Artists wanted Nabuco to sign a document stating that the similarities were merely a coincidence but she refused. Rohter quotes Nabuco's memoirs as saying, When the film version of 'Rebecca' came to Brazil, the producers' lawyer sought out my lawyer to ask him that I sign a document admitting the possibility of there having been a mere coincidence. I would be compensated with a quantity described as 'of considerable value.' I did not consent, naturally. Rohter remarked: \"Nabuco had translated her novel into French and sent it to a publisher in Paris, who she learned was also Ms. du Maurier's [publisher] only after \"Rebecca\" became a worldwide success. The novels have identical plots and even some identical episodes.\"\n\"The Birds\".\nAuthor Frank Baker's second novel, \"The Birds\", was published by Peter Davies in 1936. Baker stated that it bore some resemblance to \"The Terror\" by Arthur Machen (first published 1917). When Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" was released in 1963, based on \"The Birds\" (1952) by du Maurier, Baker considered litigation against Universal Studios but his legal counsel stated: \"The treatment of the general idea of attacks by birds in the two works is as different as it could be.\"\nDu Maurier denied that she had ever read Baker's book. Some sources claim that Du Maurier was a reader for Davies in 1936, but she was already a successful author by then, and spent most of 1936 in Alexandria with her family.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Islanders compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at UBS Arena. The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the New York metropolitan area, along with the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers, and their fanbase resides primarily on Long Island.\nThe team was founded in 1972 as part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league World Hockey Association (WHA) out of the newly built Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Uniondale, New York. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing 14 straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships between 1980 and 1983, the eighth of nine dynasties recognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships, and to date the last NHL team to achieve a three-peat.\nFollowing the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since 1987\u201388, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the 2016 playoffs. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated to Barclays Center in Brooklyn following the 2014\u201315 season. In the 2018\u201319 and 2019\u201320 seasons, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played all their home games in the 2020\u201321 season at Nassau Coliseum. Their new arena near Belmont Park was opened in 2021.\nTen former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, seven of whom\u2014Mike Bossy, Clark Gillies, Denis Potvin, Billy Smith, Bryan Trottier, coach Al Arbour, and general manager Bill Torrey\u2014were members of all four Cup-winning teams. Post-dynasty players Pat LaFontaine, Roberto Luongo, Pierre Turgeon, and Zdeno Chara were also inducted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe NHL heads to Long Island (1972\u20131974).\nIn fall 1972, the emerging World Hockey Association (WHA) planned to place its New York team, the New York Raiders, in Nassau County's brand-new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. County officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out. William Shea, who had helped bring Major League Baseball's New York Mets to the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted Continental League, the American Football League and the American Basketball Association, his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets (and also with the New York Jets and New York Nets, as a result of those teams' leagues merging with their established rivals).\nIn contrast, Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports, Shea immediately found NHL president Clarence Campbell to be receptive to adding a second team in New York. Nevertheless, the Islanders' bid faced opposition from the New York Rangers, who did not want additional competition in the New York area. Eventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners, Madison Square Garden, to reconsider. Rangers' president Bill Jennings weighed pros and cons. Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area. On the other hand, a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL\u2013WHA merger, a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed. Finally, consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers' fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise, and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the National Football League, Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area.\nDespite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL awarded a Long Island-based franchise to clothing manufacturer Roy Boe, owner of the American Basketball Association's New York Nets, on November 8, 1971. The terms included $6 million ($ million in 2024 dollars) franchise fee plus a $5 million ($ million in 2024 dollars) territorial fee to the Rangers. An expansion franchise was also given to Atlanta (the Flames) to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built Omni Coliseum.\nThe New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February 15, 1972, at a press conference held across the street from Roosevelt Raceway at a restaurant owned by Burt Bacharach. Many expected it to use the \"Long Island Ducks\", after the Eastern Hockey League team that played from 1959 to 1973. The team was soon nicknamed the \"Isles\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to Cherry Hill, New Jersey in the middle of their second season.\nFormer California Golden Seals executive vice president Bill Torrey was named as the team's general manager at the same press conference as the franchise's name unveiling. The Islanders secured veteran forward Ed Westfall, defenseman Gerry Hart, and goaltender Billy Smith in the 1972 expansion draft, along with junior ice hockey stars Billy Harris, Lorne Henning, and Bobby Nystrom in the 1972 amateur draft. Soon after the draft, Phil Goyette was named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with Earl Ingarfield and assistant coach Aut Erickson. Unlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft. Torrey stated, \"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\" Before the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain.\nBy September 1972, the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility \"The Royal Ice Rink\" in Kings Park. The team was forced to practice as late as October 6, the day before their first game, at the Rangers practice rink in New Hyde Park.\nThe Islanders' first win came on October 12, 1972, in a 3\u20132 game against the Los Angeles Kings. In the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. The young and inexperienced expansion team, however, posted a record of 12\u201360\u20136, setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season. A highlight occurred on January 18, 1973, when they defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins 9\u20137.\nFinishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the 1973 draft. Off the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then-unprecedented $11 million in franchise and territorial fees. Montreal Canadiens' general manager Sam Pollock was keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman Denis Potvin, who had been touted as \"the next Bobby Orr\" when he was 14 years old. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick. During the off-season, Torrey convinced former St. Louis Blues coach Al Arbour to come coach the Islanders. Even with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the East Division during the 1973\u201374 season, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973, which also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season.\nAscendancy and playoff inability (1974\u20131979).\nWith the 4th and 22nd picks in the 1974 draft, the Islanders added young forwards Clark Gillies and Bryan Trottier to continue Torrey's building plan. In the 1974\u201375 season, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and Glenn \"Chico\" Resch, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival New York Rangers in a best-of-3 first-round series as J. P. Parise scored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game. In the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series-winning game 7 on a late third-period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the 1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs, 2004 Boston Red Sox, the 2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers, and the 2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings). They were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3\u20130 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers before the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again. Despite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\"\nThe Islanders continued their climb up the standings in 1975\u201376, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league. It was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence. Rookie center Trottier finished the season with 95 points and won the Calder Memorial Trophy; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie. It would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history. Despite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In 1976 and 1977 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Montreal Canadiens. The Canadiens posted a 24\u20133 record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders.\nIn the 1977 draft, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards Mike Bossy and Dwight Foster. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality. Foster was known as a solid checker with marginal offensive ability (despite having led the Ontario Hockey League in scoring). Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check. In the 1977\u201378 season, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, and scored 53 goals that season, a rookie record at the time. The team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships. Six players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them Islanders draft picks, showing the success of the draft building process. The season ended with a familiar result in the playoffs, as the team lost in overtime in game 7 of the quarterfinals against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nIn 1978\u201379, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season's final game against the Rangers. Trottier won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP and captured the Art Ross Trophy for the most points, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving Madison Square Garden following their game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts.\nOff the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both his franchises, even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10 million they had paid in startup costs, and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the National Basketball Association threw Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners, John Pickett. In return, Pickett promoted Torrey to team president, though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative cable television contract with the fledgling SportsChannel network as their owner, Charles Dolan, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as MSG Sportsnet, for over four decades.\nThe Dynasty (1979\u20131983).\nAfter the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In 1980, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the Stanley Cup.\nBefore the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman Dave Lewis to the Los Angeles Kings for second line center Butch Goring. Goring's arrival is often called the \"final piece of the puzzle\", a strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and Clark Gillies. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers Duane Sutter and Anders Kallur and stay-at-home defensemen Dave Langevin, Gord Lane, and Ken Morrow (the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the 1980 Olympics), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.\nIn the 1980 playoffs, the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20131 in the preliminary round, then beat the Boston Bruins 4\u20131 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the Buffalo Sabres, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2\u20131 victory in game two on Bob Nystrom's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the Philadelphia Flyers, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25\u20130\u201310) during the regular season. In game one in Philadelphia, the Islanders won 4\u20133 on Denis Potvin's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3\u20132, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4\u20132 lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship. This was the most recent Stanley Cup-clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans (Stefan Persson and Kallur) on its roster.\nThe Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored 50 goals in 50 games in 1981 and the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the Minnesota North Stars in five games to win the Stanley Cup. Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinals sweep of the Rangers, Islanders' fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \"1940!\" \u2013 referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in 1940 (the Rangers would not win the cup again until 1994). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.\nIn 1981\u201382, the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while Mike Bossy set a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders finished with the most points in the league (118), yet once in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins they found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before John Tonelli scored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the Quebec Nordiques and the Vancouver Canucks in the first-ever coast-to-coast Stanley Cup Final for their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from Tiger Williams and falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe next year, although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times, more attention was being paid to the upstart Edmonton Oilers, whose young superstar Wayne Gretzky had just shattered existing scoring records. In 1982\u201383 the Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the Stanley Cup Final to win their fourth straight championship. Billy Smith was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series. Duane and Brent Sutter scored seven and five points respectively in the first three games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and Mark Messier said that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.\nPost-dynasty and the Easter Epic (1983\u20131991).\nThe Islanders finished the 1983\u201384 regular season tied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \"Drive for Five\" got off to a tense start. Late in the deciding game of their first-round series against the Rangers, Don Maloney tied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the Washington Capitals in five games and the Montreal Canadiens in six to set up a Stanley Cup Final rematch with the Oilers. The 1984 Stanley Cup Final featured rookie Pat LaFontaine scoring two third-period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years. For the 1984 playoffs, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the Stanley Cup Final series, which provided the Islanders home-ice advantage in the series based on Wales Conference teams collectively having a winning record in regular season games versus Campbell Conference opponents, despite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series, after the teams had split the first two games in New York. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series. The Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19-series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959\u20131967 streak by the Boston Celtics of the NBA). Unlike the 1976\u20131979 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons.\nThe Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the 1984\u201385 NHL season, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387 seasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, who eliminated the Islanders in the division finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first-round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.\nIn 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury and Clark Gillies was picked up on waivers by the Buffalo Sabres. Arbour retired as coach following the 1985\u201386 season and was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach Terry Simpson. During the first round of the 1987 playoffs against the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7. The Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \"Easter Epic\". Kelly Hrudey stopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime\u2014and at 1:56 a.m. on Easter Sunday morning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75\u201352. They were eliminated in the division finals in seven games by the Flyers. Chronic back pain forced Mike Bossy to retire after the season.\nThe following season, the Islanders captured another division title, but were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart New Jersey Devils. Potvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by Ray Bourque and Paul Coffey. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out.\nThe 1988\u201389 season saw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the Quebec Nordiques for the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal, Stephen Walsh, and Paul Greenwood. In return, they each bought a 2.5% interest in the team. In the next season, the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of Bryan Trottier's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The 1990\u201391 season had the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.\nNew faces and the 1993 run (1991\u20131995).\nLaFontaine was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before 1991\u201392. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine, Randy Wood and Randy Hillier (along with future considerations) to the Buffalo Sabres in return for Pierre Turgeon, Benoit Hogue, Uwe Krupp and Dave McLlwain. He also sent longtime captain Brent Sutter and Brad Lauer to the Chicago Blackhawks for Steve Thomas and Adam Creighton. With these additions and a talented core of players such as Derek King, Ray Ferraro, and Patrick Flatley, along with incoming Soviet players Vladimir Malakhov and Darius Kasparaitis, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early 1990s. The management committee, however, was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager Don Maloney was hired in Torrey's place, while Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion Florida Panthers.\nIn Maloney's first year, 1992\u201393, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in five years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the Lady Byng Trophy.\nRay Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first-round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Only seconds after Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, scored an insurance goal in the series-clinching game, Dale Hunter violently checked him from behind. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer, with a separated shoulder. He returned only for spot power-play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension, at the time the longest for on-ice misconduct in modern NHL history.\nThe Islanders' next opponent, the Pittsburgh Penguins, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, and Ron Francis. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of \"Newsday\" predicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs, however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from Glenn Healy and contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when David Volek scored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game. \"Newsday\"'s front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \"It's a Miracle!\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015\u201316 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the conference finals against the Montreal Canadiens, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup.\nMaloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the 1993 expansion draft he traded backup goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick to the Quebec Nordiques for Ron Hextall. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the expansion draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, then was claimed by the Tampa Bay Lightning in Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he became the backup.\nThe Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. It would be the Islanders' last playoff appearance until 2002. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant Lorne Henning. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for Tommy Soderstrom in September. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year Ottawa Senators.\nManagement issues (1995\u20132000).\nBy the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the Montreal Canadiens for Kirk Muller and Mathieu Schneider, while Hogue was sent to Toronto for young goaltender Eric Fichaud. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well.\nBefore the 1995\u201396 season, Maloney fired Henning and named Mike Milbury head coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker-clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \"fishsticks\"\u2014mocking how the logo resembled the Gorton's Fisherman. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. (In spite of this, the logo found renewed popularity as a throwback design in the late 2010s and early 2020s, enough so that the team would revive it as their third \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in 2022 and would use an adjusted version of the logo for their AHL team, the Bridgeport Islanders, beginning in 2024.) The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22\u201350\u201310. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall, and gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the following season and elevated assistant Rick Bowness to the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the 1997\u201398 season. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the following season while retaining his job as general manager.\nDuring the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to Dallas businessman John Spano in 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off \"Newsday\" that something was amiss about their new boss. In July, \"Newsday\" exposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525 or $750) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the ESPN \"30 for 30\" documentary, \"Big Shot\". Pickett finally found a buyer, a group led by Howard Milstein and Phoenix Coyotes co-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when Spectacor Management Group, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.\nInitially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players Todd Bertuzzi and Bryan McCabe were traded for veteran Trevor Linden. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997\u201398 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer Zigmund Palffy, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year Bryan Berard, and rugged defenseman Rich Pilon. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the National Football League's Washington Redskins and Cleveland Browns.\nNew ownership and a return to the playoffs (2000\u20132006).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLet's face it, the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\n \u2014Charles Wang\nIn 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to Computer Associates executives Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar. The sale cost $187.5 million ($ million in 2024 dollars) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around. The new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players Roberto Luongo and Olli Jokinen to the Florida Panthers for Oleg Kvasha and Mark Parrish. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took Rick DiPietro with the first selection in the 2000 draft, ahead of consensus picks Dany Heatley and Marian Gaborik. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\" Establishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \"Mad Mike\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise's first season. The team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player Butch Goring. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring Ted Nolan as Goring's successor; Instead, Boston Bruins assistant coach Peter Laviolette was hired.\nThree key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001\u201302 season, Laviolette's first. Alexei Yashin was acquired from the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forward Bill Muckalt, defenseman Zdeno Chara and the Islanders' second overall pick in the 2001 draft. Next, Islanders prospects Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt were traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Michael Peca, who became the team's captain. By virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season, Detroit Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood was the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange. The additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9\u20130\u20131\u20131 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turnaround in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed Ron Hextall's previous record of 65. During the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs. The Islanders lost in a very physical first-round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, game 5 featured Gary Roberts charging Islander defenseman Kenny Jonsson, and Darcy Tucker submarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's anterior cruciate ligament, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun, which Tucker denied.\nDespite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the 2002\u201303 season. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded Ottawa Senators. Milbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach. He was replaced with Steve Stirling, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. In the following season, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning.\nFollowing the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for following season. Peca was traded to the Edmonton Oilers for center Mike York, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap. The same day, the team signed winger Miroslav Satan to play alongside Yashin. Milbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding Alexei Zhitnik, Brad Lukowich and Brent Sopel to replace the departed Adrian Aucoin and Roman Hamrlik, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the HockeyAllsvenskan in Sweden. In the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain. The team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.\nManagement shake-ups and the DiPietro contract (2006\u20132009).\nOn the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found. He served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007. Wang proceeded by hiring Neil Smith as general manager and Ted Nolan as head coach, following a brief stint by Brad Shaw as the team's interim head coach. Smith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender Garth Snow, who retired from his playing career to accept the position. Before his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen Brendan Witt and Tom Poti, and forwards Mike Sillinger and Chris Simon.\nOn September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5 million ($ million in 2024 dollars) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for National Basketball Association player Magic Johnson. DiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\" As speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players, Atlanta Thrashers' general manager Don Waddell felt that, \"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\"\nThe new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings. Eyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward Ryan Smyth from the Edmonton Oilers at the trade deadline on February 27, 2007. Injuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention. They qualified for the playoffs, assisted by a late-season winning streak and a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the New Jersey Devils in their final regular season game. Despite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the Presidents' Trophy-winning Buffalo Sabres.\nManagement announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain Alexei Yashin's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it. Free agents Smyth, Poti, Viktor Kozlov, Jason Blake, and Richard Zednik also left in July 2007. During that month, the Islanders signed Bill Guerin to a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy. Also in the off-season, free agents Mike Comrie, Andy Sutton and Jon Sim joined the team. That summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500. Arbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3\u20132, raising his career coaching win total to 740. The team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they re-signed Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and Marc-Andre Bergeron. A rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season.\nAt the 2008 NHL entry draft, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center Josh Bailey. They also added free agents Mark Streit and Doug Weight. The team dismissed head coach Ted Nolan over alleged philosophy differences, and later that summer replaced him with Scott Gordon. Near the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and Chris Campoli to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forward Dean McAmmond and the San Jose Sharks' first-round draft pick in the 2009 NHL entry draft and sent captain Bill Guerin to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a conditional draft pick.\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26\u201347\u20139, which was the team's worst record since the 2000\u201301 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the 2009 NHL entry draft.\nThe Tavares era begins (2009\u20132015).\nBeginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected John Tavares with the first-overall pick of the 2009 NHL entry draft. Tavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports, and it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares, Victor Hedman, and Matt Duchene. NHL Central Scouting Bureau's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player.\" They traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman Calvin de Haan with the 12th overall pick, as well as Casey Cizikas and Anders Lee in later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the 2014\u201315 season.\nThe 2009\u201310 season started out slow, with the team winless its first six games. The team continued to play inconsistently due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential playoff contenders. The team hit a mid-season hot streak, however nine losses in 11 games before the Olympic break set them right back. They ultimately ended up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league. The placement led to a fifth overall pick in 2010. Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards Nino Niederreiter and Brock Nelson with picks five and 30, respectively. As the 2010\u201311 season got underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach Scott Gordon. He was replaced on an interim basis by Jack Capuano, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Early in the season, they also acquired Michael Grabner from waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy; he would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season. This year also featured the Penguins\u2013Islanders brawl, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \"failure to control their players\".\nThe following season was a breakout year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 50 assists, in addition to being selected to play in the 59th NHL All-Star Game at the age of 21; his 81 points were seventh-best in the league. Tavares' left-winger Matt Moulson also had a strong season, finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points. Despite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in the league with a record of 34\u201337\u201311, continuing their pattern of racking up top prospects with early picks at the drafts. They used the first round of the 2012 draft to select defenseman Griffin Reinhart with the fourth overall pick.\nOn August 1, 2011, voters in Nassau County rejected a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called The Lighthouse Project, which would have renovated the arena. In the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, new arenas in Queens or Suffolk County, the Sprint Center in Kansas City, or the Videotron Centre in Quebec City, the last of which was coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise would indeed be moving to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn for the 2015\u201316 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move. As part of the deal, the management of Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to Barclays Center. The decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and Queens.\nBeginning on April 1, 2013, of the 2012\u201313 season, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the Philadelphia Flyers later that month. During that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4\u20133 shootout loss to the Carolina Hurricanes, ending a six-year playoff drought. Behind goaltender Evgeni Nabokov, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the playoffs, continuing their winless streak in playoff series.\nOn September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011. After posting a 4\u20134\u20133 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Thomas Vanek, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer. Despite chemistry with linemates Tavares and Kyle Okposo, however, his desire to test free agency and the team's impending move to Barclays Center led to Vanek being dealt to the Montreal Canadiens at the trade deadline for Sebastian Collberg and a second-round pick in 2014. After a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing with a record of 34\u201337\u201311.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their final season at Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to Jaroslav Halak from the Washington Capitals in exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed Mikhail Grabovski, Nikolai Kulemin and goaltender Chad Johnson as free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired Johnny Boychuk from the Boston Bruins for two-second round picks in 2014 and 2015 and a conditional third-round pick in 2015, as well as Nick Leddy from the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for prospect Ville Pokka, T. J. Brennan and the rights to Anders Nilsson.\nThe NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen Jon Ledecky and Scott D. Malkin in October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who retained a share of the franchise.\nThe Islanders finished the 2014\u201315 regular season with a record of 47\u201328\u20137 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the 2015 playoffs. The Capitals held home-ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the Columbus Blue Jackets, 5\u20134, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2\u20131\u20131 record in the season series (Washington went 2\u20130\u20132, winning the season series with six points to the Islanders' five). On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first-round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2\u20131. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; the Isles' Cal Clutterbuck scored the final NHL goal in the building's first run prior to the Islanders' return in 2018.\nMove to Barclays Center and playoff series win (2015\u20132017).\nIn June 2015, the Islanders entered the 2015 draft without a first-round pick, but emerged with two first-rounders in Mathew Barzal and Anthony Beauvillier after a series of draft day trades. The Islanders also selected forward Andong Song in the sixth round of the 2015 draft, making him the first Chinese player to be drafted by an NHL team.\nThe Islanders played their first regular season game at Barclays Center on October 9, 2015, losing 3\u20132 in overtime to the Chicago Blackhawks. Artem Anisimov scored the first regular season goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power-play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman Travis Hamonic, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the Florida Panthers; goaltender Thomas Greiss only played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the San Jose Sharks prior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up Alan Quine scored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1\u20130 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to the Lightning in five games.\nSummer of 2016 saw free agents and longtime Islanders Kyle Okposo, Frans Nielsen, and Matt Martin all depart the team, joining the Buffalo Sabres, Detroit Red Wings, and Toronto Maple Leafs, respectively. Snow signed free agents Andrew Ladd from the Chicago Blackhawks and Jason Chimera from the Washington Capitals to help fill the gaps left behind. After an underwhelming first half of the 2016\u201317 season, posting a 17\u201317\u20138 record through 42 games, head coach Jack Capuano was relieved of duties, with assistant general manager Doug Weight being named interim head coach. Having coached the team since 2010, Capuano was the second-winningest coach in the team's history with 227 wins, also leading the team to their first playoff series win since 1993. Prior to Capuano's release, goaltender Jaroslav Halak was placed on waivers, and eventually sent down to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up Jean-Francois Berube after Halak posted a 6\u20138\u20135 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season.\nIn late January 2017, following a report by \"Bloomberg News\" which speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue was mixed partly due to obstructed view seats, as well as features like an off-center scoreboard, and the Islanders had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league while playing at the venue), \"Newsday\" reported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum. However, commissioner Gary Bettman considered the concept to be \"unviable\" (the renovation reduced the capacity of the arena to just under 14,000, which is smaller than any NHL arena), and noted that Ledecky and Malkin were pursuing a possible arena project at Belmont Park.\nDespite winning their last six games of the 2016\u201317 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season.\nLamoriello era and Conference Final appearances (2017\u20132025).\nOn February 9, 2018, rookie Mathew Barzal recorded his third five-point game, becoming only the second rookie to do so since Joe Malone in 1917\u201318 and tying a 100-year-old record in the process. At the end of the 2017\u201318 regular season, Barzal had 85 points (22 goals, 63 assists). He led his team and all NHL rookies in points, and was tied for 13th overall in scoring in the NHL. Barzal was the seventh rookie in NHL history, and first since Sidney Crosby in 2005\u201306, to have scored at least 20 goals and 60 assists in a single season. Barzal also tied Islanders legend, Bryan Trottier's franchise record for rookie assists. Barzal won the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year for his 85-point season, leading the closest candidate by 20 points and receiving 160 out of 164 first-place votes. Barzal was the first Islanders' player to win the award since Bryan Berard in 1997, and he was the fifth Islanders' player overall to win the trophy, joining Islanders legends Mike Bossy (1978), Trottier (1976), and Denis Potvin (1974).\nDuring the 2018 off-season, the Islanders announced that former New Jersey Devils and Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Lou Lamoriello was named their president of hockey operations, with \"full authority over all hockey matters with the organization\", and would become general manager on June 5, 2018, replacing Garth Snow. Additionally, Barry Trotz was hired as head coach of the Islanders. Trotz resigned from the Washington Capitals one month prior after coaching them to their first Stanley Cup championship since they entered the NHL in 1974. Captain John Tavares' contract with the team expired following the 2017\u201318 season, and despite attempts to re-sign him, he joined the Toronto Maple Leafs as a free agent.\nIn the 2018\u201319 season, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and their former home, Nassau Coliseum. The use of both arenas would continue over the course of the following two seasons until the completion of a new 18,000-seat arena at Belmont Park in Elmont. The Islanders enjoyed success throughout the 2018\u201319 season, clinching a playoff berth at home for the first time in 17 years, and the first time in March since 1990. Nassau Coliseum hosted their home playoff games during the first round while the Barclays Center hosted their home games for the rest of the playoffs. In the first round of the 2019 playoffs, the Islanders swept the Pittsburgh Penguins, and in the second round the team was swept by the Carolina Hurricanes.\nOn August 8, 2019, the Empire State Development Corporation board (ESD) voted unanimously in favor of the Belmont Park Arena project.\nIn February 2020, it was announced that the Islanders would return to Nassau Coliseum for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs and the 2020\u201321 season until UBS Arena was opened. Both the 2019\u201320 season and the construction of the new arena were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. When the NHL season was suspended on March 12, 2020, the Islanders had twelve regular season games remaining and were one point shy of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Islanders qualified for the NHL Return-to-Play initiative as the seventh seed, beating the Florida Panthers in four games in a best-of-5 qualifying round to make the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs. They would then go on to defeat the Washington Capitals in the first round in five games. Then, after blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to the Philadelphia Flyers that extended the series to seven games, the Islanders would go on to win game 7 against the Flyers and advance to the conference finals for the first time since the 1993 playoffs. However, their run would come to an end at the hands of the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games. In December 2020, New York Islanders Hockey Club, L.P. bought the remaining 15 percent stake of the team from the estate of Charles Wang and took full ownership of the team.\nThe Islanders again made the playoffs in the shortened 2020\u201321 season, defeating the Penguins and Bruins each in six games. They again lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning, this time in seven.\nThe Islanders started the 2021\u201322 season on a 13-game road trip while UBS Arena was finalizing construction, finishing their road trip with a 5\u20136\u20132 record. However, minutes before the first home game of the season on November 20, 2021, many Islander players contracted COVID-19 and missed the home opener and several others. Longest tenured Islander Josh Bailey and team captain Anders Lee missed the game, while Adam Pelech, Anthony Beauvillier, and Andy Greene were ruled out minutes before puck drop. They lost the home opener to the Calgary Flames by a score of 5\u20132. Brad Richardson scored the first goal in UBS Arena history, while Brock Nelson scored the first Islander goal. The Islanders won their first game at UBS Arena against the Devils, on December 11, by a score of 4\u20132. Former Devils captain Zach Parise scored the game-winning goal for the Islanders. The Islanders missed the playoffs after three consecutive trips, finishing the season with a 37\u201335\u201310 record. On May 9, 2022, head coach Barry Trotz was relieved from his duties, and replaced with Lane Lambert. In the next season, the Islanders finished as the first wild card, but were defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round of the 2023 playoffs.\nAfter an inconsistent start to the 2023\u201324 season, head coach Lane Lambert was fired on January 20, 2024, and Patrick Roy was hired as his replacement. The Islanders finished in third place in the Metropolitan Division and lost to the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round of the 2024 playoffs.\nAfter a disappointing 2024\u201325 season where the team finished 35\u201335\u201312 and missing the playoffs by nine points, the Islanders announced on April 22, 2025, that they would not be renewing Lamoriello's contract, bringing his time as general manager and president of hockey operations to an end. \nSchaefer and new management (2025\u2013present).\nDespite having only the 10th-best odds, the Islanders won the 2025 NHL draft lottery, acquiring the right to select first overall for the first time since 2009. In the off-season, Mathieu Darche replaced Lamoriello as general manager. At the draft, the Islanders took Canadian defenseman Matthew Schaefer first overall. Due to Darche's decision to trade defenseman Noah Dobson to the Montreal Canadiens, the club made two additional first round selections that year.\nTeam identity.\nLogo.\nAdvertising executive John Alogna created the original Islanders logo, a circle with the letters \"NY\" over a map of the Nassau and Suffolk counties. The lower part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of the shaft and a puck to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the \"I\" ends in a point aimed at Uniondale, the location of Nassau Coliseum.\nBefore the 1995\u201396 season, the Islanders attempted to update their look by introducing a new logo depicting a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The new logo was a marketing disaster; the reaction among the fanbase was so negative that management announced it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them to do so. Many found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the Gorton's fisherman; indeed, New York Rangers fans taunted the Islanders with chants of \"We want fishsticks!\" long after the logo was discarded. The traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting as an alternate jersey logo in 1996\u201397 before fully replacing the fisherman in 1997\u201398. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was recolored to match.\nBeginning in 2008\u201309, the Islanders introduced another modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The \"new\" logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley Cup titles won by the team in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010.\nFor their 2014 Stadium Series special jerseys, the Islanders used a simplified jersey logo with just the \"NY\" from their regular logo. Versions of that have since appeared on third jersey designs.\nJerseys.\nThe Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained largely the same, with only minor tweaks through the 1994\u201395 season.\nPrior to the 1995\u201396 season, team executives decided to change the jersey. The fisherman logo replaced the \"NY\" circular design, incorporating navy blue and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the Montauk Lighthouse, and featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern. Late in the season, the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from switching jersey designs for the 1996\u201397 season on only a few months' notice. Instead, they debuted their first third (and fourth) jerseys, which were identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, except the circular \"NY\" crest, now colored in the navy blue and bright orange shades to match, replaced the fisherman logo. The team wore these jerseys in approximately 15 games during that season and adopted them permanently in the 1997\u201398 season.\nPrior to the 1998\u201399 season, the team's jerseys reverted to a traditional design but kept the navy blue and bright orange shades from the jerseys used the previous three seasons. They added a shoulder patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four Stanley Cup championships. A predominantly orange third jersey was introduced in 2002\u201303, featuring navy blue yokes and sides that formed sharp points on the sleeves and body. The team wore this jersey through the 2006\u201307 season.\nFor the 2007\u201308 season, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all NHL teams changed over to the Reebok Edge system. These jerseys resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured \"retro\" laces at the neck.\nA royal blue throwback design was introduced the following season as a third jersey. Before the 2010\u201311 season, the Islanders made this throwback design their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders' draft party at Nassau Coliseum.\nFor the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player. These were only used sparing for two seasons, as they proved unpopular.\nDuring the 2014 Stadium Series, the Islanders wore a special edition jersey. The front side featured the \"NY\" from the primary logo in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey in the 2014\u201315 season, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman jersey for warmups before their game against the Florida Panthers.\nThe Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only on the rear collar), while the \"NY\" insignia that was carried over from the Stadium Series jersey was stripped of its chrome accents. The four narrow white stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins.\nWhen the NHL switched to Adidas as its uniform provider in 2017, the Islanders kept their primary jerseys mostly intact except for the restoration of the blue trim in the primary logo on the road jersey. As with all NHL teams, the Islanders only wore two jerseys for the 2017\u201318 season, thus retiring the all-black third jerseys.\nThe Islanders released a new blue third jersey for the 2018\u201319 season, featuring an updated \"NY\" insignia (shorter \"Y-stick\" with four orange stripes on the blade), white shoulder yoke (reminiscent of the 2014 Stadium Series alternates), the map of Long Island on the collar, and orange numbers that call back to the jerseys used during the team's inaugural season.\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Islanders released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The uniform resembled their current home jerseys, but used the navy blue and bright orange scheme worn from 1995 to 2010. A second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the \"Fisherman\" uniform from 1995 to 1997 but with less teal elements and diagonal orange striping.\nDuring the 2024 Stadium Series, the Islanders wore navy blue jerseys with a thick orange middle stripe. \"ISLES\" in navy blue letters was added within the orange stripe, as are the navy blue numbers.\nThe Islanders reverted to wearing only their primary jerseys after Fanatics took over as the NHL uniform provider in 2024, even though it kept most aspects of Adidas' template and retained the use of third jerseys.\nMascot and Ice Girls.\nThe Islanders' team mascot is named \"Sparky the Dragon\", who served at one point as cross-promotion with the Arena Football League's New York Dragons team, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named \"Nyisles\" whose body style went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued toward the end of the 1997\u201398 season when the team distributed \"Who kidnapped Nyisles?\" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be Toronto Maple Leafs mascot Carlton the Bear. Nyisles returned as the secondary mascot of the club with a brand new look in December 2022 to coincide with the return of the Fisherman logo on the team's reverse retro uniforms.\nFrom the 2001\u201302 season to the 2014\u201315 season, the Islanders also had an ice crew named the \"Ice Girls\", made up of only women who skated onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up during the game. The Ice Girls were also used for promotional purposes during games and at community events. Starting in the 2015\u201316 season, a co-ed ice crew would replace the Ice Girls.\nRivalries.\nThe Islanders have rivalries with the New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, and Washington Capitals.\nNew York Rangers.\nOften referred to as the Battle of New York, the rivalry between the Islanders and the New York Rangers dates back to the 1970s. The rivalry was at its height from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, with the Islanders completing their dynasty in the early 1980s. The rivalry also saw a resurgence in the early to mid-1990s with the Rangers knocking the Islanders out of the 1994 playoffs and eventually defeating the Vancouver Canucks in the 1994 Stanley Cup Final. The Rangers hold the distinction as being the Islanders' most-hated rival. \nPhiladelphia Flyers.\nOriginating in 1975, the rivalry between the Islanders and the Philadelphia Flyers stems from the two teams meeting each other in the playoffs several times from the mid-1970s to the 1980s.\nWashington Capitals.\nThe rivalry between the Islanders and the Washington Capitals stems from several playoff meetings from the early 1980s to the early 1990s, with the rivalry cooling off in the 2000s before resurging in the mid-2010s and early 2020s.\n\"This is only a partial list of the last five seasons.

Bossy and Potvin were the first Islanders to be inducted, in 1991. Chara is the most recent Islander to be inducted, in 2025.\nIn addition to the eight players, two team builders have been inducted; Bill Torrey and Al Arbour were inducted in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Lou Lamoriello, hired to serve as Islanders general manager in 2018, was previously inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009.\nFive of the eight Hall of Fame players (Bossy, Gillies, Potvin, Smith and Trottier), in addition to Bob Bourne, have since been inducted into the Islanders' Hall of Fame, established in 2007. In February 2008, the team unveiled the Hall of Fame plaques for each player, which are displayed at the team's practice facility. In November 2011, first Islanders captain Ed Westfall was added to their Hall of Fame, followed by the addition of defenseman Ken Morrow in December 2011, right-winger Patrick Flatley (\"Chairman of the Boards\") in January 2012 and Kenny Jonsson in February 2012. In February 2020, John Tonelli and Butch Goring were inducted into the Islanders Hall of Fame at the same time their numbers, 27 and 91 respectively, were retired by the team. Brent Sutter is scheduled to be inducted on January 18, 2025.\nThere are two other banners hanging with the retired numbers: one honors Al Arbour in recognition of his 1,500 games coached for the Islanders, and the other honors Bill Torrey, who held the titles of general manager, vice president, president, and chairman of the board for the Islanders organization from 1972 until 1993. In place of a number, Torrey's banner features the words \"The Architect\" and his trademark bowtie.\nThe NHL retired Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 for all its member teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.\nTeam captains.\nThe Islanders have had 15 team captains. The team's first, Ed Westfall, won the Bill Masterton Trophy during his captaincy; Michael Peca, who won the Frank J. Selke Trophy after the 2001\u201302 season, is the only other captain to have won an award during his term. The longest captaincy reign was Denis Potvin's from 1979 through 1987, during which he played 521 regular season games. Bryan McCabe served for the shortest length of time, a mere 56 regular season games before being traded to the Vancouver Canucks. Also traded mid-season was Bill Guerin, who went to the Pittsburgh Penguins during the 2008\u201309 season. The Islanders' 15th and current captain, Anders Lee, was named to the position on October 4, 2018.\nTwo seasons have been played without a captain. Nobody was assigned to the position for the 1996\u201397 season after previous captain Patrick Flatley was released from his contract. The 2000\u201301 season also went by without a captain after Kenny Jonsson stepped down from the position on November 18, 2000.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGeneral managers.\nThe current general manager of the Islanders is Mathieu Darche, who was named to the role on May 23, 2025.\nHead coaches.\nThe current head coach of the Islanders is Patrick Roy, who was named to the role on January 20, 2024.\nFranchise records.\nBryan Trottier holds the franchise record for most points with the team (1,353), as well as most games played (1,123). Only Trottier and two others, Mike Bossy and Denis Potvin have scored over 1,000 points with the team, while six others have gained more than 500, with Derek King only one point shy. Potvin and Josh Bailey are the only other players besides Trottier to play in over 1,000 games with the team; Potvin is also the only defenseman in the top ten of the franchise scoring leaders, ranking third overall.\nScoring leaders.\nThese are the top-ten point-scorers in franchise history. Figures are updated after each completed NHL regular season.\nNote: \"Pos = Position; GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; P/G = Points per game\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTelevision and radio.\nMost Islanders games are shown locally on sports channels MSG Sportsnet and MSGSN 2. Brendan Burke is the team's play-by-play announcer, while former Islanders player Butch Goring is their color analyst. Shannon Hogan joined the broadcast team for the 2014\u201315 season as their studio host.\nUntil the 2025\u201326 season the Islanders' radio broadcasts originated on flagship station WRHU (88.7 FM) in Hempstead. In New York City itself, most games air on WEPN, with some airing on WRCN-FM in Riverhead. WRHU is the student radio station of Hofstra University; its signal covers the western section of Long Island and Nassau County. WRCN serves the middle section and Suffolk County. The play-by-play was done by longtime Islanders broadcaster Chris King, and color commentary was provided by Greg Picker. Picker and Cory Wright co-hosted the radio pregame and intermission shows. Hofstra students used to provide reporting for all home games and several away games and were also involved in producing and engineering the broadcasts from on- and off-site.\nIn New York City itself, WFAN picked up Islanders games from 2016\u201317 to 2018\u201319, when it shifted most of its broadcasts to internet streaming on Audacy (formerly Radio.com), which also partnered with the team on other exclusive ancillary content. Previously, public radio station WNYE had been the main Islanders outlet for New York City and its inner suburbs.\nThe Islanders are unusual among professional sports teams in their use of a noncommercial radio station as its primary outlet. However, the team does not maintain a traditional radio network due to the other New York/New Jersey area teams filling the available tri-state radio stations covering sports. This causes complications with advertising and commercial breaks that do not make a traditional radio network feasible.\nWCBS began airing Islanders games starting with the 2016 playoffs, returning the team to a major market New York signal. The games moved to WNYM and WMCA in 2017 before being consolidated on WEPN in 2019.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "66881", "revid": "23512862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66881", "title": "New York Rangers", "text": "National Hockey League team in New York City\nThe New York Rangers are a professional ice hockey team based in New York City. The Rangers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They are one of three NHL franchises located in the New York metropolitan area; the others being the New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders.\nFounded in 1926 by Tex Rickard, the Rangers are one of the Original Six teams that competed in the NHL before its 1967 expansion, along with the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. The team attained success early on under the guidance of Lester Patrick, who coached a team containing Frank Boucher, Murray Murdoch, and Bun and Bill Cook to win the Stanley Cup in only their second season. In 1928, they became the first NHL franchise in the United States to win the trophy, and are still the fastest true expansion team in NHL history to do so. The team won two more Stanley Cups in 1933 and 1940.\nFollowing this initial grace period, the franchise struggled between the 1940s and 1960s, where playoff appearances and successes were infrequent. The team enjoyed a mini-renaissance in the 1970s, where they made the Stanley Cup Final twice, losing to the Bruins in 1972 and the Canadiens in 1979. The Rangers subsequently embraced a rebuild for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, which eventually paid dividends in 1994, where the team, led by Mark Messier, Brian Leetch, Adam Graves, and Mike Richter, captured their fourth Stanley Cup.\nThe team was unable to duplicate that success in the years that followed, and entered into another period of mediocrity, enduring a franchise-record seven-year postseason drought from 1998 to 2005. After the arrival of goaltender Henrik Lundqvist in 2006, the Rangers thrived, missing the playoffs just once between then and 2017. The Rangers returned to the Stanley Cup Final in 2014, falling to the Los Angeles Kings in five games. Between 2012 and 2024, they reached the Eastern Conference finals five times.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1926\u20131942).\nGeorge Lewis \"Tex\" Rickard, president of Madison Square Garden, was awarded an NHL franchise for the 1926\u201327 season to compete with the New York Americans, who had begun play at the Garden the previous season. The Americans' early success in their inaugural season exceeded expectations, leading Rickard to pursue a second team for the Garden despite promising the Americans that they were going to be the only ice hockey team to play there. The team was originally incorporated under the name \"New York Giants Professional Hockey Club\" during a league meeting with NHL president Frank Calder on April 17, 1926, but during the meeting the name was then changed to \"New York Rangers Hockey Club.\" The franchise's nickname is attributed to sports editor of the \"New York Herald Tribune\", George Haley, who referred to the new team as \"Tex's Rangers\" because of Rickard's decision to bring a new NHL team to New York.\nRickard's franchise began play in the 1926\u201327 season. The first team crest played on the club's name with a rearing horse sketched in blue carrying a cowboy waving a hockey stick aloft, with the word \"TEX'S\" in a crescent at the top of the emblem with \"RANGERS\" below it. Rickard rejected that design and management settled on a crest similar to the Americans, a \"shield\" shape with \"NEW YORK\" horizontally across the top of the shield and \"RANGERS\" written diagonally from the top left to bottom right. The diagonal positioning of \"RANGERS\" carried over to the front of the solid blue jerseys. Future Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe was hired to assemble the team. However, he had a falling-out with Rickard's associate, John S. Hammond, and was fired as manager-coach on the eve of the first season \u2013 he was paid a then-hefty $2,500 to leave. Smythe was replaced by Pacific Coast Hockey Association co-founder Lester Patrick. The new team Smythe assembled turned out to be a winner. The Rangers won the American Division title their first year but lost to the Boston Bruins in the playoffs.\nThe team's early success led to players becoming minor celebrities and fixtures in New York City's Roaring Twenties nightlife. It was during this time, playing at the Garden on 49th Street, blocks away from Times Square, that the Rangers obtained their nickname \"The Broadway Blueshirts\". On December 13, 1929, the Rangers became the first team in the NHL to travel by plane when they hired the Curtiss-Wright Corporation to fly them to Toronto for a game against the Maple Leafs, which they lost 7\u20136.\nStanley Cup success (1927\u20131942).\nIn only their second season, they won the 1928 Stanley Cup, defeating the Montreal Maroons in five games. One of the most memorable stories that emerged from the Cup Final series involved Patrick playing in goal at the age of 44. At the time, teams were not required to dress a backup goaltender. When the Rangers' starting goaltender, Lorne Chabot, left a game with an eye injury, Maroons head coach Eddie Gerard vetoed Patrick's original choice for an emergency replacement, Alex Connell of the Ottawa Senators, who was in attendance. An angry Patrick lined up between the pipes for two periods in game two of the Stanley Cup Final, allowing one goal to Maroons center Nels Stewart. Frank Boucher scored the game-winning goal in overtime for New York.\nAfter a loss to the Bruins in the 1929 Stanley Cup Final, the Rangers, led by brothers Bill and Bun Cook on the right and left wings, respectively, and Frank Boucher at center, defeated the Maple Leafs in the 1933 Stanley Cup Final to win their second Stanley Cup. Lester Patrick stepped down as head coach and was replaced by Frank Boucher.\nIn the 1939\u201340 season, the Rangers finished the regular season in second place behind Boston. The two teams then met in the first round of the playoffs. The Bruins gained a 2\u20131 series lead on New York, but the Rangers recovered to win three straight games, defeating the first-place Bruins four games to two. The Rangers' first-round victory advanced them to the Stanley Cup Final, where the Rangers defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games. Following the Brooklyn Americans fold in 1942, and the league reneging on Red Dutton's promise to have the Americans return, Dutton swore a curse on the Rangers.\nOriginal Six era (1942\u20131967).\nThe Rangers collapsed by the mid-1940s, losing games by scores as lopsided as 15\u20130. In 1943\u201344, goaltender Ken McAuley led the league with 39 losses and 310 goals allowed in 50 games played; his 6.24 goals-against average that year remains the worst in NHL history by a goaltender playing at least 25 games in a season. They missed the playoffs for five consecutive seasons before earning the fourth and final playoff spot in 1947\u201348, losing in the first round. In December, 1948, Boucher resigned as head coach remaining as general manager, giving control to Lynn Patrick, the son of Lester Patrick. In the 1950 Stanley Cup Final, the Rangers were forced to play all of their games, including \"home\" games, in Toronto, while the circus was held at the Garden. They lost to the Detroit Red Wings in overtime in the seventh game of the series.\nDuring this time, Red Wings owner James E. Norris became the largest stockholder in the Garden. However, he did not buy controlling interest in the arena, which would have violated the NHL's rule against one person owning more than one team. Nonetheless, he had enough support on the board to exercise de facto control. The Rangers missed the playoffs 12 of the next 16 years within the remainder of the Original Six era. Boucher, who had been general manager of the squad, resigned citing depression over the team's inability to be a contender. His successor, Muzz Patrick, the younger brother of Lynn Patrick, did not fare well either, resigning in 1964 following criticism about management's unwillingness to improve the team by spending money. Emile Francis took over as both coach and general manager. After a five-year absence, the team made the playoffs, aided by goaltender Eddie Giacomin and 37-year-old former Montreal Canadiens right wing Bernie \"Boom Boom\" Geoffrion, who signed out of retirement in 1966.\nPost-Original Six era (1967\u20131993).\nGAG line and championship appearances (1967\u20131980).\nIn 1968, the Rangers moved into the fourth version of Madison Square Garden. During the 1969\u201370 season, the Rangers acquired veteran goaltender Terry Sawchuk, playing his final season with New York.\nIn 1971\u201372, the Rangers reached the 1972 Stanley Cup Final despite losing high-scoring center Jean Ratelle to injury during the last half of the regular season. The strength of players such as Brad Park, Jean Ratelle, Vic Hadfield and Rod Gilbert (the last three constructing the famed \"GAG line\", standing for \"goal-a-game\") carried them through the playoffs. They defeated the defending-champion Canadiens in the first round and the Chicago Black Hawks in the second, but lost to the Bruins in the Cup Final.\nThe following season in 1972\u201373, the team made the semifinals against the Black Hawks again, but lost in five games. The Rangers' conference semifinals series against the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1974 playoffs, which they lost in seven games became the first Original Six club to lose a playoff series to a 1967 expansion team. This series was noted for a game seven fight between Dale Rolfe of the Rangers and Dave Schultz of the Flyers. The Rangers' new rivals, the New York Islanders, who entered the League in 1972\u201373 after paying a territorial fee \u2013 $4 million \u2013 to the Rangers, were their first-round opponents in the 1975 playoffs. After splitting the first two games, the Islanders defeated the Rangers 11 seconds into overtime of the deciding game three.\nIn a blockbuster trade with the Boston Bruins, the Rangers acquired Esposito and Carol Vadnais from the Bruins for Park, Ratelle and Joe Zanussi in 1975\u201376. On January 8, 1976, Emile Francis was fired after the team got to a bad start. Ron Stewart who was coaching the team was also fired. John Ferguson Sr. took over as both coach and general manager for the remainder of the season. To assist in Ferguson's contention building, the team acquired Ken Hodge from Bruins in exchange for Rick Middleton. However, the team failed to make a playoff push and Ferguson was fired in 1978. Madison Square Garden's new owner, Sonny Werblin, hired Fred Shero to take over as head coach and general manager. In the 1979 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Rangers defeated the Islanders in the semifinals and advanced to the 1979 Stanley Cup Final, losing to the Canadiens.\nPlayoff struggles (1980\u20131993).\nIn four consecutive playoffs (1981\u20131984), the Rangers were eliminated by the rival Islanders, who went on to win the Stanley Cup in 1981, 1982, and 1983.\nThe Rangers stayed competitive through the 1980s and early 1990s, making the playoffs each year. In the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Rangers, behind the play of rookie goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, upended the Patrick Division-winning Flyers in five games followed by a six-game win over the Washington Capitals in the Patrick Division finals. Montreal disposed of the Rangers in the Wales Conference finals behind a rookie goaltender of their own, Patrick Roy. During the 1986\u201387 season, the team acquired superstar center Marcel Dionne after almost 12 years with the Los Angeles Kings.\nFrustration was at its peak when the 1991\u201392 Rangers captured the Presidents' Trophy. They took a 2\u20131 series lead on the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins and then faltered in three-straight (some observers note a Ron Francis slapshot from outside the blue line that eluded goaltender Mike Richter as the series' turning point). The following year, they missed the playoffs and head coach Roger Neilson was fired and replaced by Ron Smith mid-season. Smith was dismissed at the conclusion of the season.\nDuring this period, the Rangers were owned by Gulf+Western, which was renamed to Paramount Communications in 1989.\nEnding the curse (1993\u201394).\nThe 1993\u201394 season was the Rangers' most successful in 54 years. With several transactions up to this point, the Rangers had acquired seven players who had been part of the Edmonton Oilers' Cup-winning teams: Oilers captain (and new Rangers captain) Mark Messier, Adam Graves, Kevin Lowe, Jeff Beukeboom, Esa Tikkanen, Craig MacTavish, and Glenn Anderson. Graves set a team record with 52 goals, breaking the prior record of 50 held by Vic Hadfield. The Rangers clinched the Presidents' Trophy by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 52\u201324\u20138, setting a franchise record with 112 points earned. In the playoffs the Rangers made it past the first two rounds of the playoffs, sweeping the New York Islanders, and then defeating the Washington Capitals in five games. However, in the conference finals against the third-seeded New Jersey Devils, with the Rangers down 3\u20132 in the series and heading back to the Meadowlands for the sixth game, Messier guaranteed a win to the press. During the game he scored a hat trick in the third period to lead the Rangers to a 4\u20132 win, setting up a seventh game back at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers won game seven, 2\u20131, when Stephane Matteau scored a goal in double overtime, leading the team to the Cup Final for the first time since 1979. In the Final, the Rangers led the series 3\u20131, but the Canucks won the next two games to force a seventh game. In the seventh game, the Rangers took a 2\u20130 first period lead, with Messier scoring later to put the Rangers up 3\u20131, the eventual Cup-winning goal they won 3\u20132. Defenceman Brian Leetch became the first American-born player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, while Alexander Karpovtsev, Alexei Kovalev, Sergei Nemchinov and Sergei Zubov became the first Russians to have their names engraved on the Cup.\nExpensive acquisitions and postseason drought (1994\u20132005).\nDespite coaching the Rangers to a regular season first-place finish and the Stanley Cup victory, head coach Mike Keenan left after a dispute with general manager Neil Smith. Paramount Communications, the owners of the Rangers, were acquired by Viacom who then sold the team to ITT Corporation and Cablevision in August 1994. During the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Rangers won their first-round series with the Quebec Nordiques, but lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Philadelphia Flyers in four games with succeeding head coach Colin Campbell. Neil Smith orchestrated a deal that sent Sergei Zubov and center Petr Nedved to Pittsburgh in exchange for defenseman Ulf Samuelsson and left-winger Luc Robitaille in the summer of 1995. The Rangers defeated the Canadiens in six games in the 1996 playoffs, but lost their second-round series to the Penguins in five games.\nThe Rangers then acquired Wayne Gretzky in 1996. With Gretzky, the team went to the conference finals in 1997, where they lost 4\u20131 to the Flyers. During the season, ITT sold their stake of the Rangers to Cablevision. Mark Messier, a former Oiler teammate of Gretzky's, left in the summer of 1997 and the team failed in a bid to replace him with Colorado Avalanche superstar Joe Sakic. Robitaille was also traded during the summer for Kevin Stevens. The Rangers missed the playoffs for seven consecutive seasons, finishing no higher than fourth in their division. Gretzky retired at the end of the 1998\u201399 season.\nIn March 2000, Smith was fired along with head coach John Muckler, and that summer, Cablevision CEO and owner James Dolan hired Glen Sather as generla manager. By the end of the 2000\u201301 season, the Rangers had acquired some veterans. Messier returned to New York, Theoren Fleury joined the Rangers after spending most of his career with the Calgary Flames and Eric Lindros was traded to the Rangers by the Flyers. The Rangers also acquired Pavel Bure late in 2001\u201302 from the Florida Panthers. Approaching the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, they also acquired Alexei Kovalev, Jaromir Jagr, Martin Rucinsky, and Bobby Holik. However, none of the acquisitions helped them obtain a playoff spot. Towards the end of the 2003\u201304 season, general manager Glen Sather traded away Brian Leetch, Kovalev, Rucinsky, and Nedved.\nHenrik Lundqvist era (2005\u20132020).\nReturn to the playoffs (2005\u20132011).\nWith the emergence of Swedish rookie goaltender Henrik Lundqvist during the 2005\u201306 season, the Rangers finished the season with a record of 44\u201326\u201312, their best record since 1993\u201394. Jagr broke the Rangers' single-season points record with a first-period assist in a 5\u20131 win against the New York Islanders on March 29, 2006. The assist gave him 110 points on the season, breaking Jean Ratelle's record. Less than two weeks later, on April 8, Jagr scored his 53rd goal of the season against the Boston Bruins, breaking the club record previously held by Adam Graves. Two games prior, on April 4, the Rangers defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 3\u20132, in a shootout, to clinch a playoff spot for the first time since 1996\u201397. In the 2006 conference quarterfinals, the Rangers faced off against the Devils and were defeated in a four-game sweep. Jagr fell two points short of winning his sixth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion in 2005\u201306, but did win his third Pearson Award as the players' choice for the most outstanding player.\nIn the 2006\u201307 offseason, the Rangers signed Triple Gold Club winner and 12-time 30-goal scorer Brendan Shanahan to a one-year contract. On October 5, 2006, Jagr was named the first team captain since Mark Messier's retirement. On February 5, 2007, the Rangers acquired forward Sean Avery in a trade with the Los Angeles Kings. The Rangers swept the Atlanta Thrashers in the first round of the 2007 playoffs. However, they were eliminated in the next round by the Buffalo Sabres.\nAt the 2007 NHL entry draft, the Rangers chose Alexei Cherepanov 17th overall, who had been ranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau as the number one European skater. In the 2007 offseason, they signed Scott Gomez to a seven-year contract, as well as Chris Drury to a five-year deal. The Rangers made the playoffs for the third consecutive season and the second round for the second consecutive season. In the first round against the New Jersey Devils, in game three, Sean Avery faced himself towards Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur and moved his arms and stick in an attempt to screen any shots from the Rangers. After the game, the league made it an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to purposefully screen the goalie with your arms and stick. Following their first-round victory, they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round. The following offseason saw the departures of captain Jaromir Jagr to the KHL and Martin Straka, who left to play in the Czech Republic.\nFollowing Jagr's departure, Chris Drury was named captain on October 3, 2008. The Rangers were one of four NHL teams to open the 2008\u201309 season in Europe, being featured in the Victoria Cup final, defeating the European Champions Cup winner Metallurg Magnitogorsk in Bern, Switzerland. This was followed by two NHL regular season games against Tampa Bay in Prague on October 4 and 5; the Rangers won both games. However, on October 13, 2007, 2007 first-round pick, Alexei Cherepanov collapsed and died during a KHL game in Russia. After the Rangers went 2\u20137\u20133 in 12 games, coach Tom Renney was fired, with 2004 Stanley Cup and Jack Adams Award winner John Tortorella named as his replacement. The Rangers made the 2009 playoffs, but gave up a 3\u20131 series lead to the Washington Capitals to lose in seven games.\nOn June 30, 2009, the Rangers traded Scott Gomez, Tom Pyatt, and Michael Busto to the Montreal Canadiens for Ryan McDonagh, Chris Higgins, Pavel Valentenko, and Doug Janik. The Rangers also signed Marian Gaborik on the first day of free agency. In the 2009\u201310 season, the Rangers failed to make the playoffs for the first time in five years, losing the final game in a shootout against the Philadelphia Flyers.\nFor the 2010\u201311 season, the team signed Norwegian forward Mats Zuccarello. The Rangers' playoff chances came down to the final day of the regular season for the second consecutive year. The team defeated the New Jersey Devils and passed the Carolina Hurricanes in the standings, putting the Rangers in the playoffs. The Rangers faced Washington in the first round and lost the series in five games.\nOn May 13, 2011, Rangers forward Derek Boogaard was found dead in his Minnesota apartment. On June 29, the Rangers bought out captain Chris Drury's contract. On July 3, the Rangers signed free agent Brad Richards to a nine-year contract. On September 12, Ryan Callahan was named the 26th captain in the Rangers' history.\nReturn to the Stanley Cup Final and third Presidents' Trophy (2011\u20132016).\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, the team finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference, recording 51 wins and 109 points. Lunqvist was awarded the Vezina Trophy for the League's best goaltender. In the playoffs, they defeated both the Senators and Capitals in seven games respectively. In the conference finals, they faced the New Jersey Devils. After leading the series 2\u20131, the Rangers lost the next three games, losing game six to New Jersey in overtime.\nOn July 23, 2012, the Rangers traded Brandon Dubinsky, Artem Anisimov, Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Rick Nash, Steven Delisle, and a 2013 conditional third-round pick. At the 2013 trade deadline on April 3, the Rangers traded Marian Gaborik and Steven Delisle to Columbus for Derick Brassard, Derek Dorsett, John Moore, and a 2014 sixth-round draft pick. After the Rangers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by Boston, management fired head coach John Tortorella. On June 21, 2013, general manager Glen Sather formally introduced former Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault as Tortorella's replacement.\nOn March 5, 2014, the Rangers traded their captain Ryan Callahan, along with a first-round draft pick in 2015, a conditional second-round pick in 2014, and a conditional seventh-round pick in 2015, for Tampa Bay captain Martin St. Louis. The trade occurred both due to the Rangers' and Callahan's inability to reach a contract extension, as well as St. Louis' growing tension with the Lightning organization and subsequent request to be traded to New York. The 2013\u201314 Rangers set a new franchise record of 25 road game wins. New York defeated Philadelphia in seven games in the first round of the 2014 playoffs, and in the next round rallied from a 3\u20131 series deficit to defeat Pittsburgh in seven games. They then defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games to move onto the Cup Final to face the Los Angeles Kings. The Rangers lost the series in five games.\nOn June 20, 2014, a week after their season ended, the Rangers bought out the remaining six years of Brad Richards' contract. On October 6, defenseman Ryan McDonagh was named the Rangers' 27th captain in team history. In 2014\u201315, the Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy for the third time in franchise history by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 53\u201322\u20137. The 53 wins and 113 points both set franchise records. In the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Rangers dispatched the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the first round. The Rangers then came back from a 3\u20131 series deficit to win their second-round series against the Capitals in seven games, becoming the first team in NHL history to battle back from a 3\u20131 deficit in back-to-back seasons and sending the Rangers to the conference finals for the third time in four years. However, the Lightning shutout the Rangers 2\u20130 in game seven, ending the Rangers' season and marking the first occasion the Rangers had ever lost a game seven at home in franchise history.\nOn June 27, 2015, the Rangers traded Carl Hagelin to the Anaheim Ducks, Cam Talbot and a draft pick to the Edmonton Oilers, and prospect Ryan Haggerty to the Chicago Blackhawks for goaltender Antti Raanta. On July 1, Glen Sather resigned as the general manager, with Jeff Gorton taking his place. On July 2, Martin St. Louis announced his retirement. The team then re-signed Jesper Fast, J. T. Miller, and Derek Stepan.\nThe Rangers started the 2015\u201316 season with a 14\u20132\u20132 record after 18 games, including a nine-game winning streak. The Rangers finished the season with 101 points. In the 2016 playoffs, the Rangers were eliminated in the first round by the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nRebuilding (2016\u20132020).\nOn July 18, 2016, the Rangers traded Derick Brassard and a 2018 seventh-round draft pick in exchange for Mika Zibanejad and a 2018 second-round draft pick. The team also signed Michael Grabner to a two-year deal and Jimmy Vesey to a two-year entry-level contract. The Rangers finished 2016\u201317 in fourth place in the Metropolitan Division with 102 points. In the first round of the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, they won their series with the Montreal Canadiens in six games. They lost in the second round to the Ottawa Senators in six games.\nOn June 14, 2017, the Rangers announced a buyout of Dan Girardi's contract. Just over a week later, the Rangers traded Derek Stepan and Antti Raanta to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for a first-round draft pick (seventh overall) and former first-round pick Tony DeAngelo. Rangers' management also signed top free agent defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk to a four-year deal. By February 8, 2018, the team had a 25\u201324\u20135 record, leading the front office to issue a social media post to fans announcing the Rangers would be committing to a rebuild and may \"lose some familiar faces\" in the process. Rick Nash was traded the day before the 2018 NHL trade deadline to the Bruins for a 2018 first-round pick, a 2019 seventh-round pick, Matt Beleskey, Ryan Spooner and Ryan Lindgren. The following day, the Rangers traded captain Ryan McDonagh and J. T. Miller to the Tampa Bay Lightning for picks and prospects. With the team missing the playoffs for the first time since 2010 and placing last in the Metropolitan Division, head coach Vigneault was fired at the conclusion of the season.\nOn May 23, David Quinn was hired as the team's new head coach. During the offseason, Hayes, Vesey, Brady Skjei and Spooner all filed for salary arbitration and all were re-signed. Gorton and his team remained committed to a rebuild in the 2018\u201319 season; the Rangers traded away veteran players at the deadline, including Kevin Hayes and Mats Zuccarello, who was sent to the Dallas Stars in exchange for two draft picks.\nThe Rangers received the second overall pick in the 2019 NHL entry draft, and used it to select forward Kaapo Kakko. On May 17, 2019, former Ranger goaltender and broadcaster John Davidson resigned from his position as president of the Columbus Blue Jackets and returned to New York to become the organization's new president. Davidson and Gorton addressed the team's defensive woes by acquiring top prospect Adam Fox from Carolina for a pair of picks, as well as defenseman Jacob Trouba. The team also signed free agent Artemi Panarin to a seven-year deal on July 1.\nThe 2019\u201320 season saw significant improvement; Panarin earned a Hart Trophy nomination, Chris Kreider signed a seven-year contract extension, and Mika Zibanejad recorded a five-goal game against Washington on March 5 and ended up with 41 goals in 57 games played. By early March 2020, the Rangers were within striking distance of the second wild card position when the coronavirus pandemic halted the regular season. In May 2020, the league announced a 24-team playoff tournament to complete the season, where the Rangers were seeded 11th and faced the Carolina Hurricanes; the Hurricanes swept the Rangers. After being eliminated from the playoffs the Rangers were entered into the second phase of the NHL draft lottery where the team won the lottery and were awarded the first pick in the 2020 NHL entry draft, which Gorton used to select Alexis Lafreniere. Later in the offseason, the team traded veteran defenseman Marc Staal to the Red Wings.\nIn September 2020, the Rangers bought out the final year of Henrik Lundqvist's contract, ending his tenure in New York after 15 years.\nThe Drury years (2020\u2013present).\nContinued team struggles (2020\u20132021).\nOn January 31, 2021, defenseman Tony DeAngelo was placed on waivers, following reports that he had an altercation with teammate Alexandar Georgiev following an overtime loss. According to \"The Athletic,\" his continued \"maturity\" issues, combined with a marked decline in his play, led the Rangers to put him on the market; there were no takers. In a game against the Washington Capitals on May 3, 2021, Capitals forward Tom Wilson cross-checked Pavel Buchnevich in the head and slammed Artemi Panarin into the ice, ending his season. Wilson, a repeat offender, was fined the league maximum of $5,000 for the incident. The Rangers organization released a statement expressing disappointment in this decision, calling head of player safety George Parros \"unfit to continue in his current role\". The NHL subsequently fined the Rangers $250,000 for their comments. Two days later, Rangers owner James Dolan fired president John Davidson and general manager Jeff Gorton. Despite the timing, Dolan stated the firings were not related to the Wilson incident and statement, citing \"culture\" issues within the organization. Chris Drury was then announced as the Rangers' new president and general manager. On May 12, Drury fired head coach David Quinn, and replaced him with Gerard Gallant. Despite a tumultuous season, a major bright spot was the play of Adam Fox; he led NHL defensemen with 42 assists, finished second in points with 47, and won the James Norris Memorial Trophy.\nPlayoff return and fourth Presidents' Trophy (2021\u2013present).\nThe Rangers finished the 2021\u201322 season with a record of 52\u201324\u20136. For the third time in franchise history, the Rangers overcame a 3\u20131 series deficit, this time against the Pittsburgh Penguins in a first round matchup that concluded with a game-winning overtime goal from Artemi Panarin. After defeating the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games, they faced the back-to-back defending champions, the Tampa Bay Lightning, and lost the series in six games despite a 2\u20130 series lead. Igor Shesterkin was named the Vezina Trophy winner following the season's conclusion. By the end of the following season, the Rangers had acquired Vladimir Tarasenko and Niko Mikkola from the St. Louis Blues and Patrick Kane from the Blackhawks, but lost to their river rivals, the New Jersey Devils, in the first round of the playoffs. Gallant was then fired as head coach and replaced with Peter Laviolette.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the Rangers clinched their fourth Presidents' Trophy, and in the first round of the 2024 playoffs swept the Washington Capitals. After defeating the Carolina Hurricanes in the second round, they lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers in the conference finals. Despite this run, the following season was disastrous, as the Rangers became the fourth team in NHL history to miss the playoffs after winning the Presidents' Trophy the prior season and the first to do it twice. Veteran players, such as Chris Kreider and Mika Zibanejad, received significant criticism throughout the season, captain Jacob Trouba, Kaapo Kakko, and Filip Chytil were traded, and Laviolette was fired at the end of the season.\nOn May 2, 2025, Mike Sullivan was named head coach. Later that offseason, Chris Kreider was traded to the Anaheim Ducks after a 13-year career with the Rangers.\nUniforms.\nThe classic Rangers sweater has been in use since the franchise's foundation, with several alterations along the way. The current blue uniform has the serifed word \"RANGERS\" in red and white drop shadow arranged diagonally, with red and white stripes on the sleeves and tail. Originally, the uniform was light blue, before it switched to a darker classic Rangers \"Broadway Blue\" in 1929. In addition, the original versions neither had a drop shadow nor were serifed. During the 1946\u201347 season, the word \"RANGERS\" was arranged in an arch form above the sweater number. It adopted its current form the next season, along with dropshadowed numbers, except for a brief period where the city name was used, a tie-down collar was not used and the tail and sleeve stripes were separated by thin blue stripes. Red pants have been used with the uniform since the 1929\u201330 season.\nThe white jerseys were first unveiled in the 1951\u201352 season, as part of a mandate that regulated NHL teams to have a dark home jersey and a light away jersey. The serifed word \"RANGERS\" is also arranged diagonally, but in blue with red drop shadow. A quinticolor of blue, white and red stripes accentuate the tail and sleeves, while a blue shoulder yoke with white and red stripes completes the look. The white sweaters, with minor changes such as a tie-down collar and arched player names, have remained virtually unchanged since.\nDuring the tenure of general manager John Ferguson Sr., he sought to modernize the Rangers sweater by featuring rounded numbers, a darker shade of blue and the shield logo, which was unveiled in the 1976\u201377 season. A blue and red stripe (white and red stripe in the blue sweaters) extend from the yoke to the sleeves, while blue pants were used. However, it proved unpopular with the fans, and following the 1977\u201378 season it was replaced by an updated version of their classic uniforms. Ferguson used this similar design when he became general manager of the original Winnipeg Jets.\nThe modernized classic uniforms introduced in 1978 featured some subtle changes. Both jerseys featured a V-neck collar in a red-white-red pattern, and bolder stripes on the sleeves and waistline. On the blue jersey, the red and white stripes were separated by thin blue stripes, along with the waistline stripes being raised above the hemline so that the patterns on both jerseys matched. From 1978 to 1987, the blue jersey (then the road jersey) featured \"NEW YORK\" diagonally across the front instead of the traditional \"RANGERS\" wordmark, similar to their 2010s heritage alternate jerseys. In 1997, the Rangers reverted the blue jersey's design, restoring the old striping pattern, and becoming the first team to re-introduce lace-up collars. The white jerseys followed suit in 1999, and the design was carried over to the Reebok Edge template in 2007.\nOn October 7, 2001, the Rangers wore a modified version of their blue jerseys in a home game against the Buffalo Sabres. This design combined the current/traditional striping with the \"NEW YORK\" wordmark of the 1978\u20131987 uniforms. The uniforms were worn in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\nThe Rangers previously had a navy alternate jersey featuring the head of the Statue of Liberty with the team abbreviation (NYR) below in a futuristic script. Silver was used as an accent color, but the player names and numbers retain the same color schemes as the regular jerseys, except for a darker shade of blue. Other than a white version used in the 1998\u201399 season, this jersey was used from 1996 to 2007, and proved to be highly popular with fans.\nDuring the 2010\u201311 season, the Rangers debuted a heritage blue jersey as their new alternate uniform. The jersey featured a darker shade of blue, as well as a cream trim. Unlike the regular jerseys, the font of the alternate was sans-serif and did not feature a dropshadow, much like the original Rangers jersey. The Rangers wore the jerseys at home on Saturdays and when they played against Original Six teams. For the 2017\u201318 season, the heritage jersey was retired because of the league-wide switch to the Adidas uniform format.\nIn the 2012 Winter Classic, the Rangers wore a cream jersey combining classic and current styles. A different version of the shield logo was used, while the player names were arranged in a straight line. The stripes were also lessened, giving it a minimalist, vintage look, as most Winter Classic jerseys are.\nFor the 2014 Stadium Series, the Rangers used white jerseys with the city name in navy, silver and red. In addition, they feature diagonal stripes and sleeve numbers, and enlarged numbers on the back to make them more readable to spectators. The chrome version of the shield logo is placed in the left shoulder. Like the Winter Classic sweaters, player names are in a straight position.\nThe 2018 Winter Classic saw the Rangers wear a navy jersey with a combination of elements from prior uniform designs. The striping design was inspired from their current uniforms, while the white \"RANGERS\" wordmark was a nod from the team's late 1920s jerseys. A white silhouette of the Rangers' shield logo contained either the abbreviation \"N.Y.\" or the alternate captain \"A\" and captain \"C\" designations. Player names are arranged in a straight position.\nDuring the 2020\u201321 season, the Rangers released a \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform in collaboration with Adidas. The uniform featured the \"Lady Liberty\" design worn from 1996 to 2007, but with a few changes in the striping. This same design was again used for their 2022\u201323 \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, but the lighter Broadway Blue served as the base color while the lower sleeves were recolored red with white and navy stripes.\nIntroduced in the 2023\u201324 season, the Rangers began wearing a new third jersey, bringing back the shield logo as the main crest for the first time since the 1976\u20131978 redesign. The navy blue-based jersey features thin white, red and Broadway blue stripes on the sleeves, waist and socks, along with white letters.\nFor the 2024 Stadium Series, the Rangers wore white jerseys with an enlarged \"NYR\" diagonal lettering in red with blue drop shadows. Enlarged numbers also employ the same color scheme as the \"NYR\" wordmark, along with thick alternating blue and red sleeve stripes.\nThe Rangers unveiled their centennial edition jersey ahead of the 2025\u201326 season. Based on their inaugural 1926\u201327 uniform, it featured a light blue base with the traditional red and cream stripes, and cream letters featuring the sans-serif \"RANGERS\" written diagonally in white. The 100th anniversary patch was placed on the left shoulder, and a sponsor patch featuring sports and entertainment brand \"Game 7\" was placed on the right shoulder. A cream variation with a diagonal sans-serif \"NEW YORK\" wordmark serves as their uniform for the 2026 NHL Winter Classic.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Rangers.

{"id": "66886", "revid": "14984434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66886", "title": "The Datsuns", "text": "Hard rock band from Cambridge, New Zealand\nThe Datsuns are a hard rock band from Cambridge, New Zealand, formed in 1998. Founding mainstays are Rudolf \"Dolf\" de Borst on vocals and bass guitar, and Christian Livingstone and Phil Somervell, both on guitar. They have released seven albums, with their debut self-titled album from October 2002 peaking at no.\u00a01 in New Zealand and reaching the top\u00a020 on the United Kingdom's Official Charts. They had relocated to London in 2002. Their second album, \"Outta Sight/Outta Mind\" (May 2004), appeared at no.\u00a07 in New Zealand and top\u00a060 in the UK. \"Smoke &amp; Mirrors\" (2006) peaked in the top\u00a020 in New Zealand. Early drummer Matt Osment was replaced by Ben Cole after that album. Their top\u00a040 singles in the UK are \"In Love\" and \"Harmonic Generator\" (both in 2002). In New Zealand, their highest-charting single, \"Stuck Here for Days\" (2006), reached the top\u00a030.\nHistory.\nIn 1995, while still at secondary school in Cambridge, New Zealand, Rudolf \"Dolf\" de Borst on vocals and bass guitar, Matt Osment on drums, and Phil Somervell on guitar formed a hard rock band, Trinket. Christian Livingstone joined in 1997 as their second guitarist and they entered a Battle of the Bands competition.\nIn 1998, they changed their name to the Datsuns, and initially each member used the band's name as their last name; de Borst performed as Dolf D. Datsun. As the Datsuns they won a Battle of the Bands. They supported Swedish band, the Hellacopters, at a concert in Hamilton in October 1998. The group secured another support slot in May 2000, behind Canadian visitors, the Smugglers. In August of that year, the Datsuns released their first single, \"Super Gyration\", on 7-inch vinyl only. They supported the White Stripes in November that year. Their early material was issued on their own label, Hellsquad Records. They toured Australia in March 2001 and then relocated to London to try the United Kingdom market.\nIn 2002 after appearing on John Peel's programme on the BBC Radio 1, the Datsuns were lauded by the UK music press, including in a front cover article in \"NME\". The band signed with V2 Records in July of that year. Their self-titled debut album appeared in October, which reached no.\u00a017 in the UK and number-one in New Zealand. Its third single, \"In Love\" (2002), peaked in the top\u00a030 in the UK. The band toured Australia in 2002 with Melbourne bands the Specimens and the Casanovas, as well as playing a live to air on PBS radio. The group won numerous awards including \"NME\"'s 'Best Live Band' and New Zealand Music Awards for 'Best Album', 'Best Group' and 'Breakthrough Artist'.\nThe Datsuns performed at Ozzfest in 2003 on the main stage supporting Ozzy Osbourne, Marilyn Manson, Korn and Disturbed. They also played the main stage of the 2004 and 2009 Big Day Out festivals, and opened for Metallica on their Australian tour in 2004. Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich had previously praised the Datsuns on the revival debut of \"Headbangers Ball\", before playing their video for \"In Love.\" Their second album, \"Outta Sight/Outta Mind\" (May 2004), was produced by Led Zeppelin member John Paul Jones. It reached no.\u00a07 in New Zealand, top\u00a050 in Australia and top\u00a060 in the UK. Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll compared the first two albums, where during their studio sessions \"[they] just pressed record and played the songs they'd been playing live. The lyrics for the first album were stream of consciousness, the lyrics for the second album [were] more considered having been refined while on the road.\"\nIn October 2006 the Datsuns released their third album, \"Smoke &amp; Mirrors\", which peaked in the top\u00a020 in New Zealand. The album was met with generally positive reviews, although it was not reviewed as widely as the band's first two efforts. Its lead single, \"Stuck Here for Days\" (2006), appeared in the top\u00a030 in New Zealand. After the album's release, Osment was replaced on drums by Ben Cole \u2013 also from Cambridge. The Datsuns toured New Zealand with Shihad during the Christmas to New Year period in 2006 to 2007. The group relocated to Germany and completed a tour of Europe to promote \"Smoke &amp; Mirrors\". Although they mostly played in locations they previously had not visited, they managed to sell out the majority of their European dates.\nThe band's fourth album, \"Headstunts\" (an anagram of \"the Datsuns\"), was released on 6 October 2008. They toured New Zealand, Australia and North America, showcasing new material, \"Eye of the Needle\", \"Human Error\", \"So Long\", \"Hey Paranoid People What's in Your Head\", \"Your Bones\" and released a limited edition single, \"Highschool Hoodlums\". The quartet then embarked on a tour of the UK and the rest of Europe. The Datsuns' fifth studio album, \"Death Rattle Boogie\", appeared in October 2012. It had been recorded in Stockholm at Gutterview Recorders, with additional work at Roundhead Studios in New Zealand, and was produced by former Hellacopters frontman Nicke Andersson.

{"id": "66890", "revid": "11099276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66890", "title": "People's Liberation Army", "text": "Combined military forces of the People's Republic of China\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the military of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). It consists of four services\u2014Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force\u2014and four arms\u2014Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, Information Support Force, and Joint Logistics Support Force. It operates under the absolute leadership of the CCP and is led by the Central Military Commission (CMC) with its chairman as commander-in-chief.\nThe PLA can trace its origins during the Republican era to the left-wing units of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) of the Kuomintang (KMT), when they broke away in 1927 in an uprising against the nationalist government as the Chinese Red Army before being reintegrated into the NRA as units of New Fourth Army and Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The two NRA communist units were reconstituted as the PLA in 1947. Since 1949, the PLA has used nine different military strategies, which it calls \"strategic guidelines\". The most important came in 1956, 1980, and 1993. Politically, the PLA and the paramilitary People's Armed Police (PAP) have the largest delegation in the National People's Congress (NPC); the joint delegation currently has 281 deputies\u2014over 9% of the total\u2014all of whom are CCP members.\nThe PLA is not a traditional nation-state military. It is the armed wing of the CCP and controlled by the party, not by the state. The PLA's primary mission is the defense of the party and its interests. The PLA is the guarantor of the party's survival and rule, and the party prioritizes maintaining control and the loyalty of the PLA. According to Chinese law, the party has leadership over the armed forces and the CMC exercises supreme military command; the party and state CMCs are practically a single body by membership. Since 1989, the CCP general secretary has also been the CMC Chairman; this grants significant political power as the only member of the Politburo Standing Committee with direct responsibilities for the armed forces. The Ministry of National Defense has no command authority; it is the PLA's interface with state and foreign entities and insulates the PLA from external influence.\nToday, the majority of military units around the country are assigned to one of five theatre commands by geographical location. In addition to wartime arrangements, the PLA is also involved in the peacetime operations of other components of the armed forces. This is particularly visible in maritime territorial disputes where the navy is heavily involved in the planning, coordination and execution of operations by the PAP's China Coast Guard. The PLA is the world's largest military force (not including paramilitary or reserve forces) and has the second largest defence budget in the world. China's military expenditure was US$314\u00a0billion in 2024, accounting for 12 percent of the world's defence expenditures. It is also one of the fastest modernizing militaries in the world, and has been termed as a potential military superpower, with significant regional defence and rising global power projection capabilities.\nMission.\nThe PLA's primary mission is the defense of the CCP and its interests. It is the guarantor of the party's survival and rule, and the party prioritizes maintaining control and the loyalty of the PLA. \nIn 2004, paramount leader Hu Jintao stated the mission of the PLA as:\nChina describes its military posture as active defense, defined in a 2015 state white paper as \"We will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked.\"41\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe CCP founded its military wing on 1 August 1927 during the Nanchang uprising, beginning the Chinese Civil War. Communist elements of the National Revolutionary Army rebelled under the leadership of Zhu De, He Long, Ye Jianying, Zhou Enlai, and other leftist elements of the Kuomintang (KMT) after the Shanghai massacre in 1927. They were then known as the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, or simply the Red Army. In 1934 and 1935, the Red Army survived several campaigns led against it by Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang and engaged in the Long March.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945, the CCP's military forces were nominally integrated into the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, forming two main units, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. During this time, these two military groups primarily employed guerrilla tactics, generally avoiding large-scale battles with the Japanese, and at the same time consolidating by recruiting KMT troops and paramilitary forces behind Japanese lines into their forces.\nAfter the Japanese surrender in 1945, the CCP continued to use the National Revolutionary Army unit structures, until the decision was made in February 1947 to merge the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army. On October 10, 1947, the \"Manifesto of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\" was published, renaming the new million-strong force the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The reorganization was completed by late 1948. The PLA eventually won the Chinese Civil War, establishing the People's Republic of China in 1949.\nEstablishment of the People's Republic of China.\nAfter the establishment of the PRC, the PLA underwent a drastic reorganization, with the establishment of the Air Force leadership structure in November 1949, followed by the Navy leadership structure the following April.\nIn this early period, the People's Liberation Army overwhelmingly consisted of peasants. Its treatment of soldiers and officers was egalitarian and formal ranks were not adopted until 1955. As a result of its egalitarian organization, the early PLA overturned strict traditional hierarchies that governed the lives of peasants. As sociologist Alessandro Russo summarizes, the peasant composition of the PLA hierarchy was a radical break with Chinese societal norms and \"overturned the strict traditional hierarchies in unprecedented forms of egalitarianism[.]\" During the 1950s, the PLA with Soviet assistance began to transform itself from a peasant army into a modern one.\nIn the PRC's early years, the PLA was a dominant foreign policy institution in the country.17 Since 1949, China has used nine different military strategies, which the PLA calls \"strategic guidelines\". The most important came in 1956, 1980, and 1993.\nIn November 1950, some units of the PLA under the name of the People's Volunteer Army intervened in the Korean War as United Nations forces under General Douglas MacArthur approached the Yalu River. Under the weight of this offensive, Chinese forces drove MacArthur's forces out of North Korea and captured Seoul, but were subsequently pushed back south of Pyongyang north of the 38th Parallel. The war also catalyzed the rapid modernization of the PLAAF.\nIn 1962, the PLA Ground Force also fought India in the Sino-Indian War. In a series of border clashes in 1967 with Indian troops, the PLA suffered heavy numerical and tactical losses.\nBefore the Cultural Revolution, military region commanders tended to remain in their posts for long periods. The longest-serving military region commanders were Xu Shiyou in the Nanjing Military Region (1954\u201374), Yang Dezhi in the Jinan Military Region (1958\u201374), Chen Xilian in the Shenyang Military Region (1959\u201373), and Han Xianchu in the Fuzhou Military Region (1960\u201374). In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the PLA abandoned the use of the military ranks that it had adopted in 1955. The Central Military Commission had deemed that ranks were an expression of bourgeois right and hierarchy which led to individualist attitudes, inequality, and a sense of disunity.165 \nThe establishment of a professional military force equipped with modern weapons and doctrine was the last of the Four Modernizations announced by Zhou Enlai and supported by Deng Xiaoping. In keeping with Deng's mandate to reform, the PLA has demobilized millions of men and women since 1978 and has introduced modern methods in such areas as recruitment and manpower, strategy, and education and training. In 1979, the PLA fought Vietnam over a border skirmish in the Sino-Vietnamese War where both sides claimed victory. However, western analysts generally agree that Vietnam handily outperformed the PLA.\nDuring the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between China and the Soviet Union resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing of each other's adversaries. China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's enemies in Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anticommunist militants. China responded to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by supporting the Afghan mujahidin and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang. China acquired military equipment from the United States to defend itself from Soviet attacks.\nThe PLA Ground Force trained and supported the Afghan Mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan War, moving its training camps for the mujahideen from Pakistan into China itself. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of anti-aircraft missiles, rocket launchers, and machine guns were given to the Mujahideen by the Chinese. Chinese military advisors and army troops were also present with the Mujahideen during training.\nSince 1980.\nIn 1981, the PLA conducted its largest military exercise in North China since the founding of the People's Republic.\nIn the late 1980s, the central government had increasing expenditures and limited revenue.43 The central government encouraged its agencies and encouraged local governments to expand their services and pursue revenues.43 The PLA established businesses including hotels and restaurants.43 The PLA gained more autonomy and permission to engage in commercial activities in exchange for a reduced role in political affairs and limited budgets; the military was downsized to free resources for economic development. The lack of oversight, ineffective self-regulation, and Jiang Zemin's and Hu Jintao's lack of close personal ties to the PLA led to systemic corruption that persisted through the late-2010s. Jiang's attempt to divest the PLA of its commercial interests was only partially successful, as many were still run by close associates of PLA officers. Corruption lowered readiness and proficiency, was a barrier to modernization and professionalization, and eroded party control. The 2010s anti-corruption campaigns and military reforms under Xi Jinping from the early-2010s were in part executed to address these problems.\nFollowing the PLA's suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, ideological correctness was temporarily revived as the dominant theme in Chinese military affairs. Reform and modernization have today resumed their position as the PLA's primary objectives, although the armed forces' political loyalty to the CCP has remained a leading concern.\nBeginning in the 1980s, the PLA tried to transform itself from a land-based power centered on a vast ground force to a smaller, more mobile, high-tech one capable of mounting operations beyond its borders. The motivation for this was that a massive land invasion by Russia was no longer seen as a major threat, and the new threats to China are seen to be a declaration of independence by Taiwan, possibly with assistance from the United States, or a confrontation over the Spratly Islands.\nIn 1985, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the CMC, the PLA changed from being constantly prepared to \"hit early, strike hard, and to fight a nuclear war\" to developing the military in an era of peace. The PLA reoriented itself to modernization, improving its fighting ability, and becoming a world-class force. Deng Xiaoping stressed that the PLA needed to focus more on quality rather than on quantity.\nThe decision of the Chinese government in 1985 to reduce the size of the military by one million was completed by 1987. Staffing in military leadership was cut by about 50 percent. During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996\u20132000) the PLA was reduced by a further 500,000. The PLA had also been expected to be reduced by another 200,000 by 2005. The PLA has focused on increasing mechanization and informatization to be able to fight a high-intensity war.\nFormer CMC chairman Jiang in 1990 called on the military to \"meet political standards, be militarily competent, have a good working style, adhere strictly to discipline, and provide vigorous logistic support\" (). The 1991 Gulf War provided the Chinese leadership with a stark realization that the PLA was an oversized, almost-obsolete force. The USA's sending of two aircraft carrier groups to the vicinity of Taiwan during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis prompted Jiang to order a ten-year PLA modernization program.\nThe possibility of a militarized Japan has also been a continuous concern to the Chinese leadership since the late 1990s. In addition, China's military leadership has been reacting to and learning from the successes and failures of the United States Armed Forces during the Kosovo War, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the Iraqi insurgency. All these lessons inspired China to transform the PLA from a military based on quantity to one based on quality. Chairman Jiang Zemin officially made a \"revolution in military affairs\" (RMA) part of the official national military strategy in 1993 to modernize the Chinese armed forces.\nA goal of the RMA is to transform the PLA into a force capable of winning what it calls \"local wars under high-tech conditions\" rather than a massive, numbers-dominated ground-type war. Chinese military planners call for short decisive campaigns, limited in both their geographic scope and their political goals. In contrast to the past, more attention is given to reconnaissance, mobility, and deep reach. This new vision has shifted resources towards the navy and air force. The PLA is also actively preparing for space warfare and cyber-warfare.\nIn 2002, the PLA began holding military exercises with militaries from other countries.242 From 2018 to 2023, more than half of these exercises have focused on military training other than war, generally antipiracy, or antiterrorism exercises involving combatting non-state actors.242 In 2009, the PLA held its first military exercise in Africa, a humanitarian and medical training practice conducted in Gabon.242\nFor the past 10 to 20 years, the PLA has acquired some advanced weapons systems from Russia, including Sovremenny class destroyers, Sukhoi Su-27 and Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines. It has also started to produce several new classes of destroyers and frigates including the Type 052D class guided-missile destroyer. In addition, the PLAAF has designed its very own Chengdu J-10 fighter aircraft and a new stealth fighter, the Chengdu J-20. The PLA launched the new Jin class nuclear submarines on 3 December 2004 capable of launching nuclear warheads that could strike targets across the Pacific Ocean and have three aircraft carriers, with the latest, the Fujian, launched in 2022.\nFrom 2014 to 2015, the PLA deployed 524 medical staff on a rotational basis to combat the Ebola virus outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau.245 As of 2023, this was the PLA's largest medical assistance mission in another country.245\nChina re-organized its military from 2015 to 2016. In 2015, the PLA formed new units including the PLA Ground Force, the PLA Rocket Force, and the PLA Strategic Support Force. In 2016, the CMC replaced the four traditional military departments with a number of new bodies. China replaced its system of seven military regions with newly established Theater Commands: Northern, Southern, Western, Eastern, and Central.289 In the prior system, operations were segmented by military branch and region.289 In contrast, each Theater Command is intended to function as a unified entity with joint operations across different military branches.289\nThe PLA on 1 August 2017 marked its 90th anniversary. Before the big anniversary it mounted its biggest parade yet and the first outside of Beijing, held in the Zhurihe Training Base in the Northern Theater Command (within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region).\nIn December 2023, Reuters reported a military leadership purge after high-ranking generals were ousted from the National People's Congress. Prior to 2017, over sixty generals were investigated and sacked.\nOverseas deployments and peacekeeping operations.\nIn addition to its Support Base in Djibouti, the PLA operates a base in Tajikistan and a listening station in Cuba. The Espacio Lejano Station in Argentina is operated by a PLA unit. The PLAN has also undertaken rotational deployments of its warships at the Ream Naval Base in Cambodia.\nThe People's Republic of China has sent the PLA to various hotspots as part of China's role as a prominent member of the United Nations. Such units usually include engineers and logistical units and members of the paramilitary People's Armed Police and have been deployed as part of peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Haiti, and more recently, Mali and South Sudan.\nEngagements.\nAs of at least early 2024, China has not fought a war since 1979 and has only fought relatively minor conflicts since.72\nOrganization.\nThe PLA is a component of the armed forces of China, which also includes the PAP, the reserves, and the militia. The armed forces are controlled by the CCP under the doctrine of \"the Party commands the gun\". The PLA and the PAP have the largest delegation in the National People's Congress (NPC), which are elected by servicemember election committees of top-level military subdivisions, including the PLA's theater commands and service branches. At the 14th National People's Congress; the joint delegation has 281 deputies\u2014over 9% of the total\u2014all of whom are CCP members.\nCentral Military Commission.\nThe PLA is governed by the Central Military Commission (CMC); under the arrangement of \"one institution with two names\", there exists a state CMC and a Party CMC, although both commissions have identical personnel, organization and function, and effectively work as a single body. The only difference in membership between the two occurs for a few months every five years, during the period between a Party National Congress, when Party CMC membership changes, and the next ensuing National People's Congress, when the state CMC changes.\nThe CMC is composed of a chairman, vice chairpersons and regular members. The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA, with the post generally held by the paramount leader of China; since 1989, the post has generally been held together with the CCP general secretary. Unlike in other countries, the Ministry of National Defense and its Minister do not have command authority, largely acting as diplomatic liaisons of the CMC, insulating the PLA from external influence. However, except for the current incumbent, Admiral Dong Jun, the Minister has always been a member of the CMC.\nThe Membership of the Central Military Commission\nPreviously, the PLA was governed by four general departments; the General Political, the General Logistics, the General Armament, and the General Staff Departments. These were abolished in 2016 under the military reforms undertaken by Xi Jinping, replaced with 15 new functional departments directly reporting to the CMC:\nIncluded among the 15 departments are three commissions. The CMC Discipline Inspection Commission is charged with rooting out corruption.\nPolitical leadership.\nThe CCP maintains absolute control over the PLA. It requires the PLA to undergo political education, instilling CCP ideology in its members. Additionally, China maintains a political commissar system. Regiment-level and higher units maintain CCP committees and political commissars (). Additionally, battalion-level and company-level units respectively maintain political directors and political instructors. The political commissars are officially equal to commanders in status. The political commissars are officially responsible for the implementation of party committee decisions, instilling and maintaining party discipline, providing political education, and working with other components of the political work system.\nKey decisions in the PLA are generally made in the CCP committees throughout the military. As a rule, the political commissar serves as the party committee secretary while the commander serves as the deputy secretary. Political commissars report to higher-level party committees, rather than military commanders. Due to the CCP's absolute leadership, non-CCP political parties and groups and organizations except the Communist Youth League of China are not allowed to establish organizations or have members in the PLA. Additionally, only the CCP is allowed to appoint the leading cadres at all levels of the PLA.\nGrades.\nGrades determine the command hierarchy from the CMC to the platoon level. Entities command lower-graded entities, and coordinate with like-graded entities. An organization's grade impacts the resources allocated to it.89 Since 1988, all organizations, billets, and officers in the PLA have a grade.\nCivil\u2013military relations within the wider state bureaucracy is also influenced by grades. The grading systems used by the armed forces and the government are parallel, making it easier for military entities to identify the civilian entities they should coordinate with.\nAn officer's authority, eligibility for billets, pay, and retirement age is determined by grade. Career progression includes lateral transfers between billets of the same grade, but which are not considered promotions. An officer retiring to the civil service has their grade translated to the civil grade system; their grade continues to progress and draw retirement benefits through the civil system rather than the armed forces.\nHistorically, an officer's grade \u2014 or position () \u2014 was more important than their \"rank\" (). Historically, time-in-grade and time-in-rank requirements and promotions were not synchronized; multiple ranks were present in each grade with all having the same authority. Rank was mainly a visual aid to roughly determine relative position when interacting with Chinese and foreign personnel. PLA etiquette preferred addressing personnel by position rather than by rank. Reforms to a more rank-centric system began in 2021. In 2023, a revised grade structure associated one rank per grade, with some ranks spanning multiple grades.\nOperational control.\nOperational control of combat units is divided between the service headquarters and domestic geographically based theatre commands.\nTheatre commands are multi-service (\"joint\") organizations that are broadly responsible for strategy, plans, tactics, and policy specific to their assigned area of responsibility. In wartime, they will likely have full control of subordinate units; in peacetime, units also report to their service headquarters. Force-building is the responsibility of the services and the CMC. The five theatre commands, in order of stated significance are:\nThe service headquarters retain operational control in some areas within China and outside of China. For example, army headquarters controls or is responsible for the Beijing Garrison, the Tibet Military District, the Xinjiang Military District, and border and coastal defences. The counterpiracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden are controlled by navy headquarters. The JSD nominally controls operations beyond China's periphery, but in practice this seems to apply only to army operations.\nServices and theater commands have the same grade. The overlap of areas or units of responsibility may create disputes requiring CMC arbitration.\nAs part of the 2015 reforms, military regions were replaced by theatre commands in 2016. Military regions were \u2212 uinlike the theatre commands \u2212 army-centric peacetime administrative organizations, and joint wartime commands were created on-demand by the army-dominated General Staff Department.\nAcademic institutions.\nThere are two academic institutions directly subordinate to the CMC, the National Defense University and the National University of Defense Technology, and they are considered the two top military education institutions in China. There are also 35 institutions affiliated to the PLA's branches and arms, and 7 institutions affiliated to the People's Armed Police.\nService branches.\nThe PLA consists of four services (Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force) and four arms (Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, Information Support Force, and Joint Logistics Support Force).\nServices.\nThe PLA maintains four services (): the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Rocket Force. Following the 200,000 and 300,000 personnel reduction announced in 2003 and 2005 respectively, the total strength of the PLA has been reduced from 2.5\u00a0million to around 2\u00a0million. The reductions came mainly from non-combat ground forces, which would allow more funds to be diverted to naval, air, and strategic missile forces. This shows China's shift from ground force prioritization to emphasizing air and naval power with high-tech equipment for offensive roles over disputed territories, particularly in the South China Sea.\nGround Force.\nThe PLA Ground Force (PLAGF) is the largest of the PLA's five services with 960,000 active duty personnel, approximately half of the PLA's total manpower of around 2 million personnel. The PLAGF is organized into twelve active duty group armies sequentially numbered from the 71st Group Army to the 83rd Group Army which are distributed to each of the PRC's five theatre commands, receiving two to three group armies per command. In wartime, numerous PLAGF reserve and paramilitary units may be mobilized to augment these active group armies. The PLAGF reserve component comprises approximately 510,000 personnel divided into thirty infantry and twelve anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) divisions. The PLAGF is led by Commander Liu Zhenli and Political Commissar Qin Shutong.\nNavy.\nUntil the early 1990s, the PLA Navy (PLAN) performed a subordinate role to the PLA Ground Force (PLAGF). Since then it has undergone rapid modernisation. The 300,000 strong PLAN is organized into three major fleets: the North Sea Fleet headquartered at Qingdao, the East Sea Fleet headquartered at Ningbo, and the South Sea Fleet headquartered in Zhanjiang. Each fleet consists of a number of surface ship, submarine, naval air force, coastal defence, and marine units.\nThe navy includes a 25,000 strong Marine Corps (organised into seven brigades), a 18,000 strong Naval Aviation Force operating several hundred attack helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. As part of its overall programme of naval modernisation, the PLAN is in the stage of developing a blue water navy. In November 2012, then Party General Secretary Hu Jintao reported to the CCP's 18th National Congress his desire to \"enhance our capacity for exploiting marine resource and build China into a strong maritime power\". According to the United States Department of Defense, the PLAN has numerically the largest navy in the world. The PLAN is led by Commander Dong Jun and Political Commissar Yuan Huazhi.\nAir Force.\nThe 403,000 strong People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) was organized into five Theatre Command Air Forces (TCAF) and 24 air divisions. As of 2024[ [update]], the system has been changed into 11 Corps Deputy-grade \"Bases\" controlling air brigades. Divisions have been mostly converted to brigades, although some (specifically the Bomber divisions, and some of the special mission units) remain operational as divisions. The largest operational units within the Aviation Corps is the air division, which has 2 to 3 aviation regiments, each with 20 to 36 aircraft. An Air Brigade has from 24 to 50 aircraft.\nThe surface-to-air missile (SAM) Corps is organized into SAM divisions and brigades. There are also three airborne divisions manned by the PLAAF. J-XX and XXJ are names applied by Western intelligence agencies to describe programs by the People's Republic of China to develop one or more fifth-generation fighter aircraft. The PLAAF is led by Commander Chang Dingqiu and Political Commissar Guo Puxiao.\nRocket Force.\nThe People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) is the main strategic missile force of the PLA and consists of at least 125,000 personnel. It controls China's nuclear and conventional strategic missiles. China's total nuclear arsenal size is estimated to be between 100 and 400 thermonuclear warheads. The PLARF is organized into bases sequentially numbered from 61 through 67, wherein the first six are operational and allocated to the nation's theatre commands while Base 67 serves as the PRC's central nuclear weapons storage facility. The PLARF is led by Command Li Yuchao and Political Commissar Xu Zhongbo.\nArms.\nThe PLA maintains four arms (): the Aerospace Force, the Cyberspace Force, the Information Support Force, and the Joint Logistics Support Force. The four-arm system was established on 19 April 2024.\nPersonnel.\nRecruitment and terms of service.\nThe PLA began as an all-volunteer force. In 1955, as part of an effort to modernize the PLA, the first \"Military Service Law\" created a system of compulsory military service. Since the late 1970s, the PLA has been a hybrid force that combines conscripts and volunteers. Conscripts who fulfilled their service obligation can stay in the military as volunteer soldiers for a total of 16 years. \"De jur\"e, military service with the PLA is obligatory for all Chinese citizens. However, mandatory military service has not been enacted in China since 1949. Due to the effect of the one-child policy, over 70 percent of the PLA and 80 percent of its combat troops come from one-child households, according to Liu Mingfu of the National Defense University.\nWomen and ethnic minorities.\nWomen participated extensively in unconventional warfare, including in combat positions, in the Chinese Red Army during the revolutionary period, Chinese Civil War (1927\u20131949) and the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945). After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, along with the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s transition toward the conventional military organization, the role of women in the armed forces gradually reduced to support, medical, and logistics roles. It was considered a prestigious choice for women to join the military. Serving in the military opens up opportunities for education, training, higher status, and relocation to cities after completing the service. During the Cultural Revolution, military service was regarded as a privilege and a method to avoid the Down to the Countryside Movement.\nIn the 1980s, the PLA underwent large-scale demobilization amid the Chinese economic reform, and women were discharged back to civilian society for economic development while the exclusion of women in the military expanded. In the 1990s, the PLA revived the recruitment of female personnel in regular military formations but primarily focused on non-combat roles at specialized positions. Most women were trained in areas such as academic/engineering, medics, communications, intelligence, cultural work, and administrative work, as these positions conform to the traditional gender roles. Women in the PLA were more likely to be cadets and officers instead of enlisted soldiers because of their specializations. The military organization still preserved some female combat units as public exemplars of social equality.\nBoth enlisted and cadet women personnel underwent the same basic training as their male counterparts in the PLA, but many of them serve in predominantly female organizations. Due to ideological reasons, the regulation governing the segregation of sex in the PLA is prohibited, but a quasi-segregated arrangement for women's organizations is still applied through considerations of convenience. Women were likelier to hold commanding positions in female-heavy organizations such as medical, logistic, research, and political work units, but sometimes in combat units during peacetime. In PLAAF, women traditionally pilot transport aircraft or serve as crew members. There had been a small number of high-ranking female officials in the PLA since 1949, but the advancement of position had remained relatively uncommon. In the 2010s, women were increasingly serving in combat roles, in mixed-gender organizations alongside their male counterparts, and to the same physical standard.\nThe military actively promotes opportunities for women in the military, such as celebrating International Women's Day for the members of the armed forces, publicizing the number of firsts for female officers and enlisted personnel, including deployments with peacekeeping forces or serving on PLA Navy's first aircraft carrier, announcing female military achievements in state media, and promoting female special forces through news reports or popular media. PLA does not publish detailed gender composition of its armed forces, but the Jamestown Foundation estimated approximately 5% of the active military force in China is female.\nNational unity and territorial integrity are central themes of the Chinese Communist Revolution. The Chinese Red Army and the succeeding PLA actively recruited ethnic minorities. During the Chinese Civil War, Mongol cavalry units were formed. During the Korean War, as many as 50,000 ethnic Koreans in China volunteered to join the PLA. PLA's recruitment of minorities generally correlates to state policies. During the early years, minorities were given preferential treatment, with special attention given to recruitment and training. In the 1950s, ethnic Mongols accounted for 52% of all officers in Inner Mongolia military region. During the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, armed forces emphasized \"socialist culture\", assimilation policies, and the construction of common identities between soldiers of different ethnicities.\nFor ethnic minority cadets and officials, overall development follows national policies. Typically, minority officers hold officer positions in their home regions. Examples included over 34% of the battalion and regimental cadres in Yi autonomous region militia were of the Yi ethnicity, and 45% of the militia cadres in Tibetan local militia were of Tibetan ethnicity. Ethnical minorities achieved high-ranking positions in the PLA, and the percentage of appointments appears to follow the ratio of the Chinese population composition. Prominent figures included ethnic Mongol general Ulanhu, who served in high-ranking roles in the Inner Mongolian region and as vice president of China, and ethnic Uyghur Saifuddin Azizi, a Lieutenant General who served in the CCP Central Committee. There were a few instances of ethnic distrust within the PLA, with one prominent example being the defection of Margub Iskhakov, an ethnic Muslim Tatar PLA general, to the Soviet Union in the 1960s. However, his defection largely contributed to his disillusion with the failed Great Leap Forward policies, instead of his ethnic background. In modern times, ethnic representation is most visible among junior-ranking officers. Only a few minorities reach the highest-ranking positions.\nWeapons and equipment.\nAccording to the United States Department of Defense, China is developing kinetic-energy weapons, high-powered lasers, high-powered microwave weapons, particle-beam weapons, and electromagnetic pulse weapons with its increase of military fundings.\nResponding to reports that its modernisation is dependent on sales of advanced technology from American allies, PLA senior leadership have stated: \"Some have politicized China's normal commercial cooperation with foreign countries, damaging our reputation.\" These contributions include advanced European diesel engines for Chinese warships, military helicopter designs from Eurocopter, French anti-submarine sonars and helicopters, Australian technology for the Houbei class missile boat, and Israeli supplied American missile, laser and aircraft technology.\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's data, China became the world's third largest exporter of major arms in 2010\u201314, an increase of 143 percent from the period 2005\u20132009. SIPRI also calculated that China surpassed Russia to become the world's second largest arms exporter by 2020.\nChina's share of global arms exports hence increased from 3 to 5 percent. China supplied major arms to 35 states in 2010\u201314. A significant percentage (just over 68 percent) of Chinese exports went to three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. China also exported major arms to 18 African states. Examples of China's increasing global presence as an arms supplier in 2010\u201314 included deals with Venezuela for armoured vehicles and transport and trainer aircraft, with Algeria for three frigates, with Indonesia for the supply of hundreds of anti-ship missiles and with Nigeria for the supply of several unmanned combat aerial vehicles.\nFollowing rapid advances in its arms industry, China has become less dependent on arms imports, which decreased by 42 percent between 2005\u201309 and 2010\u201314. Russia accounted for 61 percent of Chinese arms imports, followed by France with 16 percent and Ukraine with 13 per cent. Helicopters formed a major part of Russian and French deliveries, with the French designs produced under licence in China.\nOver the years, China has struggled to design and produce effective engines for combat and transport vehicles. It continued to import large numbers of engines from Russia and Ukraine in 2010\u201314 for indigenously designed combat, advanced trainer and transport aircraft, and naval ships. It also produced British-, French- and German-designed engines for combat aircraft, naval ships and armoured vehicles, mostly as part of agreements that have been in place for decades.\nIn August 2021, China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile that circled the globe before speeding towards its target. The \"Financial Times\" reported that \"the test showed that China had made astounding progress on hypersonic weapons and was far more advanced than U.S. officials realized.\" During the Zapad 2021 joint strategic exercise, most of the gear comprised novel Chinese arms such as the KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, J-20 and J-16 fighters, Y-20 transport planes, and surveillance and combat drones. Another joint forces exercise took place in August 2023 near Alaska.\nOn 24 September 2024, the PLARF performed its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test over the Pacific Ocean since the early 1980s.\nCyberwarfare.\nThere is a belief in the Western military doctrines that the PLA have already begun engaging countries using cyber-warfare. There has been a significant increase in the number of presumed Chinese military initiated cyber events from 1999 to the present day.\nCyberwarfare has gained recognition as a valuable technique because it is an asymmetric technique that is a part of information operations and information warfare. As is written by two PLAGF Colonels, Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui in the book \"Unrestricted Warfare\", \"Methods that are not characterized by the use of the force of arms, nor by the use of military power, nor even by the presence of casualties and bloodshed, are just as likely to facilitate the successful realization of the war's goals, if not more so.\nWhile China has long been suspected of cyber spying, on 24 May 2011 the PLA announced the existence of having 'cyber capabilities'.\nIn February 2013, the media named \"Comment Crew\" as a hacker military faction for China's People's Liberation Army. In May 2014, a Federal Grand Jury in the United States indicted five Unit 61398 officers on criminal charges related to cyber attacks on private companies based in the United States after alleged investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation who exposed their identities in collaboration with US intelligence agencies such as the CIA.\nIn February 2020, the United States government indicted members of China's People's Liberation Army for the 2017 Equifax data breach, which involved hacking into Equifax and plundering sensitive data as part of a massive heist that also included stealing trade secrets, though the CCP denied these claims.\nNuclear capabilities.\nThe first of China's nuclear weapons tests took place in 1964, and its first hydrogen bomb test occurred in 1967 at Lop Nur. Tests continued until 1996, when the country signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), but did not ratify it.\nThe number of nuclear warheads in China's arsenal remains a state secret. There are varying estimates of the size of China's arsenal. The \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" and Federation of American Scientists estimated in 2024 that China has a stockpile of approximately 438 nuclear warheads, while the United States Department of Defense put the estimate at more than 500 operational nuclear warheads, making it the third-largest in the world.\nChina's policy has traditionally been one of no first use while maintaining a deterrent retaliatory force targeted for countervalue targets. According to a 2023 study by the National Defense University, China's nuclear doctrine has historically leaned toward maintaining a secure second-strike capability.\nSpace.\nHaving witnessed the crucial role of space to United States military success in the Gulf War, China continues to view space as a critical domain in both conflict and international strategic competition. The PLA operates a various satellite constellations performing reconnaissance, navigation, communication, and counterspace functions. Planners at PLA's National Defense University project China's space actions as retaliatory or preventative, following conditions like an attack on a Chinese satellite, an attack on China, or the interruption of a PLA amphibious landing. According to this approach, PLA planners assume that the country must have the capacity for retaliation and second-strike capability against a powerful opponent. PLA planners envision a limited space war and therefore seek to identify weak but critical nodes in other space systems.\nSignificant components of the PLA's space-based reconnaissance include Jianbing (vanguard) satellites with cover names Yaogan () and Gaofen (). These satellites collect electro-optical (EO) imagery to collect a literal representation of a target, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to penetrate the cloudy climates of southern China, and electronic intelligence (ELINT) to provide targeting intelligence on adversarial ships. The PLA also leverages a restricted, high-performance service of the country's BeiDou positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) satellites for its forces and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. For secure communications, the PLA uses the Zhongxing and Fenghuo series of satellites which enable secure data and voice transmission over C-band, Ku-band, and UHF. PLA deployment of anti-satellite and counterspace satellites including those of the Shijian and Shiyan series have also brought significant concern from western nations.\nThe PLA also plays a significant role in the Chinese space program. To date, all the participants have been selected from members of the PLA Air Force. China became the third country in the world to have sent a man into space by its own means with the flight of Yang Liwei aboard the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft on 15 October 2003, the flight of Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng aboard Shenzhou 6 on 12 October 2005, and Zhai Zhigang, Liu Boming, and Jing Haipeng aboard Shenzhou 7 on 25 September 2008.\nThe PLA started the development of an anti-ballistic and anti-satellite system in the 1960s, code named Project 640, including ground-based lasers and anti-satellite missiles. On 11 January 2007, China conducted a successful test of an anti-satellite missile, with an SC-19 class KKV.\nThe PLA has tested two types of hypersonic space vehicles, the Shenglong Spaceplane and a new one built by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation. Only a few pictures have appeared since it was revealed in late 2007. Earlier, images of the High-enthalpy Shock Waves Laboratory wind tunnel of the CAS Key Laboratory of high-temperature gas dynamics (LHD) were published in the Chinese media. Tests with speeds up to Mach 20 were reached around 2001.\nBudget.\nChina's official military budget for 2025 was at 1.78 trillion yuan (US$246 billion), which is an increase of 7.2% over the last year. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated that China's military expenditure was US$314\u00a0billion in 2024, the second-largest in the world after the United States and accounting for 12 percent of the world's defence expenditures.\nSymbols.\nAnthem.\nThe March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was adopted as the military anthem by the Central Military Commission on 25 July 1988. The lyrics of the anthem were written by composer Gong Mu (real name: Zhang Yongnian; Chinese: \u5f20\u6c38\u5e74) and the music was composed by Korea-born Chinese composer Zheng L\u00fccheng.\nFlag and insignia.\nThe PLA's insignia consists of a roundel with a red star bearing the two Chinese characters \"\"(literally \"eight-one\"), referring to the Nanchang uprising which began on 1 August 1927 (first day of the eighth month) and symbolic as the CCP's founding of the PLA. The inclusion of the two characters (\") is symbolic of the party's revolutionary history carrying strong emotional connotations of the political power which it shed blood to obtain. The flag of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the war flag of the People's Liberation Army; the layout of the flag has a golden star at the top left corner and \" to the right of the star, placed on a red field. Each service branch also has its flags: The top &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5\u20448 of the flags is the same as the PLA flag; the bottom &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20448 are occupied by the colors of the branches.\nThe flag of the Ground Forces has a forest green bar at the bottom. The naval ensign has stripes of blue and white at the bottom. The Air Force uses a sky blue bar. The Rocket Force uses a yellow bar at the bottom. The forest green represents the earth, the blue and white stripes represent the seas, the sky blue represents the air and the yellow represents the flare of missile launching.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66904", "revid": "290570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66904", "title": "Nixie tube", "text": "Electronic numeric display device\nA Nixie tube ( ), or cold cathode display, is an electronic device used for displaying numerals or other information using glow discharge.\nThe glass tube contains a wire-mesh anode and multiple cathodes, shaped like numerals or other symbols. Applying power to one cathode surrounds it with an orange glow discharge. The tube is filled with a gas at low pressure, usually mostly neon and a small amount of argon, in a Penning mixture. In later nixies, in order to extend the usable life of the device, a tiny amount of mercury was added to reduce cathode poisoning and sputtering.\nAlthough it resembles a vacuum tube in appearance, its operation does not depend on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot cathode. It is hence a cold cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), and is a variant of the neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology\u2014they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, not to be confused with a control grid), and shaped bare metal cathodes.\nHistory.\nNixie tubes were invented by David Hagelbarger. The early Nixie displays were made by a small vacuum tube manufacturer called Haydu Brothers Laboratories, and were introduced in 1955 by Burroughs Corporation, which purchased Haydu. The name \"Nixie\" was derived by Burroughs from \"NIX I\", an abbreviation of \"Numeric Indicator eXperimental No. 1\", although this may have been a backronym designed to justify the evocation of the mythical creature with this name. Hundreds of variations of this design were manufactured by many firms, from the 1950s until the 1990s. The Burroughs Corporation introduced \"Nixie\" and owned the name \"Nixie\" as a trademark. Nixie-like displays made by other firms had trademarked names including \"Digitron\", \"Inditron\" and \"Numicator\". A proper generic term is \"cold cathode neon readout tube\", though the phrase \"Nixie tube\" quickly entered the vernacular as a generic name.\nBurroughs even had another Haydu tube that could operate as a digital counter and directly drive a Nixie tube for display. This was called a \"Trochotron\", in later form known as the \"Beam-X Switch\" counter tube; another name was \"magnetron beam-switching tube\", referring to their derivation from a split-anode magnetron. Trochotrons were used in the UNIVAC 1101 computer, as well as in clocks and frequency counters.\nThe first trochotrons were surrounded by a hollow cylindrical magnet, with poles at the ends. The field inside the magnet had essentially-parallel lines of force, parallel to the axis of the tube. It was a thermionic vacuum tube; inside were a central cathode, ten anodes, and ten \"spade\" electrodes. The magnetic field and voltages applied to the electrodes made the electrons form a thick sheet (as in a cavity magnetron) that went to only one anode. Applying a pulse with specified width and voltages to the spades made the sheet advance to the next anode, where it stayed until the next advance pulse. Count direction was determined by the direction of the magnetic field, and as such was not reversible. A later form of trochotron called a Beam-X Switch replaced the large, heavy external cylindrical magnet with ten small internal metal-alloy rod magnets which also served as electrodes.\nIn 1949, Philips invented the https://, another beam deflection counter tube. It is a thermionic vacuum tube with ten states and direct readout. Philips designed the PW4032, five digit, 120kHz Electronic Counter around this tube. \nGlow-transfer counting tubes, similar in essential function to the trochotrons, had a glow discharge on one of a number of main cathodes, visible through the top of the glass envelope. Most used a neon-based gas mixture and counted in base-10, but faster types were based on argon, hydrogen, or other gases, and for timekeeping and similar applications a few base-12 types were available. Sets of \"guide\" cathodes (usually two sets, but some types had one or three) between the indicating cathodes moved the glow in steps to the next main cathode. Types with two or three sets of guide cathodes could count in either direction. A well-known trade name for glow-transfer counter tubes in the United Kingdom was Dekatron. Types with connections to each individual indicating cathode, which enabled presetting the tube's state to any value (in contrast to simpler types which could only be directly reset to zero or a small subset of their total number of states), were trade named \"Selectron\" tubes.\nAt least one device that functioned in the same way as Nixie tubes was patented in the 1930s\n. There were a number of relevant patents filed by Northrop and others around the early 1950s, and the first mass-produced display tubes were introduced in 1954 by National Union Co. under the brand name Inditron. However, the construction of the first Inditrons was cruder than that of the later Nixies, lacking the common anode grid, so that the unlit numerals were held at anode voltage to function as the effective anode. Their average lifetime was shorter, and they failed to find many applications due to their complex drive needs.\nDesign.\nThe most common form of Nixie tube has ten cathodes in the shapes of the numerals 0 to 9 (and occasionally a decimal point or two), but there are also types that show various letters, signs and symbols. Because the numbers and other characters are arranged one behind another, each character appears at a different depth, giving Nixie based displays a distinct appearance. A related device is the pixie tube, which uses a stencil mask with numeral-shaped holes instead of shaped cathodes. Some Russian Nixies, e.g. the \u0418H-14 (IN-14), used an upside-down digit 2 as the digit 5, presumably to save manufacturing costs.\nEach cathode can be made to glow in the characteristic neon red-orange color by applying about 170 volts DC at a few milliamperes between a cathode and the anode. The current limiting is normally implemented as an anode resistor of a few tens of thousands of ohms. Nixies exhibit negative resistance and will maintain their glow at typically 20 V to 30 V below the strike voltage. Some color variation can be observed between types, caused by differences in the gas mixtures used. Longer-life tubes that were manufactured later in the Nixie timeline have mercury added to reduce sputtering resulting in a blue or purple tinge to the emitted light. In some cases, these colors are filtered out by a red or orange filter coating on the glass.\nOne advantage of the Nixie tube is that its cathodes are typographically designed, shaped for legibility. In most types, they are not placed in numerical sequence from back to front, but arranged so that cathodes in front obscure the lit cathode minimally. One such arrangement is 6 7 5 8 4 3 9 2 0 1 from front (6) to back (1). Russian \u0418H-12A (IN-12A) and \u0418H-12B (IN-12B) tubes use the number arrangement 3 8 9 4 0 5 7 2 6 1 from front (3) to back (1), with the 5 being an upside down 2. The \u0418H-12B tubes feature a bottom far left decimal point between the numbers 8 and 3.\nApplications and lifetime.\nNixies were used as numeric displays in early digital voltmeters, multimeters, frequency counters and many other types of technical equipment. They also appeared in costly digital time displays used in research and military establishments, and in many early electronic desktop calculators, including the first: the Sumlock-Comptometer \"ANITA Mk VII\" of 1961 and even the first electronic telephone switchboards. Later alphanumeric versions in fourteen-segment display format found use in airport arrival/departure signs. Some elevators used Nixies to display floor numbers.\nAverage longevity of Nixie tubes varied from about 5,000 hours for the earliest types, to as high as 200,000 hours or more for some of the last types to be introduced. There is no formal definition as to what constitutes \"end of life\" for Nixies, mechanical failure excepted. Some sources suggest that incomplete glow coverage of a glyph (\"cathode poisoning\") or appearance of glow elsewhere in the tube would not be acceptable.\nNixie tubes are susceptible to multiple failure modes, including:\nDriving Nixies outside of their specified electrical parameters will accelerate their demise, especially excess current, which increases sputtering of the electrodes. A few extreme examples of sputtering have even resulted in complete disintegration of Nixie-tube cathodes.\nCathode poisoning can be abated by limiting current through the tubes to significantly below their maximum rating, through the use of Nixie tubes constructed from materials that avoid the effect (e.g. by being free of silicates and aluminum), or by programming devices to periodically cycle through all digits so that seldom-displayed ones get activated.\nAs testament to their longevity, and that of the equipment that incorporated them, as of 2006[ [update]] several suppliers still provided common Nixie tube types as replacement parts, new in original packaging. Devices with Nixie-tube displays in excellent working condition are still plentiful, though many have been in use for 30 to 40 years or more. Such items can easily be found as surplus and obtained at very little expense. In the former Soviet Union, Nixies were still being manufactured in volume in the 1980s, so Russian and Eastern European Nixies are still available.\nAlternatives and successors.\nOther numeric-display technologies include light pipes, rear-projection and edge-lit lightguide displays (all using individual incandescent or neon light bulbs for illumination), Numitron incandescent filament readouts, Panaplex seven-segment displays, and vacuum fluorescent display tubes. Before Nixie tubes became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly by use of cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by wiring the outputs of stepping switches to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of stepping switch to drive Nixie tubes.\nNixie tubes were superseded in the 1970s by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs), often in the form of seven-segment displays. The VFD uses a hot filament to emit electrons, a control grid and phosphor-coated anodes (similar to a cathode-ray tube) shaped to represent segments of a digit, pixels of a graphical display, or complete letters, symbols, or words. Whereas Nixies typically require 180 volts to illuminate, VFDs only require relatively low voltages to operate, making them easier and cheaper to use. VFDs have a simple internal structure, resulting in a bright, sharp, and unobstructed image. Unlike Nixies, the glass envelope of a VFD is evacuated rather than being filled with a specific mixture of gases at low pressure.\nSpecialized high-voltage driver chips such as the 7441/74141 were available to drive Nixies. LEDs are better suited to the low voltages that semiconductor integrated circuits typically use, which was an advantage for devices such as pocket calculators, digital watches, and handheld digital measurement instruments. Also, LEDs are much smaller and sturdier, without a fragile glass envelope. LEDs use less power than VFDs or Nixie tubes with the same function.\nLegacy.\nCiting dissatisfaction with the aesthetics of modern digital displays and a nostalgic fondness for the styling of obsolete technology, significant numbers of electronics enthusiasts have shown interest in reviving Nixies. Unsold tubes that have been sitting in warehouses for decades are being brought out and used, the most common application being in homemade digital clocks. During their heyday, Nixies were generally considered too expensive for use in mass-market consumer goods such as clocks. This recent surge in demand has caused prices to rise significantly, particularly for large tubes, making small-scale production of new tubes financially viable.\nIn addition to the tube itself, another important consideration is the relatively high-voltage circuitry necessary to drive the tube. The original 7400 series drivers integrated circuits such as the 74141 BCD decoder driver have long since been out of production and are rarer than NOS tubes. The 74141 is still available as NOS from various web suppliers and the Soviet equivalent, the K155ID1, is still in production. However, modern bipolar transistors with high voltage ratings are now available cheaply, such as MPSA92 or MPSA42.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It took place between Indonesia's declaration of independence in 1945 and the Netherlands' transfer of sovereignty over the Dutch East Indies to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia at the end of 1949.\nThe four-year struggle involved sporadic but bloody armed conflict, internal Indonesian political and communal upheavals, and two major international diplomatic interventions. Dutch military forces (and, for a while, the forces of the World War II allies) were able to control the major towns, cities and industrial assets in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra but could not control the countryside. By 1949, international pressure on the Netherlands, the United States threatening to cut off all economic aid for World War II rebuilding efforts to the Netherlands and the partial military stalemate became such that the Netherlands transferred sovereignty over the Dutch East Indies to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia.\nThe revolution marked the end of the colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies, except for Dutch New Guinea. It also significantly changed ethnic castes as well as reducing the power of many of the local rulers (\"raja\"). It did not significantly improve the economic or political fortunes of the majority of the population, although a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce.\nBackground.\nThe Indonesian independence movement began on 20 May 1908, which is commemorated as the \"Day of National Awakening\" (). Indonesian nationalism and movements supporting independence from Dutch colonialism, such as Budi Utomo, the Indonesian National Party (PNI), Sarekat Islam and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), grew rapidly in the first half of the 20th century. Budi Utomo, Sarekat Islam and others pursued strategies of co-operation by joining the Dutch initiated \"Volksraad\" (\"People's Council\") in the hope that Indonesia would be granted self-rule. Others chose a non-cooperative strategy demanding the freedom of self-government from the Dutch East Indies colony.\nThe occupation of Indonesia by Japan for three and a half years during World War II was a crucial factor in the subsequent revolution. The Netherlands had minimal ability to defend its colony against the Japanese army, and within only three months of their initial attacks, the Japanese had occupied the Dutch East Indies. In Java, and to a lesser extent in Sumatra (Indonesia's two dominant islands), the Japanese spread and encouraged nationalist sentiment. Although this was done more for Japanese political advantage than from altruistic support of Indonesian independence, this support created new Indonesian institutions (including local neighbourhood organisations) and elevated political leaders such as Sukarno. Just as significantly for the subsequent revolution, the Japanese destroyed and replaced much of the Dutch-created economic, administrative, and political infrastructure.\nOn 7 September 1944, with the war going badly for the Japanese, Prime Minister Koiso promised independence for Indonesia, but no date was set. For supporters of Sukarno, this announcement was seen as vindication for his collaboration with the Japanese.\nJapanese surrender.\nProclamation of Indonesian Independence.\nThe unconditional surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945 was eagerly received by the radical and politicised \"pemuda\" (Indonesian for 'male youth') groups. They pressured Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945, two days later. The following day, the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) elected Sukarno as president, and Hatta as vice-president.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; PROCLAMATION\nWe, the people of Indonesia, hereby declare the independence of Indonesia.\nMatters which concern the transfer of power and other things will be executed by careful means and in the shortest possible time.\nDjakarta, 17 August 1945\nIn the name of the people of Indonesia,\n[signed] Soekarno\u2014Hatta\nRevolution and Bersiap.\nIt was mid-September before news of the declaration of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces shipping entered Indonesia (owing in part to boycotts and strikes, in Australia, on coaling, loading and manning Dutch shipping from Australia, where the Netherlands East Indies Government in exile was based). These strikes were only fully broken in July 1946. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.\nThe resulting power vacuums in Java and Sumatra in the weeks following the Japanese surrender created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one of opportunity for the Republicans. Many \"pemuda\" joined pro-Republic struggle groups (\"badan perjuangan\"). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded \"Giy\u016bgun\" (PETA, volunteer army) and \"Heiho\" (local soldiers employed by Japanese armed forces) groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations.\nBy September 1945, control of major infrastructure like railway stations and trams in Java's largest cities had been taken over by Republican \"pemuda\", such as the Railway Youth Force, who encountered little Japanese resistance. To spread the revolutionary message, \"pemuda\" set up their own radio stations and newspapers, and graffiti proclaimed the nationalist sentiment. On most islands, struggle committees and militia were set up. Republican newspapers and journals were common in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, which fostered a generation of writers known as \"angkatan 45\" ('generation of 45') many of whom believed their work could be part of the revolution.\nRepublican leaders struggled to come to terms with popular sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist Tan Malaka, spread the idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by the Indonesian \"pemuda\". Sukarno and Hatta, by contrast, were more interested in planning government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy. Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one in Jakarta on 19 September with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.\nBy September 1945, many of the self-proclaimed \"pemuda\", who were ready to die for '100% freedom', were getting impatient. It was common for ethnic 'out-groups' \u2013 Dutch internees, Eurasian, Ambonese and Chinese \u2013 and anyone considered to be a spy, to be subjected to intimidation, kidnapping, robbery, murder and organised massacres. Such attacks would continue throughout the course of the revolution, but were most present during the 1945\u201346 period, which is known as the Bersiap.\nEstimates of the death toll of the Bersiap period vary from 3,500 to 30,000. NIOD concluded a Dutch casualty number of approximately 5,500 with possible higher numbers but not above 10,000. Estimates of the number of Indonesian fighters killed in the lead up to and during the Battle of Surabaya range from 6,300 to 15,000. The Japanese forces lost around 1,000 soldiers and the British forces registered 660 soldiers, mostly British Indians, as killed (with a similar number missing in action).\nFormation of the Republican government.\nBy the end of August 1945, a central Republican government had been established in Jakarta. It adopted a constitution drafted during the Japanese occupation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence. With general elections yet to be held, a Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) was appointed to assist the President. Similar committees were established at provincial and regency levels.\nQuestions of allegiance immediately arose amongst indigenous rulers. Central Javanese principalities, for example, immediately declared themselves Republican, while many \"raja\" ('rulers') of the outer islands, who had been enriched from their support of the Dutch, were less enthusiastic. Such reluctance among many outer islands was sharpened by the radical, non-aristocratic, and sometimes Islamic nature of the Java-centric Republican leadership. Support did, however, come from South Sulawesi (including the King of Bone, who still recalled battles against the Dutch from early in the century), and from Makassarese and Bugis \"raja\", who supported the Republican Governor of Jakarta, a Menadonese Christian. Many Balinese \"raja\" accepted Republican authority.\nFearing the Dutch would attempt to re-establish their authority over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely in contact with the outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists. In 14 November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed prime minister.\nIn the week following the Japanese surrender, the Giy\u016bgun (PETA) and Heiho groups were disbanded by the Japanese. Command structures and membership vital for a national army were consequently dismantled. Thus, rather than being formed from a trained, armed, and organised army, the Republican armed forces began to grow in September from usually younger, less trained groups built around charismatic leaders. Creating a rational military structure that was obedient to central authority from such disorganisation, was one of the major problems of the revolution, a problem that remains through to contemporary times. In the self-created Indonesian army, Japanese-trained Indonesian officers prevailed over those trained by the Dutch. A thirty-year-old former school teacher, Sudirman, was elected 'commander-in-chief' at the first meeting of Division Commanders in Yogyakarta on 12 November 1945.\nAllied situation (1945).\nThe Dutch accused Sukarno and Hatta of collaborating with the Japanese, and denounced the Republic as a creation of Japanese fascism. The Dutch East Indies administration had just received a ten million dollar loan from the United States to finance its return to Indonesia.\nAllied occupation.\nThe Netherlands, however, was critically weakened from World War II in Europe and did not return as a significant military force until early 1946. The Japanese and members of the Allied forces reluctantly agreed to act as caretakers. Australian forces of I Corps under general Leslie Morshead had landed in Borneo in May 1945, to destroy the Imperial Japanese forces stationed there, as well as maintaining order on the island until the Dutch could return. As US forces were focusing on the Japanese home islands, the archipelago was put under the jurisdiction of British Admiral Earl Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command. Allied enclaves already existed in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), Morotai (Maluku) and parts of Irian Jaya; Dutch administrators had already returned to these areas. In the Japanese navy areas, the arrival of Allied troops quickly prevented revolutionary activities where Australian troops, followed by Dutch troops and administrators, took the Japanese surrender (except for Bali and Lombok). Due to the lack of strong resistance, two Australian Army divisions succeeded in occupying eastern Indonesia.\nThe British were charged with restoring order and civilian government in Java. The Dutch took this to mean pre-war colonial administration and continued to claim sovereignty over Indonesia. The British and Indian troops did not, however, land on Java to accept the Japanese surrender until late September 1945. Lord Mountbatten's immediate tasks included the repatriation of some 300,000 Japanese, and freeing prisoners of war. He did not want, nor did he have the resources, to commit his troops to a long struggle to regain Indonesia for the Dutch. The first British troops reached Jakarta in late September 1945, and arrived in the cities of Medan (North Sumatra), Padang (West Sumatra), Palembang (South Sumatra), Semarang (Central Java) and Surabaya (East Java) in October. In an attempt to avoid clashes with Indonesians, the British commander Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison diverted soldiers of the former Dutch colonial army to eastern Indonesia, where Dutch reoccupation was proceeding smoothly. Tensions mounted as Allied troops entered Java and Sumatra; clashes broke out between Republicans and their perceived enemies, namely Dutch prisoners, Dutch colonial troops (KNIL), Chinese, Indo-Europeans and Japanese.\nThe first stages of warfare were initiated in October 1945 when, in accordance with the terms of their surrender, the Japanese tried to re-establish the authority they had relinquished to Indonesians in the towns and cities. Japanese military police killed Republican \"pemuda\" in Pekalongan (Central Java) on 3 October, and Japanese troops drove Republican \"pemuda\" out of Bandung in West Java and handed the city to the British, but the fiercest fighting involving the Japanese was in Semarang. On 14 October, British forces began to occupy the city. Retreating Republican forces retaliated by killing between 130 and 300 Japanese prisoners they were holding. Five hundred Japanese and two thousand Indonesians had been killed and the Japanese had almost captured the city six days later when British forces arrived. The Allies repatriated the remaining Japanese troops and civilians to Japan, although about 1,000 elected to remain behind and later assisted Republican forces in fighting for independence.\nThe British subsequently decided to evacuate the 10,000 Indo-Europeans and European internees in the volatile Central Java interior. British detachments sent to the towns of Ambarawa and Magelang encountered strong Republican resistance and used air attacks against the Indonesians. Sukarno arranged a ceasefire on 2 November, but by late November fighting had resumed and the British withdrew to the coast (refer Battle of Ambarawa). Republican attacks against Allied and alleged pro-Dutch civilians reached a peak in November and December, with 1,200 killed in Bandung as the \"pemuda\" returned to the offensive. In March 1946, departing Republicans responded to a British ultimatum for them to leave the city of Bandung by deliberately burning down much of the southern half of the city in what is popularly known in Indonesia as the \"Bandung Sea of Fire\".\nBattle of Surabaya.\nThe Battle of Surabaya was the heaviest and bloodiest single battle of the revolution and became a national symbol of Indonesian resistance. \"Pemuda\" groups in Surabaya, the second largest city in Indonesia, seized arms and ammunition from the Japanese and set up two new organisations; the Indonesia National Committee (KNI) and the People's Security Council (BKR). By the time the Allied forces arrived at the end of October 1945, the \"pemuda\" foothold in Surabaya city was described as \"a strong unified fortress\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe city itself was in pandemonium. There was bloody hand-to-hand fighting on every street corner. Bodies were strewn everywhere. Decapitated, dismembered trunks lay piled one on top of the other... Indonesians were shooting and stabbing and murdering wildly\n\u2014 Sukarno\nIn September and October 1945 Europeans and pro-Dutch Eurasians were attacked and killed by Indonesian mobs. Ferocious fighting erupted when 6,000 British Indian troops landed in the city. Sukarno and Hatta negotiated a ceasefire between the Republicans and the British forces led by Brigadier Mallaby. Mallaby was killed on 30 October 1945 while he was travelling about Surabaya under a white flag to spread the news about the cease fire agreement and rescue some stranded Mahratta troops, despite being warned of the danger by Force 136 troops. Following the killing of Mallaby on 30 October, the British sent more troops into the city from 10 November under the cover of air attacks. Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.\nDespite the military defeat suffered by the Republicans and a loss of manpower and weaponry that would severely hamper Republican forces for the rest of the revolution, the battle and defence mounted by the Indonesians galvanised the nation in support of independence and helped garner international attention. For the Dutch, it removed any doubt that the Republic was a well-organised resistance with popular support. It also convinced Britain to lie on the side of neutrality in the revolution, and within a few years, Britain would support the Republican cause in the United Nations. The last British troops left Indonesia in November 1946, but by this time 55,000 Dutch troops had landed in Java.\nSituation from Dutch landing on Java until Linggadjati (January\u2013December 1946).\nWith British assistance, the Dutch landed their Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) forces in Jakarta and other key centres. Republican sources reported 8,000 deaths up to January 1946 in the defence of Jakarta, but they could not hold the city. The Republican leadership thus established themselves in the city of Yogyakarta with the crucial support of the new sultan, Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX. Yogyakarta went on to play a leading role in the revolution, which would result in the city being granted its own Special Territory status. In Bogor, near Jakarta, and in Balikpapan in Kalimantan, Republican officials were imprisoned. In preparation for the Dutch occupation of Sumatra, its largest cities, Palembang and Medan, were bombed. In December 1946, Special Forces Depot (DST), led by commando and counter-insurgency expert Captain Raymond \"Turk\" Westerling, were accused of pacifying the southern Sulawesi region using arbitrary terror techniques, which were copied by other anti-Republicans. Westerling would target a village by herding them together, have soldiers search people's houses, shoot suspected Republicans in the head, as well as those who would refuse to name names, and sometimes additional victims beyond those suspected to be Republicans. There are disputes on how many were killed during this period, with some estimating as many as 3,000 while others estimate between 3,500 and 6,500. These war crimes were not officially recognized until 2015, when The Hague held the Netherlands responsible, leading to monetary reparations for the victims.\nOn Java and Sumatra, the Dutch found military success in cities and major towns, but they were unable to subdue the villages and countryside. On the outer islands (including Bali), Republican sentiment was not as strong, at least among the elite. They were consequently occupied by the Dutch with comparative ease, and autonomous states were set up by the Dutch. The largest, the State of East Indonesia (NIT), encompassed most of eastern Indonesia, and was established in December 1946, with its administrative capital in Makassar.\nDiplomacy and major military engagements (1946\u20131948).\nLinggardjati Agreement.\nThe Linggadjati Agreement or \"Linggardjati Agreement\", brokered by the British and concluded in November 1946, saw the Netherlands recognise the Republic as the \"de facto\" authority over Java, Madura, and Sumatra. Both parties agreed to the formation of the United States of Indonesia by 1 January 1949, a semi-autonomous federal state with the monarch of the Netherlands at its head. The Republican-controlled Java and Sumatra would be one of its states, alongside areas that were generally under stronger Dutch influence, including southern Kalimantan, and the \"Great East\", which consisted of Sulawesi, Maluku, the Lesser Sunda Islands, and Western New Guinea. The Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) did not ratify the agreement until February 1947, and neither the Republic nor the Dutch were satisfied with it. On 25 March 1947 the Lower House of the Dutch parliament ratified a stripped-down version of the treaty, which was not accepted by the Republic. Both sides soon accused the other of violating the agreement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n...[the Republic] became increasingly disorganised internally; party leaders fought with party leaders; governments were over thrown and replaced by others; armed groups acted on their own in local conflicts; certain parts of the Republic never had contact with the centre \u2013 they just drifted along in their own way.\nThe whole situation deteriorated to such an extent that the Dutch Government was obliged to decide that no progress could be made before law and order were restored sufficiently to make intercourse between the different parts of Indonesia possible, and to guarantee the safety of people of different political opinions.\n \u2014 former East Indies Governor H. J. van Mook's justification for the first Dutch \"police action\".\nOperation Product.\nAt midnight on 20 July 1947, the Dutch launched a major military offensive called \"Operatie Product\", with the aim of regaining control of economically lucrative areas in Java and Sumatra and deep ports in Java, thus covering the cost of the ~120,000-strong Dutch military presence. Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the Dutch euphemistically described the campaign as \"police actions\" to restore law and order. In the offensive, Dutch forces drove Republican troops out of parts of Sumatra, and East and West Java. The Republicans were confined to the Yogyakarta region of Java.\nInternational reaction to the Dutch actions was negative. Neighbouring Australia and newly independent India were particularly active in supporting the Republic's cause in the UN, as were the Soviet Union and, most significantly, the United States. Dutch ships continued to be boycotted from loading and unloading by Australian waterside workers, a blockade that began in September 1945. The United Nations Security Council became directly involved in the conflict, establishing a Committee of Good Office (CGO, known in Indonesia as Komite Tiga Negara, KTN, but not confused with Unilateral Committee.) to sponsor further negotiations, making the Dutch diplomatic position particularly difficult. A ceasefire, called for by UNSC resolution 27, was ordered by the Dutch and Sukarno on 4 August 1947.\nRenville Agreement.\nThe United Nations Security Council brokered the Renville Agreement in an attempt to rectify the collapsed Linggadjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch tanks' positions. Many Republican positions, however, were still intact behind the Dutch lines. Some Republican militias, particularly laborers, peasants, and student troops, just couldn't leave thus must live (and operate) behind Renville Line. The agreement also required referendums to be held on the political future of the Dutch-held areas. The apparent reasonableness of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.\nThe Indonesian Republic faced economic hardship due to the continued naval blockade and land blockades at Renville line (in violation of Renville Agreement) which led to insufficient availability of not only arms, but also food, clothing, medicine, mails, books, magazines, material to service and repair transportation, and overpopulation due to people fleeing from Dutch advances in Operation Product. This economic hardship was paired with political crisis spurred by accepting the terms of the Renville Agreement, as well as internal conflicts between Republicans and other Indonesian nationalists, which fed fuel to what would later become the Madiun Affair.\nDiplomatic efforts between the Netherlands and the Republic continued throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, both domestic and international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook's federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the \"Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO)\" (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising the leadership of the federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative (successor to office of Governor-General) and the Republican forces.\nMutual distrust between the Netherlands and the Republic hindered negotiations. Indonesia who faced aforementioned naval and land blockades (which violated Renville Agreement) also feared a second major Dutch offensive. Meanwhile, the Dutch objected to continued pro-Republican activity on the Dutch side of the Renville line.\nIn February 1948 the Siliwangi Battalion of the Republican Army, led by Nasution, marched from West Java to Central Java; the relocation was intended to ease internal Republican tensions involving the Battalion in the Surakarta area. The Battalion, however, clashed with Dutch troops while crossing Mount Slamet, and the Dutch believed it was part of a systematic troop movement across the Renville Line. The fear of such incursions actually succeeding, along with apparent Republican undermining of the Dutch-established Pasundan state and negative reports, led to the Dutch leadership increasingly seeing itself as losing control.\nOperation Kraai and General Offensive (\"Serangan Oemoem\").\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe have been attacked... The Dutch government have betrayed the cease-fire agreement. All the Armed Forces will carry out the plans which have been decided on to confront the Dutch attack\n \u2014 General Sudirman, broadcast from his sickbed.\nFrustrated at negotiations with the Republic and believing it weakened by both the \"Darul Islam\" and Madiun insurgencies, the Dutch launched a military offensive on 19 December 1948 which it termed 'Operatie Kraai' (Operation Crow). By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, the location of the temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands. The Republican president, vice-president, and all but six Republic of Indonesia ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a guerrilla war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff General Sudirman, who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia (PDRI), was established in West Sumatra.\nAlthough Dutch forces conquered the towns and cities in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, they could not control villages and the countryside. Republican troops and militia led by Lt. Colonel (later President) Suharto attacked Dutch positions in Yogyakarta at dawn on 1 March 1949. The Dutch were expelled from the city for six hours but reinforcements were brought in from the nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon. Indonesian fighters retreated at 12:00\u00a0pm and the Dutch re-entered the city. The Indonesian attack, later known in Indonesia as \"Serangan Oemoem\" (new spelling: \"Serangan Umum\" '1 March General Offensive'), is commemorated by a large monument in Yogyakarta. A large-scale attack against Dutch troops in Surakarta on 10 August the same year resulted in republican forces holding the city for two days.\nOnce again, international opinion of the Dutch military campaigns was one of outrage, significantly in both the United Nations and the United States. U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall threatened to stop all of the economic aid program to the Netherlands unless they immediately withdraw from Indonesia and transferred all of the sovereignty to Indonesia. In January 1949, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution demanding the reinstatement of the Republican government. United States aid specifically earmarked for Dutch Indonesia was immediately cancelled and pressure mounted within the US Congress for all United States aid to be cut off. This included Marshall Plan funds vital for Dutch post-World War II rebuilding that had so far totalled $US 1\u00a0billion. The Netherlands Government had spent an amount equivalent to almost half of this funding their campaigns in Indonesia. That United States aid could be used to fund \"a senile and ineffectual imperialism\" encouraged many key voices in the United States \u2013 including those amongst the US Republican Party and from within American churches and NGOs \u2013 to speak out in support of Indonesian independence.\nInternal turmoil.\nThe internal turmoil happened was called as social revolutions and insurgencies of Communist and Islamist. It is argued there were common causes because of general similarity of these separated actions. The common causes are extreme polarization of \"pergerakan\" and aristocrat groups, the harshness of Japanese requirement for labour and rice; the vacuum of central authority; powerful Islamic sentiment for mass mobilization; and activity of minute semi-underground revolutionary cadres (commonly communist).\nSocial revolutions.\nThe so-called 'social revolutions' following the independence proclamation were challenges to the Dutch-established Indonesian social order, and to some extent a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the country, people rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources. The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; in most cases the challenges to the social order were quashed, although in East Sumatra, the sultanates were overthrown and there were mass killings of members of the aristocratic families.\nA culture of violence rooted in the deep conflicts that split the countryside during the revolution would repeatedly erupt throughout the whole second half of the 20th century. Violence was one of the many lessons learned during the Japanese occupation, and figures identified as 'feudal', including kings, regents, or simply the wealthy, were often attacked and sometimes beheaded. Rape became a weapon against 'feudal' women. In the coastal sultanates of Sumatra and Kalimantan, for example, sultans and others whose authority had been shored up by the Dutch, were attacked as soon as Japanese authority left. The pro-Dutch aristocratic administrators (\"ule\u00ebbalangs\") secular local lords of Aceh, who had been the foundation of Dutch rule, were executed during local civil war, and its place was taken over by pro-Republican religious leaders. (\"ulama\"). Meanwhile, monarchical officials in Surakarta was kidnapped by anti-monarchist movement which led to the freezing and abolition of the special region.\nMany Indonesians lived in fear and uncertainty, particularly a significant proportion of the population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all sales to the Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term \"kedaulatan rakyat\" ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') \u2013 which is mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution and used by \"pemuda\" to demand pro-active policies from leaders \u2013 came to be used not only in the demanding of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery. Chinese merchants, in particular, were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death.\nCommunist and Islamist insurgencies.\nOn 18 September 1948 an 'Indonesian Soviet Republic' was declared in Madiun, east of Yogyakarta, by members of the PKI and the Indonesian Socialist Party (PSI). Judging the time right for a proletarian uprising, they intended it to be a rallying point for revolt against \"Sukarno-Hatta, the slaves of the Japanese and America\". Madiun however was won back by Republican forces within a few weeks and the insurgency leader, Musso, killed. Ario Soerjo, the governor of East Java, as well as several police officers and religious leaders, were killed by the rebels. This ended a distraction for the revolution, and it turned vague American sympathies based on anti-colonial sentiments into diplomatic support. Internationally, the Republic was now seen as being staunchly anti-communist and a potential ally in the emerging global Cold War between the American-led 'free world' and the Soviet-led bloc.\nMembers of the Republican Army who had come from Indonesian Hizbullah felt betrayed by the Indonesian Government for ratifying the Renville Agreement \u2013 therefore recognising many areas behind the van Mook Line as \"de jure\" Dutch. In May 1948, they declared a break-away regime, the \"Negara Islam Indonesia\" (Indonesian Islamic State), better known as \"Darul Islam\". Led by an Islamic mystic, Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo, \"Darul Islam\" sought to establish Indonesia as an Islamic theocracy. At the time, the Republican Government did not respond, as they were focused on the threat from the Dutch. Some leaders of Masjumi sympathised with the rebellion. After the Republic regained all territories in 1950, the government took the \"Darul Islam\" threat seriously, especially after some provinces declared that they had joined \"Darul Islam\". The last group of rebels was put down in 1962.\nTransfer of sovereignty.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMillions upon millions flooded the sidewalks, the roads. They were crying, cheering, screaming \"...Long live Bung Karno...\" They clung to the sides of the car, the hood, the running boards. They grabbed at me to kiss my fingers.\nSoldiers beat a path for me to the topmost step of the big white palace. There I raised both hands high. A stillness swept over the millions.\n\"\"Alhamdulillah\" \u2013 Thank God,\" I cried. \"We are free\"\n \u2014 Sukarno's recollections of independence achieved.\nThe resilience of Indonesian Republican resistance and active international diplomacy set world opinion against the Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony. The second 'police action' was a diplomatic disaster for the Dutch cause. The newly appointed United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson pushed the Netherlands government into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations but until then defied by the Netherlands. The Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI). It would include all the territory of the former Dutch East Indies with the exception of Dutch New Guinea; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia within a year of the transfer of sovereignty. The other issue on which Indonesia gave concessions was paying the Netherlands East Indies debt which amounted to 4.5 billion guilders. This amount would mean, Indonesia paid for the colonial government expenses of \". Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.\nRepublican-controlled Java and Sumatra together formed a single state in the seven-state, nine-territory RUSI federation, but accounted for almost half its population. The other fifteen 'federal' states and territories had been created by the Netherlands since 1945. These entities were dissolved into the Republic over the first half of 1950. An abortive anti-Republic coup in Bandung and Jakarta by Westerling's Legion of the Just Ruler (APRA) on 23 January 1950 resulted in the dissolution of the populous Pasundan state in West Java, thus quickening the dissolution of the federal structure. Colonial soldiers, who were largely Ambonese, clashed with Republican troops in Makassar during the Makassar Uprising in April 1950. The predominantly Christian Ambonese were from one of the few regions with pro-Dutch sentiments and they were suspicious of the Javanese Muslim-dominated Republic, whom they unfavourably regarded as leftists. On 25 April 1950, an independent Republic of South Maluku (RMS) was proclaimed in Ambon but this was suppressed by Republican troops during a campaign from July to November. With the state of East Sumatra now being the only federal state remaining, it too folded and fell in line with the unitary Republic. On 17 August 1950, the fifth anniversary of his declaration of Indonesian independence, Sukarno proclaimed the Republic of Indonesia as a unitary state.\nImpact and casualties.\nAlthough there is no accurate account of how many Indonesians died, it was in far greater numbers than the Europeans. Estimates of Indonesian deaths in fighting and civilians range from 97,421 to 100,000. A total of 980 British soldiers were killed or went missing in Java and Sumatra in 1945 and 1946, most of them Indian soldiers. More than 4,000 Dutch soldiers lost their lives in Indonesia between 1945 and 1949. Many Japanese died; while it is unknown how many died, only about half of whom died in actual combat, the rest killed in rampages by Indonesians. Seven million people were displaced on Java and Sumatra. Based on demographic data, historian Pierre van der Eng estimated a demographic gap of around 2.4 million people in Indonesia during the entire 1940s, including the period of the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, and the Indonesian National Revolution. Van der Eng states that conflict led to significant ramifications for Indonesians outside of direct violence, such as widespread famine, disease and a lowered fertility rate. According to the official website of Indonesian veterans, there were 863,432 people who joined the struggle for Indonesian independence and this included those who were members of the militia, police, intelligence and auxiliary and as of 2023, there are still 25,676 Indonesian National Revolution veterans alive and According to the official Netherlands veterans website, there are around 5,000 veterans who were deployed to the Dutch East Indies still alive, this also includes former KNIL members.\nThe revolution had direct effects on economic conditions; shortages were common, particularly food, clothing and fuel. There were in effect two economies \u2013 the Dutch and the Republican \u2013 both of which had to simultaneously rebuild after World War II and survive the disruptions of the revolution. The Republic had to set up all necessities of life, ranging from 'postage stamps, army badges, and train tickets' whilst subject to Dutch trade blockades. Confusion and ruinous inflationary surges resulted from competing currencies; Japanese, new Dutch money, and Republican currencies were all used, often concurrently. The Indonesian government was saddled with significant debt, slowing development, with last remaining payment for Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference was made in the form of annual payment, with 1% annual interest rate since 1973, was made in 2002.\nIndonesian independence was secured through a blend of both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect of anarchy, without confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern Indonesian history, and it has provided the reference point and validation for the country's major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's 'guided democracy', to political Islam, the origins of the Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.\nThe revolution destroyed a colonial administration ruled from the other side of the world, and dismantled with it the , seen by many as obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population's poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.\nDutch apologies.\nIn 2013, the Netherlands government apologised for the violence used against the Indonesian people. In 2016, Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders apologized for a massacre by Dutch troops of 400 Indonesian villagers in 1947. During a state visit to Indonesia in March 2020, King Willem-Alexander made a surprise apology for \"excessive violence\" by Dutch troops.\nOn 17 February 2022, a major Dutch historical review was released, titled \"Independence, Decolonization, Violence and War in Indonesia, 1945\u20131950\". The research was done by three institutions: Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV), Netherlands Institute for Military History (NIMH) and NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The review concluded that the Netherlands had used systematic and excessive violence during the war. According to the review, \"The use of extreme violence by the Dutch armed forces was not only widespread, but often deliberate, too\" and \"was condoned at every level: political, military and legal.\" On the same day, the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte apologized for the atrocities committed by the Dutch during the war and also for the failure of past Dutch governments to acknowledge it.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His paintings of 1905\u20131906 are characterized by riotous colourism in the Fauve style. By 1910, however, his work had become more austere as a result of his study of C\u00e9zanne and the old masters. After the First World War, Derain became one of the leaders of the new classicism in the arts known as the Return to Order.\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nDerain was born in 1880 in Chatou, Yvelines, \u00cele-de-France, just outside Paris. In 1895 he began to study on his own, contrary to claims that meeting Vlaminck or Matisse began his efforts to paint, and occasionally went to the countryside with an old friend of C\u00e9zanne's, Father Jacomin along with his two sons. In 1898, while studying to be an engineer at the Acad\u00e9mie Camillo, he attended painting classes under Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re, and there met Matisse. In 1900, he met and shared a studio with Maurice de Vlaminck and together they began to paint scenes in the neighbourhood, but this was interrupted by military service at Commercy from September 1901 to 1904. Following his release from service, Matisse persuaded Derain's parents to allow him to abandon his engineering career and devote himself solely to painting; subsequently Derain attended the .\nFauvism.\nDerain and Matisse worked together through the summer of 1905 in the Mediterranean village of Collioure and Derain completed the \"Mountains at Collioure\" painting. Later that year they displayed their highly innovative paintings at the Salon d'Automne. The vivid, unnatural colors led the critic Louis Vauxcelles to derisively dub their works as \"les Fauves\", or \"the wild beasts\", marking the start of the Fauvist movement. (In 2023, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, co-organized and exhibited \"Vertigo of Color: Matisse, Derain, and the Origins of Fauvism\", an exhibit examining their work together and the birth of Fauvism.)\nIn March 1906, the noted art dealer Ambroise Vollard sent Derain to London to produce a series of paintings with the city as subject. In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain presented a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as Whistler or Monet. With bold colors and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the Thames and Tower Bridge. These London paintings remain among his most popular work. Art critic T. G Rosenthal: \"Not since Monet has anyone made London seem so fresh and yet remain quintessentially English. Some of his views of the Thames use the Pointillist technique of multiple dots, although by this time, because the dots have become much larger, it is rather more simply the separation of colours called Divisionism and it is peculiarly effective in conveying the fragmentation of colour in moving water in sunlight.\"\nIn 1907 art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler purchased Derain's entire studio, granting Derain financial stability. He experimented with stone sculpture and moved to Montmartre to be near his friend Pablo Picasso and other noted artists. Fernande Olivier, Picasso's mistress at the time, described Derain as:\nSlim, elegant, with a lively colour and enamelled black hair. With an English chic, somewhat striking. Fancy waistcoats, ties in crude colours, red and green. Always a pipe in his mouth, phlegmatic, mocking, cold, an arguer.\nAt Montmartre, Derain began to shift from the brilliant Fauvist palette to more muted tones, showing the influence of Cubism and Paul C\u00e9zanne. (According to Gertrude Stein, Derain may have been influenced by African sculpture before Picasso.) Derain supplied woodcuts in primitivist style for an edition of Guillaume Apollinaire's first book of prose, \"L'enchanteur pourrissant\" (1909). He displayed works at the Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung in Munich in 1910, in 1912 at the secessionist Der Blaue Reiter and in 1913 at the seminal Armory Show in New York. He also illustrated a collection of poems by Max Jacob in 1912.\nTowards a new classicism.\nAt about this time Derain's work began overtly reflecting his study of the Old Masters. The role of colour was reduced and forms became austere; the years 1911\u20131914 are sometimes referred to as his gothic period. In 1914 he was mobilized for military service in World War I and until his release in 1919 he would have little time for painting, although in 1916 he provided a set of illustrations for Andr\u00e9 Breton's first book, \"Mont de Piete\".\nAfter the war, Derain won new acclaim as a leader of the renewed classicism then ascendant. With the wildness of his Fauve years far behind, he was admired as an upholder of tradition. In 1919 he designed the ballet \"La Boutique fantasque\" for Diaghilev, leader of the Ballets Russes. A major success, it would lead to his creating many ballet designs.\nThe 1920s marked the height of his success, as he was awarded the Carnegie Prize in 1928 for his \"Still-life with Dead Game\" and began to exhibit extensively abroad\u2014in London, Berlin, Frankfurt, D\u00fcsseldorf, New York City and Cincinnati, Ohio.\nDuring the German occupation of France in World War II, Derain lived primarily in Paris and was much courted by the Germans because he represented the prestige of French culture. Derain accepted an invitation to make an official visit to Germany in 1941, and traveled with other French artists to Berlin to attend a Nazi exhibition of an officially endorsed artist, Arno Breker. Derain's presence in Germany was used effectively by Nazi propaganda, and after the Liberation he was branded a collaborator and ostracized by many former supporters.\nA year before his death, he contracted an eye infection from which he never fully recovered. He died in Garches, Hauts-de-Seine, \u00cele-de-France, France in 1954 when he was struck by a moving vehicle.\nDerain's London paintings were the subject of a major exhibition at the Courtauld Institute from 27 October 2005 to 22 January 2006.\nIn 2025, all of Derain\u2019s work entered the public domain in the United States.\nPublic collections.\nAmong the public collections holding works by Andr\u00e9 Derain are:\nNazi-looted art.\nIn 2020, a French court ordered that three paintings by Derain, \"Paysage \u00e0 Cassis (ou Vue de Cassis\"), \"La Chapelle-sous-Cr\u00e9cy\" were restituted and \"Pin\u00e8de, Cassis\" should be restituted to the heirs of Ren\u00e9 Gimpel, from whom they had been looted during the Nazi occupation of France. Gimpel's family had submitted the claim in 2013. In 2023 Derain's \"Still Life With a Bottle\" was restituted to the heirs of Dane Reichsmann, who was murdered in Auschwitz with his wife.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66921", "revid": "34146514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66921", "title": "Global Television Network", "text": "Canadian broadcast TV network\nThe Global Television Network (more commonly called Global, or occasionally Global TV) is a Canadian English-language terrestrial television network. It is currently Canada's second most-watched private terrestrial television network after CTV, and has fifteen owned-and-operated stations throughout the country. Global is owned by Corus Entertainment \u2014 the media holdings of JR Shaw and other members of his family.\nGlobal has its origins in a regional television station of the same name, serving Southern Ontario, which launched in 1974. The Ontario station was soon purchased by the now-defunct CanWest Global Communications, and that company gradually expanded its national reach in the subsequent decades through both acquisitions and new station launches, building up a quasi-network of independent stations, known as the CanWest Global System, until the stations were unified under the Ontario station's branding in 1997.\nHistory.\nNTV.\nThe network has its origins in NTV, a new network first proposed in 1966 by Hamilton media proprietor Ken Soble, the co-founder and owner of independent station CHCH-TV through his Niagara Television company. Financially backed by Power Corporation of Canada, Soble submitted a brief to the Board of Broadcast Governors in 1966 proposing a national satellite-fed network. Under the plan, Soble's company would launch Canada's first broadcast satellite and would use it to relay the programming of CHCH to 96 new transmitters across Canada. Soble died in December of that year; his widow, Frances, took over as president of Niagara Television, while former CTV executive Michael Hind-Smith and Niagara Television vice-president Al Bruner handled the network application. Soble had originally formulated the plan after failing in a bid to acquire CTV.\nThe original proposal was widely criticized on various grounds, including claims that it exceeded the board's concentration of media ownership limits and that it was overly ambitious and financially unsustainable. As well, it failed to include any plan for local news content on any of its individual stations beyond possibly the metropolitan Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver markets.\nBy 1968, NTV put forward its first official licence application, under which the original 96 transmitters would be supplemented by 43 more transmitters to distribute a separate French-language service, along with provisions for the free distribution of CBC Television, Radio-Canada, and a new noncommercial educational television service on the network's satellite. Transponder space would also be leased to CTV and T\u00e9l\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole, but as competing commercial services, they would not have been granted the free distribution rights the plan offered to the public television services. However, after federal communications minister Paul Hellyer announced plans to move forward with the publicly owned Anik series of broadcast satellites through Telesat Canada instead of leaving the rollout of satellite technology in the hands of private corporations, Power Corporation backed out of the application and left NTV in limbo.\nGlobal Communications.\nBruner was fired from Niagara Television in 1969, purportedly because his efforts to rescue the network application were leading him to neglect his other duties with the company's existing media operations. He then put together another investment team to form Global Communications, which carried the network application forward thereafter. By 1970, the Canadian Radio and Television Commission had put out a formal call for \"third\" stations in several major cities. Global Communications put forward a revised application under which the network would launch with transmitters only in Ontario, as an interim step toward the eventual buildout of the entire network originally envisioned by Soble. Because Niagara Television and CHCH were no longer involved in the proposal, the 1970 application also requested a licence to launch a new station in Toronto as the chain's flagship.\nThe network licence was approved by the CRTC on July 21, 1972. The group was granted a six-transmitter network in Southern Ontario, stretching from Windsor to Ottawa. They had also sought a seventh transmitter in Maxville that could reach Montreal, but were turned down because of a CRTC moratorium on new English stations in the Montreal market. The transmitters would all be fed from a central studio in Toronto. The group promised a high level of Canadian content and agreed not to accept local advertising.\nThe station's initial plan was to broadcast only during prime time hours from 5 p.m. to midnight, while leasing daytime hours to the Ontario Educational Communications Authority to broadcast educational programming. However, the offer never came to fruition, with the OECA opting instead to expand what would eventually become TVOntario by launching its own transmitters.\nThe new Global Television Network, with the callsign CKGN-TV (now CIII-DT), launched on January 6, 1974, from studios located at a former factory in the Don Mills neighbourhood in North York (now in Toronto) at 6\u00a0p.m. local time. Global remains based there today. Although the Ontario station has always been based in Toronto, its main transmitter was licensed to Paris, Ontario; halfway between Kitchener-Waterloo and Hamilton, transmitting on Channel 6, until 2009. Repeating transmitters were originally located near Windsor, Ontario on Channel 22; Sarnia, Channel 29, Uxbridge, Ontario on Channel 22, to serve the metro Toronto area; Bancroft, on Channel 2; and Hull, Quebec, to cover the Ottawa area, on Channel 6.\nLaunch.\nGlobal's original prime time schedule included Patrick Watson's documentary series \"Witness to Yesterday\", Pierre Berton's political debate show \"The Great Debate\", a Canadian edition of Bernard Braden's British consumer affairs newsmagazine \"The Braden Beat\", William Shatner's film talk show \"Flick Flack\", Sunday night Toronto Toros hockey games and a nightly variety series called \"Everything Goes\", as well as a few imported American series, including \"Chopper One\", \"Dirty Sally,\" and \"Doc Elliot\". In March, the station drew a formal complaint from MP James McGrath against its airing of the 1969 Western film \"Heaven with a Gun\", as the film featured scenes of violence that McGrath considered inappropriate.\nThe station ran into a financial crisis within just three months. Due to the CRTC decision, it was forced to launch at midseason. Many companies had already allocated their advertising budgets for the season and had little money left to buy time on the newly minted network, and even some of the advertisers who had booked time on the network backed out in light of the 1973 oil crisis. In addition, the short-lived American adoption of year-round daylight saving time in January 1974 and the Ontario government's refusal to follow suit had unexpectedly forced \"Everything Goes\", promoted as the network's flagship show, into airing directly opposite \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and thus attracting disastrous ratings. As a result of the crisis, the station quickly lost access to its line of credit.\nUnable to meet daily expenses, Global initially approached potential bidders, including Channel Seventynine, Denison Mines, Standard Broadcasting, and the Jim Pattison Group, and was soon bailed out by IWC Communications, owned by broadcaster Allan Slaight, and Global Ventures Western Ltd., a syndicate that included Winnipeg movie theatre owner Paul Morton and Izzy Asper, a Manitoba politician turned broadcaster. Asper's company, CanWest Capital, was in the process of obtaining the licence for what would become CKND-TV in Winnipeg, which planned to carry some of Global's programs under a syndication deal.\n1970s\u20131990s.\nIn the spring of 1974, Global cancelled a significant number of its scheduled programs. By that fall, it was obvious that Global's original model was unsustainable, and it was forced to pick up a large amount of American programming to fill in the gaps. With American imports filling as much of the schedule as Canadian content rules would allow (60% Canadian overall, 50% Canadian in prime time), Global had effectively become \"another CTV.\" With the exception of the nightly newscasts, few other Canadian-produced programs remained on the station, and the ones that did exist were largely criticized as cheaply produced filler. John Spalding, the station's original program director, quit in 1975 after being unable to convince the station's owners to invest more money into higher-quality production. To replace him, the company recruited programmer Bill Stewart away from CKCO-TV, Kitchener. Stewart's savvy program purchases in the ensuing years were largely credited with keeping the network viable while its viewership grew. The company enhanced its senior talent pool in 1979 with the arrival of sales guru Dave Mintz, formerly of KVOS-TV, as the network's president, a post he held until his retirement in 1993, taking Global from the lowest-rated station in Toronto to the ratings leader along the way. Over several years, the prime late evening newscast shifted between 10 and 11 p.m. and between 30 and 60 minutes. CKGN changed its callsign to CIII-TV in 1984, deferring to its widespread CATV distribution on Cable 3.\nAsper bought a controlling interest in 1985, making him the first western-based owner of a major Canadian broadcaster. In 1989, Asper and Morton tried to buy each other out, a struggle that was resolved in favour of Asper and Canwest.\nFor its first decade, the network remained restricted to its six-transmitter chain in Ontario. However, soon after Asper bought controlling interest in Global, he seemed eager to grow his chain of stations into a third national network. He started by launching CFRE-DT in Regina and CFSK-DT in Saskatoon, and winning a legal battle for CKVU-DT in Vancouver during the second half of the 1980s. He also acquired the fledgling CIHF-DT in Halifax in the early 1990s. Canwest's stations now reached seven of Canada's ten provinces. The Canwest stations purchased many of their programs collectively, and consequently had similar\u2014although not identical\u2014broadcast schedules. They did not share common branding, however\u2014although stations were sometimes indicated as being part of the \"CanWest Global System\" as a secondary brand, throughout the 1980s and early 1990s they each retained their own branding and continued to function as an ownership group of independent stations rather than as a fully unified network.\nIn 1997, Canwest bought a controlling interest in the CBC affiliate in Quebec City, CKMI-TV, from TVA, which retained a 49% interest until 2002. With the acquisition of CKMI, Canwest now had enough coverage of Canada that it seemed logical to rebrand its station group as a network. Accordingly, on August 18, 1997, Canwest scrubbed all local branding from its stations and rebranded them as the \"Global Television Network,\" the brand previously used solely by the Ontario outlet. On the same day, CKMI disaffiliated from CBC, set up rebroadcasters in Montreal and Sherbrooke, and became the Quebec outlet of the newly minted network. It also built a new studio in Montreal and moved most of its operations there, though the licence nominally remained in Quebec City until 2009. Canwest's acquisition of CKMI expanded Global's reach to eight of Canada's 10 largest markets, with only rebroadcasters serving Ottawa and Montreal.\nEven so, Global was still not a fully national network, as it did not have stations in Calgary and Edmonton. The CRTC turned down bids by Canwest for stations in those cities in the 1980s. As a result, Global continued its long-standing secondary affiliations in those cities on independent stations CICT-TV and CITV-TV, respectively. Similarly, Global lacked a full-time station in St. John's, where Global programming was carried by longtime CTV affiliate CJON-TV.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, Canwest acquired the conventional television assets of Western International Communications (WIC). WIC's stations in Calgary, Edmonton, and Lethbridge had been airing some Global programs since 1988, and those stations formally joined the network on September 4, 2000.\nThe following fall, WIC's long-dominant Vancouver station CHAN-TV was brought into the fold after its existing affiliation agreement with CTV expired, setting off a sweeping realignment of television affiliations in southwestern British Columbia. Indeed, one main reason why Canwest bought WIC's television assets was because of CHAN's enormous translator network, which covered 97% of British Columbia. Global's previous Vancouver station, CKVU-TV, as well as WIC-owned Montreal CTV affiliate CFCF-TV, were sold off. WIC's remaining stations were maintained as twinstick stations and were eventually integrated into a secondary system known as CH (rebranded as E! in 2007 in a partnership with the American channel of the same name), although financial pressures forced Canwest to sell or fold the E! stations in 2009.\nFull network service is still not available over-the-air in Newfoundland and Labrador. However, CJON, having disaffiliated from CTV in 2002, now clears the vast majority of Global programming in that province, most recently adding the network's national newscast in mid-2009. Any remaining programs there may be accessed on cable or satellite through Global stations from other markets (most commonly Edmonton's CITV) or through the network's website.\nFollowing Canwest's purchase of Southam Newspapers (later Canwest Publishing) and the \"National Post\" from Conrad Black in 2001, their media interests were merged under a policy of cross-promotion and synergy. Journalists from the \"Post\" and other Canwest papers made frequent appearances on Global's news programs, passengers on the now-defunct serial drama \"Train 48\" habitually read the \"Post\", and Global programs were promoted in Canwest newspapers. However, this practice has now been largely abandoned, particularly after Canwest's breakup in 2010.\nIn late 2004, with CTV beginning to dominate the ratings, Canwest reorganized its Canadian operations and hired a number of new executives, all formerly of various U.S. media firms, leading to a major overhaul of Global that was announced in December 2005. The most obvious change was a new logo, replacing the \"crescent\" with a new \"greater than\" logo, with the Global wordmark in a new font, that was introduced on February 5, 2006 (coinciding with Global's broadcast of Super Bowl XL). New logos and graphics were designed for news and network promotions, and several newscasts received new timeslots and formats. The company subsequently removed the crescent, which had been a common design element in many Canwest logos, from other properties it owned or sponsored over time.\nOn April 10, 2008, the network announced that its Toronto and Vancouver stations would start broadcasting their over-the-air signals in those markets in high definition. CIII and CHAN officially started transmitting in HD on April 18, 2008. The network has also launched digital signals at its stations in Calgary (CICT-DT) and Edmonton (CITV-DT) as of July 2009.\n2010s.\nFollowing Canwest seeking creditor protection in late 2009, Shaw Communications acquired Canwest's broadcasting assets on October 27, 2010, and folded them into a new division, Shaw Media, of which Global is the flagship. Canwest's newspaper assets had been sold off earlier in the year as Postmedia Network.\nOn April 1, 2016, as part of a corporate reorganization (marketed as being an acquisition), Shaw Media was subsumed by Shaw's sister company, Corus Entertainment.\nTelevision listings.\nIn television listings such as \"TV Guide\", where space limitations usually require television networks to be referred to by a three-letter abbreviation, the abbreviations \"GLO,\" \"GLB,\" or \"GTV\" are commonly used, depending on the publication. None of these abbreviations has any standing as an official name for the network, however\u2014the network's own short form name for itself is always \"Global.\"\nProgramming.\nNews.\nGlobal News is the news and current affairs division of the Global Television Network, which is based in Vancouver. National programs broadcast by the division include Global's flagship national newscast \"Global National\" and newsmagazine shows such as \"16x9\". The network also offers various amounts of local news programming on its eleven O&amp;Os. Local news programming on most of Global's O&amp;Os mirror the newscast schedules of many U.S. television stations; most Global-owned stations carry a morning newscast of three or four hours in length, a noon newscast, supper hour newscasts of between 30 and 90 minutes and a half-hour to hour-long late evening newscast. Global-owned stations in certain major markets also carry locally based public affairs programs under the \"Focus\" brand.\nIn addition, Corus also operates several Global-branded news/talk radio stations across Canada under the \"Global News Radio\" moniker.\nEntertainment.\nGlobal does not have what can be called a main schedule, apart from news. Even before the WIC purchase, the Global stations had widely varying program lineups, and the WIC purchase only exacerbated the differences. For example, CHAN held the British Columbia rights to many shows that aired on CTV until 2001, except for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". Factors influencing the stations' programming include time zone differences, local programming, and ratings for non-Global shows.\nGlobal has built its business on profitable entertainment programming produced in the United States and has long been criticized for not investing enough in Canadian content. Canadian programming carried on the network, such as a revival of 1960s American science fiction series \"The Outer Limits\", or the Chicago-set drama \"Zoe Busiek: Wild Card\", has often avoided Canadian themes, presumably to focus on sales to United States and international cable or syndication markets \u2013 although \"Psi Factor\" did include Canadian themes, including a \"killer wheat\" episode and episodes set in Northern Quebec and Halifax. Series initially intended for the U.S. and international market are sometimes called \"industrial\" productions and largely disappeared with the collapse of the international action hour market.\nFrom the late-1990s to the mid-2000s, Global aired somewhat more identifiably Canadian entertainment programming, including the long-running finance drama \"Traders\", the British-Canadian animated comedy \"Bob and Margaret\", the police procedural drama \"Blue Murder\", the nightly improvised drama \"Train 48\", the sitcom \"The Jane Show\" and the reality show \"My Fabulous Gay Wedding\". In 2003, Global signed comedian Mike Bullard, host of the nightly \"Open Mike with Mike Bullard\" on CTV and The Comedy Network, to a multi-year contract for a new nightly talk show on Global, but that series was cancelled after 60 episodes amid poor ratings.\nGlobal purchased the rights to produce a Canadian version of the popular entertainment magazine \"Entertainment Tonight\"; \"ET Canada\" launched on September 12, 2005. It also secured Canadian production rights to the American reality series \"The Apprentice\", but a Canadian version of the program never came to fruition. They also produce a Canadian version of the reality series \"Big Brother\".\nGlobal, like all Canadian broadcast outlets, benefits from Canada's simultaneous substitution (or \"simsub\") regulations, which allow content owners to control programming rights for a particular show in Canada. When an American broadcast network is broadcasting the same show at the same time that Global is (such as the programs mentioned above), Canadian cable subscribers may only watch the Global Television broadcast, even when trying to view the American stations. This law gives them double exposure for their content and a larger share of advertising revenue, effectively blocking American border cities from access to the Canadian market. This was done to help give money to the networks to fund Canadian content development. Global is not the only Canadian broadcaster to use simsubs; nonetheless, some complaints, specific to Global, have arisen due to the following related practices:\nGlobal cross-promotes heavily with other Corus Entertainment properties in the markets where both services operate in parallel.\nOn June 6, 2007, the Canadian actors' union ACTRA picketed Global's fall upfronts presentation to protest the lack of Canadian content on current television network schedules.\nSports.\nIn 1979, Global \u2013 then a regional network in Ontario \u2013 purchased the Toronto Blizzard soccer team and produced and aired coverage of the team's games in-house. The team was not a success on the field, in attendance or ratings, and Global sold the franchise in 1981 but continued to broadcast seven games a year until 1983.\nAside from its brief experiment with soccer, the Global network has never had an in-house sports production division as do CBC, CTV/TSN, &amp; Citytv/Sportsnet. Network sports broadcasts are either simulcast with American networks or outsourced to independent producers such as Molstar. During the 1987 and 1988 Stanley Cup playoffs, Global aired NHL games syndicated by Carling O'Keefe. Global was the longtime broadcaster of National Football League football games in Canada, an association that ended in 2007 when CTV outbid Global for the NFL broadcast package. The network was a long-time broadcaster of PGA Tour events.\nBeyond event coverage, many Global stations were well known for local late-night sports highlights shows, such as \"Sportsline\" in Ontario, \"Sports Page\" in Vancouver (later moved to former sister station CHEK-TV), \"2&amp;7 Sports at 11\" in Calgary and \"Sports Night\" in Edmonton. Most of these programs were later unified under the \"Global Sports\" brand. However, due to declining audiences, by fall 2005 all but the Ontario program had been cancelled, although stations continued to cover sports in their local newscasts. Global Ontario's sports program was finally cancelled in January 2007; at that point, the station closed its sports department entirely, and for a time outsourced sports coverage to Sportsnet and The Score / Sportsnet 360.\nSome Global O&amp;Os outside of Ontario (such as CHAN Vancouver and CITV Edmonton) continue to feature locally produced sports segments on their local newscasts. On the other hand, the sports segments aired during local newscasts on CIHF-DT in Saint John and CKMI-DT in Montreal are produced from CHAN's Vancouver studio, presented by that station's sports anchors.\nUntil the discontinuation of Fox Sports World Canada, CKND-DT in Winnipeg also produced the \"Fox Soccer Report\", which was seen on the network and Fox Soccer in the United States. It was replaced in 2012 by the Sportsnet-produced \"Fox Soccer News\".\nIn 2015, Global broadcast coverage of the Canada West conference's university football championship, including coverage of one semi-final game, and the Hardy Cup game the following week. The telecasts were produced through Shaw TV's \"Canada West Football on Shaw\" package.\nVideo on-demand.\nGlobal streams live and on-demand programming via its website and apps for mobile devices and digital media players. In 2020, the Global apps were relaunched to include streaming for subscribers of most of Corus Entertainment's specialty channels, mirroring a similar move announced by CTV.\nGlobal HD.\nIn October 2004, Global launched a 1080i high definition simulcast feed of its Toronto station CIII-TV called Global HD and started airing select American programs in HD; some Canadian series such as \"Falcon Beach\" eventually began to be included among its HD programs. At the time, the service was only available via digital cable. On April 18, 2008, Global officially launched a digital transmitter in Toronto, making the HD simulcast of CIII-TV available over-the-air. The network also launched an HD simulcast feed of its Vancouver station (CHAN-TV) on the same day.\nGlobal HD is available nationally via satellite and on digital cable as well as for free over-the-air using a regular TV antenna and a digital tuner (included in most new television sets) on the following channels:\nThe above noted transmitters were converted to digital by August 31, 2011, as part of Canada's over-the-air transition deadline in mandatory markets from analog to digital. As part of its purchase by Shaw Communications in 2011, Shaw committed to converting all of the network's over-the-air analog transmitters to digital by 2016.\nGlobal stations.\nThe Global network has long been much more decentralized than either CBC or CTV. For most programs, there is no \"network\" feed \"per se\", and in effect every commercial break is a station break. National advertising is certainly available, but such ads are seamlessly integrated into local ad blocks.\nIn fact, it is not uncommon to see different lengths of commercial breaks from one station to the next even during identical programming. This occurs even though all Global stations have had their master control operations centralized in Calgary since fall 2006.\nFrom 2010 to 2016, with the exception of CIII-DT in Toronto, stations used sustained on-screen bugs using each station's full local brand as opposed to simply \"Global\". In September 2016, except for local newscasts, Global has updated its bug back to \"Global\" without an additional local station city below it.\nOwned-and-operated stations.\n\"Notes:&lt;br&gt;\"\n\"1) Two boldface asterisks appearing following a station's call letters (**) indicate a flagship station of the Global Television Network;&lt;br&gt;\"\n\"2) Two boldface plus signs appearing following a station's call letters (++) indicate a station that was part of the Canwest Global System until it was merged with the Global Television Network brand in 1997;\"\nSeveral O&amp;Os predate the first appearance of the Global banner in 1974. Specifically, CKMI, CICT, CHBC, CHEX, CISA and CKWS launched in the 1950s as CBC Television affiliates, while CHAN-TV launched in 1960 and soon became Vancouver's original CTV affiliate. All of these were eventually supplanted by network-owned stations or transmitters.\nMost of these stations serve their entire province or region through a network of relay stations as a part of the key station's licence, although some of their transmitters may air separate advertising targeted to their local community.\nOther Global-branded channels.\nGlobal previously maintained a secondary television system similar to CTV 2. CH was originally launched on February 12, 2001, by Canwest Global Communications after acquiring the Western International Communications properties in 2000. The system was launched in September of that year when the large network shuffle in Vancouver occurred, only to provide a secondary schedule parallel to Canwest's larger Global Television Network. It initially focused on airing programs from the U.S. broadcast networks that could not fit on Global's own schedule, to avail of simultaneous substitution opportunities. The system became \"E!\" in fall 2007, as a result of a deal with Comcast to carry programming from that company's U.S.-based E!: Entertainment Television, although it continued to air much the same American network series in primetime and the afternoon.\nThe E! television system ceased operations on September 1, 2009, due to low ratings and corporate financial difficulties that eventually led to Canwest filing for bankruptcy protection and selling its properties to Shaw Media; the E! O&amp;O stations experienced varied fates (CHCH Hamilton and CJNT Montreal were sold to Channel Zero, CHEK Victoria was sold to an employee-led group; CHBC Kelowna remained with Canwest and was converted into a Global O&amp;O, and CHCA Red Deer ceased operations outright), while the Pattison Group stations affiliated with the Rogers Media-owned Citytv system. As E!, local news and other regional programming, as well as most local community sponsorships on the O&amp;O stations, used local branding (using the callsign branding scheme common with Canadian stations not owned by a network or television system). This decision was at least partly made to avoid confusion with \"E! News\", but likely intended to ensure that local newscasts were not perceived as celebrity-oriented. E! in the U.S. later reached an agreement to bring the channel's brand and programming to Bell Media's Category 2 specialty channel Star! (which had a similar format to E! U.S. and had carried some of its programming prior to the 2007 rebranding of CH), rebranding it as a Canadian version of E! on November 29, 2010.\nOther Global-branded channels included the Global Reality Channel that was devoted to reality shows launched in 2010 and ceased operations in 2012, Prime, DejaView and Mystery TV, which the latter three channels formerly wore the previous Global logo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The essential requirement of memory management is to provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and free it for reuse when no longer needed. This is critical to any advanced computer system where more than a single process might be underway (multitasking) at any time. \nSeveral methods have been devised that increase the effectiveness of memory management. Virtual memory systems separate the memory addresses used by a process from actual physical addresses, allowing separation of processes and increasing the size of the virtual address space beyond the available amount of RAM using paging or swapping to secondary storage. The quality of the virtual memory manager can have an extensive effect on overall system performance. The system allows a computer to appear as if it may have more memory available than physically present, thereby allowing multiple processes to share it. \nIn some operating systems, e.g. Burroughs/Unisys MCP, and OS/360 and successors, memory is managed by the operating system. In other operating systems, e.g. Unix-like operating systems, memory is managed at the application level.\nMemory management within an address space is generally categorized as either manual memory management or automatic memory management.\nManual memory management.\nThe task of fulfilling an allocation request consists of locating a block of unused memory of sufficient size. Memory requests are satisfied by allocating portions from a large pool of memory called the \"heap\" or \"free store\". At any given time, some parts of the heap are in use, while some are \"free\" (unused) and thus available for future allocations.\nIn the C language, the function which allocates memory from the heap is called and the function which takes previously allocated memory and marks it as \"free\" (to be used by future allocations) is called .\nSeveral issues complicate the implementation, such as external fragmentation, which arises when there are many small gaps between allocated memory blocks, which invalidates their use for an allocation request. The allocator's metadata can also inflate the size of (individually) small allocations. This is often managed by chunking. The memory management system must track outstanding allocations to ensure that they do not overlap and that no memory is ever \"lost\" (i.e. that there are no \"memory leaks\").\nEfficiency.\nThe specific dynamic memory allocation algorithm implemented can impact performance significantly. A study conducted in 1994 by Digital Equipment Corporation illustrates the overheads involved for a variety of allocators. The lowest average instruction path length required to allocate a single memory slot was 52 (as measured with an instruction level profiler on a variety of software).\nImplementations.\nSince the precise location of the allocation is not known in advance, the memory is accessed indirectly, usually through a pointer reference. The specific algorithm used to organize the memory area and allocate and deallocate chunks is interlinked with the kernel, and may use any of the following methods:\nFixed-size blocks allocation.\nFixed-size blocks allocation, also called memory pool allocation, uses a free list of fixed-size blocks of memory (often all of the same size). This works well for simple embedded systems where no large objects need to be allocated but suffers from fragmentation especially with long memory addresses. However, due to the significantly reduced overhead, this method can substantially improve performance for objects that need frequent allocation and deallocation, and so it is often used in video games.\nBuddy blocks.\nIn this system, memory is allocated into several pools of memory instead of just one, where each pool represents blocks of memory of a certain power of two in size, or blocks of some other convenient size progression. All blocks of a particular size are kept in a sorted linked list or tree and all new blocks that are formed during allocation are added to their respective memory pools for later use. If a smaller size is requested than is available, the smallest available size is selected and split. One of the resulting parts is selected, and the process repeats until the request is complete. When a block is allocated, the allocator will start with the smallest sufficiently large block to avoid needlessly breaking blocks. When a block is freed, it is compared to its buddy. If they are both free, they are combined and placed in the correspondingly larger-sized buddy-block list.\nSlab allocation.\nThis memory allocation mechanism preallocates memory chunks suitable to fit objects of a certain type or size. These chunks are called caches and the allocator only has to keep track of a list of free cache slots. Constructing an object will use any one of the free cache slots and destructing an object will add a slot back to the free cache slot list. This technique alleviates memory fragmentation and is efficient as there is no need to search for a suitable portion of memory, as any open slot will suffice.\nStack allocation.\nMany Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows implement a function called for dynamically allocating stack memory in a way similar to the heap-based . A compiler typically translates it to inlined instructions manipulating the stack pointer. Although there is no need of manually freeing memory allocated this way as it is automatically freed when the function that called returns, there exists a risk of overflow. And since alloca is an \"ad hoc\" expansion seen in many systems but never in POSIX or the C standard, its behavior in case of a stack overflow is undefined.\nA safer version of alloca called , which reports errors, exists on Microsoft Windows. It requires the use of . gnulib provides an equivalent interface, albeit instead of throwing an SEH exception on overflow, it delegates to malloc when an overlarge size is detected. A similar feature can be emulated using manual accounting and size-checking, such as in the uses of in glibc.\nAutomated memory management.\nThe proper management of memory in an application is a difficult problem, and several different strategies for handling memory management have been devised.\nAutomatic management of call stack variables.\nIn many programming language implementations, the runtime environment for the program automatically allocates memory in the call stack for non-static local variables of a subroutine, called automatic variables, when the subroutine is called, and automatically releases that memory when the subroutine is exited. Special declarations may allow local variables to retain values between invocations of the procedure, or may allow local variables to be accessed by other subroutines. The automatic allocation of local variables makes recursion possible, to a depth limited by available memory.\nGarbage collection.\nGarbage collection is a strategy for automatically detecting memory allocated to objects that are no longer usable in a program, and returning that allocated memory to a pool of free memory locations. This method is in contrast to \"manual\" memory management where a programmer explicitly codes memory requests and memory releases in the program. While automatic garbage collection has the advantages of reducing programmer workload and preventing certain kinds of memory allocation bugs, garbage collection does require memory resources of its own, and can compete with the application program for processor time.\nReference counting.\nReference counting is a strategy for detecting that memory is no longer usable by a program by maintaining a counter for how many independent pointers point to the memory. Whenever a new pointer points to a piece of memory, the programmer is supposed to increase the counter. When the pointer changes where it points, or when the pointer is no longer pointing to any area or has itself been freed, the counter should decrease. When the counter drops to zero, the memory should be considered unused and freed. Some reference counting systems require programmer involvement and some are implemented automatically by the compiler. A disadvantage of reference counting is that circular references can develop which cause a memory leak to occur. This can be mitigated by either adding the concept of a \"weak reference\" (a reference that does not participate in reference counting, but is notified when the area it is pointing to is no longer valid) or by combining reference counting and garbage collection together.\nMemory pools.\nA memory pool is a technique of automatically deallocating memory based on the state of the application, such as the lifecycle of a request or transaction. The idea is that many applications execute large chunks of code which may generate memory allocations, but that there is a point in execution where all of those chunks are known to be no longer valid. For example, in a web service, after each request the web service no longer needs any of the memory allocated during the execution of the request. Therefore, rather than keeping track of whether or not memory is currently being referenced, the memory is allocated according to the request or lifecycle stage with which it is associated. When that request or stage has passed, all associated memory is deallocated simultaneously.\nSystems with virtual memory.\nVirtual memory is a method of decoupling the memory organization from the physical hardware. The applications operate on memory via \"virtual addresses\". Each attempt by the application to access a particular virtual memory address results in the virtual memory address being translated to an actual \"physical address\". In this way the addition of virtual memory enables granular control over memory systems and methods of access.\nIn virtual memory systems the operating system limits how a process can access the memory. This feature, called memory protection, can be used to disallow a process to read or write to memory that is not allocated to it, preventing malicious or malfunctioning code in one program from interfering with the operation of another.\nEven though the memory allocated for specific processes is normally isolated, processes sometimes need to be able to share information. Shared memory is one of the fastest techniques for inter-process communication.\nMemory is usually classified by access rate into primary storage and secondary storage. Memory management systems, among other operations, also handle the moving of information between these two levels of memory.\nMemory management in Burroughs/Unisys MCP systems.\nAn operating system manages various resources in the computing system. The memory subsystem is the system element for managing memory. The memory subsystem combines the hardware memory resource and the MCP OS software that manages the resource.\nThe memory subsystem manages the physical memory and the virtual memory of the system (both part of the hardware resource). The virtual memory extends physical memory by using extra space on a peripheral device, usually disk. The memory subsystem is responsible for moving code and data between main and virtual memory in a process known as overlaying. Burroughs was the first commercial implementation of virtual memory (although developed at Manchester University for the Ferranti Atlas computer) and integrated virtual memory with the system design of the B5000 from the start (in 1961) needing no external memory management unit (MMU).\nThe memory subsystem is responsible for mapping logical requests for memory blocks to physical portions of memory (segments) which are found in the list of free segments. Each allocated block is managed by means of a segment descriptor, a special control word containing relevant metadata about the segment including address, length, machine type, and the p-bit or \u2018presence\u2019 bit which indicates whether the block is in main memory or needs to be loaded from the address given in the descriptor.\nDescriptors are essential in providing memory safety and security so that operations cannot overflow or underflow the referenced block (commonly known as buffer overflow). Descriptors themselves are protected control words that cannot be manipulated except for specific elements of the MCP OS (enabled by the UNSAFE block directive in NEWP).\nDonald Knuth describes a similar system in Section 2.5 \u2018Dynamic Storage Allocation\u2019 of \u2018Fundamental Algorithms\u2019.\nMemory management in OS/360 and successors.\nIBM System/360 does not support virtual memory. Memory isolation of jobs is optionally accomplished using protection keys, assigning storage for each job a different key, 0 for the supervisor or 1\u201315. Memory management in OS/360 is a supervisor function. Storage is requested using the codice_1 macro and freed using the codice_2 macro, which result in a call to the supervisor (SVC) to perform the operation.\nIn OS/360 the details vary depending on how the system is generated, e.g., for PCP, MFT, MVT.\nIn OS/360 MVT, suballocation within a job's \"region\" or the shared \"System Queue Area\" (SQA) is based on \"subpools\", areas a multiple of 2\u00a0KB in size\u2014the size of an area protected by a protection key. Subpools are numbered 0\u2013255. Within a region subpools are assigned either the job's storage protection or the supervisor's key, key 0. Subpools 0\u2013127 receive the job's key. Initially only subpool zero is created, and all user storage requests are satisfied from subpool 0, unless another is specified in the memory request. Subpools 250\u2013255 are created by memory requests by the supervisor on behalf of the job. Most of these are assigned key 0, although a few get the key of the job. Subpool numbers are also relevant in MFT, although the details are much simpler. MFT uses fixed \"partitions\" redefinable by the operator instead of dynamic regions and PCP has only a single partition.\nEach subpool is mapped by a list of control blocks identifying allocated and free memory blocks within the subpool. Memory is allocated by finding a free area of sufficient size, or by allocating additional blocks in the subpool, up to the region size of the job. It is possible to free all or part of an allocated memory area.\nThe details for OS/VS1 are similar to those for MFT and for MVT; the details for OS/VS2 are similar to those for MVT, except that the page size is 4 KiB. For both OS/VS1 and OS/VS2 the shared \"System Queue Area\" (SQA) is nonpageable.\nIn MVS the address space includes an additional pageable shared area, the \"Common Storage Area\" (CSA), and two additional private areas, the nonpageable \"local system queue area\" (LSQA) and the pageable \"System Work area\" (SWA). Also, the storage keys 0\u20137 are all reserved for use by privileged code.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n* http://"}

A demodulator is an electronic circuit (or computer program in a software-defined radio) that is used to recover the information content from the modulated carrier wave. There are many types of signal modulation, and there are many types of demodulators. The signal output from a demodulator may represent sound (an analog audio signal), images (an analog video signal) or binary data (a digital signal).\nThese terms are traditionally used in connection with radio receivers, but many other systems use many kinds of demodulators. For example, in a modem, which is a contraction of the terms modulator/demodulator, a demodulator is used to extract a serial digital data stream from a carrier signal which is used to carry it through a telephone line, coaxial cable, or optical fiber.\nHistory.\nDemodulation was first used in radio receivers. In the wireless telegraphy radio systems used during the first 3 decades of radio (1884\u20131914) the transmitter did not communicate audio (sound) but transmitted information in the form of pulses of radio waves that represented text messages in Morse code. Therefore, the receiver merely had to detect the presence or absence of the radio signal, and produce a click sound. The device that did this was called a detector. The first detectors were coherers, simple devices that acted as a switch. The term \"detector\" stuck, was used for other types of demodulators and continues to be used to the present day for a demodulator in a radio receiver.\nThe first type of modulation used to transmit sound over radio waves was amplitude modulation (AM), invented by Reginald Fessenden around 1900. An AM radio signal can be demodulated by rectifying it to remove one side of the carrier, and then filtering to remove the radio-frequency component, leaving only the modulating audio component. This is equivalent to peak detection with a suitably long time constant. The amplitude of the recovered audio frequency varies with the modulating audio signal, so it can drive an earphone or an audio amplifier. Fessendon invented the first AM demodulator in 1904 called the electrolytic detector, consisting of a short needle dipping into a cup of dilute acid. The same year John Ambrose Fleming invented the Fleming valve or thermionic diode which could also rectify an AM signal.\nTechniques.\nThere are several ways of demodulation depending on how parameters of the base-band signal such as amplitude, frequency or phase are transmitted in the carrier signal. For example, for a signal modulated with a linear modulation like amplitude modulation (AM), we can use a synchronous detector. On the other hand, for a signal modulated with an angular modulation, we must use a frequency modulation (FM) demodulator or a phase modulation (PM) demodulator. Different kinds of circuits perform these functions.\nMany techniques such as carrier recovery, clock recovery, bit slip, frame synchronization, rake receiver, pulse compression, Received Signal Strength Indication, error detection and correction, etc., are only performed by demodulators, although any specific demodulator may perform only some or none of these techniques.\nMany things can act as a demodulator, if they pass the radio waves on nonlinearly.\nAM radio.\nAn AM signal encodes the information into the carrier wave by varying its amplitude in direct sympathy with the analogue signal to be sent. There are two methods used to demodulate AM signals:\nSSB is a form of AM in which the carrier is reduced or suppressed entirely, which require coherent demodulation. For further reading, see sideband.\nFM radio.\nFrequency modulation (FM) has numerous advantages over AM such as better fidelity and noise immunity. However, it is much more complex to both modulate and demodulate a carrier wave with FM, and AM predates it by several decades.\nThere are several common types of FM demodulators:\nQAM.\nQAM demodulation requires a coherent receiver. It uses two product detectors whose local reference signals are a quarter cycle apart in phase: one for the in-phase component and one for the quadrature component. The demodulator keeps these product detectors tuned to a continuous or intermittent pilot signal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Records split and WEA was formed. It was first established in Canada and followed by Australia. The Australian operation began in July 1970, by Paul Turner with five staff members. The official launch was held at the Menzies Hotel in Sydney on 1 October 1970. The company was then based in Riley Street, Darlinghurst, and had three major labels: Warner Bros. Records, Elektra Records, and Atlantic Records\nA year later Warner Bros. Records worldwide (including Australia) changed its name to Kinney Music. The monopoly laws in America at the time did not allow the three labels to trade as one, so the umbrella name of Kinney Music was chosen. For the first two years, the Australian Record Company (ARC), now known as Sony Music, handled the Australian distribution.\nTurner's income for the first year was 1 million dollars. That was achieved in seven months, with the first years sales being just under $2 million. By 1 October 1972, U.S. monopoly laws had changed and WEA, using the first initial of each of the three main labels for its name, was born. From that time, WEA Australia had its own sales and distribution arm.\nWEA became a major player in the Australian recording industry, through international successes of artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin and The Doors.\nThe company was renamed Warner Music Australia in 1990 and split into two divisions \u2013 WEA and East-West Records. With more focus being placed on domestic signings, phenomenal success was achieved with acts such as INXS, Cold Chisel, 1927 and Jenny Morris.\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Warner Music also invested in Brisbane bands, Regurgitator and Pretty Violet Stain. Regurgitator became Warner Music's first direct signing and remained with the company until 2004. In 2005, Sire Records invested in Brisbane band The Veronicas, who went straight to number two with their debut single \"4 Ever\" and their album \"The Secret Life of the Veronicas\".

The festival was held during summer, typically in January of each year but was sometimes held as late as early February in some cities including Perth.\nThe event was conceptualised after the Violent Femmes announced a tour of Australia. Promoters Ken West and Vivian Lees sought another act as middle-level support for the band's tour. They succeeded in securing Nirvana to play the Sydney leg at the Hordern Pavilion. \nThe Big Day Out debuted on the 1992 Australia Day public holiday in Sydney and eventually expanded to Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth the following year. The Gold Coast and Auckland were added to the schedule in 1994. As of 2003, it featured seven or eight stages (depending on the venue), accommodating popular contemporary rock music, electronic music, mainstream international acts, and local acts. Auckland was taken out of the tour schedule in 2013, but the festival returned to the city for its last run in 2014.\nAfter the partnership between Ken West and Vivian Lees was dissolved in 2011, Lees sold his stake in the event to American festival promoters C3 Presents. In early June 2014, C3 attained full ownership of the Big Day Out festival and announced the cancellation of the 2015 event on 26 June 2014 with the option for the festival to return in the future left open. Despite this, the event has yet to return in subsequent years and as of 2022 there are currently no plans for any event to be held in future. Founder Ken West died in April 2022 at the age of 64.\nHistory.\n1992\u20131997.\nAnnual music festivals had been gaining momentum for some time, and the United States had launched Lollapalooza in Chicago, Illinois in 1991. Australia had seen various music festivals but nothing annual. Big Day Out was founded by Ken West and Vivian Lees\u2013the festival began in 1992 as a Sydney-only show, with the headline act, Violent Femmes, playing alongside Nirvana, and a range of other foreign and local alternative music acts, at the Hordern Pavilion. In 1993 the scope of the festival was extended to include Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. West revealed in an interview that he was looking to create \"urban mayhem\" and \"controlled chaos\".\nIn 1994 the Big Day Out was extended further to include Auckland, New Zealand and the Gold Coast, and was held over a three-week period. The geographical locations of the 1994 festival occurred on an annual basis until 1997, when organisers West and Lees announced a year-long hiatus, causing concern that the festival was nearing the end of its existence; however, the festival returned in 1999.\n1999\u20132013.\nFollowing the start of the 21st century, the festival was involved in two major controversies. Firstly, 16-year-old Jessica Michalik was killed after she was crushed at a 2001 Sydney show during a performance by the band Limp Bizkit. Michalik's death temporarily placed the future of the BDO festival in jeopardy, but the event continued after the Sydney Coroner's Court criticised the crowd control measures at the site and inflammatory comments made by Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst after the crush occurred.\nThe festival celebrated its 100th performance in 2010. In the period leading up to the 100-show milestone, which occurred at the second of two Sydney dates in 2010, Lees claimed in an \"Australian\" article that the BDO's ability to build relationships with acts during their careers had become an important part of the BDO culture. In the same \"Australian\" article, journalist Iain Shedden described the BDO as one of the \"most successful and long-running rock festivals in the world\", aligning the festival with the established Australian horse-racing event, the Melbourne Cup.\nLees also explained the growth and increased complexity of the festival in the 2010 \"Australian\" article, stating that, while a crew of 70 people crossed Australia in 1993 for the inaugural event, the 2010 festival consisted of 700 people. Lees highlighted the increased needs of Australian bands in his explanation:\nIt does get easier but it's also getting bigger and that makes it more complicated ... You're more confident about what you're doing and having some gravitas, but at the same time, because we're having more and more expectations put on us by everyone, the complexities are increasing. Even Aussie bands that used to take five or six people on the road are now taking 11. That seems to be the magic number, even for a new starting-off band. What they are doing is working to put on the best show they can. Through that the festival needs more production, more riders, more hotel rooms, more everything.\nDue to the increasing popularity of the event, a second Sydney show was occasionally held. The extreme popularity of Metallica in 2004 led to this addition, followed by another second-show addition in Sydney for the 2010 event, when Muse was the headline act. A second Sydney date returned in 2011, in response to the co-headline acts, Tool and Rammstein.\nIn November 2011, the business partnership between Lees and West was dissolved, and the latter next partnered with Austin, United States (US)-based company C3 Presents, which runs the Lollapalooza festival in the US. C3 purchased a 51 per cent stake in the company following a split that was caused by \"internal and external\" pressures, whereby Lees severed all connections with the business. Prior to November 2011, Creative Festival Entertainment was the production company of the BDO festival.\nOn 17 January 2012, West announced that the Auckland BDO event, held on 20 January 2012, would be the last Big Day Out in New Zealand, explaining that the festival would only be held in Australia in 2013. However, in April 2013, the promoters said that they were seeking to reschedule an Auckland event in 2014 (at Western Springs Stadium instead of Mt Smart).\nThe 2012 festival was beset by difficulties and was described as \"disastrous\" by the \"Faster Louder\" website in June 2014. Headline act Kanye West did not appear at the Perth and Adelaide events, while a media report at the time alleged that \"staging and fencing contractors had not been paid, sponsors were angry and the festival was beset by internal rifts, namely the firing and then apparent re-hiring of CEO Adam Zammit.\"\nIn 2013 the festival received staunch opposition from the Town of Claremont's mayor Jock Barker, who stated that music festivals in general introduce \"appalling antisocial and criminal behaviour into a residential area.\" Although a study revealed that large-scale music festivals contribute approximately A$5.2 million to the state's economy, in addition to increased tourism and employment levels, Claremont councilor Peter Browne supported Barker's position by stating that the benefits of events such as the Big Day Out are \"hopelessly outweighed by the intolerable noise, the late finish, the high level of criminal activity and general social misbehaviour in and outside of the grounds.\" Despite such opposition, the Claremont Showground venue in Perth, Western Australia was used by the BDO organisers for the 2013 event. The Perth leg of the 2014 BDO was held at the Arena Joondalup venue.\nWest announced to the media on 17 September 2013 that Arash \"AJ\" Maddah, a fellow Australian music festival promoter, had joined the Big Day Out enterprise. Although West explained that \"the BDO team will now be C3, AJ Maddah and yours truly\", Maddah stated to the media: \"It's Ken's vision and I'm working for him. For 20 years it's been my ambition to work for the Big Day Out. It's been a great festival for 22 years. I don't need to fuck with that.\" As of the date of the announcement, Adam Zammit was the CEO of the company and Fairfax Media reported numerous job cuts.\nAn October 2013 Fairfax Media article then reported that the company's office space in the inner-city Sydney suburb of Surry Hills was being sold for A$5 million and an unnamed source informed Fairfax that the BDO company had also \"recently lost some or all control over the lucrative sideshows.\" During the same time period, Lees publicly revealed that West had sold his stake in the company and the festival was facing serious problems.\n2014\u2013present.\nShortly after Maddah joined the BDO team, the headlining act for the 2014 festival, Blur, cancelled eight weeks prior to the commencement of their first 2014 BDO show. The band announced the cancellation on their Facebook fan page:\nDevastated to report that Blur won't be performing at BDO in 2014. It's a shock that it has come to this. Only 8 weeks to go, the band feels that with the constantly shifting goalposts and challenging conditions of the organisers, they can't let it drag on any longer and want to make this announcement, to be clear to Blur fans that they won't be there. We've done our very best to work with the organisers and considered every option to make it happen, but they've let us down and let everyone else down too.\nWest previously explained in July 2013 that he had attempted to secure Blur for 14 years and their high status meant that they were considered a \"white whale\" act: \"That [securing Blur] was a long negotiation ... Blur were going to be a headliner in various years but they couldn't get it together and more importantly they weren't connecting as a band.\" BDO organisers were as shocked by the cancellation as those people who had purchased tickets, as they had not received prior notification. Social media was the forum in which the public and media received updates, with Maddah first stating on Twitter that, in the time he had been with the festival, he had only seen the BDO team work as hard as possible to fulfil each of Blur's requests. Maddah later stated on Twitter that refund options would be available for those ticket-holders who no longer wished to attend due to Blur's announcement.\nThe second 2014 Sydney show was then officially cancelled on 26 September 2013 due to poor ticket sales\u2014the show was merged into the first show on 26 January. In an official statement, West explained, \"Perhaps we were a bit ambitious expanding to two dates in Sydney for this year's Big Day Out.\" Overall, the attendance figures for the 2014 festival were equivalent to around 50 per cent of the 2013 event. Approximately 15,000 tickets were sold for the Perth leg of the festival, leading to an announcement that the Big Day Out would not return to the western capital city. Maddah confirmed to the media that 31,000 people attended the Sydney leg on 26 January.\nMaddah participated in an interview with the triple j radio station in February 2014 and said that he had not expected the festival to be financially successful in 2014:\nI was under no illusion that it was going to be [anything but] a financial catastrophe\u2014to say the least\u2014this year. That was not even remotely in my mind, that I was going to walk in there and make any money this year.\nMaddah further explained that the festival lost around A$10 million, but at the time of the interview, he was still awaiting the final financial results. Maddah cited overhead cost issues from the Perth leg as detrimental to the festival:\nWhen you look through the financial history of most of the national festivals, the east coast has to subsidise events in Perth ... That's another reason why Big Day Out ticket prices were so high this year, because generally speaking you lose money in Perth. You've got two days to get there, three days to get back, all the trucking, all the production... a hotel room that you would pay $180 in Sydney is $320 a night in Perth in the same hotel chain. The price of hiring everything is ridiculous over there. Combine that will dropping public support for festivals over there and attendance figures and then for all your trouble you get a kicking from the local government and state government. It just got to a point where it's become unbearable.\nOn 25 June 2014, the Australian \"Music Feeds\" website published an article after it received documents showing that Maddah \"stepped down as Big Day Out director and transferred his stake in the Australian festival entirely over to American partners, the Austin, Texas-based C3 Presents\"\u2014the arrangement was effective on 4 June 2014. Maddah's shares (held under the business name \"Madjo BDO Pty Ltd\") were transferred from West and an unnamed company in November 2013, thereby removing the last remaining cofounder from the business. The documents also revealed that the newly appointed director of the \"BDO Presents\" company, as of 4 June 2014, is a person named Blake Kendrick, while the company's new registered address belongs to an Australian law firm.\nOn 26 June 2014, the C3 company\u2014founded by its managers, Charles Attal, Charlie Jones and Charlie Walker, in 2007\u2014released an official statement in which it announced the cancellation of the 2015 Big Day Out; however, the company also stated that it enjoyed its involvement in the BDO festival and intends to \"bring back the festival in future years\".\nIn the wake of Maddah's sale and the C3 announcement, differing perspectives emerged in the media. On 26 June 2014, following the release of C3's official statement, Maddah insisted in a triple j interview that he remained involved with the festival and holds the option of buying back his stake in the company for 2016, the year that he insisted the festival will return. However, an anonymous source stated that Maddah is no longer involved, with C3 in control of all aspects of the BDO brand\u2014from social media to intellectual property\u2014while another unnamed source believes that C3 will \"bankrupt the company, go back to America and forget about Australia.\" Lees also spoke with triple j on 26 June and, in addition to stating \"It's a very dysfunctional arrangement with AJ [Maddah] being in the driver's seat\", expressed an ongoing belief in the high status of the BDO festival:\nThe Big Day Out has been, and will always be, the festival in Australia. And if people are expecting something better to come along tomorrow, then they shouldn't be holding their breath, because it's not going to happen. Big Day Out set the high benchmark which is not going to be succeeded by a one-day festival in the near future for sure.\nAfter the \"New York Times\" announced \"advanced talks\" between Live Nation and C3 Presents in early October 2014, the purchase of a 51-per cent stake in the Austin company was confirmed on 22 December of the same year. Described at the time of the acquisition as \"the largest independent concerts company in its space\", C3 reported revenue to the value of US$124 million in 2013 and was targeted by Live Nation for its festival portfolio. The C3 founders told reporters that they were \"excited\" by the development, but made no mention of the Big Day Out festival. It has not returned since then.\nArtist lineups.\nSince its inception in 1992, Big Day Out has attracted a large range of artists, with headlining acts including Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Kanye West, The Smashing Pumpkins, The White Stripes, Chemical Brothers, Blink 182, The Strokes, Muse, Hole, Violent Femmes, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, The Ramones, Soundgarden, Rammstein, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, The Prodigy, Marilyn Manson, Foo Fighters, Metallica, Tool, The Offspring, Neil Young and Red Hot Chili Peppers. The annual festival has also been a launching platform for many Australian artists, with various acts performing on the tour multiple times, such as Silverchair, Regurgitator, Powderfinger, You Am I, The Living End, Jebediah, The Vines, Grinspoon, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Kisschasy, and Wolfmother.\nVenues within the festival.\nBoiler Room.\nThe Boiler Room was an indoor dance venue hosting dance and electronica artists at the Big Day Out. The concept was started in 1993, when only two bands, Severed Heads and Itch-E &amp; Scratch-E, performed. The Boiler Room was established as a fixture from 1994 (the first with solely dance music) as the first big dance music stage of the Big Day Out, and soon became very popular, with DJ Fatboy Slim leading the lineup in 1999. Ben Suthers programmed the lineup for 15 years, until 2014. Also in 1999, British band Underworld played the Boiler Room in Sydney and Melbourne. In 1996, The Prodigy played, and in 1997, British artist Aphex Twin. Australian DJ and producer Groove Terminator said of his first Boiler Room experience \"In Adelaide, we played a lot harder and faster than anywhere else\". As LCD Soundsystem rose to popularity (2006-2007), the programming moved towards indie rock and slightly away from \"the club sound\". Other performers in the Boiler Room over the years included Simian Mobile Disco, Dizzee Rascal, The Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx, Goldie, and The Presets (2006).\nThe Boiler Room was a significant cultural phenomenon, which changed Australian music fans' perception of dance music, and was credited with bringing electronic music and culture to rock fans. DJ BeXta said \"genres were developing as Big Day Out and the Boiler Room was developing\". Programmer Sutherland said in 2019: \"Trying to get a whole bunch of people who maybe only ever listened to Nirvana, listening to dance music. That's its legacy.\"\nControversy.\nDeath of Jessica Michalik.\nDuring the 2001 Big Day Out festival in Sydney, Jessica Michalik was crushed in a mosh pit during a performance by the band Limp Bizkit. The crush reportedly occurred as the band began playing \"My Generation\". The band were then cut short by medical personnel and security staff as they attempted to play \"Re-Arranged\", after which the band took a 15-minute break before resuming their performance. Michalik was revived and rushed to Concord Hospital, but died of a heart attack five days later.\nAccording to a review of the band's performance by \"Metal Hammer\", Limp Bizkit's frontman, Fred Durst, encouraged the crowd \"to settle down\" twice during the performance. Durst also claimed the band had attempted to take precautions that fell on deaf ears, \"We begged, we screamed, we sent letters, we tried to take precautions, because we are Limp Bizkit, we know we cause this big emotional blister of a crowd\". The following day, Limp Bizkit had left Australia without telling the organisers, who only discovered the band's departure through a note left at the hotel.\nSenior deputy state coroner Jacqueline Milledge issued a statement saying responsibility was on the Big Day Out's promoters Creative Entertainment Australia, saying there was overwhelming evidence that crowd density was dangerous when Limp Bizkit went on stage. Limp Bizkit was also criticised in the report, Milledge saying that Durst could have taken the situation more seriously, with his comments on stage during the attempt to rescue Michalik \"alarming and inflammatory\".\nMichalik's parents filed separate wrongful death claims naming promoters and security personnel, and in one claim, Limp Bizkit. A New South Wales court dismissed the band and all parties connected with the band from the claim, finding they were not liable.\nIn 2005, United National Insurance sued Limp Bizkit in an attempt to avoid paying legal fees arising from Michalik's death. The company claimed in the lawsuit, which was filed on 11 August 2005, that Durst had incited the audience at the festival to rush the stage.\nFlag ban.\nOn 21 January 2007, a decision was made by the organisers to discourage Big Day Out patrons in Sydney from bringing and displaying the Australian flag. The organisers said the decision was a result of recent ethnic tensions in Sydney and complaints that the previous year's festival had been marred by roving packs of aggressive flag-draped youths.\nSections of the community had strong views in support of or objection to the policy. Prime Minister John Howard, New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma, and Federal Leader of the Opposition Kevin Rudd all condemned the move. Iemma suggested the event be cancelled if the organisers could not secure the attendees' safety. Main stage act Jet performed in front of a large backdrop of a black-and-white Australian flag cut-out of their name, with lead vocalist Nic Cester adding, \"I can't tell anyone else what to do but we as a band are very proud to be Australian and we don't want to feel we are not allowed to feel proud\".\nOther people including Andrew Bartlett of the Australian Democrats, sports writer Peter FitzSimons, and members of the hip-hop outfit The Herd expressed concern that the flag was being misused by a handful of aggressive attendees in a jingoist manner and that rock concerts were not the appropriate venue to be waving a flag.\nOn the first day of the 2007 Sydney Big Day Out, significant numbers of patrons attended the event wearing Australian flag-related apparel or carrying Australian flags. No one was refused entry and no flag-related material or clothing was confiscated. After that date, there were no further suggestions of banning the Australian flag from Big Day Out events.\nDrugs.\nDrug use is associated with many Australian music festivals, including Big Day Out, with anecdotal reports strongly indicating that alcohol continues to be the most prevalent drug at all events. Police have intercepted suspected users and dealers by placing drug sniffing dogs at some entrances of each festival and patrolling the event (see New South Wales Police Force strip search scandal). At the 2008 festival in Sydney, police made 86 drug-related arrests. In 2009, 107 people were detained for drug violations. At the 2009 Perth leg of the festival tour, more than 70 arrests were charged with drug-related offences.\nDeath of Gemma Thoms.\nAt the 2009 Big Day Out festival in Perth, 17-year-old Gemma Thoms collapsed after allegedly taking three ecstasy tablets. She died 12 hours later in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, after being transferred from the event's first-aid post. The girl and her friend reportedly took one tablet each whilst at home before the event. After arriving, she saw police near the entrance, panicked, and swallowed another two tablets. Police later denied responsibility for Thoms' death, suggesting that no sniffer dogs were being used to search patrons at the entrance she had used. They agreed that \"There may have been a perceived fear of being detected\". Thoms had been driven by car and had not taken the train to the station where police were searching.\nBeenie Man and Odd Future.\nIn November 2009, gay rights groups in New Zealand protested after controversial rapper Beenie Man was included in the second round of announcements for the 2010 tour. Groups such as GayNZ.com cited controversial and homophobic lyrics from Beenie Man's songs such as \"I'm dreaming of a new Jamaica/Come to execute all the gays\". The group called for Big Day Out organisers to drop Beenie Man from the lineup \"to send a message that homophobia is unacceptable\", and over 850 people joined a Facebook group to oppose his appearance.\nOn 15 November 2009, the festival's Australian organisers issued a statement on their website confirming that Beenie Man had indeed been dropped from the lineup. Whilst they acknowledged his commitment to the 2007 Reggae Compassionate Act and his promises to not perform the offending songs on his tour, they ultimately made the decision to drop Beenie Man because they felt his appearance would \"be divisive amongst our audience members and would mar the enjoyment of the event for many.\"\nIn early November in 2011, ahead of the 2012 Big Day Out, a request was made by Auckland City Council to remove Odd Future from line up due to some of their lyrics being allegedly homophobic. The promoters agreed, and put an Odd Future sideshow on in Auckland outside of the Big Day Out.\nCompilation albums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66931", "revid": "49983941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66931", "title": "Red Square", "text": "Square in Moscow, Russia\nRed Square (Russian: , , ) is one of the oldest and largest squares in Moscow, Russia. It is located in Moscow's historic centre, along the eastern walls of the Kremlin. It is the city's most prominent landmark, with famous buildings such as Saint Basil's Cathedral, Lenin's Mausoleum, the State Historical Museum and the GUM department store. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. Red Square has been the scene of executions, demonstrations, riots, parades, and speeches. Almost 73,000 square metres (800,000 square feet), it lies directly east of the Kremlin and north of the Moskva River. A moat that separated the square from the Kremlin was paved over in 1812.\nLocation.\nRed Square has an almost rectangular shape and is 70 meters wide and 330 meters long. It extends lengthways from northwest to southeast along part of the wall of the Kremlin that forms its boundary on the southwest side. In the northeast, the square is bounded by the GUM department store building and the old district of Kitay-gorod, in the northwest by the State Historical Museum and the Resurrection Gate and in the southeast by Saint Basil's Cathedral. Tverskaya Street begins to the northwest of the square behind the building of the State Historical Museum, and to the southeast is the so-called Basilius slope, which leads to the Moskva River, which goes down and over a bridge to the Zamoskvorechye District. Two streets branch off to the northeast from Red Square: Nikolskaya Street, which is named after the Nikolaus Tower of the Kremlin, which is directly opposite, and the Ilyinka (\u0418\u043b\u044c\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430), both of which have existed since the 14th century and were once important arteries of old Moscow. Today the square itself, with the exception of the access road leading through it to the Savior Gate of the Kremlin, is a pedestrian zone.\nOrigin and name.\nThe main squares in Russian cities, such as those in Suzdal, Yelets, and Pereslavl-Zalessky, are frequently named \"Krasnaya ploshchad\", or Beautiful Square. Archaically, the Russian word \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f (\"krasnaya\") meant 'beautiful', but now means 'red'. The current word for 'beautiful' is \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f (\"krasivaya\"), which is derived from it.\nIn Moscow, the name \"Red Square\" originally described the small area between St. Basil's Cathedral, the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin, and the Lobnoye Mesto herald's platform. Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich officially extended the name to encompass the entire square, which had previously been called \"Pozhar\", or \"burnt-out place\", reflecting that previous buildings occupying the site had burned down.\nHistory.\nThe history of Red Square is reflected in paintings by Vasily Surikov, Konstantin Yuon and others. The square was meant to serve as Moscow's main marketplace. It was also the site of various public ceremonies and proclamations, and occasionally a coronation for Russia's Tsars would take place. The square has been gradually built up since that point and has been used for official ceremonies by all Russian governments since it was established.\nBefore the 18th century.\nThe East side of the Kremlin triangle, lying adjacent to Red Square and situated between the rivers Moskva and the now underground Neglinnaya River was deemed the most vulnerable side of the Kremlin to attack, since it was neither protected by the rivers, nor any other natural barriers, as the other sides were. Therefore, the Kremlin wall was built to its greatest height on this side, and the Italian architects involved in the building of these fortifications convinced Ivan the Great to clear the area outside of the walls to create a field for shooting. The relevant decrees were issued in 1493 and 1495. They called for the demolition of all buildings within 110 sazhens () of the wall.\nFrom 1508 to 1516, the Italian architect Aloisio the New arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the Eastern wall, which would connect the Moskva and Neglinnaya and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the Alevizov moat having a length of and width of , as well as a depth of 9.5\u201313\u00a0m was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, -thick cogged brick walls. Three square gates existed on this side of the wall, which in the 17th century, were known as: Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, as well as Christ the Savior and St.\u00a0Nicholas which hung over them). The last two are directly opposite Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral. In the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns \u2013 \"raskats\". The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto.\nThe square was called \"Veliky Torg\" ('Great Market') or simply \"Torg\" ('Market'), then \"Troitskaya\" by the name of the small Troitskaya ('Trinity') Church, burnt down in the great fire during the Tatar invasion in 1571. After that, the square held the name \"Pozhar\", which means 'burnt'. It was not until 1661\u201362 that it was first mentioned by its contemporary \"Krasnaya\" name.\nRed Square was then the foremost landing stage and trading center for Moscow. Even though Ivan the Great decreed that trade should only be conducted from person to person, in time, these rules were relaxed, and permanent market buildings began appearing on the square. After a fire in 1547, Ivan the Terrible reorganized the wooden shops that lined its eastern side into market lines. The streets Ilyinka and Varvarka were divided into the Upper lines (now GUM department store), Middle lines and Bottom lines, although Bottom Lines were already in Zaryadye.\nAfter a few years, the Cathedral of Intercession of the Virgin, commonly known as Saint Basil's Cathedral, was built on the moat under the rule of Ivan IV. This was the first building which gave the square its present-day characteristic silhouette (pyramidal roofs had not yet been built on the Kremlin towers). In 1595, the wooden market lines were replaced with stone. By that time, a brick platform for the proclamation of the tsar's edicts, known as Lobnoye Mesto, had also been constructed.\nRed Square was considered a sacred place. Various festive processions were held there, and during Palm Sunday, the famous \"procession on a donkey\" was arranged, in which the patriarch, sitting on a donkey, accompanied by the tsar and the people went out of Saint Basil's Cathedral in the Kremlin.\nDuring the expulsion of the Polish army from Moscow in 1612, Prince Dmitry Pozharsky entered the Kremlin through the square. In memory of this event, he built the Kazan Cathedral in honor of the \"Kazan Icon of the Mother of God\", which had followed his army in a campaign.\nAt the same time (1624\u20131625), the Spasskaya tower received contemporary tent roofs. This was done on the proposal and subsequent draft of Christopher Galloway from Scotland, who was summoned to design the new tower's clock and suggested the arrangement of the tent roof over the clock. In mid-century, a gilded double-headed eagle was set on top of the tower. After this, the square became known as \"Krasivaya\" (lit.\u2009'beautiful').\nIn the late 17th century (1679\u20131680), the square was cleared of all wooden structures. Then all Kremlin towers received tent roofs, except Nikolskaya. One tent was erected on the wall above Red Square (the so\u2011called Tsarskaya Tower, so that the tsar could watch from this spot the ceremonies in the square). Tent roofs were also constructed at Voskrerensky (Iberian) gates, arranged in the wall of Kitai-gorod. These were the fortified gates at Voskresensky Bridge over the River Neglinnaya.\nIn 1697 and 1699, gates on both sides of Voskresensky Bridge were rebuilt into large stone buildings: the Mint and Zemsky prikaz (department in charge of urban and police matters). Zemsky prikaz (on the site of current Historical Museum) was then known as the Main Pharmacy, founded under orders of Peter The Great. In 1755 the first Russian University was originally housed in the building of Zemsky prikaz, before moving to the better known building on Mokhovaya street further across Manege Square. At the same time the (by then already drained) Alevizov moat was used as a state Pharmacy's garden for growing medicinal plants.\n18th century.\nIn 1702, the first public theater in Russia was built near the Nikolsky gate. It existed until 1737, when it was destroyed in a fire.\nIn the 1730s, a new mint building, called the Gubernskoye pravlenie (Provincial Board), was built in front of the old one.\nDuring her reign, Catherine the Great decided to make improvements to the square. In 1786, the upper floor of the market lines was made of stone. This line was built on the opposite side of the square, near a moat between the Spasskaya and Nikolskaya towers. Then architect Matvey Kazakov built (in the old forms) the new Lobnoye mesto of hewn stone, slightly West of the place where it was before.\n19th and early 20th centuries.\nIn 1804, at the request of merchants, the square was paved in stone. In 1806 Nikolskaya Tower was reconstructed in the Gothic style, and received a tent roof. The new phase of improvement of the square began after the Napoleonic invasion and fire in 1812. The moat was filled in 1813 and in its place, rows of trees were planted. The market Line along the moat, dilapidated after the fire, had been demolished, and on the Eastern side, Joseph Bov\u00e9 constructed new building of lines in the Empire style. In 1818 the Monument to Minin and Pozharsky, was erected; its construction symbolized the rise in patriotic consciousness during the war.\nIn 1874 the historic building of Zemsky prikaz was demolished. In its place the Imperial Historical Museum was built in pseudo-Russian style. After Bov\u00e9's lines were demolished, new large buildings were erected between 1888 and 1893, also in the pseudo-Russian style: upper lines (GUM department store) and middle lines. The upper lines were intended for retail sale and together in fact comprised the first department store in Moscow. Middle lines were intended for wholesale trade. At the same time (in 1892) the square was illuminated by electric lanterns. In 1909 a tram appeared on the square for the first time.\nSoviet era and modern era.\nDuring the Soviet era, Red Square maintained its significance, becoming a focal point for the new state. Besides being the official address of the Soviet government, it was renowned as a showcase for military parades from 1919 onward. Lenin's Mausoleum would from 1924 onward be a part of the square complex, and also as the grandstand for important dignitaries in all national celebrations. In the 1930s, Kazan Cathedral and Iverskaya Chapel with the Resurrection Gates were demolished to make room for heavy military vehicles driving through the square (both were later rebuilt after the fall of the Soviet Union). There were plans to demolish Moscow's most recognized building, Saint Basil's Cathedral, as well to make way for a larger Red Square, as well as the State Historical Museum. The legend is that Lazar Kaganovich, Stalin's associate and director of the Moscow reconstruction plan, prepared a special model of Red Square, in which the cathedral could be removed, and brought it to Stalin to show how the cathedral was an obstacle for parades and traffic. But when he jerked the cathedral out of the model, Stalin objected with his rather famous quote: \"Lazar! Put it back!\". However, no documented evidence exists of this encounter.\nIn 1963, a group of African students organized a protest on Red Square in response to the alleged murder of a medical student named Edmund Assare-Addo. This was the first recorded political protest on Red Square since the late 1920s. On 28 May 1987 a West German pilot named Mathias Rust landed a Cessna F172P light aircraft at St.\u00a0Basil next to Red Square, causing a major scandal in the Soviet Air Defense Forces.\nIn 1990 the Kremlin and Red Square were among the first sites in the USSR added to UNESCO's World Heritage List.\nRed Square has also served as a venue for high-profile concerts. Linkin Park, The Prodigy, t.A.T.u., Shakira, Scorpions, Paul McCartney, Roger Waters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and other celebrities performed there. For the New Year 2006, 2007, and 2008 celebrations, a skating rink was set up on Red Square. Paul McCartney's performance there was a historic moment for many, as The Beatles were banned in the Soviet Union, preventing any live performances there of any of The Beatles. The Soviet Union also banned the sales of Beatles records. While McCartney's performance was historic, he was not the first Beatle to perform in Russia. Former Beatle Ringo Starr and His All Starr Band performed at Moscow's Russia Hall in August 1998. On 4 December 2008 the KHL announced they would be holding their first all-star game outdoors on 10 January at Red Square.\nVenue for parades.\nTwo of the most significant military parades on Red Square were 1941 October Revolution Parade, when the city was besieged by Germans and troops were leaving Red Square straight to the front lines, and the Victory Parade in 1945, when the banners of defeated Nazi armies were thrown at the foot of Lenin's Mausoleum. The Soviet Union held many parades in Red Square for May Day (until 1969), Victory Day, and October Revolution Day, which consisted of propaganda, flags, labor demonstration, marching troops, and showing off of tanks and missiles. Individual parades have been held on Defender of the Fatherland Day (23 February 1925), the Day of Tankmen (8 September 1946), and the state funeral of Joseph Stalin (9 March 1953). On Victory Day in 1945, 1965, 1985, and 1990, there were Soviet military marches and parades as well, and since 1995, the annual Moscow Victory Day Parade has been held on the square, marking anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. The last large-scale Soviet parade commemorating the 73rd anniversary of the October Revolution occurred at the square in 1990.\nIn January 2008, Russia announced it would resume parading military vehicles through Red Square, although recent restoration of Iverski Gate complicated this, by closing one of existing passages along Historical Museum for the heavy vehicles. In May 2008, Russia held its annual Victory day parade, during which for the first time since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Russian military vehicles paraded through the square. On 9 May 2010, to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the capitulation of Germany in 1945, the armed forces of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States marched in the Moscow Victory Day parade for the first time in history.\nBuildings.\nIn the following, all of the buildings located directly on Red Square will be presented in a clockwise direction, starting with the State Historical Museum at the northwest end of the square.\nState Historical Museum.\nThe striking dark red building of the State Historical Museum forms the end of Red Square from the north-western side. It was built in the years 1875\u20131883 and is therefore one of the younger components of the architectural ensemble of Red Square. Before it was built, the first pharmacy building in Moscow stood on this site from the beginning of the 18th century, which was rebuilt in 1755 and served as the first campus of the then newly founded Moscow State University for two decades.\nToday's museum building was built especially for the historical museum, which was newly founded in 1872, and was ceremoniously handed over to its destination in May 1883. Its architect was Vladimir Osipovich Sherwood, who is considered to be one of the main representatives of the \"Russian style\", a variant of historicism based on traditional Russian architecture, which was widely used at the time. The museum building looks correspondingly \"Old Russian\": the facades are decorated with arched windows and ornaments reminiscent of traditional Russian Orthodox churches, several decorative towers reminiscent of some of the Kremlin towers are attached to the sides, and the shape of the roof is reminiscent of the Great Kremlin Palace in the Kremlin, a form of the Russian mansion that was particularly preferred in the 16th and 17th centuries.\nToday the Historical Museum is the largest and most famous history museum in Russia. In 16 specialist departments, it houses around 4.5 million exhibits on Russian history from almost all epochs and also organizes themed special exhibitions several times a year. In addition to the actual museum building, the historical museum complex also includes Saint Basil's Cathedral and the Novodevichy Convent, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nResurrection Gate.\nThe Resurrection Gate forms one of the two entrances to Red Square from the northwest side. This structure, built for the first time in 1680, was initially part of the Kitai-Gorod fortifications. In its base part it consists of two arched portals, which are crowned in a symmetrical manner by two rectangular towers, the tops of which are strongly reminiscent of the Kremlin towers. Originally, the Resurrection Gate represented part of the architectural ensemble at the northern end of Red Square, which, in addition to the gate, included the affiliated building of the government administration (see below) and the no longer preserved pharmacy building, which had to give way to the History Museum at the end of the 19th century. During the times of the Russian Empire, the gate served as a symbolic entrance gate to the heart of Moscow, especially during major celebrations: the tsars always passed the gate at their coronation celebrations before the coronation was proclaimed in front of the people on Red Square.\nIn 1931, the new state authorities had the gate dismantled so that it would not obstruct the passage of military technology during major military parades on Red Square. Today's gate is largely a replica of the original and dates from 1996. Between the two portals on the north side of the gate, the chapel of the icon of the Mother of God of Iviron, originally built in 1781, was rebuilt at the same time. A new copy of the icon was made for this chapel on Mount Athos, where the Iviron monastery is located.\nFormer government administration.\nThe building standing between the Resurrection Gate and the Kazan Cathedral is one of the less conspicuous buildings on Red Square. It was built between 1733 and 1740 and since then has served as the headquarters of the administration of the city of Moscow and the Moscow Governorate (the latter partially corresponds to today's Moscow Oblast). The government administration building was not spared from the war against Napoleon in 1812, in which large parts of Moscow were destroyed. In the 1810s it was then rebuilt, under the direction of the architect Joseph Bov\u00e9, who was instrumental in the reconstruction of the city at that time. In the course of this reconstruction, a tower was added to the roof of the house, which for a long time served as an observation tower for a fire station. At the beginning of the 20th century, however, this tower was dismantled.\nIn the courtyard of the former government administration building, the old building of the state mint has been preserved to this day. This was built in 1697 by decree of Peter the Great and since then has housed a production facility for silver coins for almost a quarter of a century before the money issuing system of the tsarist Empire was essentially relocated to Saint Petersburg. After the end of minting, the lower part of the building, which had no windows, was temporarily used as a Debtors' prison for insolvent merchants. Today, both the former government building and the old mint belong to the neighbouring historical museum.\nKazan Cathedral.\nThe Kazan Cathedral is to the right of the former government administration building, on the corner of Red Square and Nikolskaya Street. Today's cathedral is a replica from 1993; originally there was a church at this site since the 1620s, initially a wooden one, then a stone one from 1636 onwards.\nThe Kazan Cathedral owes its name to the icon of Our Lady of Kazan, which has been venerated by the believers of the Russian Orthodox Church for centuries. According to a legend, it was precisely this icon of the Russian People's army, led by the national heroes Kuzma Minin and Dmitri Pozharsky, who defeated the Military of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1612. A few years after the victory, the devout Prince Pozharsky founded the cathedral dedicated to this icon. This corresponded to the then usual Russian tradition of building churches in memory of historically important victories in Russia.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the Kazan Cathedral on Red Square was one of the most important Moscow places of worship and was the scene of solemn cross processions led by the patriarch and the tsar, especially on the anniversary of the victory over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn 1936 the cathedral, like many other Moscow places of worship, was demolished at the approval of Joseph Stalin. It was not until the early 1990s that the reconstruction, which was called for by the public on several occasions, began and was completed in 1993. This made the Kazan Cathedral one of the first places of worship in Moscow to be destroyed during the Soviet era, to be rebuilt in the 1990s.\nGUM department store.\nThe GUM department store, situated at the eastern side of the square, occupies the entire section between Nikolskaya and Ilyinka streets. Due to its location directly on Red Square, and its considerable size, the sales area is around . Owing to the building's striking architecture, the GUM is the best-known shopping center in Russia.\nBuilt in 1893, it replaced an Empire style building that had housed the Upper Trading Ranks since 1815, which united a large part of Kitai-Gorod's trading activities under one roof. After this building began to deteriorate in the middle of the 19th century, there were plans for a building to replace it. However, due to organisational difficulties, these could only be implemented in the 1890s, for which a special company was founded and an ideas competition among architects was advertised. This was won by a project by the architecture professor Alexander Pomeranzewas, as well as the little-known engineer Vladimir Schuchow. The construction of the new trade rows lasted from 1890 to 1893. When they were ceremoniously opened on 2 December 1893, the new structure was able to impress the Russian and foreign public, not only with an unprecedented range of all kinds of consumer goods, but also with a completely new glass roof construction of the three passages, designed by Schuchow and built using around 60,000 panes of glass. The building's architectural style, like the neighbouring Historical Museum a decade earlier, was in the historical \"Russian style\" with a roof gable based on typical boyar palaces of the 16th century, two decorative towers based on the Kremlin and a main facade reminiscent of historical Russian buildings.\nDuring the Soviet era, the new upper trading ranks had an eventful history. In 1921, they were given their current name GUM (\u00ab\u0413\u0423\u041c\u00bb), which, at the time, was the abbreviation for \u00ab\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u00bb ('State Department Store'); today it stands for \u00ab\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u00bb ('Main Universal Store'). In the early 1930s, they were closed for two decades and served as office and residential buildings, and from the end of 1953, until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the store was considered a model department store in the middle of the real socialist shortage economy. In the 1990s, the store was privatised and thoroughly renovated, and today, it presents itself to the locals and tourists as a noble shopping centre characterised by boutiques in the upper price ranges. Since 2013, GUM operates a yearly Christmas fair in front of its department store, the biggest one in all of Russia.\nMiddle Trade Rows.\nThe building at the easternmost point of the square, on the corner of Ilyinka Street, stands exactly where the Middle Trading Rows stood in the 17th century. These formed, along with the Upper Trading Rows, where today's GUM store is located, as part of the broader market trading area that helped shape the Kitay-gorod district, adjacent to the Red Square. This massive expanse of assorted market stalls and self-made wooden huts was for the first time replaced at the end of the 18th century, by a building complex specially built for trade, whose authorship is attributed to the Italian builder Giacomo Quarenghi. In the war of 1812, however, these buildings were burned down and were replaced by the Middle Trading Rows building, rebuilt by Joseph Bov\u00e9, which has been preserved to this day and is located on Ilyinka Street a few hundred meters east of Red Square.\nThe Middle Trade Rows was not built until 1894, as was the GUM store. Planned from the start as a supplement to the latter, the upper rows were supposed to accommodate retail trade, while the premises to their right were reserved for the wholesale trade, which is why both of the buildings look very similar architecturally. The building's architect was Roman Klein, who also designed numerous other well-known Moscow structures in the late 19th century, including the Pushkin Museum.\nAfter the Bolsheviks came to power, the building was no longer used as a trading house, but became the headquarters of various public bodies. Until recent times, it belonged to the Russian Armed Forces. At the beginning of 2007, four inner structures of the former trading rows were demolished while plans were made to reconstruct the entire building true to the original to house an exclusive hotel. These plans came under criticism from both Russian and foreign media as circumventing the preservation order by cleverly exploiting a loophole in the law. Work is currently underway to set up a museum in the building's interior space, to designs by Meganom and Nowadays Office. The new museum is going to form a part of the UNESCO protected ensemble of Moscow Kremlin Museums, and will bring a part of the Kremlin Armoury collection outside the Kremlin walls.\nLobnoye Mesto.\nThe Lobnoye Mesto (Russian: \u041b\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e) is a round, grandstand-like structure made of white stone in the southeastern part of the square, in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral. At the same time, it is one of the oldest buildings on the square that has been documented to this day. Lobnoye Mesto was first mentioned in 1549, when the then 19 year old tsar Ivan The Terrible gave a speech there. Thus, it must have been conceived from the beginning as a platform from which, above all, tsar decrees were announced to the people. The name \"Lobnoye Mesto\" could literally mean 'forehead' or 'skull' (and thus a literal translation of Golgotha), however, according to other hypotheses, it has nothing to do with a forehead, but with its location near the praise, as a steep river bank was called in medieval Russia.\nAccording to tradition, the grandstand on Red Square was originally made of wood, and the current stone building with a gate made of iron grating dates from the late 1590s. In the course of time, the Lobnoye Mesto was not only used as a platform for state announcements and announcements, but also as the centre of solemn events; the patriarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church gave speeches to the crowd here, at solemn services on Red Square. At the same time, the Lobnoye Mesto became notorious as the scene of executions, such as the one of Stenka Rasin in 1671, and many others. Although, these executions were not carried out directly in the stand, but a few meters away.\nAfter Saint Petersburg became Imperial Russia's capital, the Lobnoye Mesto lost its function as the tsar's tribune and has been a monument ever since. In 1786, it was rebuilt according to a design by the architect Matvey Kazakov, and moved a few meters to the east.\nMonument to Minin and Pozharsky.\nThe monument to the two Russian national heroes Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitri Poszharsky, erected between 1812 and 1818, stands directly in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral. Just like the Kazan Cathedral donated by the latter at the time in the northern part of the square, this monument also commemorates the liberation of Moscow from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian occupation troops in 1612, to which the popular army led by Minin and Poszharsky made a decisive contribution.\nThe bronze monument, which weighs 20 tons, and was financed entirely from donations at the time, was designed by the sculptor Ivan Martos. After almost 15 years of planning and construction, it was unveiled in a festive ceremony in February 1818. Since at the time, it had been five years since Russia successfully stopped the French invasion led by Napoleon, and the reconstruction of Moscow had just been completed, the monument was celebrated when it was erected as a symbol of the invincibility of Russia and the heroism of its sons. Originally, however, the sculpture did not stand in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral, but in front of today's GUM department store at the level of the main entrance. It was only moved to its current location in 1930, to make more space for military parades and large-scale demonstrations.\nSaint Basil's Cathedral.\nSaint Basil's Cathedral, which delimits the square on its southern side, is undoubtedly the square's most famous building, and one of Russia's cultural icons. Once, the church was the main place of worship in Moscow, but today the cathedral mainly functions as a museum that is part of the complex of the State Historical Museum in the opposite. Since the early 1990s, services have been held in the cathedral at irregular intervals.\nIn the middle of the 16th century, the wooden Church of the Holy Trinity, stood exactly on the site of Saint Basil's Cathedral. In 1555, Tsar Ivan the Terrible ordered a monumental church to be built on the site, which was a token of the victory of Russia over the Khanate of Kazan three years earlier. This was according to the tradition of the time to have churches built to commemorate military victories. The wooden church was then demolished and the present cathedral was built on this site by 1561, making it one of the oldest buildings on the square. The name of the cathedral, which is still more common today, was given in memory of Basil the Blessed, who was venerated by tsar Ivan at the time, and after his death in 1522, he was buried near the cathedral. Ivan Barma and Postnik Yakovlev were among the most popular architects of the church.\nFrom the completion of the cathedral to the relocation of Russia's capital from Moscow to Saint Petersburg, it remained the most important church in the city and the venue for solemn services on all major Orthodox festivals. In its history, the cathedral was threatened with destruction several times; legend has it that Napoleon ordered the cathedral to be blown up when he withdrew from Moscow in 1812, but a sudden downpour extinguished the fuses that had already been ignited. In 1918, after the October Revolution, the cathedral was closed by the Bolsheviks and its head was executed. At the same time, there were demolition plans for the cathedral, only the personal commitment of the architect Pyotr Baranovsky, who was commissioned to prepare the demolition against the plans ultimately prevented their implementation.\nWhat is particularly striking about the cathedral is its asymmetrical and unique architectural style, which greatly distinguishes it from most other Russian Orthodox church buildings. The central element of the house are its nine church towers with brightly painted onion-shaped domes, some of which are very different in size and colour. The latter also has the effect that the building does not have a main facade and therefore offers the viewer an unusual view from every side. Originally built of white stone, the cathedral was decorated in places with red bricks during a renovation in the middle of the 17th century, which gives it its striking colour heterogeneity to this day. The inside of the cathedral is also very imposing with a labyrinth-like system of corridors and galleries.\nEastern Kremlin Wall.\nThe eastern segment of the Kremlin wall, and the Red Square behind it, emerged on its present site in the 15th century, during the reign of Ivan III; the wall and the square were separated with a wide defensive moat filled with water diverted from the Neglinnaya River. The moat was lined with a secondary fortress wall, and spanned by three bridges connecting the Kremlin to the posad.\nThe northernmost of the three Kremlin towers is the 70 meter high Nikolskaya Tower named after Saint Nicholas, whose icon originally adorned the lower part of the tower. The tower is one of the four towers of the Moscow Kremlin today that have an entrance gate to the Kremlin. It was originally built in 1491, to a design by the master builder Pietro Antonio Solari, who as one of several Italian architects who were active in Moscow at the time, playing a key role in the construction of the Kremlin ensemble. In 1806, Nikolskaya Tower was significantly redesigned and under Gothic architectural style, which was completely unusual for the Kremlin. Only a few years later, it was destroyed by the troops of Napoleon, and was finally rebuilt in 1816 with the participation of Joseph Bov\u00e9. Owning its Gothic style, Nikolskaya Tower is still the most unusual of the twenty Kremlin towers.\nThe Spasskaya Tower, is the main tower of the eastern wall of the Kremlin, and is arguably the most famous tower of all of Kremlin. It also has an entrance gate, which closes Red Square together with the neighboring Saint Basil's Cathedral from the south. Owing its name to an image of the Savior that once hung over the gate, the tower rises over 71 meters, and like Nikolskaya Tower, was also built by Pietro Antonio Solari in 1491. However, it was then about half as high as it is today. The tower has roughly the current shape since a reconstruction in the years 1624\u20131625, when it was supplemented by a bell tower with a large tower clock designed by Christopher Galloway, which today, is the most famous architectural element of the tower. The clock's four dials, one on each side of the tower, date up to 1852, and each of them has a diameter of 6.12 meters. The high-precision clockwork occupies three floors of the tower, and a dozen bells below the top of the tower ring every quarter of an hour.\nBoth the Nikolskaya and the Spasskaya Tower are crowned by a three-meter-wide red star made of three-layer ruby and agate glass. These stars, were symbols of Communism, and were placed on a total of five Kremlin towers in 1937, which were previously adorned with the Imperial Russian double-headed eagle.\nThe small tower at the level of Lenin's Mausoleum between the Nikolskaya and the Spasskaya Tower is the Senatskaya Tower. It was built in 1491, also by Pietro Antonio Solari, and was purely defensive in nature: it guarded the Kremlin on the Red Square side. For a long time it remained nameless. It was only in 1787, after architect Matvei Kazakov constructed the Kremlin Senate on the Kremlin's territory, that it was given its present name. The dome of the Senate can be seen from Red Square. Inside the central part of the tower there are three tiers of vaulted chambers. In 1860, the flat tower was topped with a stone tent roof crowned, in turn, with a gilt weather vane. The tower contains a through-passage that allows VIPs to travel from the kremlin to Red Square. Its height is .\nLenin Mausoleum.\nAn important monument of the Soviet era is the Lenin Mausoleum, which is located in the western side of the square. It stands by the Kremlin wall at the height of the Senate Tower, almost exactly where the protective moat ran until the 18th century, and a tram line ran from 1909 to 1930. Inside the mausoleum, the lavishly embalmed corpse of Vladimir Lenin rests in an armoured glass sarcophagus. To this day, the mausoleum is open to visitors on certain days.\nToday's building made of granite and labradorite, was preceded by two provisional mausoleums made of oak. The first of these was erected in January 1924, a few days after Lenin's death, and had a simple cube shape at a height of three meters, a second temporary arrangement was set up in the spring of 1924. The current building was erected between 1929 and 1930. From the outside, it has the shape of a multi-tiered pyramid, which should underline the character of the mausoleum as a monumental burial place based on ancient models. The author of the design was the renowned architect Alexey Shchusev, who also had the two previous mausoleums built.\nFrom the completion of the mausoleum, and until the end of the Soviet Union, the mausoleum was considered a central attraction, and a place of worship in the socialist world. During the military parades and marches on Red Square, heads of state appeared from the central stand on the roof of the mausoleum until the mid-1990s. In 1953, the body of the deceased Lenin's successor Joseph Stalin was embalmed and laid out in the mausoleum. Eight years later, however, he was removed from the mausoleum in the course of the so-called de-Stalinization, which began after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, and buried at the Kremlin wall.\nToday the mausoleum still attracts numerous tourists, although mostly no longer motivated by the personality cult surrounding the revolutionary leader. Notwithstanding this, the further laying out of Lenin's remains in the mausoleum is controversial. Many celebrities, including the last Soviet head of state, Mikhail Gorbachev, spoke out in favour of Lenin's burial.\nKremlin Wall Necropolis.\nRight behind Lenin's Mausoleum, along the walls of the Kremlin, there is a large cemetery of honour. This was created in November 1917, when around 250 soldiers had fallen during the October Revolution in Moscow. They found their final resting place in two collective graves near the Senate tower. The tradition of burying revolutionaries on Red Square, the ultimate symbol of the Bolshevik Revolution, continued immediately: as early as the spring of 1919, Lenin's leading comrade Yakov Sverdlov was buried on the Kremlin wall and received with Lenin's Mausoleum, which was completed in 1930 the burial place is its central element. Since then, the mausoleum and the surrounding cemetery have been collectively referred to as the Revolutionary Necropolis.\nFrom the 1920s to the 1980s, hundreds of people were buried in Red Square who were considered to be the most deserving sons and daughters of the Soviet Union, that is, revolutionaries, heroes of the Soviet Union, statesmen and military leaders of the highest order. The burial in the Kremlin wall necropolis was in fact considered the highest posthumous honour that was reserved for only a few. A total of twelve statesmen; including Sverdlov, Mikhail Kalinin, Kliment Voroshilov, Leonid Brezhnev and Stalin, who was laid out in the mausoleum until 1961, were buried in individual graves, and a large number of the revolutionaries rest here in a total of 15 collective graves. Most of the burials here, however, are niches in the Kremlin wall, in which over 100 urns with the remains of revolutionaries, heroes or main ideologues are walled. The people whose urns are in the Kremlin wall include, among others, Lenin's companion Nadezhda Krupskaya, the first cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky, the nuclear weapon developer Igor Kurchatov, but also foreign politicians Clara Zetkin and Fritz Heckert.\nThe necropolis on the Kremlin wall has been a memorial since 1974. After the 1985 funeral of the head of state Konstantin Chernenko, there have been no further burials. The tombs of the necropolis can now be visited at the same time as the mausoleum.\nSport events.\nThe Russian Bandy Federation in cooperation with the Moscow Patriarchate annually organise the Patriarch's Cup, in which not only normal tournaments are held,https:// but also for bandy in boots.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66932", "revid": "167282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66932", "title": "Gay village", "text": "Geographical area within a city that is inhabited or frequented by LGBT people\nA gay village, also known as a gayborhood or gaybourhood, is a geographical area with generally recognized boundaries that is inhabited or frequented by many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people. Gay villages often contain a number of gay-oriented establishments, such as gay bars and pubs, nightclubs, bathhouses, restaurants, boutiques, and bookstores.\nSuch areas may represent an LGBTQ-friendly oasis in an otherwise hostile city or may simply have a high concentration of gay residents and businesses. Some areas are often associated with being \"gay\" cities or resorts, due to their image and acceptance of the gay community.\nMuch as other urbanized groups, some LGBTQ people have managed to utilize their spaces as a way to reflect their cultural values and serve the special needs of individuals in relation to society at large. Today, these neighborhoods can typically be found in the upper-class areas of a given city, like in Manhattan, chosen for aesthetic or historic value, no longer resulting from the sociopolitical ostracization and the constant threat of physical violence from homophobic individuals that originally motivated these communities to live together for their mutual safety.\nThese neighborhoods are also often found in working-class parts of the city or in the neglected fringe of a downtown area\u00a0\u2013 communities which may have been upscale historically but became economically depressed and socially disorganized. In these cases, the establishment of an LGBTQ community has turned some of these areas into more expensive neighborhoods, a process known as gentrification\u00a0\u2013 a phenomenon in which LGBTQ people often play a pioneer role. This process does not always work out to the benefit of these communities, as they often see property values rise so high that they can no longer afford them, as high-rise condominiums are built and bars move out, or the only LGBTQ establishments that remain are those catering to a more upscale clientele. However, today's manifestations of \"queer ghettos\" bear little resemblance to those of the 1970s.\nThe \"ghetto\".\nThe term \"ghetto\" originally referred to those places in European cities where Jews were required to live according to local law. During the 20th century, \"ghetto\" came to be used to describe the areas inhabited by a variety of groups that mainstream society deemed outside the norm, including not only Jews but poor people, LGBTQ people, ethnic minorities, hobos, prostitutes, and bohemians.\nThese neighborhoods, which often arise from crowded, highly dense, and often deteriorated inner city districts, are critical sites where members of gender and sexual minorities have traditionally congregated. From one perspective, these spaces are places of marginality created by an often homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic heterosexual community; from another perspective, they are places of refuge where members of gender and sexual minorities can benefit from the concentration of safe, nondiscriminatory resources and services (just as other minorities do).\nIn some cities, LGBT people congregate in visibly identified neighborhoods, while in others, they are dispersed in neighborhoods, which have less visibility, because a liberal, affirming counterculture is present. For example, LGBT residents of Philadelphia developed the city's Gayborhood, LGBT people in San Francisco congregate in the Castro neighborhood, while LGBT people in Seattle concentrate in the city's older bohemian stomping grounds of Capitol Hill, and those of Montreal have concentrated in a working-class neighborhood referred to administratively as \"Centre-Sud\" but largely known as \"Le Village\". These areas, however, have higher concentrations of LGBT residents and businesses that cater to them than do surrounding neighborhoods. Some cities, like Austin, Texas, have not developed a defined gay village despite the city of Austin being home to many LGBT people with developed LGBT-friendly businesses and a counterculture present.\nHistory.\nThe neighbourhood of Sch\u00f6neberg in Berlin was the first gay village in the world, developing in the 1920s. Prior to the 1960s and 1970s, specialized LGBT communities did not exist as gay villages in the United States; bars were usually where LGBT social networks developed, and they were located in certain urban areas where police zoning would implicitly allow so-called \"deviant entertainment\" under close surveillance.\nIn New York, for example, the congregation of gay men had not been illegal since 1965; however, no openly gay bar had been granted a license to serve alcohol. The police raid of a private gay club called the Stonewall Inn on June 27, 1969, led to a series of minor disturbances in the neighborhood of the bar over the course of the subsequent three days and involving more than 1,000 people. The Stonewall Rebellion managed to change not only the profile of the gay community but the dynamic within the community itself. This, along with several other similar incidents, precipitated the appearance of gay ghettos throughout North America, as spatial organization shifted from bars and street-cruising to specific neighborhoods. This transition \"from the bars to the streets, from nightlife to daytime, from 'sexual deviance' to an alternative lifestyle\" was the critical moment in the development of the gay community. On June 24, 2016, the Stonewall National Monument was named the first US National Monument dedicated to the LGBT-rights movement. Montreal's Gay Village developed a bilingual French and English identity reflective of the city itself.\nOnline communities had developed globally by the early 2000s as a resource connecting gay villagers worldwide to provide information for arts, travel, business, gay counseling, and legal services, aiming to provide safe and gay-friendly environments for members of LGBT communities in general.\nCharacteristics.\nGay villages can vary widely from city to city and from country to country. Furthermore, some large cities also develop \"satellite\" gay villages that are essentially \"overflow\" areas. In such cases, gay men and lesbians have become priced-out of the main gay village and move to other, more affordable areas, thereby creating an entirely new gay village, also thereby furthering the process of gentrification by pricing-out long held tenants of these areas. In New York City, many gays in the 1990s moved to the Chelsea neighborhood from the Greenwich Village neighborhood as a less expensive alternative; subsequent to this movement, house prices in Chelsea have increased dramatically to rival the West Village within Greenwich Village itself. Similarly, gentrification is dramatically changing Philadelphia's Gayborhood, and the city's LGBT community is expanding across the city. Other examples include, in Boston, gay men moving to the South End and lesbians migrating to Jamaica Plain; while in Chicago, gays have moved to the Andersonville area as an offshoot of the Boystown/Lakeview neighborhood. Some gay villages are not neighborhoods at all, but instead are entirely separate municipalities from the city for which they serve as the primary gay enclave, such as West Hollywood in the Los Angeles area, and Wilton Manors in the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area.\nThese processes are tied to the spatial nature of the urban renaissance which was occurring at the time. The \"first wave\" of low-wage gay residences in these urban centers paved the way for other, more affluent gay professionals to move into the neighborhoods; this wealthier group played a significant role in the gentrification of many inner city neighborhoods. The presence of gay men in the real estate industry of San Francisco was a major factor facilitating the urban renaissance of the city in the 1970s.\nHowever, the gentrification of gay villages may also serve to reinforce stereotypes of gays, by pushing out gay people who do not conform to the prevailing \"gay, white, affluent, professional\" image. Such people (including gay people of color, low-income/working-class gays, and \"undesirable\" groups such as gay prostitutes and leathermen) are usually forced out of the \"village\" due to rising rents or constant harassment at the hands of an increased policing presence. Especially in San Francisco's Polk Gulch neighborhood (the first \"gay village\" in that city), gentrification seems to have had this result.\nGay men and women have a reputation for driving the revitalization of previously run-down enclaves. Making these neighborhoods more desirable places to live, businesses and other classes of people move to the area and, accordingly, property values tend to go up. The urban studies theorist Richard Florida claims that their mere presence lures investors and jobs, particularly of the high-technology kind. They are, he says, \"the canaries of the creative economy\". Cities that have gay villages and are more tolerant towards gays, generally tend to have stronger, more robust, and creative economies, as compared to cities that are less tolerant towards gays. Florida says that cities as such have a stronger creative class, which is integral in bringing in new ideas that stimulate economies.\nConsumerization.\nThe gentrification of once rundown inner-city areas, coupled with the staging of pride parades in these areas, has resulted in the increased visibility of gay communities. Parades such as Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and Manchester's Pride events attract significant investment and create tourist revenue, and cities have acknowledged that the acceptance of lesbian and gay culture has become a sign of urban \"sophistication\" and that gay-oriented events, such as pride parades and the Gay Games, are potentially lucrative events, attracting thousands of gay tourists and their dollars. The growing recognition of the economic value of the gay community is not only associated with their wealth but also with the role that lesbians and gay men have played (and continue to play) in urban revitalization.\nList of gay villages.\nAfrica.\nSouth Africa.\nCape Town is a global destination for gay tourism, and is known as Africa's gay capital. The city is regarded as one of the friendliest in the world towards LGBTQIA+ individuals.\nJust beside Cape Town's central business district is the gayborhood of De Waterkant, which features a Pink Lane tour route past numerous LGBT-related establishments, installed to celebrate the local LGBT community's history and diversity. The suburb's permanent rainbow crosswalk is the official starting point of the city's annual Pride March, one of the events that takes place during the Cape Town Pride festival.\nNorth America.\nUnited States.\nData from the 2010 United States census showed that Provincetown, Massachusetts, had the most gay couples out of any city in the United States. Provincetown, or Ptown, was also voted \"Best Resort Town in 2011\" by Gaycities.com. The town had far more gay marriages than straight marriages performed since 2003 when Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage. The town's various businesses sponsor Gay Men's Week, Women's Week, Bear Week, Family Week (for same-sex families), and their version of a gay pride parade, Carnival. Famous gay residents currently include journalist Andrew Sullivan, filmmaker John Waters, and comedian Kate Clinton.\nSome cities have a very well-defined gay village in the heart of a larger area that also has a significant gay population. One example of this phenomenon is Davie Village in the heart of Vancouver's gay community. It sits within the greater West End area, which, though decently populated by gay people, is not necessarily considered a gay village.\nBoystown in Chicago is also a very well-defined gay village situated within the larger Lakeview neighborhood. Lakeview is an affluent neighborhood with a reputation for being a stronghold of liberal and progressive political views. Outside of Boystown, Lakeview is a mixture of both gay and straight citizens and families, but Boystown is the main gay village. Boystown began with a cluster of bars on North Halsted Street and blossomed into an entire district dedicated to LGBT life and culture in the 1980s. According to the founders of Sidetrack, one of these pioneering bars, Boystown was only to grow as much as it did because its residents were politically engaged and actively resisted city efforts to drive them underground. Gay bars in Boystown also served as a hub of AIDS-related activism.\nAndersonville is another of Chicago's gay villages. It became known as \"Girlstown\" in the 1980s and 1990s following an influx of lesbian couples to the area. Residents attribute this initial migration to a well-loved feminist bookstore called Women and Children First moving to Andersonville after being priced out of Boystown. In the mid-2000s, more families and older people started moving into Boystown, and many gay men also made the move to Girlstown. In the last decade, the number of married gay men in Andersonville actually surpassed the number of married lesbians and many of the neighborhood's lesbian-centric business have closed. Still, Andersonville retains its historical significance for the lesbian community and its identity as a haven for LGBT people.\nDespite its large gay population and higher concentration of gay venues, the South Beach area in Miami Beach, Florida, was never exclusively gay, because of its popularity among straight people alike. Philadelphia's traditional gay village comprises several downtown blocks and is called \"the Gayborhood\". The LGBT culture in Philadelphia has an established presence that includes clubs, bars, and restaurants as well as health facilities for the LGBT community. Philadelphia's \"Gayborhood\" contains 68 rainbow street sign signs throughout the community. Washington, D.C.'s Dupont Circle and Logan Circle area are known for its many gay oriented bars, restaurants, and shops. Dupont Circle is also known for its annual High Heel Drag Queen Race. The Short North in downtown Columbus, Ohio, is primarily known as an art district, but has a strong gay community and a high concentration of gay-oriented clubs and bars. In Boston, the trendy and upscale South End neighborhood has a large population of gay men, and the Jamaica Plain and Roslindale neighborhoods are home to scores of lesbians, also with vibrant but less trendy downtown areas. Montreal's Gay Village (\"Le Village\", in French) is considered one of North America's largest in population, concentration, and scope.\nSan Diego has its own gay village called Hillcrest, which sits around Balboa Park. Hillcrest is very close to the downtown area but is able to maintain a small town eclectic feel. While it is considered by most as the gay area of San Diego with its gay bars and dance clubs, the overall population of the area has only gotten more and more diverse with the rise in condominium projects. Having been priced out of owning or renting in the Hillcrest area, the San Diego LGBT community has spread outward for miles into North Park, University Heights and dozens more neighborhoods. These diverse, welcoming areas have slowly continued the gentrifying process.\nIn Minneapolis, Minnesota, areas surrounding Loring Park, site of the local LGBT pride festival, are regarded as a \"gay\" neighborhood, though many gay and lesbian people have migrated to more residential neighborhoods such as Bryn Mawr and Whittier.\nIn Tampa, Florida, the gay community was traditionally spread out among several neighborhoods. In the early 21st century, the Ybor City National Historic Landmark District has seen the creation of the GaYbor District, which is now the center of gay and lesbian life in the Tampa Bay area and home to the majority of gay bars and dance clubs, restaurants, and service organizations. Across Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg, the LGBT community is centered around the Grand Central neighborhood near downtown. In Orlando, Florida, the gay community is centered around the neighborhoods of Thornton Park and Eola Heights.\nAsbury Park, New Jersey, and the adjacent town of Ocean Grove, New Jersey, house large gay communities. Many vacationers who visit Asbury Park are gay, and the city houses New Jersey's only gay hotel, The Empress Hotel. Collingswood, New Jersey, a suburb of Philadelphia, also houses a prominent year-round gay community. Ogunquit, Maine, has a gay population of year-round residents and second homeowners.\nGreater Los Angeles includes several gayborhoods, most notably West Hollywood, Silver Lake, the Run in Downtown Los Angeles, and the Broadway Corridor in Long Beach.\nIn 2019, Village Hearth was founded in Durham, North Carolina, as one of the first LGBTQ co-housing developments in the United States.\nCanada.\nChurch and Wellesley is an LGBT-oriented community located in Toronto, Canada. It is roughly bounded by Gould Street to the south, Yonge Street to the west, Charles Street to the north, and Jarvis Street to the east, with the intersection of Church and Wellesley Streets at the centre of this area. Though some gay- and lesbian-oriented establishments can be found outside of this area, the general boundaries of this village have been defined by the Gay Toronto Tourism Guild. \nOttawa established an LGBT-friendly village along Bank Street in Centretown on November 4, 2011, when the City of Ottawa installed six street signs at the intersections of Bank/Nepean, Bank/Somerset and Bank/James. This is the cap to an historic year and six years of lobbying, where the village installed two public art projects in addition to tripling the number of rainbow flags in the village area. The village in Ottawa features a diverse mix of businesses and organizations, many of which cater to or of specific interest to the LGBT community, and has a high concentration of LGBT persons living and working in the area.\nEurope.\nThe neighbourhood of Le Marais in Paris has experienced a growing gay presence since the 1980s, as evidenced by the existence of a large gay community and of many gay caf\u00e9s, nightclubs, cabarets and shops, such as one of the largest gay clubs in Europe, Le Depot. These establishments are mainly concentrated in the southwestern portion of the Marais, many on or near the streets Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie and Vieille du Temple.\nA well-known gay village of Sitges is one of the richest residential areas within the area of greater Barcelona. The town hosts several gay events throughout the year, such as Gay Pride and Bears Week. The first monument for the gay community, an inverse triangle, was built in Passeig Maritim street in 2006. Many gay tourists use the gay-friendly accommodation in Sitges during Circuit Festival of Barcelona.\nNot all major cities have gay villages, especially those with more progressive histories with LGBT rights. Sweden, for example, legalized same sexual activity in 1944, a full 67 years before \"Lawrence v. Texas\" decriminalized homosexuality in the US. As a result, there was not the same need for secret gathering places in Swedish cities that shaped many gay villages elsewhere. However, there are areas which were historically known as meeting places for gays, such as S\u00f6dermalm in Stockholm, Punavuori and Kallio in Helsinki, which remain as somewhat trendy areas for gay people to live in, though they do not have a predominantly gay population.\nThere are a number of gay villages in England such as in Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and London.\nAustralasia.\nAustralia.\nIn Sydney, New South Wales, Potts Point (also known as \"Poofs Point\") and nearby Elizabeth Bay (also known as \"Betty Bay\") are renowned for having the largest gay population in the city, with many gay run business. The area is known for having the highest density of population in Australia with many Art Deco apartment blocks. Newtown also has a sizable gay population but it has a more gritty bohemian feel. Darlinghurst is also a historically gay area. Oxford Street in particular is known as the Golden Mile due to its long stretch of LGBT bars and clubs.\nIn Melbourne, Victoria, city fringe suburbs such as Collingwood and South Yarra have sizeable gay communities. Big 7 Travel ranked Melbourne as the fourth most LGBT friendly city in the world.\nNew Zealand.\nHamilton East, a suburb of Hamilton, a town situated in the North Island of New Zealand is one of the newest gay villages worldwide. There is a small gay population with some gay owned businesses, cafes and is across the river from the Hamilton central business district. The local LGBT pride month is in April each year and celebrates local diversity.\nAsia.\nThailand.\nIn Pattaya, Thailand, Boyztown is a hub of gay nightlife and entertainment that is especially popular with European and Chinese tourists. Since its peak in the 1990s and early 2000s, rising prices and COVID policies have caused Boyztown to lose some of its business. At the peak of its popularity, Boyztown drew in funding for AIDS-related charity organizations through grand events like the Pattaya Gay Festival.\nJapan.\nShinjuku Ni-ch\u014dme, Tokyo's gay village, boasts the world's highest density of gay and lesbian bars, many of which are very small and highly curated to a particular scene. Some are intended for foreign tourists, while others give priority to regulars and court a certain subset of the local LGBT community, such as butch lesbians or the BDSM community. Ni-ch\u014dme is also home to Japan's first LGBT center, Pride House Tokyo Legacy. Like Pattaya's Boyztown, Nich\u014d's business suffered during the pandemic, but it is slowly developing its former popularity.\nSouth America.\nBogota, Colombia has a prominent gay village called the Chapinero. The locus of the Chapinero's LGBT culture is one of the most famous gay nightclubs in the world, Theatron, which opened in the 1990s. Before Theatron, the Chapinero had a vibrant drag ball scene that drew crowds from neighboring South American countries.\nLGBTQ populations.\nTop LGBTQ populations in Brazilian cities.\nIn 2009, a survey conducted by the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in 10 Brazilian state capitals estimated that 7.8% of Brazil's male population was gay and 2.6% was bisexual (a total of 10.4%), while 4.9% of the female population was estimated to be lesbian and 1.4% bisexual (a total of 6.3%).\nIn the city of Rio de Janeiro, 19.3% of the male population was estimated to be gay or bisexual. Among the female population in the city of Manaus, 10.2% were estimated to be lesbian or bisexual.\nTop LGBTQ populations in the US.\nAn estimated 33 to 50 percent of Palm Springs, California, are gay male or other parts of the LGBTQ community; this statistic makes them the largest percentage community in the US.\nThe following charts show a list of the top US cities, states, and metro areas with:\nPopulation\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Starting off in the rodeo, Pickens took up acting, and appeared in dozens of movies and TV shows. For much of his career, Pickens played cowboy roles. He played comic roles in \"Dr. Strangelove\", \"Blazing Saddles\", \"1941\", and his villainous role in \"One-Eyed Jacks\" with Marlon Brando.\nEarly life and rodeo work.\nLouis Burton Lindley was born in Kingsburg, California, the son of Sally Mosher (n\u00e9e Turk) and Louis Bert Lindley, a Texas-born dairy farmer. Young Lindley was an excellent horse rider from an early age. Known as \"Burt\" to his family and friends, he grew bored with dairy farming and began to make a few dollars by riding broncos and roping steers in his early teens. His father found out and forbade this activity, but Lindley took no notice, went to compete in a rodeo, and was told by the doubtful rodeo manager that there would be \"slim pickins\" (i.e. little chance of any prize money) for him. To prevent his father from discovering that he had competed, he entered his name as Slim Pickens, and won $400 that afternoon.\nLindley graduated from Hanford High School (in Hanford) and was a member of the Future Farmers of America. He joined the rodeo, billed as Slim Pickens, and eventually became a well-known rodeo clown. During World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces. Reportedly when the recruiter asked him his profession, Lindley responded \"rodeo\"; misread on a form as \"radio\", he\u00a0spent his entire enlistment at a radio station in the Midwest.\nFilm career.\nAfter nearly 20 years' rodeo work, Pickens's wide eyes, moon face, strong physical presence, and distinctive country drawl gained him a role in the Western \"Rocky Mountain\" (1950), which starred Errol Flynn. He appeared in many more Westerns, playing both villains and comic sidekicks to actors such as Rex Allen.\nHollywood made good use of Pickens's rodeo background. He did not need a stand-in for horseback scenes, and he was able to gallop his own Appaloosa horses across the desert, or drive a stagecoach pulled by a six-horse team.\nPickens appeared in dozens more films, including \"Old Oklahoma Plains\" (1952), \"Down Laredo Way\" (1953), \"Tonka\" (1959), \"One-Eyed Jacks\" (1961, with Marlon Brando), \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"Major Dundee\" (1965, with Charlton Heston), In Harms Way, and the remake of \"Stagecoach\" (1966; Pickens played the driver, portrayed in the 1939 film by Andy Devine), \"An Eye for an Eye\" (1966), \"Never a Dull Moment\" (1968), \"The Cowboys\" (1972, with John Wayne), \"The Getaway\" (1972, with Steve McQueen), \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\" (1973), \"Ginger in the Morning\" (1974, with Fred Ward), \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), \"Poor Pretty Eddie\", \"Rancho Deluxe\" (both 1975), \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\" (1979, with Michael Caine and Karl Malden), and \"Tom Horn\" (1980, also with McQueen). He had a small but memorable role in Steven Spielberg's \"1941\" (1979) in scenes with Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee; during one scene, he enumerates the objects on his person, similarly to the way he does in the \"Survival Kit Contents Check\" scene in \"Dr. Strangelove\". In 1978, Pickens lent his voice to theme park Silver Dollar City as a character named Rube Dugan, for a ride called \"Rube Dugan's Diving Bell\". The diving bell was a simulation ride that took passengers on a journey to the bottom of Lake Silver and back. The ride was in operation from 1978 to 1984. He also played werewolf sheriff Sam Newfield in \"The Howling\" (1981).\nIn 1975, Pickens was in another Western, playing the evil, limping bank robber in Walt Disney's \"The Apple Dumpling Gang\"; that same year, the exploitation cult classic \"Poor Pretty Eddie\" was released, with Pickens portraying twisted Sheriff Orville. He provided the voice of B.O.B. in the 1979 Disney science-fiction thriller \"The Black Hole\". His last film was his least notable, \"Pink Motel\" (1982, with Phyllis Diller).\n\"Dr. Strangelove\".\nPickens played B-52 pilot Major T.\u00a0J. \"King\" Kong in 1964's \"Dr. Strangelove\". Stanley Kubrick cast Pickens after Peter Sellers, who played three other roles in the film, sprained his ankle and was unable to perform in the role due to having to work in the cramped cockpit set. Pickens was chosen because his accent and comic sense were perfect for the role of Kong, a cartoonishly patriotic and gung-ho B-52 commander. He was not given the script for the entire film, but only those portions in which he played a part. Three memorable scenes featuring Pickens were:\nPickens credited \"Dr. Strangelove\" as a turning point in his career. Previously, he had been \"Hey you\" on sets, and afterwards he was addressed as \"Mr. Pickens.\" He once said, \"After \"Dr. Strangelove\", the roles, the dressing rooms, and the checks all started gettin' bigger.\" Pickens said he was amazed at the difference one movie could make. He also said that working with Stanley Kubrick proved too difficult due to Kubrick's perfectionist style of directing with multiple takes for nearly every shot, especially with the climactic H-bomb riding scene, which was done in just over 100 takes. In the late 1970s, Pickens was offered the part of Dick Hallorann in Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's \"The Shining\", but Pickens stipulated that he would appear in the film only if Kubrick was required to shoot Pickens's scenes in fewer than 100 takes. Instead, Pickens's agent showed the script to Don Schwartz, the agent of Scatman Crothers, and Crothers accepted the role.\nVoice work and recordings.\nPickens lent his voice to the 1975 studio recording of Bobby Bridger's collection of Western ballads \"A Ballad of the West\", in which he narrated part 1, \"Seekers of the Fleece\", the story of Jim Bridger and the mountain man fur-trade era. In 1977, he released the self-titled country album, \"Slim Pickens\", on Blue Canyon Records. The LP contained 12 selections (including Kinky Friedman's \"Carryin' the Torch\", which was issued as a single) and two songs written by Pickens. The record jacket featured a photograph of the actor in his signature role in \"Dr. Strangelove\", sitting in the cockpit. Pickens also recorded a one-off single, \"Christmas in November\" (a song about a child who would not live to celebrate Christmas on time), on the Midsong label in 1980.\nTelevision.\nPickens appeared in numerous television guest shots, including a 1954 \"Stories of the Century\" episode in which he played the Sundance Kid to Joe Sawyer's Butch Cassidy, as well as four episodes of the syndicated Western series \"Annie Oakley\" (1956, with Gail Davis and Brad Johnson), a 1956 episode of \"The Lone Ranger\", and three episodes of NBC's \"Wide Country\" (1962), a rodeo series starring Earl Holliman and Andrew Prine. He appeared in the 1959-1960 Walt Disney Studios miniseries \"The Swamp Fox\" In 1961, he had a recurring role as Johnson in the 17-episode NBC series \"The Americans\", the story of how the American Civil War divided families. Thereafter, he was cast in a first-season episode of NBC's espionage series \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\".\nHe appeared in episodes of \"Mannix\", \"Cheyenne\", \"Sugarfoot\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"The Lone Ranger\", \"Frontier Doctor\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"Route 66\", \"The Tall Man\", \"Maverick\" (in several episodes playing different characters), \"The Westerner\", \"Riverboat\", \"The Fugitive\", \"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters\", \"The Legend of Jesse James\", \"Alias Smith and Jones\", \"Daniel Boone\", \"The Virginian\", \"Night Gallery\", \"That Girl\", \"Baretta\", \"Vega$\", \"How the West Was Won\", \"Cimarron Strip\", and \"Kung Fu\".\nPickens was cast in recurring roles in \"Custer\", \"Bonanza\", \"Hee Haw\" (where he was a semiregular from 1981 until his death), \"B. J. and the Bear\" with Greg Evigan, and \"Filthy Rich\". He played Wild Jack Monroe, the owner of station WJM, in CBS's \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", and also guest-starred as Zeke in the 1963 episode \"Higgins and the Hillbilly\" of the ABC sitcom \"Our Man Higgins\", which starred Stanley Holloway as a British butler for a suburban American family. Pickens portrayed Grandpa Shoenfield in a two-part 1980 episode of ABC's \"The Love Boat\". In an episode of CBS's \"Hawaii Five-O\", he portrayed the patriarch of a family of serial killers. Pickens emceed NBC's short-lived country music variety series \"The Nashville Palace\" in 1981.\nAwards.\nIn 1982, Pickens was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. In 1986, Pickens was honored by the Rodeo Historical Society during his posthumous induction into the Rodeo Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.\nIn 2005, Pickens was posthumously inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs for his work as a rodeo clown. In 2006, Pickens was inducted into the Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame. In 2020, Pickens was inducted into the Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame in Washington.\nFinal years and death.\nIn his last years, Pickens lived with his wife in Columbia, California. He died in a hospital in Modesto on December 8, 1983, after surgery for a brain tumor. He was survived by his wife and children, Thomas Michael Lindley and Margaret Louise Wittman (n\u00e9e Lindley), as well as his stepdaughter he chose to raise as his own, Daryle Ann Giardino (n\u00e9e Lindley). His funeral was held at Presbyterian Church of the Forty Niners in Columbia, California, where he was a member. His ashes were scattered over his favorite trail areas. His wife died in 2011.\nPersonal life.\nHis brother Samuel (1921\u20132001) was also an actor with the stage name Easy Pickens. Slim was a longtime supporter of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), appearing in promotional shots. He was an avid outdoorsman, appearing in several episodes of \"The American Sportsman\".\nCultural references.\nThe album \"Days Go By\" (2012) by The Offspring features the song \"Slim Pickens Does the Right Thing and Rides the Bomb to Hell\" (Track 12, 2:36) which harkens back to his final scene from \"Dr. Strangelove\".\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTelevision.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66935", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66935", "title": "Queer", "text": "People who are not heterosexual or not cisgender\nQueer is often used as an umbrella term for people who are non-heterosexual or non-cisgender. It is alternately used to refer to all people who reject sexual and gender norms and share radical politics characterized by solidarity across lines of identity. \"Queer\" is also a self-identity term for many people (similar to but distinct from gay, lesbian, and bisexual), characterized by rejection or disruption of binary categories of sexual orientation and gender.\nOriginally meaning 'strange' or 'peculiar', \"queer\" came to be used pejoratively against LGBTQ people in the late 19th century. From the late 1980s, queer activists began to reclaim the word as a neutral or positive self-description.\nIn the 21st century, \"queer\" became increasingly used to describe a broad spectrum of non-heteronormative sexual or gender identities and politics. Academic disciplines such as queer theory and queer studies have emerged to examine a wide variety of issues, either informed by this type of perspective, or to examine the lives of LGBTQ people. These share a general opposition to binarism, normativity, and a perceived lack of intersectionality, some of them connected only tangentially to the LGBTQ movement. Queer arts, queer cultural groups, and queer political groups are examples of modern expressions of queer identities.\nCritics include LGBTQ community members who associate the term more with its colloquial, derogatory usage; those who wish to dissociate themselves from queer radicalism; and those who see it as too amorphous or trendy. Supporters of the term include those who use it to contrast with a more assimilationist part of the gay rights movement, and to signify greater willingness to defy societal norms in pursuit of gender and sexual identity liberation. They may associate it with the advancement of radical perspectives that were also present within past gay liberation movements, such as anti-consumerism or anti-imperialism, or with events such as the Stonewall rebellion.\n\"Queer\" is sometimes expanded to include any non-normative sexuality expression, including cisgender queer heterosexuality, although some LGBTQ people view this use of the term as appropriation. Some non-heterosexual and/or non-cisgender individuals self-describe themselves as \"queer\" for the relative ambiguity and rejection of explicit categorization this provides compared to labels such as \"lesbian\" and \"gay\". PFLAG states that as such a personal identity, \"queer\" is \"valued by some for its defiance, by some because it can be inclusive of the entire community, and by others who find it to be an appropriate term to describe their more fluid identities.\" Recent studies have found that 5\u201320% of non-heterosexuals and 21\u201336% of trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people identify as queer.\nOrigins and early use.\nEntering the English language in the century, \"queer\" originally meant 'strange', 'odd', 'peculiar', or 'eccentric'. It might refer to something suspicious or \"not quite right\", or to a person with mild derangement or who exhibits socially inappropriate behaviour. The Northern English expression \"there's nowt so queer as folk\", meaning \"there is nothing as strange as people\", employs this meaning. Related meanings of \"queer\" include a feeling of unwellness or something that is questionable or suspicious. In the 1922 comic monologue \"My Word, You Do Look Queer\", the word is taken to mean \"unwell\". The expression \"in Queer street\" is used in the United Kingdom for someone in financial trouble. Over time, \"queer\" acquired a number of meanings related to sexuality and gender, from narrowly meaning \"gay or lesbian\" to referring to those who are \"not heterosexual\" to referring to those who are either not heterosexual or not cisgender (those who are LGBTQ+). The term is still widely used in Hiberno-English with its original meaning as well as to provide adverbial emphasis (very, extremely).\nEarly pejorative use.\nBy the late 19th century, \"queer\" was beginning to gain a connotation of sexual deviance, used to refer to feminine men or men who were thought to have engaged in same-sex relationships. An early recorded usage of the word in this sense was in an 1894 letter by John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, as read aloud at the trial of Oscar Wilde.\n\"Queer\" was used in mainstream society by the early 20th century, along with \"fairy\" and \"faggot\", as a pejorative term to refer to men who were perceived as flamboyant. This was, as historian George Chauncey notes, \"the predominant image of \"all\" queers within the straight mind\".\nStarting in the underground gay bar scene in the 1950s, then moving more into the open in the 1960s and 1970s, the homophile identity was gradually displaced by a more radicalized \"gay\" identity. At that time \"gay\" was generally an umbrella term including lesbians, as well as gay-identified bisexuals and transsexuals; gender nonconformity, which had always been an indicator of gayness, also became more open during this time. During the endonymic shifts from \"invert\" to \"homophile\" to \"gay\", \"queer\" was usually pejoratively applied to men who were believed to engage in receptive or passive anal or oral sex with other men as well as those who exhibited non-normative gender expressions.\nEarly 20th-century queer identity.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, \"queer\", \"fairy\", \"trade\", and \"gay\" signified distinct social categories within the gay male subculture. In his book \"Gay New York\", Chauncey noted that \"queer\" was used as a within-community identity term by men who were stereotypically masculine. Many queer-identified men at the time were, according to Chauncey, \"repelled by the style of the \"fairy\" and his loss of manly status, and almost all were careful to distinguish themselves from such men\", especially because the dominant straight culture did not acknowledge such distinctions. \"Trade\" referred to straight men who would engage in same-sex activity; Chauncey describes trade as \"the 'normal men' [queers] claimed to be.\"\nIn contrast to the terms used within the subculture, medical practitioners and police officers tended to use medicalized or pathological terms like \"invert\", \"pervert\", \"degenerate\", and \"homosexual\".\nNone of the terms, whether inside or outside of the subculture, equated to the general concept of a homosexual identity, which emerged only with the ascension of a binary (heterosexual/homosexual) understanding of sexual orientation in the 1930s and 1940s. As this binary became embedded into the social fabric, \"queer\" began to decline as an acceptable identity in the subculture.\nSimilar to the earlier use of \"queer\", \"gay\" was adopted by many U.S. assimilationist men in the mid-20th century as a means of asserting their normative status and rejecting any associations with effeminacy. The idea that \"queer\" was a pejorative term became more prevalent among younger gay men following World War II. As the gay identity became more widely adopted in the community, some men who preferred to identify as \"gay\" began chastising older men who still referred to themselves as \"queer\" by the late 1940s:\nIn calling themselves gay, a new generation of men insisted on the right to name themselves, to claim their status as men, and to reject the \"effeminate\" styles of the older generation. [...] Younger men found it easier to forget the origins of gay in the campy banter of the very queens whom they wished to reject.19-20In other parts of the world, particularly England, \"queer\" continued to be the dominant term used by the community well into the mid-twentieth century, as noted by historical sociologist Jeffrey Weeks:By the 1950s and 1960s to say \"I am queer\" was to tell of who and what you were, and how you positioned yourself in relation to the dominant, \"normal\" society. \u2026 It signaled the general perception of same-sex desire as something eccentric, strange, abnormal, and perverse.\nReclamation.\nGeneral.\nBeginning in the 1980s, the label \"queer\" began to be reclaimed from its pejorative use as a neutral or positive self-identifier by LGBTQ people. An early example of this usage was by an LGBTQ organisation called Queer Nation, which was formed in March 1990 and circulated an anonymous flier at the New York Gay Pride Parade in June 1990 titled \"Queers Read This\". The flier included a passage explaining their adoption of the label queer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ah, do we really have to use that word? It's trouble. Every gay person has his or her own take on it. For some it means strange and eccentric and kind of mysterious [...] And for others \"queer\" conjures up those awful memories of adolescent suffering [...] Well, yes, \"gay\" is great. It has its place. But when a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning we feel angry and disgusted, not gay. So we've chosen to call ourselves queer. [...] It's a way of suggesting we close ranks, and forget (temporarily) our individual differences because we face a more insidious common enemy. Yeah, queer can be a rough word but it is also a sly and ironic weapon we can steal from the homophobe's hands and use against him.\nQueer people, particularly queer Black and Brown people, also began to reclaim \"queer\" in response to a perceived shift in the gay community toward liberal conservatism, catalyzed by Andrew Sullivan's 1989 piece in \"The New Republic\", titled \"Here Comes the Groom: The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage\". By identifying themselves as \"queer\" rather than \"gay,\" LGBTQ activists sought to reject causes they viewed as assimilationist, such as marriage, military inclusion and adoption. This radical stance, including the rejection of U.S. imperialism, continued the tradition of earlier lesbian and gay anti-war activism, and solidarity with a variety of leftist movements, as seen in the positions taken at the first two National Marches on Washington in 1979 and 1987, the radical direct action of groups like ACT UP, and the historical importance of events like the Stonewall riots. The radical queer groups following in this tradition of LGBTQ activism contrasted firmly with \"the holy trinity of marriage, military service and adoption [which had] become the central preoccupation of a gay movement centered more on obtaining straight privilege than challenging power.\" Commentators such as Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore have argued that it was exactly these \"revolting queers\" (who were now being pushed aside) who had made it safe for the assimilationists to now have the option of assimilation.\nThis radical political stance has remained embedded in the reclaimed use of the word \"queer\". Ever since the early 1990s, \"queer\" has been used as both an umbrella term and as a distinct self-identity term by people for whom no other label better describes their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.\nAs an umbrella term, \"queer\" is often used to describe all people who are non-heterosexual and non-cisgender, but it is alternately used to describe all people who defy or deviate from sexual and gender norms and share radical anti-assimilationist politics. For many people, the word \"queer\" is a political identity\u2014one that is characterized by solidarity across sexual, gender, racial, class, and disabled identity lines. The Trans Language Primer notes:While it has gained relatively wide usage in the present, there are still many that maintain that in order to be queer, one must be invested in liberation beyond respectability and assimilation. \u201cWe\u2019re here! We\u2019re queer! Get over it!\u201d and \u201cNot gay as in happy, but queer as in fuck you,\u201d are popular in the queer community precisely because they capture this spirit of radical liberation.As a distinct self-identity term, \"queer\" is defined by a rejection and disruption of binary categories, particularly man/woman and gay/straight, and for many people it is an intentionally politicized identity that exists in opposition to identities such as gay, lesbian, and bisexual. Recent studies have found that 5\u201320% of non-heterosexuals identify as queer. Trans and nonbinary people are more likely to identify as queer than cisgender people, with recent studies finding that 21\u201336% of trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people identify as queer. As a self-identity label, \"queer\" can encompass sexuality and/or gender; in a 2025 international survey of more than 40,000 nonbinary people, more than half reported that they use the word \"queer\" as a self-identity term in relation to gender.\nOther usage.\nThe term may be capitalized when referring to an identity or community, in a construction similar to the capitalized use of Deaf. The 'Q' in extended versions of the LGBTQ acronym, such as \"LGBTQIA+\", is most often considered an abbreviation of queer. It can also stand for questioning.\nReactions.\nReclamation and use of the term \"queer\" is controversial; several people and organizations, both LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ, object to some or all uses of the word for various reasons. Some LGBTQ people dislike the use of \"queer\" as an umbrella term because they associate it with political and social radicalism. Sociologist Joshua Gamson argues that the controversy about the word also marks a social and political divide in the LGBTQ community between those (including civil-rights activists) who perceive themselves as \"normal\" and who wish to be seen as ordinary members of society and those who see themselves as separate, confrontational or not part of the ordinary social order. Other LGBTQ people disapprove of reclaiming or using \"queer\" because they consider it offensive, in part due to its continued use as a pejorative. Some LGBTQ people avoid \"queer\" because they perceive it as faddish slang or as academic jargon.\nScope.\nIntersex and queer identities.\nScholars and activists have proposed different ways in which queer identities apply or do not apply to intersex people. Sociologist Morgan Holmes and bioethicists Morgan Carpenter and Katrina Karkazis have documenting a heteronormativity in medical rationales for the surgical normalization of infants and children born with atypical sex development, and Holmes and Carpenter have described intersex bodies as \"queer bodies\". In \"What Can Queer Theory Do for Intersex?\" Iain Morland contrasts queer \"hedonic activism\" with an experience of insensate post-surgical intersex bodies to claim that \"queerness is characterized by the sensory interrelation of pleasure and shame\".\nEmi Koyama describes a move away from a queer identity model within the intersex movement:\nSuch tactic [of reclaiming labels] was obviously influenced by queer identity politics of the 1980s and 90s that were embodied by such groups as Queer Nation and Lesbian Avengers. But unfortunately, intersex activists quickly discovered that the intersex movement could not succeed under this model. For one thing, there were far fewer intersex people compared to the large and visible presence of LGBTQ people in most urban centers. For another, activists soon realized that most intersex individuals were not interested in building intersex communities or culture; what they sought were professional psychological support to live ordinary lives as ordinary men and women and not the adoption of new, misleading identity. ... To make it worse, the word \"intersex\" began to attract individuals who are not necessarily intersex, but feel that they might be, because they are queer or trans. ... Fortunately, the intersex movement did not rely solely on queer identity model for its strategies. \nQueer heterosexuality.\n\"Queer\" is sometimes expanded to include any non-normative sexuality, including (cisgender) \"queer heterosexuality\". This has been criticized by some LGBTQ people, who argue that \"queer\" can only be reclaimed by those it has been used to oppress: \"A straight person identifying as queer can feel like choosing to appropriate the good bits, the cultural and political cachet, the clothes and the sound of gay culture, without ... the internalized homophobia of lived gay experience.\" Many queer people believe that \"you don't have to identify as queer if you're on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum, but you do have to be on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum to identify as queer.\"\nAcademia.\nIn academia, the term \"queer\" (and the related verb \"queering\") broadly indicate the study of literature, discourse, academic fields, and other social and cultural areas from a non-heterosexual or non-cisgender viewpoint. Though the fields of queer studies and queer theory are broad, such studies often focus on LGBTQ+ lives, and may involve challenging the assumption that being heterosexual and cisgender are the default or \"normal\". Queer theory, in particular, may embrace ambiguities and fluidity in traditionally \"stable\" categories such as \"gay\" or \"straight.\"\nQueer studies is the study of issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity, usually focusing on LGBTQ people and cultures. Originally centered on LGBTQ history and literary theory, the field has expanded to include the academic study of issues raised in biology, sociology, anthropology, history of science, philosophy, psychology, sexology, political science, ethics, and other fields by an examination of the identity, lives, history, and perception of queer people. Organizations such as the Irish Queer Archive attempt to collect and preserve history related to queer studies.\nQueer theory is a field of post-structuralist critical theory that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of queer studies and women's studies. Applications of queer theory include queer theology and queer pedagogy. Philosopher Judith Butler has described queer theory as a site of \"collective contestation\", referring to its commitment to challenging easy categories and definitions. Critics of queer theory argue that this refusal of straightforward categories can make the discipline overly abstract or detached from reality.\nQueer theorists such as Rod Ferguson, Jasbir Puar, Lisa Duggan, and Chong-suk Han have critiqued the mainstream gay political movement as allied with neoliberal and imperialistic agendas, including gay tourism, gay and trans military inclusion, and state- and church-sanctioned marriages for monogamous gay couples. Puar, a queer theorist of color, specifically coined the term \"homonationalism\" to refer to the perceived rise of American exceptionalism, nationalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy within the gay community, catalyzed in response to the September 11 attacks.\nIn their research on the queer movements of Indonesia and Malaysia, scholars J\u00f3n Ingvar Kjaran and Mohammad Naeimi have said that the \"localization of modern queer identity\", rooted in local interpretations of queer theory and \"Muslim modernism\", has helped queer Indonesians and Malaysians to \"promote their self-construction and organize a collective mobilization for their rights\". They contrast this with the rhetoric of those conservative Muslim homophobes who portray \"gay\" or \"LGBTQ\" identities as a form of Western imperialism, as well as the \"Eurocentric discourse\", homonationalism and homonormativity of \"LGBTQ politics\" in the global north.\nCulture and politics.\nSeveral LGBTQ social movements around the world use the identifier \"queer\", such as the Queer Cyprus Association in Cyprus and the Queer Youth Network in the UK. In India, pride parades include Queer Azaadi Mumbai and the Delhi Queer Pride Parade. The use of \"queer\" and \"Q\" is also widespread in Australia, including national counselling and support service Qlife and \"QNews\".\nOther social movements exist as offshoots of queer culture or combinations of queer identity with other views. Adherents of queer nationalism support the notion that the LGBTQ community forms a distinct people due to their unique culture and customs. Queercore (originally \"homocore\") is a cultural and social movement that began in the mid-1980s as an offshoot of punk expressed in a do-it-yourself style through zines, music, writing, art and film.\nThe term queer migration is used to describe the movement of LGBTQ people around the world often to escape discrimination or ill treatment due to their orientation or gender expression. Organizations such as the Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees and Rainbow Railroad attempt to assist individuals in such relocations.\nFlags.\nA pride flag for the queer community was created in 2015, though it is not widely known. Its colors include blue and pink for attraction to the same gender, orange and green for non-binary people, and black and white for agender, asexual, and aromantic people.\nArt.\nThe label \"queer\" is often applied to art movements, particularly cinema. New queer cinema was a movement in queer-themed independent filmmaking in the early 1990s. Modern queer film festivals include the Melbourne Queer Film Festival and Mardi Gras Film Festival (run by Queer Screen) in Australia, the Mumbai Queer Film Festival in India, the Asian Queer Film Festival in Japan, and Queersicht in Switzerland. Chinese film director Cui Zi'en titled his 2008 documentary about homosexuality in China \"Queer China\", which premiered at the 2009 Beijing Queer Film Festival after previous attempts to hold a queer film festival were shut down by the government.\nMultidisciplinary queer arts festivals include the Outburst Queer Arts Festival in Northern Ireland, the Queer Arts Festival in Canada, and the National Queer Arts Festival in the US.\nTelevision shows that use \"queer\" in their titles include the UK series \"Queer as Folk\" and its American-Canadian remake of the same name, \"Queer Eye\", and the cartoon \"Queer Duck\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral bibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many variants of the initialism are used to encompass intersex, asexual, aromantic, agender and other identities.\nIn the 1990s, gay, lesbian, and bisexual activists adopted the initialism \"LGB\". Terminology eventually shifted to \"LGBT\", as transgender people gained recognition. Around that time, some activists began to reclaim the term \"queer\", seeing it as a more radical and inclusive umbrella term, though others reject it, due to its history as a pejorative. In recognition of this, the 2010s saw the adoption of \"LGBTQ\", and other more inclusive variants.\nLGBTQ people collectively form the LGBTQ community, though not all LGBTQ people participate in or consider themselves part of a broader community. These labels are not universally agreed upon by everyone that they are intended to include. For example, some intersex people prefer to be included in this grouping, while others do not. Various alternative umbrella terms exist across various cultures, including \"queer\"; same-gender loving (SGL); and gender, sexual and romantic minorities (GSRM).\nSome versions of the term add a plus sign (+) to represent additional identities not captured by the letters within the initialism. Many further variants exist which add additional identities, such as \"2SLGBTQ\" (for two-spirit), \"LGBTQQ\" (for queer and questioning), or, rarely, the letters ordered differently, as in \"GLBT\" and \"GLBTQ\".\nHistory.\nThe first widely used term, \"homosexual\", now a term used primarily in scientific contexts, has at times carried negative connotations in the United States. \"Gay\" became a popular term in the 1970s.\nAs lesbians forged more public identities, the phrase \"gay and lesbian\" became more common. A dispute as to whether the primary focus of their political aims should be feminism or gay rights led to the dissolution of some lesbian organizations, including Daughters of Bilitis, which was founded by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, but disbanded in 1970 following disputes over which goal should take precedence. As equality was a priority for lesbian feminists, disparity of roles between men and women or butch and femme were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian feminists eschewed gender role play that had been pervasive in bars as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men or take up their causes.\nLesbians who held the essentialist view that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor \"lesbian\" to define sexual attraction often considered the separatist opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights. Bisexual and transgender people also sought recognition as legitimate categories within the larger minority community.\nIn the late 1970s and the early 1980s, after the elation of change following group action in the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. The Gay Liberation Front, which was less assimiliationist, remained more accepting. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes, and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to come out and be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.\nFrom about 1988, activists began to use the initialism \"LGBT\" in the United States. Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people gain equal respect. This spurred some organizations to adopt new names, as the GLBT Historical Society did in 1999. Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term \"LGBT\" has been a positive symbol of inclusion.\nBeginning in the 1990s, the term \"queer\" began to be reclaimed from its earlier pejorative use, particularly by radical activists who sought to reject causes they viewed as assimilationist, such as marriage, military inclusion and adoption. Academic fields of study such as queer studies and queer theory build on this reclamation. The term \"queer\" is now in use as an umbrella term and as a distinct self-identity term analogous to gay, lesbian, and bisexual. The initialism LGBT eventually evolved to LGBTQ in recognition of the unique meaning of \"queer\" within the community.\nIn 2016, GLAAD's Media Reference Guide states that \"LGBTQ\" is the preferred initialism, being more inclusive of younger members of the communities who embrace \"queer\" as a self-descriptor. Some people consider \"queer\" to be a derogatory term originating in hate speech and reject it, especially among older members of the community.\nVariants.\nMany variants of the term \"LGBTQ\" exist, such as the more inclusive &lt;dfn &gt;LGBT+&lt;/dfn&gt;, and variations that change the order of the letters or include additional letters. At least some of the components of sexuality (regarding hetero, bi, straight), and also gender are stated to be on different spectrums of sexuality. Other common variants also exist, such as LGBTQIA, with the \"I\" standing for intersex and the \"A\" standing for asexual, aromantic, or agender, and LGBTQIA+, where \"the '+' represents those who are part of the community, but for whom LGBTQ does not accurately capture or reflect their identity\".\nLonger initialisms have been criticized as confusing or unwieldy, sometimes being referred to as \"alphabet soup\", and mocked with labels such as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;, and . The implication that the initialism refers to a single community is also controversial.\nAlthough identical in meaning, \"LGBT\" may have a more feminist connotation than \"&lt;dfn &gt;GLBT&lt;/dfn&gt;\" as it places the \"L\" (for \"lesbian\") first. \"LGBT\" may also include additional Qs for \"queer\" or \"questioning\" (sometimes abbreviated with a question mark and sometimes used to mean anybody not literally L, G, B or T) producing the variants \"LGBTQ\" and \"&lt;dfn &gt;LGBTQQ&lt;/dfn&gt;\".\nThe order of the letters has not been standardized. In addition to the variations between the positions of the initial \"L\" or \"G\", the mentioned, less common letters, if used, may appear in almost any order. In Hebrew and Peninsular Spanish, \"LGTB\" () is used, that is, reversing the letters \"B\" and \"T\".\nVariant terms do not typically represent political differences within the community, but arise simply from the preferences of individuals and groups.\nThe terms \"pansexual\", \"omnisexual\", \"fluid\" and \"queer-identified\" are regarded as falling under the umbrella term \"bisexual\" (and therefore are considered a part of the bisexual community). Some use \"LGBT+\" to mean \"LGBT and related communities\". Other variants may have a \"U\" for \"unsure\"; a \"C\" for \"curious\"; another \"T\" for \"transvestite\"; a \"TS\", \"2S\", or \"2\" for \"two-spirit\" persons; or an \"SA\" for \"straight allies\".\nThe inclusion of straight allies in the LGBTQ initialism has proven controversial, as many straight allies have been accused of using LGBTQ advocacy to gain popularity and status in recent years, and various LGBTQ activists have criticised the heteronormative worldview of certain straight allies. Some may also add a \"P\" for \"polyamorous\" or \"pangender\", an \"H\" for \"HIV-affected\", or an \"O\" for \"other\". The initialism \"&lt;dfn &gt;LGBTIH&lt;/dfn&gt;\" has seen use in India to encompass the hijra third gender identity and the related subculture.\nAdding the term \"allies\" to the initialism has sparked controversy, with some seeing the inclusion of ally in place of asexual/aromantic/agender as a form of LGBT erasure. There is also the acronym \"&lt;dfn &gt;QUILTBAG&lt;/dfn&gt;\" (queer and questioning, unsure, intersex, lesbian, transgender and two-spirit, bisexual, asexual and aromantic, and gay and genderqueer). Similarly \"&lt;dfn &gt;LGBTIQA+&lt;/dfn&gt;\" stands for \"lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer/questioning, asexual and many other terms (such as non-binary and pansexual)\".\nAs of 2025[ [update]], the Government of Canada's official term is \"2SLGBTQI+\", with the first two characters standing for two-spirit. Trudeau's new initialism was criticized by some social media users. For some indigenous people, \"two-spirit\" invokes a combination of identities, including sexual, gender, cultural, and spiritual. The government previously used \"LGBTQ2\". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was also criticized for using the \"2SLGBTQQIA+\" initialism.\nTransgender inclusion.\nThe term \"trans*\" has been adopted by some groups as a more inclusive alternative to \"transgender\", where \"trans\" (without the asterisk) has been used to describe trans men and trans women, while \"trans*\" covers all non-cisgender (genderqueer) identities, including transgender, transsexual, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, genderfuck, genderless, agender, non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit, bigender, and trans man and trans woman. Likewise, the term \"transsexual\" commonly falls under the umbrella term \"transgender\", but some transsexual people object to this.\nIntersex inclusion.\nThose who add intersex people to LGBTQ groups or organizations may use the extended initialism LGBTQI.\nThe relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer communities is complex, but intersex people are often added to the LGBTQ category to create an LGBTQI community. Some intersex people prefer the initialism \"LGBTQI\", while others would rather that they not be included as part of the term. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in \"LGBTQI\" can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions \"that intersex people's rights are protected\" by laws protecting LGBTQ people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBTQ.\nAsexual, aromantic and agender inclusion.\nIn the early 2010s, asexuality and aromanticism started gaining wider recognition. Around 2015, they were included in the expanded initialism LGBTQIA, with the A standing for \"asexual\", \"aromantic\", commonly grouped together as \"a-spec\" along with \"agender\".\nSome people have mistakenly claimed the A stands for \"ally\", but allies are not a marginalized group and mentions of A for ally have regularly sparked controversy as a form of LGBTQ erasure.\nCriticism.\nThe initialisms \"LGBT\" or \"GLBT\" are not agreed to by everyone that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes are not the same as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that being transgender or transsexual has to do more with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals.\nA belief in \"lesbian and gay separatism\", not to be confused with the related \"lesbian separatism\", holds that lesbians and gay men form, or should form, a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere.&lt;ref name=\"Gays/Justice\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While not always appearing in sufficient numbers or organization to be called a movement, separatists are a significant, vocal, and active element within many parts of the LGBTQ community. In some cases separatists will deny the existence or right to equality of bisexual orientations and of transsexuality, sometimes leading to public biphobia and transphobia. In contrasts to separatists, Peter Tatchell of the LGBTQ human rights group OutRage! argues that to separate the transgender movement from the LGB would be \"political madness\", stating that:\nQueers are, like transgender people, gender deviant. We don't conform to traditional heterosexist assumptions of male and female behaviour, in that we have sexual and emotional relationships with the same sex. We should celebrate our discordance with mainstream straight norms.\nThe portrayal of an all-encompassing \"LGBT community\" or \"LGB community\" is also disliked by some lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Some do not subscribe to or approve of the political and social solidarity, and visibility and human rights campaigning that normally goes with it, including LGBT pride marches and events. Some of them believe that grouping together people with non-heterosexual orientations perpetuates the myth that being gay/lesbian/bi/asexual/pansexual/etc. makes a person deficiently different from other people. These people are often less visible compared to more mainstream gay or LGBTQ activists.\nSince this faction is difficult to distinguish from the heterosexual majority, it is common for people to assume all LGBTQ people support LGBTQ liberation and the visibility of LGBTQ people in society, including the right to live one's life differently from the majority. In the 1996 book \"Anti-Gay\", a collection of essays edited by Mark Simpson, the concept of a 'one-size-fits-all' identity based on LGBT stereotypes is criticized for suppressing the individuality of LGBTQ people.\nWriting in the BBC News Magazine in 2014, Julie Bindel questions whether the various gender groupings now, \"bracketed together[,] ... share the same issues, values and goals?\" Bindel refers to a number of possible new initialisms for differing combinations and concludes that it may be time for the alliances to either be reformed or go their \"separate ways\". In 2015, the slogan \"Drop the T\" was coined to encourage LGBT organizations to stop support of transgender people as they say that sexual orientation, LGB, does not share similarity with gender identity, the T. The campaign has been condemned by many LGBT groups as transphobic.\nAlternatives.\nQueer.\nMany have expressed desire for an umbrella term to replace existing initialisms. \"Queer\" gained popularity as an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities in the 21st century. The term remains controversial, particularly among older LGBTQ people who perceive it as offensive due to its historical usage as a slur, as well as those who wish to dissociate themselves from queer radicalism, and those who see it as amorphous or trendy. Some people feel \"queer\" is a more politically charged, more powerful term than \"LGBT\". Recent studies have found that 5\u201320% of non-heterosexuals and 21\u201336% of trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people identify as queer.\nSexual and gender minorities.\nIn academic and professional contexts, \"sexual and gender minorities\" (\"SGM\") is sometimes used as an alternative to \"LGBTQ\" to include individuals who may not self-identify as LGBTQ (such as men who have sex with men, women who have sex with women, and some intersex people). A UK government paper favors \"SGM\" because initials like \"LGBTQ\" stand for terms that, especially outside the Global North, are \"not necessarily inclusive of local understandings and terms used to describe sexual and gender minorities\".\n\"Gender, sexual and romantic minorities\" (\"GSRM\") includes individuals of a minority romantic orientation such as aromanticism.\nFurther umbrella terms.\nOther rare umbrella terms are Gender and Sexual Diversities (GSD), MOGII (Marginalized Orientations, Gender Identities, and Intersex) and MOGAI (Marginalized Orientations, Gender Alignments and Intersex).\n\"SGL\" (same-gender loving) is sometimes favored among gay male African Americans as a way of distinguishing themselves from what they regard as white-dominated LGBTQ communities.\nClinical.\nIn public health settings, \"MSM\" (\"men who have sex with men\") is clinically used to describe men who have sex with other men without referring to their sexual orientation, with \"WSW\" (\"women who have sex with women\") also used as an analogous term.\nMVPFAFF.\nMVPFAFF is an abbreviation for , Vakasalewa, , Fa'afafine, , Fakaleit\u012b (Leiti), and Fakafifine. This term was developed by Phylesha Brown-Acton in 2010 at the Asia Pacific Games Human Rights Conference. This refers to those in the rainbow Pacific Islander community, who may or may not identify with the LGBTQ initialism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prefix \"cis-\" is Latin and means \"on this side of\". The term \"cisgender\" was coined in 1994 as an antonym to \"transgender\", and entered into dictionaries starting in 2015 as a result of changes in social discourse about gender.\nRelated concepts are cisnormativity (the presumption that cisgender identity is preferred or normal) and cissexism (bias or prejudice favoring cisgender people).\nEtymology.\nThe term \"cisgender\" has its origin in the Latin-derived prefix \"cis-\", meaning 'on this side of', which is the opposite of \"trans-\", meaning 'across from' or 'on the other side of'. This usage can be seen in the \"cis\"\u2013\"trans\" distinction in chemistry, the cis and trans sides of the Golgi apparatus in cellular biology, the ancient Roman term \"Cisalpine Gaul\" (i.e. 'Gaul on this side of the Alps'), and Cisjordan (as distinguished from Transjordan). In \"cisgender\", \"cis-\" describes the alignment of gender identity with assigned sex.\nHistory and usage of the term.\nCoinage.\nGerman.\nMarquis Bey states that \"proto-cisgender discourse\" arose in German in 1914, when Ernst Burchard introduced the cis/trans distinction to sexology by contrasting \"\"cisvestitismus\", or a type of inclination to wear gender-conforming clothing, [...] with \"transvestitismus\", or cross-dressing.\" German sexologist Volkmar Sigusch used the term \"cissexual\" ( in German) in his two-part 1991 article \"\" (\"Transsexuals and our nosomorphic view\"); in 1998, he said he had coined the term there.\nEnglish.\nThe term \"cisgender\" was coined in English in 1994 in a Usenet newsgroup about transgender topics as Dana Defosse, then a graduate student, sought a way to refer to non-transgender people that avoided marginalizing transgender people or implying that transgender people were an other. John Hollister used it that same year. In 1995, Carl Buijs used it, apparently coining it independently.\nAcademic use.\nMedical academics use the term and have recognized its importance in transgender studies since the 1990s. After the terms \"cisgender\" and \"cissexual\" were used in a 2006 article in the \"Journal of Lesbian Studies\" and Serano's 2007 book \"Whipping Girl\", the former gained further popularity among English-speaking activists and scholars. \"Cisgender\" was added to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 2015, defined as \"designating a person whose sense of personal identity corresponds to the sex and gender assigned to him or her at birth (in contrast with transgender)\". \"Perspectives on History\" states that since this inclusion, the term has increasingly become common usage.\nSocial media.\nIn the late 1990s, \"cisgender\" was popularized on USENET by Laura Blake, who used it prolifically when debating with other users and emphasized the term's linguistic grounding in social constructionism. Blake's concept of a \"cisgender ideal\" as foundational to transphobia was influential for other transgender Internet users.\nIn February 2014, Facebook began offering \"custom\" gender options, allowing users to identify with one or more gender-related terms from a selected list, including \"cis\", \"cisgender\", and others.\nDefinitions.\nSociologists Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook define \"cisgender\" as a label for \"individuals who have a match between the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity\". A number of derivatives of the terms \"cisgender\" and \"cissexual\" include \"cis male\" for \"male assigned male at birth\", \"cis female\" for \"female assigned female at birth\", analogously \"cis man\" and \"cis woman\", and \"cissexism\" and \"cissexual assumption\" or \"cisnormativity\" (akin to \"heteronormativity\"). EliR. Green wrote in 2006, \"cisgendered is used [instead of the more popular gender normative] to refer to people who do not identify with a gender diverse experience, without enforcing existence of a normative gender expression\".\nOthers have similarly argued that using terms such as \"man\" or \"woman\" to mean \"cis man\" or \"cis woman\" reinforced cisnormativity, and that instead using the prefix \"cis\" similarly to \"trans\" would counteract the cisnormative connotations within language.\nJulia Serano has defined \"cissexual\" as \"people who are not transsexual and who have only ever experienced their mental and physical sexes as being aligned\", while \"cisgender\" is a slightly narrower term for those who do not identify as transgender (a larger cultural category than the more clinical \"transsexual\"). For Jessica Cadwallader, \"cissexual\" is \"a way of drawing attention to the unmarked norm, against which trans is identified, in which a person feels that their gender identity matches their body/sex\".\nSerano also uses the related term \"cissexism\", \"which is the belief that transsexuals' identified genders are inferior to, or less authentic than, those of cissexuals\". In 2010, the term \"cisgender privilege\" appeared in academic literature, defined as the \"set of unearned advantages that individuals who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth accrue solely due to having a cisgender identity\".\nCritiques.\nWhile intended to be a positive descriptor to distinguish between trans and non-trans identity, the term has been met with criticisms in more recent years.\nFrom feminism and gender studies.\nKrista Scott-Dixon wrote in 2009 that she preferred \"the term \"non-trans\" to other options such as \"cissexual\"/\"cisgendered\"\", saying \"non-trans\" is clearer to average people.\nWomen's and gender studies scholar Mimi Marinucci writes that some consider the 'cisgender\u2013transgender' binary distinction to be as dangerous or self-defeating as the masculine\u2013feminine gender binary because it lumps people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) together (over-simplistically, in her view) with a heteronormative class of people in an opposition with transgender people; she says that characterizing LGB individuals together with heterosexual, non-trans people may problematically suggest that LGB individuals, unlike transgender individuals, \"experience no mismatch between their own gender identity and gender expression and cultural expectations regarding gender identity and expression\".\nGender studies professor Chris Freeman criticizes the term, describing it as \"clunky, unhelpful and maybe even regressive\" and saying it \"\u200dcreates\u00a0\u2013 or re-creates\u00a0\u2013 a gender binary\".\nFrom intersex organizations.\nIntersex people are born with atypical physical sex characteristics that can complicate initial sex assignment and lead to involuntary or coercive medical treatment. The term cisgender \"can get confusing\" in relation to people with intersex conditions, although some intersex people use the term according to the Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth Inter/Act project. Hida Viloria of Intersex Campaign for Equality notes that, as a person born with an intersex body who has a non-binary sense of gender identity that \"matches\" their body, they are both cisgender and gender non-conforming, presumably opposites according to \"cisgender\"'s definition, and that this evidences the term's basis on a binary sex model that does not account for intersex people's existence. Viloria also critiques the fact that the term \"sex assigned at birth\" is used in one of \"cisgender\"'s definitions without noting that babies are assigned male or female regardless of intersex status in most of the world, stating that doing so obfuscates the birth of intersex babies and frames gender identity within a binary male/female sex model that fails to account for both the existence of natally congruent gender non-conforming gender identities, and gender-based discrimination against intersex people based on natal sex characteristics rather than on gender identity or expression, such as \"normalizing\" infant genital surgeries.\nFrom Elon Musk.\nIn June 2023, Elon Musk, owner of social network Twitter (now X), stated that use of the words \"cis\" and \"cisgender\" on the platform as \"targeted harassment\" would constitute violations of its hateful content policy, as he considered them to be slurs. The changes came following an interaction between Musk and a gender-critical commentator, who alleged that pro-trans advocates were using forms of the word (such as \"cissy\", a variant of the pejorative \"sissy\") to insult him following a post in which he rejected the term. Musk has since described cisgender as being \"heterophobic\" and a \"heterosexual slur\". The change came amid the loosening of other rules protecting LGBT users under his ownership, including removing rules prohibiting deadnaming.\nResponses to critiques.\nAfter the Oxford Dictionary added \"cisgender\" as a word in 2015, \"The Advocate\" wrote that \"even among LGBT people, the word is hotly debated\"; transgender veteran Brynn Tannehill argued that it was \"often used in a negative way\" by trans people to express \"a certain level of contempt\" for people they think should not partake in discussions on trans issues. Transgender scholar K.J. Rawson, by contrast, stated that \"cis\" was \"not meant to be dismissive, but rather descriptive\", and was no different than using the word \"straight\" to describe people who are heterosexual. Rawson explained that people who are straight \"don't typically experience their heterosexuality as an identity, many don't identify as heterosexual\u2014they don't need to, because culture has already done that for them\", and that \"similarly, cisgender people don't generally identify as cisgender because societal expectations already presume that they are.\"\nIn a 2023 essay, Defosse said she did not intend the word as an insult. She says she does not believe the word \"cisgender\" caused problems, and that \"it only revealed them.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the second most visited theme park in Scandinavia, with around three million visitors annually. Among the noteworthy attractions is the wooden roller coaster Balder, twice (2003 and 2005) voted as the \"Best Wooden Tracked Roller Coaster\" in the world in a major international poll. The park itself has also been chosen as one of the top ten amusement parks in the world (2005) by \"Forbes\" magazine and second best in Europe (2022) by \"IAAPA\".\nIn addition to the summer season, the park is also open during October to December, albeit with fewer rides operating, hosting a Halloween season with various houses of horrors and a Christmas market, with traditional Swedish cuisine such as mulled wine and specialties such as d\u00f6ner kebab made from reindeer meat.\nThe official colors of Liseberg are pink and green as can be seen on the entrance and the older houses in the park. The colors were also adopted for the logo, which was introduced in the 1980s, but changed in 2013 to the current logo.\nHistory.\nIn 1752, the landowner Johan Anders Lamberg named his property \"Lisas Berg\" (\"Lisa's Mountain\") after his wife Elisabeth S\u00f6derberg. The area eventually became known as Liseberg.\nIn 1908, Gothenburg City bought the property, including the on-site buildings, for 225,000 Swedish kronor.\nIn 1923, Gothenburg celebrated its 300-year anniversary with the Gothenburg Exhibition, which included a Leisure Park and the Congress Park; the area was opened on 8 May and included fun slides and the long wooden Kanneworffska Funicular, designed by the Danish amusement builder Waldemar Lebech (originally there were five trains with three cars each that accommodated 10 people in each car, the ride lasted 2 minutes 30 seconds; it was demolished in 1987 after having served over 41\u00a0million visitors). The fun park was originally intended as a temporary attraction for the exhibition, but it became such a success with over 800,000 visitors in just over a month, that it was kept open. With an area of , the park had cost 2.6\u00a0million kronors to build.\nOn 24 November 1924, the Gothenburg City Council decided to purchase the Liseberg amusement park for 1\u00a0million kronor. In 1925, the amusement park was taken over by the municipal company Liseberg AB. The park's first director and one of its initiators was the legendary \"carpenter from Sk\u00e5ne\" Herman Lindholm, who managed it 1923\u201342.\nOn 13 August 1935, the functional-inspired Liseberg Bath was inaugurated, created by engineer KI Sch\u00f6n Anderson. The pool was wide and long and sported underwater lights and artificial waves. The pool was able to receive 800 people at a time and the entrance fee with a cabin was 50 \u00f6re. The Swedish Olympic hopeful champion from 1920, Arvid Wallman, inaugurated the facilities. The pool was closed in 1956 and the building was demolished in 1962 for the forthcoming 40th anniversary in 1963.\nRotundan was one of the largest dancehalls when it opened on 10 January 1940. Its architect was Axel Jonson, and the construction lasted for one year at a cost of approximately 500,000 SEK. The dance floor held 1,200 people and on the second floor a bar with the name Uggleklubben was opened. In 1956, the facility was renovated and its name changed to the Rondo. The architect Gunnar Aspe was behind the work, which cost 1 million dollars.\nIn 1947, Liseberg AB opened hotel facilities; Hotell Liseberg Heden. Right from the start one of the objectives of Liseberg was that it would be an opportunity for Gothenburg dwellers to experience recreation and the scenery, and in 1959 it opened the Princess Birgitta, a flower exhibition. During the opening ceremony, 15,000 roses were strewn over the park by helicopter. In 1977, Honor Place was founded, a collection of many of the world's largest celebrity hand impressions. At the time, there were 50 imprints; today, there are more than can fit the area, so an annual selection is made as to who should get the honor to appear.\nIn 1991, the Liseberg Guest AB was formed to oversee the running of Gothenburg campsites and harbor. In the 1990s, the park was expanded by and a host of new attractions were inaugurated. In 2015, Liseberg's different companies consolidated into one: Liseberg AB.\nThe park.\nIn addition to the park's more than 30 different rides, Liseberg has many venues (stages, dance hall, restaurants and arcade halls). The park has two entrances / exits (one at \u00d6rgrytev\u00e4gen, the other at Getebergsled). Much of the park is forested.\nIn 1983, the green-pink bunny, Liseberg Rabbit, became the park's symbol and mascot.\nIn 1998, that year's Sveriges Television's Christmas calendar \"N\u00e4r karusellerna sover\" was filmed there.\nThe park is noted for its Liseberg's Lustgarten (botanical garden) that is landscaped and has many waterfalls, artworks and a variety of plants.\nLiseberg Main Stage (Stora Scenen) was built in 1923 and was originally designed as a big music pavilion for the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and other large-scale concerts (over the years the design of the venue has been modified). Bands such as Abba and the Rolling Stones have performed here. Right next to the Stora Scenen is the smaller Kvarnteatern which plays host to various smaller events, in particular children's theater.\nPolka (Polketten) is the dance hall that was built in 1925 but has since been moved to its current location. The Taube Scene was inaugurated in 2008 and is named after Evert Taube; this venue is used for different types of music such as jazz, and the Liseberg Orchestra plays here as well.\nAdjacent to Liseberg Park are more venues: Lisebergshallen is an entertainment and sports arena, home to the local floorball team and team handball team. Rondo is the name of a show venue and Liseberg Theater is a local theater.\nMultifarious Swedish performers have performed at Liseberg since its opening. Among them include, Zarah Leander, Maurice Chevalier, Marlene Dietrich, Evert Taube, ABBA, Lasse Dahlquist, Birgit Nilsson, Pernilla Wahlgren and Carola H\u00e4ggkvist. Sten-\u00c5ke Cederh\u00f6k played in 25 years' own perceptions of the \"Week Revy\". Other artists such as Sonya Hedenbratt, Hagge Geigert and Laila Westersund have appeared countless times at Liseberg. Olof Palme gave a speech on the main stage during his last election in 1985.\nInternational acts who have performed at Liseberg include Bob Marley, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Cliff Richard, Nightwish, Delta Rhythm Boys, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cat Stevens, The Beach Boys, The Kinks, The Who, PJ Proby, Frank Zappa with The Mothers of Invention, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, Procol Harum, and Toto, among others.\nSince 2004 a sing-along show called \"Lotta p\u00e5 Liseberg\" (\"Lotta at Liseberg\"), hosted by Lotta Engberg, is held every summer at \"Stora scenen\" in Liseberg, which airs over TV4 since 2009.\nOceana Waterpark.\nIn November 2020, Liseberg started construction on Scandinavia's largest water park called \"Oceana\". The water park's total area measures and it has 14 various attractions and space for up to 1,750 visitors.\nOn 12 February 2024 a massive fire broke out at the water park, which was still under construction and had been scheduled to open in the spring. The fire left one person dead and injured 22 others, produced three explosions and caused the evacuation of a nearby hotel and office facilities. According to initial reports, Oceana was totally destroyed by the fire and nothing was salvageable. The fire reignited again, the day after it was extinguished. A body was found during clearing operations. The deceased man was later identified as Patrik Gillholm, a manager at the park. A subsequent investigation found that the fire was caused as a result of deficiencies in the fitting of the water diversion pipes, which resulted in the pipes overheating and then catching fire during electrofusion.\nOn 17 July 2024, during a board meeting, a decision was made to rebuild the water park and attempt to have it finished by 2026. Clearing operations of the site were ongoing.\nVisitors.\n\"* Includes all guests at Gothenburg's 300th anniversary celebrations.\"\n\"** Includes guests to Lisebergsteatern, Rondo, Lisebergshallen and events inside the park\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They can range in size from 1/6000 scale wargaming miniatures to large vessels capable of holding people.\nShip modeling is a craft as old as shipbuilding itself, stretching back to ancient times when water transport was first developed.\nHistory.\nAncient Mediterranean.\nAncient ship and boat models have been discovered throughout the Mediterranean, especially from ancient Greece, Egypt, and Phoenicia. These models provide archaeologists with valuable information regarding seafaring technology and the sociological and economic importance of seafaring. In spite of how helpful ancient boat and ship models are to archaeologists, they are not always easily or correctly interpreted due to artists\u2019 mistakes, ambiguity in the model design, and wear and tear over the centuries.\nShips \"were among the most technologically complex mechanisms of the ancient world.\" Ships made far-flung travel and trade more comfortable and economical, and they added a whole new facet to warfare. Thus, ships carried a great deal of significance to the people of the ancient world, and this is expressed partly through the creation of boat and ship models. Ancient boat and ship models are made of a variety of materials and are intended for different purposes. The most common purposes for boat and ship models include burial votives, house hold articles, art, and toys. While archaeologists have found ship and boat models from societies all around the Mediterranean, the three of the most prolific ship model building cultures were the Greeks, Phoenicians, and Egyptians.\nArchaeologists have determined that Ancient Greek ship models were used as burial or votive offerings and as household articles such as lamps or drinking vessels. The kinds of ships depicted in Ancient Greek models can be classified broadly as small craft, merchant vessels, and warships. Models were cast in different materials, including wood, bronze, lead, and clay.\nGreek warships were popular subjects to be made in miniature. One particular model, acquired by the Staatliches Museum (engl.: \"Land museum\") in Kassel, Germany, proves to be helpful to archaeologists and historians in understanding what a hemiolia warship was like. Archaeologists have tentatively dated the Kassel model to be from the 6th or 5th centuries BC through iconographic and literary sources. This ship model is made of clay and features a distinctive prow shaped like a boar's head that is described by Herodotus in \"The History\", and depicted on pottery, coins seals and drinking cups. The model is a miniature of a vessel that would have been too small to be a typical warship. The presence of holes bored into 8 thwarts in the ship suggests that the thwarts may have been seats for a pegged-in dummy crew. If the holes bored into the thwarts are indeed meant to accommodate a dummy crew, the crew seating would have been arranged with two men per bench amidships, and one man per bench fore and aft where the ship narrows so that there is only room for one man. Alec Tilley (former \"Royal Navy\" and \"Navy of Oman\" officer) suggests that a small ship with this type of seating arrangement would have been called a hemiolia, or a one-and-a-halfer. The name indicates that two oarsmen would have been seated on half of the benches and one on the others. Until this ship model was discovered, archaeologists, classicists, and historians had only been able to hypothesize on what the seating arrangement might have been like on a hemiolia based on its name.\nNot all ancient Greek ship models are of warships. One boat model from a house deposit in Mochlos, Crete, dating to around 3000BC, is thought to be too small to be a war ship. Belgian maritime historian \"L.Basch\" postulates that the boat \"cannot have been propelled by more than four oarsmen \u2026 so it can hardly be other than a fishing boat.\" As opposed to other Early Bronze Age ship and boat models, this model was not found in a burial context. This model is thought to be a child's toy or a piece of art, instead of a burial offering. The model itself features a projection of the keel beyond the stem-post at both ends. Despite appearances, these projections are not rams. Because the model is depicting a fishing boat, there would be no need for rams. This model in particular has helped archaeologists understand that not all keel projections in depictions of boats during this time are necessarily rams. Instead, keel projections on depictions of Bronze Age ships are explained as cut-waters or as beaching protection.\nPhoenician ship models also provide archaeologists information regarding the technical aspects of seafaring, and the cultural importance of seafaring for the ancient Phoenicians. However, some models offer tantalizing pieces of information that are, however, difficult to interpret. Item number H-3134 at the Hecht Museum, a dark-brown clay model of a 5th-century BCE oared boat, is one such craft. The vessel has no provenance, save for the reported location of its discovery off the Phoenician coast, but scientists have been able to tentatively confirm the origin and authenticity of this model. The model is of an oared boat manned by three pairs of oarsmen, who are rendered with \"hands \u2026 raised to their chests, in the last instant of pulling the oar in the water, before lifting it for the recovery.\" The mystery of this model is the purpose of small holes- three on the starboard side, and four on port- that were made in the sides of the ship with a sharp tool before the clay dried. It is believed that the holes are too small to pass an oar through, and thus would not be used for rowing purposes. This is hard to prove, however, because the poorly preserved state of the model and the amount of fouling that is layered on the model makes it difficult to definitively rule out this possibility. Another theory regarding the purpose of these holes suggests that \"ropes for holding oars were threaded through these holes.\"\nShip models are helpful to archaeologists in that they allow archaeologists to make estimates regarding the size the vessel would be in real life. While this technique makes the assumption that artists scaled the models appropriately, it is useful to get some sense of how large these ships and boats may have been in real life. Archaeologists estimate the Phoenician vessel above (H-3134) to be about 6 meters long and the beam about 2 meters. Archaeologists are able to calculate these estimates of size by employing a series of assumptions about the distance between benches, the lateral distance between rowers, and a maximum draft of the vessel.\nEgyptian ship and boat models are perhaps some of the most well-preserved types of ship models available to archaeologists. Ancient Egyptian ship and boat models were most frequently placed in tombs of prominent people as \"magical substitutes for the actual objects which the deceased has used in life and which he expected to use again in the next world.\" These boats have been categorised into two types: boat models that represent actual vessels used on the Nile, and boat models that represent boats that are considered necessary for religious purposes. The second type of model may or may not have been used in real life, but were purely magical boats. The majority of boats found in tombs are carved from wood.\nSeveral boat and ship models were found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, dating back to the Sixth Dynasty, and in the tomb of Meketre (2061\u20132010 BC). The wide variety of vessels depicted by the models in these two tombs has provided archaeologists new information on the types of boats that were used in Egypt. Moreover, the presence of boat and ship models in the tombs attests to the paramount importance of boats and ships to the Nile-going people of Egypt.\nThe boat models discovered at Meketre's tomb feature several different kinds of boats, including traveling boats, sporting boats, and several papyriform crafts. Two of the papyriform skiffs have a trawling net slung between them. It is uncertain whether or not the net is meant to be depicted as being under the water or being pulled out of the water by the fishermen. In the event that the artist meant for the net to be in the water, it is upside down. Needless to say, the upside down net would not work for catching fish. This ambiguity points up the question of artistic veracity of the craftsmen who make ship models. As is attested by the ambiguity of the holes in the sides of the Phoenician model, and the skiff from Meketre, archaeologists need to be aware of the possibility of artistic error while interpreting ancient ship models. While a mistake involving an inverted trawling net may seem trivial, the lesson is important. It is important for archaeologists to be aware of the possibility that ancient artists may not have been familiar with the finer details of ships and boats.\nDespite some of the limitations of interpreting ancient Mediterranean ship models, archaeologists have been able to glean a great deal of information from these items. This information has been instrumental in filling in gaps in knowledge about ancient seafaring technology and culture.\nEurope.\nSome of the oldest surviving European ship models have been those of early craft such as galleys, galleons, and possibly carracks, dating from the 12th through the 15th centuries and found occasionally mounted in churches, where they were used in ceremonies to bless ships and those who sailed in them, or as votive offerings for successful voyages or surviving peril at sea, a practice which remained common in Catholic countries until the 19th century.\nUntil the early 18th century, virtually all European small craft and many larger vessels were built without formal plans being drawn. Shipwrights would construct models to show prospective customers how the full size ship would appear and to illustrate advanced building techniques. These were also useful for marine artists, and it is clear that from Dutch Golden Age Painting onwards extensive use of models was made by artists.\nShip models constructed for the Royal Navy were referred to as \"Admiralty models\" and were principally constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries to depict proposed warship design. Although many of these models did not illustrate the actual timbering or framing, they did show the form of the hull and usually had great detail of the deck furnishings, masts, spars, and general configuration. Some of these grand models were decorated with carvings of great beauty and were evidently constructed by teams of artisans.\nAdmiralty models served to educate civilians who were involved in the financing or some other aspect of the ship, to avoid construction errors that might have evolved as the ship itself took form.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars French and English seamen who were taken prisoner were confined, sometimes for many years, and in their boredom sought relief by building ship models from scraps of wood and bone. This evolved into something of an art form and the models were sold to the public,\nwhich responded by supplying the prisoners with ivory so that the models would be more decorative. For the most part, the models had carved wooden hulls with rigging made from human hair, horsehair, silk, or whatever other fine material could be obtained. Bone or ivory would be used for masts and spars, and as a thin veneer over the hull.\nA consequence of Britain's naval supremacy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was wide public interest in ships and ship models. Numerous fairly crude models were built as children's toys leading to the creation of functional, as opposed to decorative, ship models. Britain also led the world in model ship sailing clubs \u2013 in 1838 the \"Serpentine Sailing Society\" was started in Hyde Park, followed by the first \"London Model Yacht Club\" in 1845. By the 1880s there were three model sailing clubs sharing the Kensington Gardens Round Pond alone.\nModern era.\nIn the early part of the 20th century, amateur ship model kits became available from companies such as Bassett-Lowke in Great Britain and Boucher's in the United States. Early 20th century models comprised a combination of wooden hulls and cast lead for anchors, deadeyes, and rigging blocks. These materials gradually gave way to plastic precast sets.\nThe development of tinplate and improvements in machine tools enabled significant advances in ship modelling from 1900 onwards. Thin, workable sheets of iron could be coated with tin to prevent rusting, then mass-produced as parts of ship model kits. The process was pioneered by French ship model manufacturer Radiguet, which produced a line of zinc boats with pressurised steam engines, wooden decking and brass fittings. The speed of production for tinplate vessels enabled one 1909 manufacturer to produce ship models of speedboats that had competed that year in Monaco.\nShip modelling in the United States experienced a boom in the late 1920s when \"Popular Science\" magazine published an extended series of articles and plans for famous ships by modeller and former Navy officer E. Armitage McCann. McCann, who, according to \"Popular Science\" was the \"recognized leader of the ship model building hobby\" of his time founded the \"Ship Model Makers\u2032 Club\" in 1929, with him as secretary and treasurer and marine artist and fellow ship model builder \"Gordon Grant\" as president.\nThe world's leading magazine for this hobby, Model Boat, is published from the UK by MyTime Media and has been in print continuously since 1950. In recent years, widespread internet access has played a major role in promoting ship modelling, offering enthusiasts the opportunity to show off their work and share techniques. Internet sites such as http://, http://, or http:// are oriented to plastic model ship builders, while others such as https:// focus largely on aircraft or other subjects can regularly feature plastic ship models as well.\nTypes of construction.\nThe most common materials used for ship models are:\nWooden.\nWooden ship model hulls can be constructed in several ways. The simplest is a solid wood hull sawn and carved from a single block of wood. This method requires the greatest skill to achieve accurate results.\nA variant of this technique, sometimes known as bread and butter construction (the wood is the \"bread\" and glue the \"butter\") is a hull built up from thin blocks of wood glued together with either a vertical seam which can be incorporated into deck design, or a horizontal seam. This reduces the amount of carving required, but still requires skill and the use of templates to achieve an accurate hull form.\nModelling precision and lightweight design can be achieved by creating a hollow hull. The \"plank on bulkhead\" technique inserts a series of shaped bulkheads along the keel to form a shaped stage which will be covered with planks to form the hull of the model. \"Plank on frame\" designs build the model just as the full size wooden ship is constructed. The keel is laid down in a manner which keeps it straight and true. The sternpost and stem are erected, deadwood and strengthening pieces inserted, and a series of shaped frames are built and erected along the keel to form the internal framework of the model. The planks are then applied over the frame to form the external covering.\nA wooden hull can be used for operating models if properly sealed.\nPlastic.\nIn the decades since World War Two injection-molded polystyrene plastic model ships have become increasingly popular. Consisting of preformed plastic parts which can be bonded together with plastic cement, these models are much simpler to construct than the more labor-intensive traditional wooden models. The inexpensive plastic kits were initially targeted to the postwar generation who could glue them together and produce passable replicas in a single afternoon. Plastic models are available in both full hull and waterline versions for a wide variety of vessels.\nA more recent addition has been a variety of kits in cold cure resin marketed by various small companies as part of a cottage industry. These often cover more obscure subjects than mainstream manufacturers.\nScales vary as well, with many kits from the early days being \"box scale\"; that is, scaled to fit into a uniform sized box designed to fit conveniently on hobby shop shelves. Scales have since become more standardized to enable modelers to construct consistent scale collections, but there are still many to choose from. In Europe 1/400 scale remains popular, while in the United States and Japan the most popular scales are (making a World War Two aircraft carrier about a foot long) and (twice as long as ). Nevertheless, mainstream plastic kit manufacturers continue to produce kits as small as 1/1200 and as large as 1/72, with a few even larger.\nThe early plastic model kit producers such as Airfix, Revell, Frog and Pyro have since been joined by Imai, Tamiya, Hasegawa, Skywave/Pit-Road, Trumpeter, Dragon Models Limited and many others in producing a wide array of model subjects. The plastic model kit market has shifted over the years to a focus on adult hobbyists willing to pay for more elaborate, higher quality kits.\nAnother recent development has been the advent of aftermarket parts to enhance the basic kits. Decals, specialized paints and turned metal replacement gun barrels are available to make plastic models more accurate. The introduction of flat photoetched metal sets, usually stainless steel or brass, also provide much more realistic lifelines, cranes, and other details than are possible with the injection molded plastic kits. These photoetch sets have transformed the hobby, enabling the finescale modeler to reproduce very delicate details with much less effort.\nLive steam.\nEnthusiasts build live steam model ships of many types and in many scales. These range from simple pop pop boats to models of racing hydroplanes.\nScale conversion factors.\nInstead of using plans made specifically for models, many model shipwrights use the actual blueprints for the original vessel.\nOne can take drawings for the original ship to a blueprint service and have them blown up, or reduced to bring them to the new scale.\nFor instance, if the drawings are in 1/4\" scale and you intend to build in 3/16\", tell the service to reduce them 25%.\nYou can use the conversion table below to determine the percentage of change. You can easily work directly from the original drawings however, by changing scale each time you make a measurement.\nThe equation for converting a measurement in one scale to that of another scale is D2 = D1 x F where:\nExample: A yardarm is 6\" long in 3/16\" scale. Find its length in 1/8\" scale.\nIt is easier to make measurements in the metric system and then multiply them by the scale conversion factor.\nScales are expressed in fractional inches, but fractions themselves are harder to work with than metric measurements.\nFor example, a hatch measures 1\" wide on the draft.\nYou are building in 3/16\" scale.\nMeasuring the hatch in metric, you measure 25\u00a0mm. T\nhe conversion factor for 1/4\" to 3/16', according to the conversion table is .75. So 25\u00a0mm x .75 = 18.75\u00a0mm, or about 19\u00a0mm.\nThat is the hatch size in 3/16\" scale.\nConversion is a fairly simple task once you start measuring in metric and converting according to the scale.\nThere is a simple conversion factor that allows you to determine the approximate size of a model by taking the actual measurements of the full-size ship and arriving at a scale factor.\nIt is a rough way of deciding whether you want to build a model that is about two feet long, three feet long, or four feet long.\nHere is a ship model conversion example using a real ship, the Hancock.\nThis is a frigate appearing in Chappelle's \"History of American Sailing Ships\".\nIn this example we want to estimate its size as a model.\nWe find that the length is given at 136' 7\", which rounds off to 137 feet.\nTo convert feet (of the actual ship) to the number of inches long that the model will be, use the factors in the table on the right.\nTo find the principal dimensions (length, height, and width) of a (square rigged) model in 1/8\" scale, then:\nAlthough this technique allows you to judge the approximate length of a proposed model from its true footage, only square riggers will fit the approximate height and beam by the above factors. To approximate these dimensions on other craft, scale the drawings from which you found the length and arrive at her mast heights and beam.\nWargaming.\nModel ships have been used for war gaming since antiquity, but the introduction of elaborate rules made the practice more popular in the early 20th century. Small miniature ships, often in 1:1200 scale and 1:1250 scale were maneuvered on large playing surfaces to either recreate a historical battle, or in the case of governments, plan for future encounters. These models were basic representations of ship types, with enough detail to make them recognizable. Bassett-Lowke marketed these to the public in England, along with more detailed versions that appealed to collectors.\nPrior to World War II, the German company Wiking became a leader in the field but the war ended its dominance.\nUpon the United States' entry into World War II, Charles King Van Riper was commissioned to build identification models at a scale of to . He produced 1:1200 models of freighters for the United States Navy's Submarine Attack Teacher at Groton, Connecticut.\nLarge scale.\nLarger ship models have been used in museums to document historical ships, in companies for decoration and public relations. These are typically built by commercial firms, or, in the past, model departments of large shipyards. One famous builder of ship models for the United States Navy was the firm of Gibbs &amp; Cox; a 1/48 scale model of the , which is on display at the Washington Navy Yard museum, required an estimated 77,000 man hours to construct. Commercial ship models are usually built to rigorous standards; for example the US Navy has an exacting set of specifications regarding the use of materials and methods with the aim of ensuring a model \"lifespan\" of one hundred years.\nRadio control.\nSome hobbyists build and operate scale model ships utilizing radio control equipment. These can range from small models that can be operated in aquariums to vessels capable of navigating large bodies of water. Further expanding the concept is model warship combat, in which scale models fire projectiles at each other in combat.\nEngineering models.\nModel ships are important in the field of engineering, where analytical modeling of a new design needs to be verified. Principals of similitude are used to apply measured data from a scaled model to the full scale design. Models are often tested in special facilities known as model basins.\nManned.\nManned models are model ships that can carry and be handled by at least one person on an open expanse of water. They must behave just like real ships, giving the shiphandler the same sensations. Physical conditions such as wind, currents, waves, water depths, channels and berths must be reproduced realistically.\nManned models are used for research (e.g. ship behaviour), engineering (e.g. port layout) and for training in shiphandling (e.g. maritime pilots, masters and officers). They are usually at 1:25 scale.\nThe aim of training on manned models is to enable seamen to acquire or to develop manoeuvring skills through a better understanding of a ship's behaviour as it sails in restricted water conditions at manoeuvring speed.\nManned models are considered by maritime pilots as the next best thing to a full-scale prototype for understanding a ship's behaviour. Those who have trained on both claim that scale models are complementary to computer simulators. While manoeuvres with currents, waves, tugs, anchors, bank effects, etc. are reproduced more accurately on scale models, numerical simulators are more realistic when it comes to the bridge environment.\nThe Port Revel Shiphandling Training Centre is a French maritime pilotage school specializing in training for pilots, masters, and officers on large ships like supertankers, container ships, LNG carriers and cruise ships. The facility uses manned models at a 1:25 scale on a man-made lake designed to simulate natural conditions in harbours, canals, and open seas. It was the first such facility in the world. The centre was originally created in 1967 near Grenoble by Laboratoire Dauphinois d'Hydraulique.\nYachts.\nModel yachts are operating craft, which may be sail, steam, engine or electric motor powered, typically resembling pleasure power craft, although the hobby also includes the construction and operation of models of working ships such as tugboats and other craft shown in this article as static models.\nModel shipwright guilds.\nModel shipwright guilds tend to concentrate their efforts on highly accurate static models of all types of watercraft and are social groupings intended to allow more experienced ship modellers the opportunity to pass on their knowledge to new members; to allow members of all levels of expertise to exchange new ideas, as well as serving as social function.\nSome model shipwright guilds are incorporated into government and Naval facilities, achieving a semi-official status as a clearinghouse for information on naval history, ship design and, at times, teaching the craft of ship modeling, through model building, restoration, repair of the facility's models, as well as, museum docent services. The USS Constitution Museum operates a model shipwright guild from the Charlestown Navy Yard adjacent to the berth for the vessel itself, as does the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park by sponsoring the https:// and providing work and meeting to them aboard space aboard the ferryboat Eureka tied at the Hyde Street Pier where they are considered working museum volunteers.\nCollections.\nThe largest collection of ship models is thought to be the collection at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, which numbers nearly 5,000, most of which are held in the Model Store at the No. 1 Smithery at the Historic Dockyard Chatham, Kent.\nIn private hands two of the largest collections belong to the hobbyists who made them. Philip Warren of England has a collection of 432 ship models built on the scale of 1:300, all of which he constructed himself. Erick Navas of Peru has a collection of 1005 warships, some of which he built from scratch.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Flyers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Xfinity Mobile Arena in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, an indoor arena they share with the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). Part of the 1967 NHL expansion, the Flyers are the first of the expansion teams in the post-Original Six era to win the Stanley Cup, victorious in 1973\u201374 and again in 1974\u201375.\nThe Flyers' all-time points percentage of 56.8% (as of the 2023\u201324 NHL season[ [update]]) is the fourth-best in the NHL, behind only the Vegas Golden Knights, Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins. Additionally, the Flyers have the most appearances in the conference finals of all 26 expansion teams (16 appearances, winning 8), and they are second behind the St. Louis Blues for the most playoff appearances out of all expansion teams (40 out of 56 seasons).\nThe Flyers have played their home games on Broad Street since their inception, first at the Spectrum from 1967 until 1996, and then at Xfinity Mobile Arena since 1996. The Flyers have had rivalries with several teams over the years. Historically, their biggest adversaries have been the New York Rangers, with an intense rivalry stretching back to the 1970s. They have also waged lengthy campaigns against the New York Islanders in the 1970s and 1980s, the Boston Bruins in the 1970s and 2010s, the Washington Capitals, since their days in the Patrick Division, as well as the New Jersey Devils, with whom they traded the Atlantic Division title every season between 1994\u201395 and 2006\u201307, and with their cross-state rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins, which is considered by many to be the best rivalry in the league.\nHistory.\nNHL in Philadelphia before 1967.\nPrior to 1967, Philadelphia had only iced a team in the NHL in the 1930\u201331 season, when the financially struggling Pittsburgh Pirates relocated in 1930 as the Philadelphia Quakers, playing at The Arena at 46th and Market Streets. The club, garbed in orange and black like today's Flyers, was coached by J. Cooper Smeaton, who was to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame 30 years later, for his far more notable role as an NHL referee. Among the young Quakers' skaters in 1930\u201331 was another future Hall of Famer in 19-year-old rookie center Syd Howe. The Quakers' only \"claim to fame\" was to establish a single season NHL record for futility which has stood ever since, by compiling a dismal record of 4\u201336\u20134, still the fewest games ever won in a season by an NHL club. The Quakers quietly suspended operations after that single dreadful campaign to again leave the Can-Am League's Philadelphia Arrows as Philadelphia's lone hockey team. The Quakers' dormant NHL franchise was finally canceled by the league in 1936.\nIn 1946, a group led by Montreal and Philadelphia sportsman Len Peto announced plans to put another NHL team in Philadelphia, to build a $2.5 million rink to seat 20,000 where the Phillies' former ballpark stood at Broad and Huntingdon Streets, and to acquire the franchise of the old Montreal Maroons. The latter was held by the Canadian Arena Company, owner of the Montreal Canadiens. However, Peto's group was unable to raise funding for the new arena project by the league-imposed deadline, and the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise.\nWhile attending a basketball game on November 29, 1964, at the Boston Garden, Ed Snider, the then-vice-president of the Philadelphia Eagles, observed a crowd of Boston Bruins fans lining up to purchase tickets to see a last-place ice hockey team. He began making plans for a new arena upon hearing the NHL was looking to expand due to fears of a competing league taking hold on the West Coast and the desire for a new television contract in the United States. Snider made his proposal to the league, which chose the Philadelphia group \u2013 including Snider, Bill Putnam, Jerome Schiff and Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman \u2013 over the Baltimore group.\nOn April 4, 1966, Putnam announced that there was going to be a name-the-team contest. Details of the contest were released on July 12. Snider's sister, Phyllis, thought that a name that fits well with Philadelphia was \"Flyers.\" Instead of going through with the naming contest, Ed Snider took his sister's advice. The team name was announced on August 3.\nEarly years (1967\u20131971).\nThe new teams were hampered by restrictive rules that kept all major talent with the \"Original Six\" teams. In the 1967 NHL expansion draft, most of the players available were either aging veterans or career minor-leaguers before expansion occurred. Among the Flyers' 20 selections were Bernie Parent, Doug Favell, Bill Sutherland, Ed Van Impe, Joe Watson, Lou Angotti, Leon Rochefort and Gary Dornhoefer. Having purchased the minor-league Quebec Aces, the team had a distinctly francophone flavor in its early years, with Parent, Rochefort, Andre Lacroix, Serge Bernier, Jean-Guy Gendron, Simon Nolet and Rosaire Paiement among others. Beginning play in 1967\u201368, the Philadelphia Flyers made their debut on October 11, 1967, losing 5\u20131 on the road to the California Seals. They won their first game a week later, defeating the St. Louis Blues on the road, 2\u20131. The Flyers made their home debut in front of a crowd of 7,812, shutting-out their intrastate rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins, 1\u20130 on October 19. Lou Angotti was named the first captain in Flyers history, while Rochefort was the Flyers' top goal scorer after netting a total of 21 goals. With all six expansion teams grouped into the same division, the Flyers were able to win the division with a sub-.500 record despite being forced to play their last seven home games on the road due to a storm blowing parts of the Spectrum's roof off. However, playoff success did not come so quickly, as the Flyers were upset by St. Louis in a first-round, seven-game series.\nAngotti left the team in the off-season, being replaced by Van Impe as team captain. Led by Van Impe and the team-leading 24 goals of Andre Lacroix, the Flyers struggled during their sophomore season by finishing 15 games under .500. Despite their poor regular season showing in 1968\u201369, they made the playoffs. They again lost to St. Louis, this time being dispatched in a four-game sweep. Not wanting his team to be physically outmatched again, majority owner Ed Snider instructed general manager Bud Poile to acquire bigger, tougher players. While head coach Keith Allen soon after replaced Poile as general manager, this mandate eventually led to one of the most feared teams to ever take the ice in the NHL. The keystone of those teams was acquired when the Flyers took a chance on a 19-year-old diabetic from Flin Flon, Manitoba, Bobby Clarke, with their second draft pick, 17th overall, in the 1969 NHL amateur draft. Keeping to Snider's mandate, the team also drafted future enforcer Dave Schultz 52nd overall.\nBy the time training camp came around, it was clear that Clarke was the team's best player, and he quickly became a fan favorite. His 15 goals and 31 assists in his rookie season earned him a trip to the NHL All-Star Game. Despite his arrival, the team struggled in 1969\u201370, recording only 17 wins \u2013 the fewest in franchise history and set the NHL team record for most ties in a season (24). They lost the tiebreaker for the final playoff spot to the Oakland Seals, missing the playoffs for the first time.\nOn December 11, 1969, the Flyers introduced what became one of the team's best-known traditions: playing a recording of Kate Smith singing \"God Bless America\" instead of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before important games. The perception was that the team was more successful on these occasions, so the tradition grew. The move was initially done by Flyers Promotion Director Lou Scheinfeld as a way to defray national tensions at the time of the Vietnam War: Scheinfeld noticed that people regularly left their seats and walked around during the anthem, but showed more respect and often sang along to \"God Bless America\". As of the close of the 2016\u201317 season, the Flyers have a record of 100\u201329\u20135 when \"God Bless America\" was sung prior to Flyers home games.\nIn 1970\u201371, the Flyers had bounced back from the previous season and returned to the playoffs, but were swept by the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round. Even though the team had improved their record in his second season behind the bench, head coach Vic Stasiuk was replaced by Fred Shero in the off-season. The team was involved in a three-way trade that sent Bernie Parent to the Toronto Maple Leafs while receiving Rick MacLeish from the Boston Bruins.\nBroad Street Bullies (1971\u20131981).\nThe team began to shift to a more aggressive style of play while also dominating on offense during this time. Bobby Clarke continued to progress as he led the team in scoring in 1971\u201372 and became the first Flyer to win an NHL award, the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. However, in the season's final game, the Flyers needed a win or a tie against the second-year Buffalo Sabres to beat out Pittsburgh for the final playoff spot. The score was tied late in the game, but with just four seconds on the clock, former Flyer Gerry Meehan took a shot from just inside the blue line that eluded Flyers goaltender Doug Favell. The Flyers lost the head-to-head tiebreaker to Pittsburgh and missed the playoffs.\nAs it turned out, it was the last time the Flyers missed the playoffs for 18 years. In the 1972\u201373 season the Flyers got rid of the mediocre expansion team label and instead became the intimidating \"Broad Street Bullies\", a nickname coined by Jack Chevalier and Pete Cafone of the \"Philadelphia Bulletin\" on January 3, 1973, after a 3\u20131 brawling victory over the Atlanta Flames that led Chevalier to write in his game account, \"The image of the fightin' Flyers spreading gradually around the NHL, and people are dreaming up wild nicknames. They're the Mean Machine, the Bullies of Broad Street and Freddy's Philistines.\" Cafone wrote the accompanying headline: \"Broad Street Bullies Muscle Atlanta.\" That same month, Clarke was the youngest player (at that time) in NHL history to be named team captain, replacing Ed Van Impe. Rick MacLeish became the first Flyer to score 50 goals in a season and the Flyers recorded their first winning season.\nAn overtime goal by Gary Dornhoefer in game five turned the tide of their first-round series with the Minnesota North Stars in the Flyers' favor, as the Flyers got their first playoff series win in six games. However, they were outmatched in the semifinals by the Montreal Canadiens, losing in five games. After the season, Clarke became the first expansion team player to be awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player.\n1973\u201374 Stanley Cup champions.\nGoaltender Bernie Parent returned to the franchise in the off-season, and the Flyers proved that the expansion teams could challenge the Original Six in 1973\u201374. The Bullies continued their rough-and-tumble ways, led by Dave Schultz's 348 penalty minutes, and reached the top of the West Division with a record of 50\u201316\u201312. The return of Parent proved to be of great benefit, as he established himself as one of if not the best goaltender in the league after winning 47 games, a record which stood for 33 years. Since the Flyers, along with Chicago, allowed the fewest goals in the league, Parent also shared the Vezina Trophy with Chicago's Tony Esposito.\nCome playoff time, the Flyers swept the Atlanta Flames in four games in the first round. In the semifinals, the Flyers faced the New York Rangers. The series, which saw the home team win every game, went seven games. Fortunately for the Flyers, they had home-ice advantage as they advanced to the Stanley Cup Final by winning game seven and in the process made history by becoming the first expansion team to win a playoff series over an Original Six team.\nTheir opponent, Bobby Orr and the Boston Bruins, took game one in Boston, but Bobby Clarke scored an overtime goal in game two to even the series. The Flyers then won games 3 and 4 at home to take a 3\u20131 series lead, though Boston won game five to stave off elimination. That set the stage for game six at the Spectrum. Kate Smith appeared in person before game six to sing her rendition of \"God Bless America\", even miming a \"knockout punch\" after her performance. The Flyers picked up the lead early when Rick MacLeish scored a first-period goal. Late in the game, Orr hauled down Clarke on a breakaway, a penalty which assured the Flyers of victory. Time expired as the Flyers brought the Stanley Cup to Philadelphia for the first time. Parent, with his shutout against Boston in game six, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.\n1974\u201375 Stanley Cup champions.\nUnder the 1974\u201375 season, Dave Schultz topped his mark from the previous season by setting an NHL record for penalty minutes with 472. Clarke's efforts earned him his second Hart Trophy and Parent was the lone recipient of the Vezina Trophy. The Flyers as a team improved their record slightly with a mark of 51\u201318\u201311, the best record in the NHL. After a first-round bye, the Flyers easily swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and were presented with another New York-area team in the semifinals, the New York Islanders. The Flyers looked to be headed toward another sweep after winning the first three games. However, the Islanders fought back by winning the next three games, setting up a deciding seventh game. The Flyers were finally able to shut the door on the Islanders, winning game seven, 4\u20131.\nFacing Buffalo in the Stanley Cup Final, the Flyers won the first two games at home. Game three, played in Buffalo, went down in hockey lore as \"The Fog Game\" due to an unusual May heatwave in Buffalo that forced parts of the game to be played in heavy fog, as Buffalo's arena lacked air conditioning. The Flyers lost games 3 and 4, but won game five at home in dominating fashion, 5\u20131. On the road for game six, Bob Kelly scored the decisive goal and Parent pitched another shutout (a playoff record fifth shutout) as the Flyers repeated as Stanley Cup champions. Parent also repeated as the playoffs MVP, winning a second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe highlight of the 1975\u201376 season had no bearing on the season standings. On January 11 at the Spectrum, the Flyers, as part of the Super Series '76, played a memorable exhibition game against the Soviet Union's dominant Central Red Army team. As the Bullies had put intimidation to good use the past three years, the Flyers' rugged style of play led the Soviets to leave the ice midway through the first period, protesting a hit on Valeri Kharlamov, whom Clarke had slashed on the ankle in the famous Summit Series '72, by Ed Van Impe. After some delay, the Soviets returned after they were warned that they would lose their salary for the entire series. The Flyers went on to win the game rather easily, 4\u20131, and were the only team to defeat the Red Army outright in the series. After that win, the Spectrum became known as the \"most intimidating building to play in and has the most intimidating fans.\" Head coach Fred Shero proclaimed, \"Yes we are world champions. If they had won, they would have been world champions. We beat the hell out of a machine.\"\nThe Flyers recorded the best record in team history (points-wise) with a record of 51\u201313\u201316 and set the record for most consecutive home wins in regulation (20). The LCB line, featuring Reggie Leach at right-wing, Bobby Clarke at center and Bill Barber at left-wing, set an NHL record for goals by a single line with 141 (Leach 61, Clarke 30, Barber 50). Clarke, on his way to a third Hart Trophy, set a club record for points in one season with 119. Heading into the playoffs, the Flyers squeaked past Toronto in seven games and defeated Boston in five games, with game five featuring a five-goal outburst by Leach, the \"Riverton Rifle\", to head to a third-straight appearance in the Stanley Cup Final. However, the Flyers did not come close to a third straight championship without an injured Bernie Parent, as they ran into an up-and-coming dynasty in Montreal, and were swept in four-straight games. Despite the loss, Leach was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for scoring a record 19 goals in 16 playoff games.\nDethroned, the heyday of the Broad Street Bullies began to come to an end, as prior to the 1976\u201377 season, tough-guy Dave Schultz was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. Despite a slight drop-off in performance, the Flyers dominated the Patrick Division with what proved to be their fourth-straight division title. After disposing of Toronto in six games, the Flyers found themselves in the semifinals for the fifth consecutive season. Pitted against Boston, the Flyers lost games 1 and 2 at home in overtime and did not return home as they were swept in four straight games. The Flyers lost their hold on the Patrick Division in 1977\u201378 and settled for second place. After sweeping the Colorado Rockies in two games in the preliminary round, the Flyers moved on to beat Buffalo in five games. They then faced Boston in the semifinals for the second consecutive season, and lost again, this time in five games. Following the season, the Flyers were stunned when head coach Shero left to become general manager and head coach of the New York Rangers. As compensation for Shero, the Flyers received the Rangers' first-round draft pick in 1978.\nBob McCammon, who had just coached the Flyers' first year American Hockey League (AHL) Maine Mariners farm club to a Calder Cup title, replaced Fred Shero behind the bench. After a slow start in 1978\u201379, the Flyers switched McCammon with Pat Quinn, Shero's previous assistant coach, who had replaced McCammon with the Mariners. Adding to the problems, Bernie Parent suffered a career-ending eye injury. The Flyers rallied under Quinn and finished in second place. Matched up against the Vancouver Canucks in the preliminary round, the Flyers won the series in three games. The Flyers' season came to an end against Fred Shero's Rangers in a five-game quarterfinals loss.\nThe Flyers began the 1979\u201380 season with a somewhat controversial move by naming Clarke a playing assistant coach and giving the captaincy to Mel Bridgman. While Clarke was against this initially, he accepted his new role. The Flyers went undefeated for a North American professional sports record 35-straight games (25\u20130\u201310), before losing 7\u20131 to the Minnesota North Stars, a record that still stands to this day. The streak started after the team was 1\u20131 on October 14, and ended on January 7, 1980. In doing so, the Flyers wrapped up the Patrick Division title with 14 games to spare and the first overall seed in the playoffs. Their regular season success continued into the playoffs, as the Flyers swept a young Wayne Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers in the first round, then went on to get revenge against Fred \"The Fog\" Shero and his Rangers by beating them in five before disposing of Minnesota in five to lock up a berth in the Stanley Cup Final. Facing the Islanders for the Cup, the Flyers ultimately lost in six games on Bob Nystrom's overtime Stanley Cup-winning goal. The result of the series was marred by controversy, as the Islanders were offside on the play that resulted in their second goal, but the call was not made. Linesman Leon Stickle admitted after the game that he had blown the call. After a tough, five-game preliminary round series win against the Quebec Nordiques, the team's 1980\u201381 season came to an end as they lost in the quarterfinals to the Calgary Flames in seven games.\nNew generation takes over (1981\u20131991).\nSoon the last of the Broad Street Bullies guard moved on. Gone were the likes of Leach, MacLeish, Dupont, Kelly, Jimmy Watson and finally Barber and Clarke in 1984, and taking their spots over the next few seasons were young talent such as Brian Propp, Tim Kerr, Dave Poulin, Pelle Lindbergh and Mark Howe, who upon arrival instantly became the Flyers' top defenseman for the next decade.\nOver the next three seasons the team would suffer early playoff exits and manage to win only one playoff game during that span. They were eliminated two years in a row in 1981\u201382 and 1982\u201383 by the New York Rangers and then were swept by the Washington Capitals in 1983\u201384. Following the loss to Washington, Bobby Clarke retired from play and was named vice-president and general manager of the team. Mike Keenan, a relative unknown at the time, was hired in 1984 to coach the team, and named second-year player Dave Poulin team captain.\nBehind the goaltending of Pelle Lindbergh (who led the NHL with 40 wins and was the first European to win the Vezina Trophy), the Flyers won a franchise-record 53 games \u2013 best in the NHL \u2013 during the 1984\u201385 season. The Flyers rolled through the playoffs by sweeping the Rangers in three games, defeating the Islanders in five and beating Quebec in six to return to the Stanley Cup Final. Though they defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Oilers in game one by a score of 4\u20131 at home, Edmonton won the next four games and the series.\nA month into the 1985\u201386 season, Pelle Lindbergh was killed in a car accident. The team rallied and showed perseverance by garnering the best record in the Wales Conference and matching their win total (53) from the previous year. Tim Kerr scored 58 goals and the defense pairing of Howe and Brad McCrimmon led the League in plus-minus, a +85 and a +83, respectively. Bob Froese filled in admirably in net for Lindbergh, being named a second Team All-Star and sharing the William M. Jennings Trophy with teammate Darren Jensen. Despite their regular season success, an emotionally exhausted Flyers team lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Rangers in five games.\nDuring the 1986\u201387 season, the Flyers were rejuvenated by the ascension of 22-year-old goaltender Ron Hextall. In his rookie season, he became the third Flyers goaltender to win the Vezina Trophy, joining Parent and Lindbergh. With Hextall providing the critical stops at crucial times, the Flyers captured a third-straight Patrick Division title, and were able to gain revenge on the Rangers by beating them in six games in the division semifinals, as well as surviving a tough seven-game test from a gritty Islanders club, in the division finals. The Flyers then defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Canadiens in a fiery six-game series (notable for a famous bench-clearing brawl during the game six warmup) to win the Wales Conference and return to the Stanley Cup Final. As was the case two seasons prior, the Flyers became decimated by injuries, the most significant of which was losing Kerr for the remainder of the playoffs. After falling behind three games to one in the Stanley Cup Final, the Flyers rallied from a two-goal deficit on the road in game five to extend the series, then won game six at home with another late-game comeback. However, they could not overcome the odds a third time and eventually succumbed to the Oilers, 3\u20131, in game seven. Hextall was voted playoffs MVP, the second time a Flyer won the Conn Smythe Trophy despite being on the losing team (the other being another Manitoban, Reggie Leach, in 1976).\nThe Flyers stumbled in 1987\u201388, finishing third in the Patrick Division (after a first-place finish the previous three years). Hextall became the first NHL goaltender to score a goal by firing the puck into an empty net in a December 8 game against Boston. In their first-round playoff series with Washington, the Flyers blew a 3\u20131 series lead as Washington forced a game seven. They then blew a 3\u20130 lead in game seven as Washington won in overtime 5\u20134. It was because of this playoff collapse that \"Iron Mike\" was fired. Paul Holmgren was named Keenan's replacement, the first time a former Flyer was named the club's head coach.\nDespite finishing at the .500 mark in 1988\u201389, the Flyers made the playoffs for the 17th consecutive season. Facing first-place Washington in the first round, the Flyers pulled off the upset in six games. Ron Hextall managed to score another empty-net goal in the waning moments of game five, becoming the first NHL goaltender to score a goal in the playoffs. The Flyers then defeated Pittsburgh in seven games to make the conference finals before bowing out to Montreal in six games.\nThe 1989\u201390 season got off to a bad start for the Flyers, and continued to get worse. Hextall missed all but eight games due to suspension for attacking Chris Chelios at the end of the Montreal playoff series the previous spring, contract holdout issues, and injury. Holmgren replaced Dave Poulin as captain in December with Ron Sutter, which led to Poulin's (and later that season, Brian Propp's) trade to Boston. As a result, the Flyers missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 1972. Bobby Clarke, having been with the Flyers organization since he was drafted in 1969, was fired and replaced as general manager by Russ Farwell.\nRon Hextall continued to be hampered by injuries during the 1990\u201391 season. He only played in 36 games and as a result the Flyers missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year, finishing fifth in the Division and three points short of a playoff spot after a late-season collapse.\nRebuilding years (1991\u20131994).\nPrior to the 1991\u201392 season, the Flyers acquired Rod Brind'Amour from St. Louis. Brind'Amour led the Flyers in goals (33), assists (44) and points (77) in his first season with the club. With Ron Sutter gone to St. Louis in the Brind'Amour trade, Rick Tocchet was named team captain. As the Flyers continued to flounder, Paul Holmgren was fired midway through the season and replaced by Bill Dineen, father of Flyer Kevin Dineen. On February 19, the Flyers and Pittsburgh made a major five-player deal which featured Tocchet \u2013 who never grew comfortably into the role of captain \u2013 heading to Pittsburgh and Mark Recchi coming to Philadelphia. Recchi recorded 27 points in his first 22 games as a Flyer, but the team missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, due in large part to an awful road record (10\u201326\u20134). With Tocchet traded, the Flyers remained without a captain until Kevin Dineen was named to the post in 1993\u201394, and instead went with three alternate captains.\nIn June 1992, the Flyers persuaded Bobby Clarke to return to the team as senior vice president after Jay Snider won the hard-fought arbitration battle for 1991 first overall pick Eric Lindros against the Rangers. It was determined that Quebec had made a deal with the Flyers before making a deal with the Rangers. In order to acquire Lindros' rights, the Flyers parted with six players, trading Steve Duchesne, Peter Forsberg, Ron Hextall, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, Chris Simon, a 1993 first-round draft pick (Jocelyn Thibault), a 1994 first-round draft pick (Nolan Baumgartner) and $15 million to Quebec. While Lindros became a preeminent star in Philadelphia, the trade proved heavily lopsided in favor of the Nordiques \u2013 soon to become the Colorado Avalanche \u2013 providing the core of their two Stanley Cup teams and an unprecedented eight-straight division championships, with Forsberg becoming a franchise player.\nThe trio of Lindros, Recchi and Brent Fedyk formed the Crazy Eights line in Lindros' first two years in the NHL, the eights being the player's jersey numbers (88, 8 and 18 respectively). In 1992\u201393, Recchi set the franchise record for points in a season with 123 (53 goals and 70 assists) and Lindros scored 41 goals in 61 games. After struggling early, the Flyers made a run at the playoffs, but came four points short of the last spot. Head coach Bill Dineen was fired at the season's end, while Clarke left town again to become general manager of the expansion Florida Panthers.\nFor 1993\u201394, Terry Simpson was hired as the new head coach in hopes of returning the Flyers to the playoffs after four consecutive off-years. Mark Recchi recorded 107 points (40 goals and 67 assists) and Lindros 97 (44 goals and 53 assists), while Mikael Renberg set a Flyers rookie record with 82 points. Offense was generated yet the Flyers still failed to clinch a playoff berth, again falling four points short of the final playoff spot. Jay Snider stepped down as president, forcing his father Ed Snider to take over day-to-day operations.\nReturn to contention (1994\u20132004).\nThe elder Snider had decided he had seen enough of Farwell as general manager, and began courting Bobby Clarke to leave his general manager post with Florida to return to Philadelphia. Farwell's last move as general manager was firing Simpson after a lackluster performance. Clarke returned to the general manager position prior to the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season and immediately began putting his stamp on the team. New head coach Terry Murray replaced Kevin Dineen as team captain with Lindros prior to the start of training camp. In order to shore up the defense, Ron Hextall was re-acquired from the Islanders and high-scoring winger Recchi was traded to Montreal for Eric Desjardins, Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair early in the abbreviated season.\nLegion of Doom (1994\u20131997).\nThe Flyers initially struggled out of the gate, going only 3\u20137\u20131 through their first 11 games while being outscored 34\u201322. Lindros and LeClair then teamed with Renberg to form the Legion of Doom line, a mix of scoring talent and physical intimidation. In their 37 games (including the 3\u20131 victory on February 11, 1995, against the New Jersey Devils), the Flyers went 25\u20139\u20133 and outscored their opponents 128\u201398 en route. Lindros tied Jaromir Jagr for the regular season scoring lead (though Jagr won the Art Ross Trophy with more goals), and captured the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP. The playoff drought came to an end as the Flyers won their first division title in eight years and clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference. After dispatching Buffalo in five and sweeping the defending Stanley Cup champion Rangers, the Flyers were upset in the conference finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in six games.\nLindros eclipsed the 100-point mark for the first time in 1995\u201396, gathering 115 points, and LeClair scored 51 goals, as the Flyers repeated as Atlantic Division champs and clinched the top seed in the East. Facing the eighth-seeded Tampa Bay Lightning, the Flyers dropped two of the first three games. They rallied by winning three straight games to win the series. After taking two of the first three games against the Florida Panthers in the second round, the Flyers were defeated in overtime in game four and double-overtime in game five. An upstart Florida club with stellar goaltending from John Vanbiesbrouck ended the Flyers' season in game six.\nThe Flyers said goodbye to the Spectrum and prepared to open a new arena \u2013 the CoreStates Center \u2013 for the next season. The 1996\u201397 season started off slowly, as Lindros missed 30 games, but LeClair still managed to score 50 goals for the second consecutive year, while the mid-season acquisition of defenseman Paul Coffey gave the Flyers a veteran presence. Despite finishing just one point shy of a third straight Atlantic Division title, the Flyers blitzed their way through the first three rounds of the playoffs, dominating Pittsburgh, Buffalo and the Rangers all in five games apiece to win the Eastern Conference championship, and clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 1986\u201387. Despite having home-ice advantage, the Flyers were swept in four-straight games by the Detroit Red Wings. The goaltending tandem of Hextall and Garth Snow fared poorly in the Cup Final, as both conceded soft goals, and Murray's strategy of alternating starters in goal was criticized. After game three, which was a 6\u20131 loss, Murray blasted his team in a closed-door meeting and then described to the media that the Flyers were in a \"choking situation\", a remark which angered his players and likely cost Murray his job, as his contract was not renewed. In July, Mikael Renberg was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, in exchange for Chris Gratton, thus splitting up the famed Legion of Doom line. The trio of Lindros, LeClair and Renberg scored a combined total of 666 points in 547 regular season games.\nThe man picked to replace Murray as coach, Wayne Cashman, was deemed ill-suited for the job as the Flyers played inconsistently throughout the 1997\u201398 season. With 21 games to go in the season, Roger Neilson took over as coach while Cashman was retained as an assistant. John LeClair was able to score at least 50 goals for the third consecutive year (netting 51), the first time for an American-born player, and goaltender Sean Burke was acquired at the trade deadline. Burke proved ineffective in net, as the Flyers were eliminated in the first round by Buffalo in five games.\nIn the off-season, the Flyers went looking for a new goaltender. Burke was let go and Hextall was about to enter his final season as a backup. They chose to sign former Panther John Vanbiesbrouck as the starting goaltender. The 1998\u201399 season was marred by a life-threatening injury sustained by Eric Lindros on April Fools' Day during a game against the Nashville Predators, a season-ending injury later diagnosed as a collapsed lung. Up until that point, Lindros was having an MVP-type season with 40 goals and 53 assists in 71 games. Without Lindros, the Flyers had trouble scoring in the playoffs even after having re-acquired Mark Recchi at the trade deadline. Although Vanbiesbrouck allowed 9 goals to Joseph's 11 allowed, the Flyers lost their first-round series with Toronto in six games.\nThe 1999\u20132000 season was one of the most tumultuous seasons in franchise history and the tumult actually started three months prior to the start of the regular season. In the span of a few days in July, longtime broadcaster Gene Hart died due to illness and defenseman Dmitri Tertyshny, coming off his rookie season, was fatally injured in a freak boating accident. Head coach Roger Neilson was diagnosed with bone cancer, forcing him to step aside in February 2000 to undergo treatment, so assistant coach Craig Ramsay took over as interim coach for the rest of the season; Neilson later recovered but was informed that he would not return. In January, longtime Flyer and fan-favorite Rod Brind'Amour was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Keith Primeau, with the intention of acquiring a big center to complement Lindros. Meanwhile, the strife between Flyers management (particularly Clarke) and Lindros, continued to worsen. Less than a month after Ramsay took over, Lindros suffered his second concussion of the season. He played several games after the initial hit and afterwards criticized the team's training staff for failing to initially diagnose the concussion after it happened. It was after this that the Flyers' organization decided to strip Lindros of the captaincy on March 27 and name defenseman Eric Desjardins the team's captain.\nWith Lindros out indefinitely, the Flyers rallied to overcome the distractions and a 15-point deficit in the standings to win the Atlantic Division and the top seed in the East on the last day of the regular season. They easily defeated their first-round opponent, Buffalo, in five games. Primeau's goal in the fifth overtime of game four against the team's second-round opponent, Pittsburgh, turned that series in the Flyers' favor as they won in six games, coming back from a 2\u20130 series deficit. After dropping game one to New Jersey in the conference finals, the Flyers won three-straight games to take a 3\u20131 series lead. However, New Jersey won game five. In game six, Lindros returned to the lineup for the first time since March in another losing effort. Early in game seven, Lindros was handed another concussion and leaving the Philadelphia crowd deflated after being on the receiving end of a controversial hit by Scott Stevens. Without him, the Flyers lost the decisive game 2\u20131. It was the second time in franchise history the team lost a series after being up 3\u20131. Lindros never again wore a Flyers uniform, as he sat out the following season awaiting a trade.\nCraig Ramsay was named the permanent head coach as Neilson was not asked to return for the 2000\u201301, which became a matter of some controversy. Ramsay lasted only until December when he was replaced by former Flyer great Bill Barber. Brian Boucher, who as a rookie backstopped the Flyers' playoff run the previous season, could not duplicate his performance and lost the starting goaltending job to Roman Cechmanek, a former star in the Czech Republic. The performance of Cechmanek, worthy of a Vezina nomination, along with Bill Barber winning the Jack Adams Award as head coach of the year, helped the Flyers stay afloat, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to Buffalo in six games.\nIn the off-season, the Flyers re-vamped their lineup by signing Jeremy Roenick and finally trading Eric Lindros to the Rangers for Kim Johnsson, Jan Hlavac, Pavel Brendl and a 2003 third-round draft pick (Stefan Ruzicka). Desjardins stepped down as team captain eight games into the season and was replaced by Primeau. The Flyers began 2001\u201302 with high expectations and with Roenick leading the team in scoring, the Flyers finished with an Atlantic Division title. The power play was one of the NHL's worst however, so Adam Oates, the third leading point-producer in the League at the time, was acquired from Washington at the NHL trade deadline. However, it was of no benefit as the Flyers could not muster much offense, scoring only two goals in their five-game, first-round playoff loss to the Ottawa Senators. It turned out there was much discontent in the locker room as Bill Barber was fired. The Flyers hired a proven winner when they turned to former Dallas Stars and Stanley Cup-winning head coach Ken Hitchcock.\nIn 2002\u201303, Roman Cechmanek had a 1.83 goals against average (GAA) and the Flyers acquired Sami Kapanen and Tony Amonte prior to the trade deadline; however, they fell one point short of a second straight Atlantic Division title. Consequently, the Flyers endured a long, brutal seven-game first-round matchup with Toronto that featured three multiple overtime games, all in Toronto. After winning game seven, 6\u20131, the Flyers fought Ottawa in the second round with equal vigor as they split the first four games of the series, with Cechmanek earning shutouts in both wins. His inconsistency showed through, however, as he allowed ten goals in the final two games, and Ottawa advanced in six games. He was later traded to Los Angeles for a 2004 second-round draft pick during the off-season despite having the second-best GAA in the League over his three years in Philadelphia.\nFree-agent goaltender Jeff Hackett was signed from Boston to replace Cechmanek and challenge backup Robert Esche for the starter's spot in 2003\u201304, but he was forced to retire in February due to vertigo. During the course of the season, serious injuries suffered by both Roenick (broken jaw) and Primeau (concussion) in February forced the Flyers to trade for Chicago's Alexei Zhamnov, who filled in well and kept the Flyers afloat. On March 5, 2004, the Flyers set an NHL record in a game against Ottawa where they set a combined record of 419 penalty minutes in a single game. Esche entrenched himself as starter and remained in that position even after the Flyers re-acquired Sean Burke from the Phoenix Coyotes as the Flyers clinched the Atlantic Division title over New Jersey on the last day of the season. Though solid in net, Esche's performance was trumped by the play of captain Keith Primeau in the playoffs. Primeau led the Flyers past the defending Stanley Cup champion Devils in five, Toronto in six on their way to the conference finals, and a matchup with Tampa Bay. Despite winning game six on the late-game heroics of Primeau and winger Simon Gagne, the Flyers came up short once again, losing game seven in Tampa, 2\u20131.\nFrom highs to lows (2004\u20132014).\nWith the NHL preparing for looming labor unrest, the Flyers let their leading scorer, Mark Recchi, leave for Pittsburgh during the off-season. Unsure about the future, the Flyers were unsure about his worth. The NHL lockout forced the cancellation of the 2004\u201305 NHL season. The Flyers were one of the more active teams once the NHL lockout came to an end. Replacing the high-profile names of Amonte, LeClair and Roenick were superstar Peter Forsberg, along with defensemen Derian Hatcher and Mike Rathje, as well as several players from the Calder Cup-winning Philadelphia Phantoms. When all was said and done, the team had experienced a turnover of nearly two-thirds of the roster.\nThe Flyers began the 2005\u201306 NHL season with lofty expectations. Despite being hampered by injuries prior to and during the season, the Flyers lived up to those expectations in the first half of the season, reaching the top of the league standings in January while simultaneously holding a 10-point lead in the Atlantic Division. The \"Deuces Wild\" line of Forsberg, Gagne, and Mike Knuble recorded 75, 79 and 65 points respectively while Gagne, with Forsberg feeding him, scored a career-high of 47 goals. However, the injuries began to accumulate and take their toll, the most crippling of which was Keith Primeau's season-ending concussion. Derian Hatcher served as interim captain for the remainder of the season. The Flyers had been first in the league prior to the Olympic break, where an injury to Forsberg occurred. All told, the Flyers were third in the NHL with 388 man-games lost to injury, tops amongst playoff teams. The second half of the regular season was defined by a record hovering around .500, sending the Flyers on a steady slide in the standings. The Flyers fell short of an Atlantic Division title, finishing second by tie-breaker to New Jersey, drawing the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference and a first-round matchup with fourth-seeded Buffalo. The Flyers lost the series in six games.\nThe Flyers' 40th anniversary season turned out to be the worst in franchise history. The Flyers traded Michal Handzus to Chicago, lost Kim Johnsson to free agency and Eric Desjardins and team captain Keith Primeau retired in the off-season. Peter Forsberg replaced Primeau as team captain, but a chronic foot injury developing in last season's Olympics had him in and out of the lineup throughout the season and limited his effectiveness. Eight games into the regular season and with a record of 1\u20136\u20131, general manager Bobby Clarke resigned and head coach Ken Hitchcock was fired. Assistant coach John Stevens replaced Hitchcock and assistant general manager Paul Holmgren took on Clarke's responsibilities on an interim basis.\nThe changes did little to improve the Flyers fortunes in 2006\u201307 as setting franchise records for futility became the norm. They had several multiple-game losing streaks, including a franchise-worst 10-game losing streak and a 13-game home losing streak that stretched from November 29 to February 10. Ultimately, the Flyers finished with a 22\u201348\u201312 record, the most losses and the worst winning percentage in franchise history, and the worst record in the league. They also set the NHL record for the biggest points drop off in the standings in a one-year span (101 points in 2005\u201306 to 56 points in 2006\u201307, a difference of 45 points). The Flyers lost the 2007 NHL draft lottery to the Chicago Blackhawks and received the second overall selection.\nWith the team clearly on the verge of missing the playoffs for the first time in 13 years, Paul Holmgren set his sights on rebuilding the team and preparing for the future. Forsberg, unwilling to commit to playing next season, was traded to Nashville for Scottie Upshall, Ryan Parent and 2007 first- and third-round draft picks at the deadline. Veteran defenseman Alexei Zhitnik was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers for prospect defenseman Braydon Coburn, while disappointing off-season acquisition Kyle Calder was sent to Detroit via Chicago in exchange for defenseman Lasse Kukkonen. The Flyers also acquired goaltender Martin Biron from Buffalo for a 2007 second-round pick. Given wide praise for his efforts, the Flyers gave Holmgren a two-year contract and removed the interim label from his title.\nBefore the 2007\u201308 season began the Flyers made a trade that sent the first-round draft pick they had acquired in the Forsberg trade (23rd overall) back to Nashville in exchange for the rights to negotiate with impending unrestricted free agents Kimmo Timonen and Scott Hartnell. Both were subsequently signed to six-year contracts. After much speculation about whether the Flyers would keep or trade the second overall pick in the 2007 NHL entry draft, the Flyers opted to keep it, using it to select New Jersey native James van Riemsdyk.\nThe Flyers wasted no time in addressing their free-agent needs. On July 1, the Flyers signed Buffalo co-captain Daniel Briere to an eight-year, $52 million contract. Continuing to revamp their defensive core, Joni Pitkanen and Geoff Sanderson were traded to Edmonton in exchange for Oilers captain Jason Smith and Joffrey Lupul. Smith was later named Flyers captain on October 1.\nThe season began in the image of the \"Broad Street Bullies\" era, with multiple-game suspensions handed out to five separate players, the most serious being 25-game suspensions to both Steve Downie and Jesse Boulerice for two separate incidents. A 7\u20133 start in October and a 9\u20133\u20131 January run had the Flyers near the top of both the Division and Conference standings. However, a disastrous ten-game losing streak in February, reminiscent of such a streak the previous season, nearly derailed the Flyers' year. An 8\u20133\u20134 run in March, coupled with two huge wins over New Jersey and Pittsburgh over the final weekend of the regular season, put the Flyers back in the 2008 playoffs as the sixth seed, setting up a first-round matchup with Washington. After taking a three-game-to-one lead over the Capitals, Washington then won games 5 and 6 to force a deciding game seven in Washington. After an evenly fought game, the Flyers ultimately won the series in overtime via a Joffrey Lupul powerplay goal. The Flyers then drew a matchup with heavily favored Montreal in the second round. Despite being outshot a majority of the series, the Flyers upset the Canadiens in five games, advancing to the conference finals for the first time since 2003\u201304 to face Pittsburgh. Before the start of the series, the Flyers suffered a fatal blow when it was learned that Kimmo Timonen was out with a blood clot in his ankle. Coupled with a gruesome facial injury to Braydon Coburn in game two, Pittsburgh ran roughshod over the Flyers' depleted defense and jumped out to a 3\u20130 series lead. The Flyers won game four at home to stave off elimination, and although Timonen returned for game five, Pittsburgh finished off the Flyers in five games.\nThe Flyers began the 2008\u201309 season by naming Mike Richards the 17th captain in team history on September 17, with Jason Smith having departed to Ottawa as a free agent. The Flyers were looking to build on the success of the previous season, but instead got off to an 0\u20133\u20133 start. However, despite a solid December and January and finishing with four points more than the year before, for the most part, the 2008\u201309 Flyers played inconsistently and looked like different teams, playing at the top of their ability one night and a sub-par performance the next. Derian Hatcher missed the entire regular season and playoffs with a knee injury, and Steve Downie was traded to Tampa Bay with Steve Eminger, whom they had previously acquired in a trade with Washington prior to the season for defenseman Matt Carle. Two pleasant surprises were the emergence of rookie center Claude Giroux and defenseman Luca Sbisa, who was drafted by the Flyers in June with the 19th overall pick acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for R. J. Umberger, a victim of team salary cap constraints. Scottie Upshall also found himself the victim of such a crunch; he was traded to Phoenix in exchange for Daniel Carcillo at the NHL trade deadline.\nDespite holding on to the fourth seed in the East for much of the season, thanks to a 4\u20135\u20131 finish to the season, highlighted by a home loss to the Rangers on the last day of the regular season, the Flyers slipped to the fifth seed and lost home-ice advantage in their first-round series with Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh dominated the Flyers in game one, and despite a better effort by the Flyers in game two, Pittsburgh came to Philadelphia with a 2\u20130 series lead. The Flyers were the better team in games three and four, but Pittsburgh gained a split in Philadelphia and took a 3\u20131 series lead. After a decisive 3\u20130 win in game five, the Flyers jumped out to a 3\u20130 lead in game six, but promptly fell victim to the inconsistencies that plagued the team all season and gave up five unanswered goals in a season-ending 5\u20133 loss. Giroux led the team in scoring in the playoffs. Jeff Carter ended the regular season with 46 goals, second in the NHL after Washington's Alexander Ovechkin. Mike Richards just missed out on the Frank J. Selke Trophy in the closest vote in the history of the award.\nThe Flyers began the 2009\u201310 season with some major changes, allowing goaltenders Martin Biron and Antero Niittymaki to depart via free agency, replacing them with former Ottawa netminder Ray Emery and former Flyer Brian Boucher, and significantly upgrading the defense with the addition of Chris Pronger from Anaheim. Pronger came at a price, however, costing the Flyers Joffrey Lupul, Luca Sbisa and the Flyers' first-round draft picks in both 2009 and 2010 drafts. The season began in earnest, though it soon unraveled with mediocre play that cost head coach John Stevens his job in December 2009. Peter Laviolette was hired as his replacement in order to reinstitute accountability and restore success to the Flyers, though the results were not immediate; the Flyers suffered a 2\u20137\u20131 stretch immediately following his arrival. Injuries took a major toll on the Flyers, with Blair Betts, Daniel Briere, Jeff Carter, Simon Gagne and Kimmo Timonen all missing significant numbers of games, though no position was nearly affected as much with injuries as goaltending. Emery suffered a hip injury in December, played sporadically afterwards and ultimately underwent season-ending surgery. Boucher suffered a hand injury shortly thereafter, which allowed journeyman goaltender Michael Leighton to step in and make an immediate impact. Leighton went 8\u20130\u20131 in his first ten starts, including a tough 2\u20131 overtime loss in the 2010 Winter Classic to Boston at Fenway Park on New Year's Day. However, Leighton was forced out of the line-up in March with a high ankle sprain, necessitating Boucher's return as starter. All told, seven different goaltenders suited up for the Flyers at various points throughout the year. Mediocre play down the stretch forced the Flyers into a do-or-die shootout with the Rangers in the final game of the regular season. Boucher stopped final shooter Olli Jokinen to clinch the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference and a first-round matchup with New Jersey.\nBoucher and the Flyers consistently outplayed Martin Brodeur and New Jersey and pulled off the upset in five games. However, the victory was costly, as Carter suffered a broken foot and Gagne a broken toe in game four, while Ian Laperriere suffered a grievous facial injury by blocking a shot in game five. The Flyers then faced sixth-seeded Boston in the second round, and despite playing at an even level with the Bruins, the Flyers found themselves in a 3\u20130 series deficit. Gagne returned in game four and scored in overtime to force a game five, which the Flyers won convincingly, 4\u20130. Boucher suffered MCL sprains during the game in both knees which forced Leighton back into net in his first time suiting up since March. Boucher and Leighton became the first goaltenders since 1955 to share a playoff shutout. A 2\u20131 Flyers win in game six forced a game seven in Boston. Falling behind 3\u20130 in game seven, the Flyers pulled off the biggest comeback in both franchise and League history, winning 4\u20133 on a late goal by Gagne to join the 1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs, the 1974\u201375 New York Islanders and the 2004 Boston Red Sox as the only sports teams to win a playoff series after trailing 3\u20130.\nIn the conference finals, the Flyers had home-ice advantage as they faced eighth-seeded Montreal. Leighton became the first Flyers netminder to record three shutouts in a series, and Carter and Laperriere returned to the lineup as the Flyers won the Eastern Conference Championship in five games, advancing to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 1997 to face the Chicago Blackhawks. Dropping two close games in Chicago, the Flyers returned home to win game three in overtime and game four to even the series. A convincing 7\u20134 win by Chicago in game five, however, put the Flyers one game away from elimination. A late goal by Scott Hartnell in game six forced overtime, but Patrick Kane scored just over four minutes into overtime to eliminate the Flyers and give Chicago their first Stanley Cup since 1961. Ville Leino, acquired in a mid-season trade from Detroit, set the Flyers rookie playoff scoring record and tied the NHL record with 21 points. Briere led the NHL playoff scoring race with 30 points, one point ahead of Conn Smythe Trophy winner, Jonathan Toews.\nComing off the close loss to Chicago in the Cup Final, the Flyers traded Gagne to Tampa Bay to clear up cap space, acquired Andrej Meszaros from Tampa Bay in a separate trade and signed free agent Sean O'Donnell to shore up the defensive corps. The Flyers started the 2010\u201311 season with rookie goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky from the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in Russia, who recorded an opening-night win in his NHL debut against Pittsburgh and had steady numbers throughout the season. Boucher remained as the team's backup goaltender, while Leighton played one game in December after recovering from a back injury before being demoted to Adirondack in the American Hockey League (AHL). The Flyers led both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference for the majority of the season, and challenged Vancouver for the overall NHL lead. Kris Versteeg was brought in from Toronto to add additional offense for the stretch drive and playoffs. However, lackluster play throughout March and April, coupled with a broken hand suffered by Chris Pronger in late February that ended his regular season, cost the Flyers the top seed in the East during the last week of the regular season, although the Flyers hung on to win their first Atlantic Division title since 2003\u201304 and clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference.\nThe Flyers drew Buffalo in the first round. Bobrovsky played well in a 1\u20130 game one loss, but was replaced in game two by Boucher, who held on for a 5\u20134 Flyers win. Boucher played well in a game three win and a game four loss, but was replaced himself in a favor of Leighton during a bad first period in game five, which Buffalo won in overtime. Pronger returned to the lineup and Leighton started game six, but was replaced by Boucher after a poor first period, though nonetheless the Flyers went on to win in overtime and forced a game seven, which Boucher started. The Flyers dominated Buffalo, 5\u20132, and became the first team to win a playoff series starting three different goaltenders since 1988. The Flyers then drew a rematch with the Boston Bruins in the second round. Boston dominated the Flyers in game one, where Boucher was again replaced, this time by Bobrovsky. Pronger again left the lineup with an undisclosed injury, while Boston won game two in overtime and again dominated the Flyers in game three to take a 3\u20130 series lead. Bobrovsky started game four, but there was no comeback like in their previous meeting, as Boston completed the sweep. The Flyers tied an NHL record with seven playoff in-game goaltender changes, and were the only NHL team not to record a shutout in either the regular season or playoffs.\nFlyers general manager Paul Holmgren made two franchise-altering trades within the span of an hour on June 23, 2011, trading Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 second-round draft pick, and Jeff Carter to Columbus for their 2011 first-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Sean Couturier), 2011 third-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Nick Cousins) and Jakub Voracek. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the Phoenix Coyotes' Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51 million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a five-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a two-year contract. Additionally, Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the 2011\u201312 season, he was lost for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome. Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to sub-par, including being benched in favor of Sergei Bobrovsky for the Flyers' 3\u20132 loss to the New York Rangers in the 2012 Winter Classic, but also being named NHL First Star for the month of March. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Couturier, Schenn and Matt Read standing out impressively.\nThe Flyers drew Pittsburgh in the first round of the 2012 playoffs, a series in which the two teams combined for an NHL-record 45 goals in the first four games and a total of 309 penalty minutes in an intense, fight-filled series. The Flyers pulled off the upset in six games against a heavily favored Pittsburgh team. In the second round against New Jersey, the Flyers were heavily favored to win the series, but the Flyers' run-and-gun style of play was stymied by the Devils' forechecking and defense, and, although they won the first game at home in overtime, the Flyers lost four games in a row and were eliminated in five. Briere and Giroux ended the playoffs tied with five other players for the League lead in playoff goals with eight, despite their team being eliminated in the second round.\nThe team began the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season by naming Claude Giroux captain on January 15, 2013, and starting off at 0\u20133\u20130, their worst start in 17 years. The franchise finished at a record of 23\u201322\u20133, fourth in the Atlantic and tenth in the East. The team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since the 2006\u201307 season and only the ninth time in team history. During the off-season, the Flyers used their two contract buyouts allotted by the new league collective bargaining agreement on Bryzgalov and Briere, and signed free agents Mark Streit (four years, $21 million) and Vincent Lecavalier (five years, $22.5 million).\nOn October 7, head coach Peter Laviolette and assistant coach Kevin McCarthy were both fired just three games into the 2013\u201314 season after the team again began the season 0\u20133\u20130. Assistant coach Craig Berube, who previously played for the Flyers and served two stints as head coach of the Flyers' AHL affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms, was named the new head coach, while John Paddock and former Flyer Ian Laperriere were announced as Berube's assistants. The team went 42\u201327\u201310 with Berube behind the bench, clinching a playoff berth and ultimately losing in seven games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the 2014 playoffs.\nMultiple makeovers (2014\u2013present).\nOn May 7, 2014, the club announced that general manager Paul Holmgren had been promoted to president, with assistant general manager Ron Hextall filling his vacancy. Hextall laid out a new plan for the franchise to develop players from within their system, rather than through outside acquisitions. In order to free up valuable cap space, Scott Hartnell was traded before the start of the 2014\u201315 season, following Braydon Coburn and Kimmo Timonen being traded away mid-season.\nThe Flyers did not qualify for the playoffs for the second time in three seasons in 2014\u201315, and head coach Berube was subsequently fired after the season. The Flyers finished with 33 wins and 31 losses for 84 points. On May 18, 2015, the Flyers hired the former head coach of the University of North Dakota men's team, Dave Hakstol. Hakstol had been North Dakota's coach for the past eight seasons, during which he accumulated a 289\u2013143\u201343 record and led the school to the NCAA tournament in each season at the helm. In the 2014\u201315 NCAA season, the university went 29\u201310\u20133 and advanced to the Frozen Four for the seventh time during Hakstol's tenure.\nThe Flyers began the 2015\u201316 season with a record of 4\u20132\u20131 in their first seven games. They found themselves outside of the playoff picture near the halfway point of the regular season, but a second-half surge, including a combined record of 17\u20137\u20135 in February and March, placed them into playoff position. On the second-to-last day of the season, the Flyers clinched the final wild-card playoff berth with a win over Pittsburgh and an Ottawa win over Boston, which consequently eliminated the Bruins from playoff contention. The Flyers faced Washington in the first round, losing the first three games of the series. The Flyers would rally to win the next two games, but lost the series in six games.\nOn April 11, 2016, Flyers longtime chairman, co-founder, and former majority owner Ed Snider died after a two-year battle with bladder cancer. In the 2016\u201317 season, the Flyers won ten straight games during the months of November and December. However, they fell out of the playoff picture after that streak ended, struggling in the standings and letting other teams get ahead of them. They were eliminated from playoff contention during the last two weeks of the regular season, becoming the first team to miss the playoffs after having a winning streak of ten or more games in the process.\nDespite finishing sixth in their division, they won the second overall pick in the 2017 NHL entry draft lottery with just a 2.4% chance to win that particular pick. They used this pick to select Nolan Patrick from the Brandon Wheat Kings. In the 2017\u201318 season, the Flyers rallied from a 10-game losing streak early in the season to finish in third place in the Metropolitan Division but lost to Pittsburgh in six games in the first round of the 2018 playoffs. They clinched a playoff spot on the last game of the season, at home against the Rangers, winning 5\u20130 with the help of a Claude Giroux hat trick. In that game, Giroux became the first Flyer to have a 100-point season since Eric Lindros in 1995\u201396, finishing second in league scoring and fourth in MVP voting, while Couturier was a finalist for the Selke Trophy, and Simmonds was a finalist for the Mark Messier Leadership Award.\nAfter failing to meet expectations to start the 2018\u201319 season, Ron Hextall was fired as general manager. Two weeks later, Dave Hakstol was fired as head coach after the Flyers' 12\u201315\u20134 start to the season. Chuck Fletcher was hired as the team's general manager on December 3, 2018, and would later be named the team's president, after Paul Holmgren stepped down from the role. Due to racial controversy involving vocalist Kate Smith, at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, the Flyers removed her statue from outside the stadium and stopped playing her version of \"God Bless America\". The Flyers fell apart as the season went on, missing the playoffs.\nHeading into the 2019\u201320 season, the Flyers hired coach Alain Vigneault and signed forward Kevin Hayes in the hopes of bringing the team to cup contender status again. Opening day took place in the Czech Republic, Voracek's birthplace. The Flyers beat the Blackhawks 4\u20132. The Flyers started off the season very well, tying a team record for the best November in team history with a record of 10\u20133\u20134. The Flyers produced consistent, cohesive hockey throughout the season. One of the most notable progressions in the team was the chemistry of the team and the success of the second line, which consisted of Scott Laughton, Kevin Hayes, and Travis Konecny. In February, the team pulled away from the pack of Wild-Card spot chasers and reached second place in the Metropolitan Division following a home win against the Rangers that put their February record at 9\u20133. The Flyers ended up with a nine-game winning streak, losing at home against the Boston Bruins, the NHL's points leader. The Flyers were scheduled to play at Tampa Bay on March 12, but the NHL suspended all games earlier in the day due to COVID-19 concerns. The Flyers were second in the Metropolitan Division, only 1 point behind the Capitals.\nThe Flyers entered the 2020 playoffs \"bubble\" in Toronto as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, meaning they had clinched a playoff appearance and were to play in a seeding round-robin between the top four teams of the conference. The Flyers beat the Bruins in the first game 4\u20131, the Capitals in the second game 3\u20131, and the Lightning in the third game 4\u20131 to claim the number first seed in the conference for the first time since the 1999\u20132000 season. Despite high expectations after sweeping the round-robin play, going 0 for 11 on the power play was a detriment to the team's play. Regardless, they went into the first round against the 12th-seeded Canadiens, who had beat the fifth-seeded Penguins in the qualifying series, with much confidence. The Flyers jumped to a 3\u20131 series lead behind young goaltender Carter Hart, who recorded two consecutive shutouts in games 3 and 4. Montreal won game five to extend their season, but the Flyers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round against the New York Islanders, the Flyers fell behind 3\u20131 in the series partially due to lack of production from the top two lines. The Flyers would rally to tie the series with an overtime win in game five and a double-overtime win in game six, but the Islanders shut out the Flyers 4\u20130 in game seven to end their season.\nDespite having lost in the playoffs, the team had very high expectations entering the 2020\u201321 season. The NHL did not begin the season until January 13, 2021, due to the ongoing global pandemic. NHL divisions would be temporarily realigned due to travel restrictions, placing the Flyers in the East Division. The team managed to finish the first month of play tied for first place in the league, with a 7\u20132\u20131 record. However things began to unravel as the season continued. The team fell out of playoff contention by early March and would finish the season with the most goals scored against in the league. Management vowed to address the issues the team had suffered during the season by making several trades and free agent signings. On July 17, 2021, the team traded Nolan Patrick and Philippe Myers to the Nashville Predators in exchange for defenseman Ryan Ellis. The following week the team traded for defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen from the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Robert Hagg, a 2021 first-round pick, and a 2023 second-round pick; and traded Voracek back to the Columbus Blue Jackets for forward Cam Atkinson. The team also signed veteran defenseman Keith Yandle, back up goaltender Martin Jones and forward Derick Brassard to short-term deals.\nThe Flyers began the 2021\u201322 season off to a steady pace by winning six out of the first ten games of the season, however once again things would start to fall apart for the team. Newly acquired Ryan Ellis was placed on injured reserved on November 16 and would be out for the remainder of the season, due to a lower body injury sustained in the preseason. The team then went on a ten-game losing streak at which point Alain Vigneault was fired from head coaching duties following a 7\u20131 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning, and replaced by assistant coach Mike Yeo. The team would show a brief sign of resurgence under Yeo before the team collapsed again by losing a franchise record thirteen games in a row. In early February, center Sean Couturier was ruled out for the rest of the season after completing back surgery for an injury sustained earlier in the year. On March 17, longtime Flyers captain Claude Giroux played in his 1,000th career NHL game, a 5\u20134 home victory over the Nashville Predators, becoming the second Flyer in history to play 1000 games with the franchise. On March 19, Giroux was traded along with Connor Bunnaman, German Rubtsov and a 2024 fifth-round pick to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Owen Tippett, a 2024 first-round draft pick, and a 2023 third-round pick. The team finished the season with the fourth worst record in the league going 25\u201346\u201311, failing to make the playoffs.\nJohn Tortorella was hired as the team's new head coach, signing a four-year contract. Before the beginning of the 2022\u201323 season it was announced that Ryan Ellis would once again sit out for the season with a possible career ending injury. To make matters worse it was announced soon after that Sean Couturier would require a second back surgery and also be forced to sit out for the entire season. The team would once again have a modest start to the season by finishing the month of October with an 8-4-2 record. However the team was unable to capitalize on their early momentum and fell in the standings with a ten-game winless streak in the month of November. On March 10, general manager Chuck Fletcher was fired and assistant general manager Daniel Briere was named interim general manager. The team finished the season with a record of 31\u201338\u201313, missing the playoffs for a third consecutive year.\nAfter the season ended the organization began a complete overhaul of the front office. On May 11, 2023, the team hired former Flyer Keith Jones as president of hockey operations and named Daniel Briere as general manager of the team. Soon after the team fired longtime player development coaches Kjell Samuelsson and John Riley, as well as senior advisor Mike O'Connell.\nLogo and jerseys.\nColors, name and logo.\nOn April 4, 1966, Bill Putnam \u2013 a member of the Philadelphia group that was selected by the NHL for one of the six new franchises \u2013 announced a name-the-team contest and orange, black and white as the team colors. Wanting what he referred to as \"hot\" colors, Putnam's choice was influenced by the orange and white of his alma mater \u2013 the University of Texas at Austin \u2013 and the orange and black of Philadelphia's previous NHL team, the Quakers. Also announced on April 4 was the hiring of a Chicago firm to design the team's arena.\nDetails of the name-the-team contest were released on July 12, 1966. Ballots were available at local Acme Markets grocery stores \u2013 sponsor of the contest. The top prize was an RCA 21\" color television, with two season tickets for both the second- and third-prize winners, and a pair of single-game tickets for the next 100 winners. Among the names considered behind the scenes were Quakers, Ramblers and Liberty Bells. The first two were the names of previous Philadelphia hockey teams and \u2013 given the connotations of losing (Quakers) and the minor leagues (Ramblers) \u2013 were passed over. Liberty Bells, although seriously considered, was also the name of a local race track. Bashers, Blizzards, Bruisers, Huskies, Keystones, Knights, Lancers, Raiders and Sabres were among the other names considered.\nIt was Ed Snider's sister Phyllis who named the team when she suggested \"Flyers\" on a return trip from a Broadway play. Ed knew immediately it would be the winning name, since it captured the speed of the game and went well phonetically with Philadelphia. On August 3, 1966, the team name was announced. Of the 11,000 ballots received, more than 100 selected Flyers as the team name and were entered into a drawing to select a winner. Alec Stockard, a nine-year-old boy from Narberth, Pennsylvania, who had spelled it \"Fliers\" on his entry, won the drawing and was declared the winner.\nWith the name and colors already known, Philadelphia advertising firm Mel Richmann Inc. was hired to design a logo and jersey. With Tom Paul as head of the project, artist Sam Ciccone designed both the logo and jerseys to represent speed. Ciccone's winged \"P\" design \u2013 four stylized wings attached to a slanted \"P\" with an orange dot to represent a puck \u2013 was considered the \"obvious choice\" over his other designs, which included a winged skate. Ciccone's jersey design, a stripe down each shoulder and down the arms, represented wings. The flying \"P\" has remained the same since the beginning (excluding minor tweaks to the shade of orange) and was ranked the sixth-best NHL logo in a 2008 \"Hockey News\" poll. The Flyers unveiled a 3D version of this logo with metallic accents during the 2002\u201303 season which was used on orange third jerseys until the end of the 2006\u201307 season.\nJerseys.\nAs with his logo design, Ciccone's jersey design was meant to represent speed. The home jersey was orange with a white stripe down each shoulder and down the arms (meant to represent wings) with a white number on the back and black sleeve numbers. The away jersey was white with orange striping, an orange number on the back and white sleeve numbers. Other than a few minor alterations to the numbers and the switch the NHL made to wear white at home and dark on the road for 1970\u201371, this general design was used until the end of the 1981\u201382 season.\nThe Flyers unveiled second-generation jerseys for the 1982\u201383 season. The main difference was the increased width of the shoulder and arm stripes with black trim added to the border of the stripes. Also, a pinstripe (black for the white jersey, orange for the dark) was added to the bottom of each sleeve. With the exception of a similarly designed black jersey replacing the orange and the NHL switching back to wearing darks at home and whites on the road prior to 2003\u201304, this design was used until the end of the 2006\u201307 season.\nMany NHL teams started using third jerseys during the mid-1990s and the Flyers unveiled a black third jersey that was similar in design to their second-generation jerseys during the 1997\u201398 season. During the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs, the black jersey became the primary dark jersey with the orange jersey being retired after the 2000\u201301 season (although it was worn for one final game early in the following season on Halloween night). In 2002\u201303, a new orange third jersey was introduced which was a radical departure from any jersey the Flyers had used before. Unique striping and fonts were used along with the aforementioned metallic 3D logo and the first use of a color other than orange, black or white on a Flyers jersey \u2013 silver/gray. These jerseys were used until the end of the 2006\u201307 season.\nThe Flyers, along with the rest of the NHL, unveiled new jerseys prior to the 2007\u201308 season. The black jersey featured white shoulders with orange and black sections at the elbow and black cuffs. The white road jersey featured orange shoulders with black and white sections at the elbow, and black cuffs. The Flyers unveiled a new orange third jersey based on their 1973\u201374 jerseys during the 2008\u201309 season, featuring white player nameplates with black letters which were used occasionally during that season. This uniform replaced the black jerseys as the primary home jersey during the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs and the subsequent 2009\u201310 season. The team wore the 1973\u201374 white jersey \u2013 reverse of their current home uniform but with a black nameplate with white lettering \u2013 at the 2010 Winter Classic versus the Boston Bruins at Fenway Park. For the 2010\u201311 season, the Winter Classic jersey was adopted as the team's primary road jersey and the team's alternate black jersey was retired.\nIn January 2012, for their second Winter Classic appearance \u2013 this time against their arch-rivals the New York Rangers at Citizens Bank Park \u2013 the Flyers wore a traditional sweater design in orange with cream and black trim, featuring a cream nameplate with black lettering, as well as black numbers. It also contained a neck tie string which no other Flyers jersey has had before it. This design was later adopted as a third jersey for the 2014\u201315 season.\nFor the 2016\u201317 season, the Flyers retired their Winter Classic third jerseys in favor of a commemorative 50th-anniversary jersey. The uniform is white with orange and black striping, along with gold numbers, black nameplate with white lettering bordered in gold, and the classic Flyers logo with gold borders. The franchise's founding season is inscribed on the neckline.\nThe Flyers wore a black uniform for the 2017 Stadium Series, featuring enlarged black numbers with white trim, orange striping on the sleeves and tail, and orange nameplate with black lettering. The said uniform will become the team's third uniform option starting in the 2018\u201319 season.\nDuring the 2019 Stadium Series, the Flyers wore orange and black uniforms minus the white elements. The black helmets also featured an enlarged Flyers logo on both sides.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Flyers released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The design was a callback to the darker burnt orange jersey they wore from 1982 to 2001; however, the white and black colors on the sleeves and numbers were reversed. In the 2022\u201323 season, the Flyers' \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was based on their early 1980s uniforms, but with black and orange relegated to the logo and lower sleeves.\nThe Flyers unveiled a new uniform design ahead of the 2023\u201324 season, reverting to the burnt orange shade they wore with the 1984\u20132007 uniforms. This design featured wider shoulder and sleeve stripes, single-colored sleeve numbers (black on the home uniform, white on the road uniform), and a black bottom stripe, all of which were visual nods to previous Flyers uniforms. The contrasting nameplate was also retained. The black alternate first used in the 2017 Stadium Series was also kept in circulation.\nThe Flyers' 2024 Stadium Series uniform featured a white base with the primary logo crest in front, thick black and orange sleeve stripes, orange numbers on the shoulders and back, and black nameplates which stretch from shoulder to shoulder.\nCooperall pants.\nThe Flyers were the first and one of only two NHL teams (the Hartford Whalers being the other) to wear Cooperalls, hockey pants that extend from the waist to the ankles, in 1981\u201382. They wore them the following season as well, but returned to the traditional hockey pants in 1983\u201384 due to Cooperalls being banned from the NHL for safety reasons.\nMascots.\nThe Flyers debuted a short-lived skating mascot named \"Slapshot\" in 1976 but dropped the character by the next season. Slapshot was the first mascot in Flyers' team history before Gritty, although the team did occasionally employ the services of \"Phlex\", the then-mascot of the team's minor-league affiliate Philadelphia Phantoms (1996\u20132009), who became the Adirondack Phantoms (2009\u20132014) and are now re-branded the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, playing in the PPL Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\nOn September 24, 2018, the Flyers introduced their new mascot, \"Gritty\", a seven-foot tall, fuzzy orange creature.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Flyers.

The seven individuals recognized as builders by the Hall of Fame includes former general managers, head coaches, and owners. Inducted in 1984, Bernie Parent was the first Flyers-affiliated player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nIn addition to players and builders, members of Philadelphia's sports media have also been recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1997, Gene Hart, a sports announcer for the Flyers, received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame for his contributions to hockey broadcasting. In 2013, Jay Greenberg of the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" was awarded the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for his work in hockey journalism.\nPlayers\nBuilders\nRetired numbers.\nThe Flyers have retired six of their jersey numbers and taken others out of circulation. Barry Ashbee's number 4 was retired a few months after his death from leukemia. Bernie Parent's number 1 and Bobby Clarke's number 16 were retired less than a year the players' retirement, while Bill Barber's number 7 and Mark Howe's number 2 were retired shortly after their inductions into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The number 31, last worn by goaltender Pelle Lindbergh, was removed from circulation after Lindbergh's death on November 11, 1985, but it is not officially retired. The NHL retired Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 for all its member teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game. In 2018, the Flyers retired Eric Lindros' number 88.\nFlyers Hall of Fame.\nEstablished in 1988, the Flyers Hall of Fame was designed to \"permanently honor those individuals who have contributed to the franchise's success.\" Candidates for the hall are nominated and voted upon by a panel of media members and team officials.

Both teams entered the league in 1967 with the Flyers finding success in the league early on while the Penguins struggled in the early years. The Flyers record against the Penguins from 1967 to 1989 was 89\u201336\u201319, and most notably during this time the Penguins had a 42-game winless streak at the Spectrum, lasting from 1974 until 1989. The two teams met for the first time in the playoffs in the 1989 division finals, where the Flyers defeated the higher-seeded Penguins in seven games. The teams faced each other again in the 1997 conference quarterfinals, with the Flyers winning the series in five games. Penguins legend Mario Lemieux decided to retire at the end of the series for the first time and left the ice to a standing ovation in Philadelphia after game five. The Flyers would go on to win over the Penguins again in the 2000 conference quarterfinals, most remembered for Keith Primeau scoring the game-winning goal in the fifth overtime period of game four, becoming the third longest playoff game in league history with a total game time of 152 minutes. The Penguins first playoff victory against the Flyers came during the 2008 conference finals, winning the series in five games to advance to the Stanley Cup Final. The two teams would meet again in the playoffs the following year in the 2009 conference quarterfinals, with the Penguins defeating the Flyers in six games. The rivalry would come to a boiling point during the 2012 conference quarterfinals when both teams combined for an NHL record 45 goals in the first four games of a playoff series, as well as accumulating 309 penalty minutes. Game three saw a total combined 158 penalty minutes between the two teams, as well as multiple suspensions. The Flyers went on to win the series in six games. The Penguins defeated the Flyers in the first round of the 2018 playoffs in six games, with the Penguins outscoring the Flyers 28\u201315. The rivalry has been showcased during the NHL Stadium Series outdoor games in 2017 at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh and in 2019 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

In the aftermath of World War I, he became an increasingly dominant figure in Polish politics and exerted significant influence on shaping the country's foreign policy. Pi\u0142sudski is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic, which was re-established in 1918, 123 years after the final partition of Poland in 1795, and was considered \"de facto\" leader (1926\u20131935) of the Second Republic as the Minister of Military Affairs.\nSeeing himself as a descendant of the culture and traditions of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Pi\u0142sudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland\u2014\"a home of nations\" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities to be assimilated as Poles. Early in his political career, Pi\u0142sudski became a leader of the Polish Socialist Party. Believing Poland's independence would be won militarily, he formed the Polish Legions. In 1914, he predicted a new major war would defeat the Russian Empire and the Central Powers. After World War I began in 1914, Pi\u0142sudski's Legions fought alongside Austria-Hungary against Russia. In 1917, with Russia faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers, and was imprisoned in Magdeburg by the Germans.\nPi\u0142sudski was Poland's Chief of State from November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922. From 1919 to 1921 he commanded Polish forces in six wars that re-defined the country's borders. On the verge of defeat in the Polish\u2013Soviet War in August 1920, his forces repelled the invading Soviet Russians at the Battle of Warsaw. In 1923, with a government dominated by his opponents, in particular the National Democrats, Pi\u0142sudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the May Coup and became the strongman of the Sanation government. He focused on military and foreign affairs until his death in 1935, developing a cult of personality that has survived into the 21st century.\nAlthough some aspects of Pi\u0142sudski's administration, such as imprisoning his political opponents at Bereza Kartuska, are controversial, he remains one of the most influential figures in Polish 20th-century history and is widely regarded as a founder of modern Poland.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nPi\u0142sudski was born 5 December 1867 to the Pi\u0142sudski family of nobility at their manor of Zulov (now Zalavas in Lithuania). Pi\u0142sudski personally knew the Lithuanian language and was able to communicate using it, in addition to Polish. The village had been under the rule of the Russian Empire since 1795, having previously been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, itself in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569\u20131795. After World War I, the village was part of the Vilnius Region that was contested between Lithuania and Poland throughout the interwar period. From 1922 until 1939, the village was in the Second Polish Republic. During World War II, the village suffered Soviet and German occupations. The estate was part of the dowry brought by his mother, Maria, a member of the wealthy Billewicz family. The Pi\u0142sudski family, although pauperized, cherished Polish patriotic traditions, and are characterized either as Polish or as Polonized Lithuanians.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[b] J\u00f3zef was the second son born to the family.\nJ\u00f3zef was not an especially diligent student when he attended the Russian Gymnasium in Vilnius. Along with his brothers Bronis\u0142aw, Adam and Jan, J\u00f3zef was introduced by his mother Maria to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Imperial authorities. His father, also named J\u00f3zef, fought in the January 1863 Uprising against Russian rule. The family resented the government's Russification policies. Young J\u00f3zef profoundly disliked having to attend Russian Orthodox Church services and left school with an aversion for the Russian Tsar, its empire, and its culture.\nIn 1885 Pi\u0142sudski started medical studies at Kharkov University where he became involved with \"Narodnaya Volya\", part of the Russian Narodniks revolutionary movement. In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations. He was rejected by the University of Dorpat, whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation. On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with Vilnius socialists to assassinate Tsar Alexander III; Pi\u0142sudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement of his brother Bronis\u0142aw. J\u00f3zef was sentenced to five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka.\nSiberian exile.\nWhile being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Pi\u0142sudski was held for several weeks at a prison in Irkutsk. During his stay, another inmate insulted a guard and refused to apologize; Pi\u0142sudski and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance and Pi\u0142sudski lost two teeth. He took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident. For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment. He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and health problems that would plague him throughout life.\nDuring his exile, Pi\u0142sudski met many \"Sybiraks\", people forcefully exiled to Siberia. He was allowed to work in an occupation of his choosing and tutored local children in mathematics and foreign languages (he knew French, German, Lithuanian and Russian in addition to his native Polish; he would later learn English). Local officials decided that, as a Polish noble, he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by others.\nPolish Socialist Party.\nIn 1892 Pi\u0142sudski returned from exile and settled in Adomavas Manor near Teneniai. In 1893, he joined the Polish Socialist Party (\"PPS\"), and helped organize their Lithuanian branch. Initially, he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible internationalism, he remained a Polish nationalist. In 1894, as its chief editor, he published an underground socialist newspaper called \"Robotnik\" (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers and a typesetter. In 1895, he became a PPS leader, promoting the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology because this combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.\nOn 15 July 1899, while an underground organizer, Pi\u0142sudski married a fellow socialist organizer, Maria Juszkiewiczowa, \"n\u00e9e\" Koplewska. According to his biographer Wac\u0142aw J\u0119drzejewicz, the marriage was less romantic than pragmatic. \"Robotnik\"'s printing press was housed in their apartment first in Vilnius, then in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. A pretext of regular family life made them less suspect. Also, Russian law protected a wife from prosecution for the illegal activities of her husband. The marriage deteriorated when, several years later, Pi\u0142sudski began an affair with a younger socialist, Aleksandra Szczerbi\u0144ska. Maria died in 1921; in October that year, Pi\u0142sudski married Aleksandra. By then, the couple had two daughters, Wanda and Jadwiga.\nIn February 1900 Pi\u0142sudski was imprisoned at the Warsaw Citadel when Russian authorities found \"Robotnik\"'s underground printing press in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. He feigned mental illness in May 1901 and escaped from a mental hospital at Saint Petersburg with the help of a Polish physician, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Mazurkiewicz, and others. He fled to Galicia, then part of Austria-Hungary, and thence to Leytonstone in London, staying with Leon Wasilewski and his family.\nArmed resistance.\nIn the early 1900s, almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland. Pi\u0142sudski's PPS was the only political force prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence to achieve that goal.\nOn the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in the summer of 1904, Pi\u0142sudski traveled to Tokyo, Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with intelligence to support its war with Russia, and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles, conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a \"Promethean\" project directed at breaking up the Russian Empire, a goal that he later continued to pursue. Meeting with Yamagata Aritomo, he suggested that starting a guerrilla war in Poland would distract Russia and asked for Japan to supply him with weapons. Although the Japanese diplomat Hayashi Tadasu supported the plan, the Japanese government, including Yamagata, was more skeptical. Pi\u0142sudski's arch-rival, Roman Dmowski, travelled to Japan and argued against Pi\u0142sudski's plan, discouraging the Japanese government from supporting a Polish revolution because he thought it was doomed to fail. The Japanese offered Pi\u0142sudski much less than he hoped; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and their combat organisation, and the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.\nIn the fall of 1904, Pi\u0142sudski formed a paramilitary unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or \"boj\u00f3wki\") aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw. On 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November, Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military. Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905, the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.\nRussian Revolution of 1905.\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1905, Pi\u0142sudski played a leading role in events in Congress Poland. In early 1905 he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities. In June 1905, Pi\u0142sudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where armed clashes broke out between Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his National Democrats. On 22 December 1905, Pi\u0142sudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.\nPi\u0142sudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the First Duma. The decision, and his resolve to try to win Polish independence through revolution, caused tensions within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured over Pi\u0142sudski's leadership. His faction came to be called the \"Old Faction\" or \"Revolutionary Faction\" (\"\"Starzy\" or \"Frakcja Rewolucyjna\"\"), while their opponents were known as the \"Young Faction\", \"Moderate Faction\" or \"Left\" (\"\"M\u0142odzi\", \"Frakcja Umiarkowana\", \"Lewica\"\"). The \"Young\" sympathized with the Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, and believed priority should be given to co-operation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the Russian Empire and creating a socialist utopia to facilitate negotiations for independence. Pi\u0142sudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia to secure Polish independence. By 1909, his faction was the majority in the PPS, and Pi\u0142sudski remained an important PPS leader until the outbreak of the First World War.\nPrelude to World War I.\nPi\u0142sudski anticipated a coming European war and the need to organize the leadership of a future Polish army. He wanted to secure Poland's independence from the three empires that partitioned Poland out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906, Pi\u0142sudski, with the connivance of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in Krak\u00f3w for the training of paramilitary units. In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, and the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908. The paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports that were leaving Polish territories. On the night of 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train that was carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg. Pi\u0142sudski, who took part in this Bezdany raid near Vilnius, used the funds so obtained to finance his secret military organization. The funds totaled 200,812 rubles which was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire income for the two preceding years.\nIn 1908, Pi\u0142sudski transformed his paramilitary units into a \"Union of Active Struggle\" (\"Zwi\u0105zek Walki Czynnej\", or \"ZWC\"), headed by three of his associates, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, Marian Kukiel and Kazimierz Sosnkowski. The ZWC's main purpose was to train officers and noncommissioned officers for a future Polish Army. In 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian partition of Poland, one in Lw\u00f3w (now Lviv, Ukraine), and one in Krak\u00f3w, to conduct training in military science. With the permission of the Austrian officials, Pi\u0142sudski founded a series of \"sporting clubs\", then the Riflemen's Association, as cover for the training of a Polish military force. In 1912, Pi\u0142sudski (using the pseudonym \"Mieczys\u0142aw\") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (\"Zwi\u0105zek Strzelecki\"). By 1914, they had increased to 12,000 men. In 1914, while giving a lecture in Paris, Pi\u0142sudski declared, \"Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation\", arguing that Polish independence can only be achieved through military struggle against the partitioning powers.\nWorld War I.\nAt a meeting in Paris in 1914, Pi\u0142sudski presciently declared that for Poland to regain independence in the impending war, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires) and the latter powers must in turn be beaten by France, Britain, and the United States.\nAt the outbreak of war, on 3 August in Krak\u00f3w Pi\u0142sudski formed a small cadre military unit called the First Cadre Company from members of the Riflemen's Association and Polish Rifle Squads. That same day, a cavalry unit under W\u0142adys\u0142aw Belina-Pra\u017cmowski was sent on a reconnaissance mission across the Russian border before the official declaration of war between Austria-Hungary and Russia on 6 August 1914.\nPi\u0142sudski's strategy was to send his forces north across the border into Russian Poland into an area the Russian Army had evacuated in the hope of breaking through to Warsaw and sparking a nationwide revolution. Using his limited forces in those early days, he backed his orders with the sanction of a fictitious \"National Government in Warsaw\", and he bent and stretched Austrian orders to the utmost, taking initiatives, moving forward, and establishing Polish institutions in liberated towns, whereas the Austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main Austrian formations. On 12 August 1914 Pi\u0142sudski's forces took the town of Kielce, in Kielce Governorate, but Pi\u0142sudski found the residents less supportive than he had expected.\nOn 27 August 1914 Pi\u0142sudski established the Polish Legions, formed within the Austro-Hungarian Army, and took personal command of their 1st Brigade, which he would lead into several victorious battles. He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight against France or Britain, only Russia.\nPi\u0142sudski decreed that Legions' personnel were to be addressed by the French Revolution-inspired \"Citizen\" (\"Obywatel\"), and he was referred to as \"the Commandant\" (\"Komendant\"). Pi\u0142sudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men, which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legions fought against Russia, at the side of the Central Powers, until 1917.\nIn August 1914 Pi\u0142sudski had set up the Polish Military Organisation (\"Polska Organizacja Wojskowa\"), which served as a precursor of the Polish intelligence services and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.\nIn mid-1916, after the Battle of Kostiuchn\u00f3wka, in which the Polish Legions delayed a Russian offensive at a cost of over 2,000 casualties, Pi\u0142sudski demanded that the Central Powers issue a guarantee of independence for Poland. He supported that demand with his own proffered resignation and that of many of the Legions' officers. On 5 November 1916, the Central Powers proclaimed the independence of Poland, hoping to increase the number of Polish troops that could be sent to the Eastern Front against Russia, thereby relieving German forces to bolster the Western Front.\nPi\u0142sudski agreed to serve in the Regency Kingdom of Poland, created by the Central Powers, and acted as minister of war in the newly formed Polish Regency government; as such, he was responsible for the Polish Armed Forces (1917\u20131918). After the Russian Revolution in early 1917, and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Pi\u0142sudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance by insisting that his men no longer be treated as \"German colonial troops\" and be only used to fight Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side. \nIn the aftermath of the July 1917 \"Oath crisis\", when Pi\u0142sudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear loyalty to Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, he was arrested and imprisoned at Magdeburg. The Polish units were disbanded and the men were incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Army, while the Polish Military Organisation began attacking German targets. Pi\u0142sudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as a leader willing to take on all the partitioning powers.\nOn 8 November 1918, three days before the Armistice, Pi\u0142sudski and his colleague, Colonel Kazimierz Sosnkowski, were released by the Germans from Magdeburg and soon placed on a train bound for the Polish capital, Warsaw \u2013 the collapsing Germans hoping that Pi\u0142sudski would create a force friendly to them.\nRebuilding Poland.\nHead of state.\nOn 11 November 1918, Pi\u0142sudski was appointed Commander-in-Chief of Polish forces by the Regency Council and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country. Later that day, which would become Poland's Independence Day, he proclaimed an independent Polish state. That week, Pi\u0142sudski negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from \"Ober Ost\". Over 55,000 Germans peacefully departed Poland, leaving their weapons to the Poles. In the coming months, over 400,000 in total departed over Polish territories.\nOn November 14, Pi\u0142sudski was asked to supervise provisionally the running of the country. On November 22, he officially received, from the new government of J\u0119drzej Moraczewski, the title of Provisional Chief of State (\"Tymczasowy Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa\") of renascent Poland. Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the Regency Council in Warsaw; Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski's government in Lublin; and the Polish Liquidation Committee in Krak\u00f3w) supported Pi\u0142sudski. He established a coalition government that was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the eight-hour day, free school education and women's suffrage, to avoid major unrest. As head of state, Pi\u0142sudski believed he must remain separated from partisan politics.\nThe day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from his time working with the underground resistance, who addressed him socialist-style as \"Comrade\" (\"Towarzysz\") and asked for his support for their revolutionary policies. He refused it and supposedly answered: \"Comrades, I took the red tram of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as 'Mister' [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!\"However, the authenticity of this quote is disputed. Pi\u0142sudski declined to support any party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government.\nFirst policies.\nPi\u0142sudski set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian, and Austrian armies. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%. A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: \"I have nowhere seen anything like the evidence of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn.\" In addition, the country had to unify the disparate systems of law, economics, and administration in the former German, Austrian, and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five currencies, and 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), each needing to be consolidated.\nBiographer Wac\u0142aw J\u0119drzejewicz described Pi\u0142sudski as very deliberate in his decision-making: Pi\u0142sudski collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision. He held long working hours, and maintained a simple lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant. Though he was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work) and as a man who distrusted almost everyone led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.\nPi\u0142sudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because he had co-operated with the Central Powers from 1914 to 1917 and because the governments of Daszy\u0144ski and Moraczewski were primarily socialist. It was not until January 1919, when pianist and composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski became Prime Minister of Poland and foreign minister of a new government, that Poland was recognized in the West. Two separate governments were claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Pi\u0142sudski's in Warsaw and Dmowski's in Paris. To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Pi\u0142sudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Pi\u0142sudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief, while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the Paris Peace Conference. Articles 87\u201393 of the Treaty of Versailles and the Little Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.\nPi\u0142sudski often clashed with Dmowski for viewing the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and attempting to send the Blue Army to Poland through Danzig, Germany (now Gda\u0144sk, Poland). On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters (Marian Januszajtis-\u017begota and Eustachy Sapieha) attempted a coup against Pi\u0142sudski but failed. On 20 February 1919, Polish parliament (the Sejm) confirmed his office when it passed the Small Constitution of 1919, although Pi\u0142sudski proclaimed his intention to eventually relinquish his powers to the parliament. \"Provisional\" was struck from his title, and Pi\u0142sudski held the office of the Chief of State until 9 December 1922, after Gabriel Narutowicz was elected as the first president of Poland.\nPi\u0142sudski's major foreign policy initiative was a proposed federation (to be called \"Mi\u0119dzymorze\" (Polish for \"Between-Seas\"), and known from the Latin as \"Intermarium\", stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. In addition to Poland and Lithuania, it was to consist of Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia and Estonia, somewhat in emulation of the pre-partition Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Pi\u0142sudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states, which refused to relinquish their independence, as well as the Allied powers, who thought it to be too bold a change to the existing balance of power structure. According to historian George Sanford, it was around 1920 that Pi\u0142sudski came to realize the infeasibility of that version of his Intermarium project. Instead of a Central and Eastern European alliance, there soon appeared a series of border conflicts, including the Polish\u2013Ukrainian War (1918\u201319), the Polish\u2013Lithuanian War (1919\u20131920, culminating in \u017beligowski's Mutiny), Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts (beginning in 1918), and most notably the Polish\u2013Soviet War (1919\u201321). Winston Churchill commented, \"The war of giants has ended; the wars of the pygmies have begun.\"\nPolish\u2013Soviet War.\nIn the aftermath of World War I, there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Pi\u0142sudski said: \"All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente\u2014on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany.\" The situation was different in the east, of which Pi\u0142sudski said that \"there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far.\" In the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish\u2013Ukrainian War, and Pi\u0142sudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the Polish struggle in Lviv.\nPi\u0142sudski was aware that the Bolsheviks would not ally with an independent Poland and predicted that war with them was inevitable. He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but he also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their White opponents. The \"White Russians\", representatives of the old Russian Empire, were willing to accept limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former Congress Poland. They objected to Polish control of Ukraine, which was crucial for Pi\u0142sudski's Intermarium project. This contrasted with the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Pi\u0142sudski speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Lenin's struggling Bolshevik government, Pi\u0142sudski probably saved it in the summer and the fall of 1919.\n \nAfter the Soviet westward offensive of 1918\u20131919, and a series of escalating battles that resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on 21 April 1920, Marshal Pi\u0142sudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance called the Treaty of Warsaw with Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura. The treaty allowed both countries to conduct joint operations against Soviet Russia. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian Treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine and independent Poland in alliance, resembling that once existing within Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Polish and Ukrainian Armies under Pi\u0142sudski's command launched a successful offensive against the Russian forces in Ukraine and on 7 May 1920, with remarkably little fighting, they captured Kiev.\nThe Bolshevik leadership framed the Polish actions as an invasion, successfully generating popular support for their cause at home. The Soviets then launched a counter-offensive from Belarus, and counterattacked in Ukraine, advancing into Poland in a drive toward Germany to encourage the Communist Party of Germany in their struggles for power. The Soviets announced their plans to invade Western Europe; Soviet Communist theoretician Nikolai Bukharin, writing in \"Pravda\", hoped for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw \"straight to London and Paris\". Soviet commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky's order of the day for 2 July 1920 read: \"To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March upon Vilnius, Minsk, Warsaw!\" and \"onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!\"\nOn 1 July 1920, in view of the rapidly advancing Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the Sejm, formed a Council of National Defense, chaired by Pi\u0142sudski, to provide expeditious decision-making as a temporary supplanting of the fractious Sejm. The National Democrats contended that the string of Bolshevik victories had been Pi\u0142sudski's fault and demanded that he resign; some even accused him of treason. On July 19, they failed to carry a vote of no confidence in the council and this led to Dmowski's withdrawal from the council. On August 12, Pi\u0142sudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, offering to be the scapegoat if the military solution failed, but Witos refused to accept his resignation. The Entente pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Pi\u0142sudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.\n\"Miracle at the Vistula\".\nPi\u0142sudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the Vistula River and to defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and on the Wieprz River while some 25% of the available divisions concentrated to the south for a counteroffensive. Afterwards, two armies under General J\u00f3zef Haller, facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, were to hold their entrenched positions while an army under General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelop the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role of the plan was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled \"Reserve Army\" (also known as the \"Strike Group\", \"Grupa Uderzeniowa\"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units that were commanded by Pi\u0142sudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot that had been identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern Fronts. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the \"Strike Group\" would close near the East Prussian border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.\nPi\u0142sudski's plan was criticized as \"amateurish\" by high-ranking army officers and military experts, quick to point out Pi\u0142sudski's lack of formal military education. However, the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to support it. When a copy of the plan was acquired by the Soviets, Western Front commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky thought it was a ruse and disregarded it. Days later, the Soviets were defeated in the Battle of Warsaw, halting the Soviet advance in one of the worst defeats for the Red Army. Stanis\u0142aw Stro\u0144ski, a National Democrat Sejm deputy, coined the phrase \"Miracle at the Vistula\" (\"Cud nad Wis\u0142\u0105\") to express his disapproval of Pi\u0142sudski's \"Ukrainian adventure\". Stro\u0144ski's phrase was adopted as praise for Pi\u0142sudski by some patriotically- or piously minded Poles, who were unaware of Stro\u0144ski's ironic intent.\nWhile Pi\u0142sudski had a major role in crafting the war strategy, he was aided by others, notably Tadeusz Rozwadowski. Later, some supporters of Pi\u0142sudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, while his opponents would try to minimize his role. On the other hand, in the West, the role of General Maxime Weygand of the French Military Mission to Poland was, for a time, exaggerated.\nIn February 1921, Pi\u0142sudski visited Paris, where, in negotiations with French President Alexandre Millerand, he laid the foundations for the Franco\u2013Polish alliance, which would be signed later that year. The Treaty of Riga, ending the Polish-Soviet War in March 1921, partitioned Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and Russia. Pi\u0142sudski called the treaty an \"act of cowardice\". The treaty and his secret approval of General Lucjan \u017beligowski's capture of Vilnius from the Lithuanians marked an end to this incarnation of Pi\u0142sudski's federalist Intermarium plan. After Vilnius was occupied by the \u017beligowski's Polish troops, Pi\u0142sudski said that he \"could not help but regard them [Lithuanians] as brothers\". In parliament, Pi\u0142sudski once said: \"I cannot not reach out to Kaunas. .. I cannot disregard those brothers who consider the day of our triumph a day of shock and mourning.\" On 25 September 1921, when Pi\u0142sudski visited Lw\u00f3w (now Lviv) for the opening of the first Eastern Trade Fair (\"Targi Wschodnie\"), he was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by Stepan Fedak, acting on behalf of Ukrainian-independence organizations, including the Ukrainian Military Organization.\nRetirement and coup.\nThe Polish 1921 March Constitution severely limited the powers of the presidency intentionally, to prevent Pi\u0142sudski from waging war. This caused Pi\u0142sudski to decline to run for the office. In the run-up to the first presidential election, a parliamentary election was held, in which Pi\u0142sudski endorsed two lists: the National-State Union, and the PZK, neither of which secured any seats in the Sejm. On 9 December 1922, the Polish National Assembly elected Gabriel Narutowicz of Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"; his election, opposed by the right-wing parties, caused public unrest. On 14 December at the Belweder Palace, Pi\u0142sudski officially transferred his powers as Chief of State to his friend Narutowicz; the \"Naczelnik\" was replaced by the President.\nTwo days later, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead by a right-wing painter and art critic, Eligiusz Niewiadomski, who had originally wanted to kill Pi\u0142sudski but had changed his target, influenced by National Democrat anti-Narutowicz propaganda. For Pi\u0142sudski, that was a major shock; he started to doubt that Poland could function as a democracy and supported a government led by a strong leader. He became Chief of the General Staff and, together with Minister of Military Affairs W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, quelled the unrest by instituting a state of emergency.\nStanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski of Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (PSL Piast), another of Pi\u0142sudski's old colleagues, was elected the new president, and Wincenty Witos, also of PSL Piast, became prime minister. The new government, an alliance among the centrist PSL Piast, the right-wing Popular National Union and Christian Democrat parties, contained right-wing enemies of Pi\u0142sudski. He held them responsible for Narutowicz's death and declared that it was impossible to work with them. On 30 May 1923, Pi\u0142sudski resigned as Chief of the General Staff.\nPi\u0142sudski criticized General Stanis\u0142aw Szeptycki's proposal that the military should be supervised by civilians as an attempt to politicize the army, and on 28 June, he resigned his last political appointment. The same day, the Sejm's left-wing deputies voted for a resolution, thanking him for his work. Pi\u0142sudski went into retirement in Sulej\u00f3wek, outside Warsaw, at his country manor, \"Milusin\", presented to him by his former soldiers. There, he wrote a series of political and military memoirs, including \"Rok 1920\" (The Year 1920).\nMeanwhile, Poland's economy was a shambles. Hyperinflation fueled public unrest, and the government was unable to find a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis. Pi\u0142sudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centred on former members of the Polish Legions, the Polish Military Organisation and some left-wing and intelligentsia parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Pi\u0142sudski became more and more critical of the government and eventually issued statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet. When the Chjeno-Piast coalition, which Pi\u0142sudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government, on 12\u201314 May 1926, Pi\u0142sudski returned to power in the May Coup, supported by the Polish Socialist Party, Liberation, the Peasant Party, and the Communist Party of Poland. Pi\u0142sudski had hoped for a bloodless coup but the government had refused to surrender; 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.\nIn government.\nOn 31 May 1926, the Sejm elected Pi\u0142sudski president of the Republic, but Pi\u0142sudski refused the office due to the presidency's limited powers. Another of his old friends, Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki, was elected in his stead. Mo\u015bcicki then appointed Pi\u0142sudski as Minister of Military Affairs (defence minister), a post he held for the rest of his life through eleven successive governments, two of which he headed from 1926 to 1928 and for a brief period in 1930. He also served as General Inspector of the Armed Forces and Chairman of the War Council.\nPi\u0142sudski had no plans for major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters and declared that his coup was to be a \"revolution without revolutionary consequences\". His goals were to stabilize the country, reduce the influence of political parties (which he blamed for corruption and inefficiency) and strengthen the army. His role in the Polish government over the subsequent years has been called a dictatorship or a \"quasi-dictatorship\".\nInternal politics.\nPi\u0142sudski's coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government, as his Sanation government (1926\u20131939), at times employing authoritarian methods, sought to curb perceived corruption and incompetence of the parliament rule, and in Pi\u0142sudski's words, restore \"moral health\" to public life (hence the name of his faction, \"Sanation\", which could be understood as \"moral purification\"). From 1928, the Sanation government was represented by the \"Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government\" (BBWR). Popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed Pi\u0142sudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled either by the president, who was appointed by Pi\u0142sudski, or by the Sejm. The Sejm's powers were curtailed by constitutional amendments that were introduced soon after the coup, on 2 August 1926. From 1926 to 1930, Pi\u0142sudski relied chiefly on propaganda to weaken the influence of opposition leaders.\nThe culmination of his dictatorial and supralegal policies came in the 1930s, with the imprisonment and trial of political opponents (the Brest trials) on the eve of the 1930 Polish parliamentary election and with the 1934 establishment of the Bereza Kartuska Prison for political prisoners in present-day Byaroza, where some prisoners were brutally mistreated. After the BBWR's 1930 victory, Pi\u0142sudski allowed most internal matters to be decided by his colonels while he concentrated on military and foreign affairs. His treatment of political opponents and their 1930 arrest and imprisonment was internationally condemned and the events damaged Poland's reputation.\nPi\u0142sudski became increasingly disillusioned with democracy in Poland. His intemperate public utterances (he called the Sejm a \"prostitute\") and his sending of 90 armed officers into the Sejm building in response to an impending vote of no-confidence caused concern in contemporary and modern observers who have seen his actions as setting precedents for authoritarian responses to political challenges. He sought to transform the parliamentary system into a presidential system; however, he opposed the introduction of totalitarianism. The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935 was tailored by Pi\u0142sudski's supporters to his specifications, providing for a strong presidency; but the April Constitution served Poland until World War II, and carried its government-in-exile until the end of the war and beyond. Pi\u0142sudski's government depended more on his charismatic authority than on rational-legal authority. None of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death the Sanation structure would quickly fracture, returning Poland to the pre-Pi\u0142sudski era of parliamentary political contention.\nPi\u0142sudski's government began a period of national stabilization and of improvement in the situation of ethnic minorities, which formed about a third of the Second Republic's population. Pi\u0142sudski replaced the National Democrats' \"ethnic-assimilation\" (i.e. Polonization) with a \"state-assimilation\" policy: citizens were judged not by their ethnicity but by their loyalty to the state. Widely recognized for his opposition to the National Democrats' anti-Semitic policies, he extended his policy of \"state-assimilation\" to Polish Jews. The years 1926 to 1935 and Pi\u0142sudski himself were favorably viewed by many Polish Jews whose situation improved especially under Pi\u0142sudski-appointed Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel. Many Jews saw Pi\u0142sudski as their only hope for restraining antisemitic currents in Poland and for maintaining public order; he was seen as a guarantor of stability and a friend of the Jewish people, who voted for him and actively participated in his political bloc. Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935 brought a deterioration in the quality of life of Poland's Jews.\nDuring the 1930s, a combination of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of \"OUN\" terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in the largely-Ukrainian eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose between the government and Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures, but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the Depression. By the end of Pi\u0142sudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.\nIn the military sphere, Pi\u0142sudski was praised for his plan at the Battle of Warsaw in 1920, but was criticized for subsequently concentrating on personnel management and neglecting modernization of military strategy and equipment. According to his detractors, his experiences in World War I and the Polish-Soviet War led him to over-estimate the importance of cavalry, and to neglect the development of armor and air forces. His supporters, on the other hand, contend that, particularly from the late 1920s, he supported the development of these military branches. Modern historians concluded that the limitations on Poland's military modernization in this period was less doctrinal than financial.\nForeign policy.\nPi\u0142sudski sought to maintain his country's independence in the international arena. Assisted by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Foreign Minister J\u00f3zef Beck, he sought support for Poland in alliances with western powers, such as France and Britain, and with friendly neighbors such as Romania and Hungary. A supporter of the Franco\u2013Polish Military Alliance and the Polish\u2013Romanian alliance, part of the Little Entente, Pi\u0142sudski was disappointed by the policy of appeasement pursued by the French and British governments, evident in their signing of the Locarno Treaties. The Locarno treaties were intended by the British government to ensure a peaceful handover of the territories claimed by Germany such as the Sudetenland, the Polish Corridor, and the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda\u0144sk, Poland) by improving Franco-German relations to such extent that France would dissolve its alliances in eastern Europe. Pi\u0142sudski aimed to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and Germany, and relations with Germany and the Soviet Union during Pi\u0142sudski's tenure could, for the most part, be described as neutral. Under Pi\u0142sudski, Poland maintained good relations with neighboring Romania, Hungary and Latvia, but were strained with Czechoslovakia, whereas there were no diplomatic relations with Lithuania, which had broken them off in 1920 due to the Polish occupation of Vilnius.\nA recurring fear of Pi\u0142sudski was that France would reach an agreement with Germany at the expense of Poland. In 1929, the French agreed to pull out of the Rhineland in 1930, five years earlier than the Treaty of Versailles specified. The same year, the French announced plans for the Maginot Line along the border with Germany, and construction of the Maginot line began in 1930. The Maginot line was a tacit French admission that Germany would be rearming beyond the limits set by the Treaty of Versailles in the near-future and that France intended to pursue a defensive strategy. At the time Poland signed the alliance with France in 1921, the French were occupying the Rhineland and Polish plans for a possible war with \"Reich\" were based on the assumption of a French offensive into the north German plain from their bases in the Rhineland. The French pullout from the Rhineland and a shift to a defensive strategy as epitomized by the Maginot line completely upset the entire basis of Polish foreign and defense policy.\nIn June 1932, just before the Lausanne Conference opened, Pi\u0142sudski heard reports that the new German chancellor Franz von Papen was about to make an offer for a Franco\u2013German alliance to the French Premier \u00c9douard Herriot which would be at the expense of Poland. In response, Pi\u0142sudski sent the destroyer ORP \"Wicher\" into the harbour of Danzig. Though the issue was ostensibly about access rights for the Polish Navy in Danzig, the real purpose of sending \"Wircher\" was as a way to warn Herriot not to disadvantage Poland in a deal with Papen. The ensuring Danzig crisis sent the desired message to the French and improved the Polish Navy's access rights to Danzig.\nPoland signed the Soviet\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact in 1932. The Soviet\u2013Polish Pact was considered at the time to be a major success of Polish diplomacy, which had been greatly weakened by the trade war with Germany, the renouncement of parts of the Treaty of Versailles and the loosened ties with France after it agreed to the Locarno Treaties. Critics of the pact stated that it allowed Stalin to eliminate his socialist opponents, primarily in Ukraine. The pacts were supported by advocates of Pi\u0142sudski's Promethean programme. After Adolf Hitler rise to power in Germany in January 1933, Pi\u0142sudski is rumored to have proposed to France a preventive war against Germany. Lack of French enthusiasm may have been a reason for Poland signing the German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact in 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced. Critics of Poland's pact with Germany accused Pi\u0142sudski of underestimating Hitler's aggressiveness, and giving Germany time to re-arm. Hitler repeatedly suggested a German\u2013Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Pi\u0142sudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for a potential war with either Germany or the Soviet Union. Just before his death, Pi\u0142sudski told J\u00f3zef Beck that it must be Poland's policy to maintain neutral relations with Germany, keep up the Polish alliance with France and improve relations with the United Kingdom. The two non-aggression pacts were intended to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors. Pi\u0142sudski was probably aware of the weakness of the pacts, stating: \"Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools. This cannot last long. We have to know from which stool we will tumble first, and when that will be\".\nEconomic policy.\nDespite coming from a socialist background and initially implementing socialist reforms, Pi\u0142sudski's government followed the conservative free-market economic tradition of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth throughout its existence. Poland had one of the lowest taxation rates in Europe, with 9.3% of taxes as a distribution of national income. Pi\u0142sudski's government was also heavily dependent on foreign investments and economies, with 45.4% of Polish equity capital controlled by foreign corporations. After the Great Depression, the Polish economy crumbled and failed to recover until Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki's government introduced economic reforms with more government interventions with an increase in tax revenues and public spending after Pi\u0142sudski's death. These interventionist policies saw Poland's economy recover from the recession until the USSR and the German invasion of Poland in 1939.\nReligious views.\nPi\u0142sudski's religious views are a matter of debate. He was baptised Roman Catholic on 15 December 1867 in the St. Casimir Church in Pavover\u0117 (then \u0160ven\u010dionys deanery). His godparents were Joseph and Constance Martsinkovsky Ragalskaya. On 15 July 1899, at the village of Papro\u0107 Du\u017ca, near \u0141om\u017ca, he married Maria Juskiewicz, a divorc\u00e9e. As the Catholic Church did not recognise divorces, she and Pi\u0142sudski had converted to Protestantism. Pilsudski later returned to the Catholic Church to marry Aleksandra Szczerbi\u0144ska. Pi\u0142sudski and Aleksandra could not get married as Pi\u0142sudski's wife Maria refused to divorce him. It was only after Maria's death in 1921 that they were married, on 25 October that year.\nDeath.\nBy 1935, unbeknown to the public, Pi\u0142sudski had for several years been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of liver cancer at Warsaw's Belweder Palace. The celebration of his life began spontaneously within half an hour of the announcement of his death. It was led by military personnel \u2013 former Legionnaires, members of the Polish Military Organisation, veterans of the wars of 1919\u201321 \u2013 and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State, and later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.\nThe Communist Party of Poland immediately smeared Pi\u0142sudski as a \"fascist and capitalist\", Other opponents of the Sanation government were more civil; socialists (such as Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski and Tomasz Arciszewski) and Christian Democrats (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions. Wincenty Witos voiced criticism of Pi\u0142sudski. In contrast, Maciej Rataj and Stanis\u0142aw Thugutt were supportive, while Roman Dmowski's National Democrats expressed a toned-down criticism.\nCondolences were officially expressed by senior clergy, including Pope Pius XI and Cardinal August Hlond, Primate of Poland. The Pope called himself a \"personal friend\" of Pi\u0142sudski. Notable appreciation for Pi\u0142sudski was expressed by Poland's ethnic and religious minorities. Eastern Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, and Islamic organizations expressed condolences, praising Pi\u0142sudski for his policies of religious tolerance. His death was a shock to members of the Jewish minority amongst which he was respected for his lack of prejudice and vocal opposition to the Endecja. Mainstream organizations of ethnic minorities similarly expressed their support for his policies of ethnic tolerance, though he was still criticized by Ukrainian, German, Lithuanian activists and Jewish supporters of the General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland.\nOn the international scene, Pope Pius XI held a special ceremony on 18 May in the Holy See, a commemoration was conducted at League of Nations Geneva headquarters, and dozens of messages of condolence arrived in Poland from heads of state across the world, including Germany's Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, Italy's Benito Mussolini and King Victor Emmanuel III, France's Albert Lebrun and Pierre-\u00c9tienne Flandin, Austria's Wilhelm Miklas, Japan's Emperor Hirohito, and Britain's King George V. In Berlin, a service for Pi\u0142sudski was ordered by Adolf Hitler. This was the only time that Hitler attended a Holy Mass as a leader of the Third Reich and probably one of the last times when he was in a church.\nFuneral.\nState funeral ceremonies for Pi\u0142sudski was held in Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w between 15 and 18 May 1935, including official masses and funeral processions in both cities. A funeral train toured Poland before the remains of Pi\u0142sudski were laid to rest at the Wawel Castle. A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks were also released to commemorate the event. The nationwide ceremonies were accompanied by extensive media coverage and reflected the personality cult of Pi\u0142sudski. The final funeral procession in Krakow on 18 May, with an estimated 300,000 participants and official representatives from 16 foreign states, constituted the largest public funeral in Poland's history. Separate funeral ceremonies were held for the burial of his brain, which Pi\u0142sudski had willed for study to Stefan Batory University, and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at Vilnius's Rasos Cemetery.\nIn 1937, after a two-year display at St. Leonard's Crypt in Krak\u00f3w's Wawel Cathedral, Pi\u0142sudski's remains were transferred to the cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells. The decision, made by his long-standing adversary Adam Sapieha, then Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, incited widespread protests that included calls for Sapieha's removal, setting off a series of clashes between the representatives of the Polish Catholic Church and the Polish government in what has come to be known as the \"Wawel conflict\" (\"konflikt wawelski\"). Despite heavy and protracted criticism, Sapieha never allowed Pi\u0142sudski's coffin to be transferred back to St. Leonard's Crypt.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nOn 13 May 1935, in accordance with Pi\u0142sudski's last wishes, Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y was named by Poland's president and government to be Inspector General of the Polish Armed Forces, and on 10 November 1936, he was elevated to Marshal of Poland. As the Polish government became increasingly authoritarian and conservative, the Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y faction was opposed by the more moderate Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki, who remained President. Although Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y reconciled with the President in 1938, the ruling group remained divided into the \"President's Men\", mostly civilians (the \"Castle Group\", after the President's official residence, Warsaw's Royal Castle), and the \"Marshal's Men\" (\"Pi\u0142sudski's colonels\"), professional military officers and Pi\u0142sudski's old comrades-in-arms. Some of this political division would continue in the Polish government-in-exile after the German invasion of Poland in 1939.\nAfter World War II, little of Pi\u0142sudski's political ideology influenced the policies of the Polish People's Republic, a \"de facto\" satellite of the Soviet Union. For a decade after World War II, Pi\u0142sudski was either ignored or condemned by Poland's Communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change after de-Stalinization and the Polish October in 1956, and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Pi\u0142sudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment. After the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, Pi\u0142sudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a Polish national hero. On the sixtieth anniversary of his death on 12 May 1995, Poland's Sejm adopted a resolution: \"J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski served his country well and has entered our history forever.\" Pi\u0142sudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.\nSeveral military units have been named for Pi\u0142sudski, including the 1st Legions Infantry Division, armoured train No. 51 (\"I Marsza\u0142ek\"\u2014\"the First Marshal\"), and the Romanian 634th Infantry Battalion. Also named for Pi\u0142sudski have been Pi\u0142sudski's Mound, one of four-man-made mounds in Krak\u00f3w; the J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski Institute of America, a New York City research center and museum on the modern history of Poland; the J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw; a passenger ship, ; a gunboat, ; and a racehorse, \"Pilsudski\". Many Polish cities . There are statues of Pi\u0142sudski in many Polish cities; Warsaw, which has three in little more than a mile between the Belweder Palace, Pi\u0142sudski's residence, and Pi\u0142sudski Square. In 2020, Pi\u0142sudski's manor house in Sulej\u00f3wek opened as a museum as part of the celebrations of the one hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Warsaw.\nPi\u0142sudski has been a character in numerous works of fiction, a trend already visible during his lifetime, including the 1922 novel \"Genera\u0142 Barcz\" (General Barcz) by Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski. Later works in which he is featured include the 2007 novel \"Ice\" (\"L\u00f3d\") by Jacek Dukaj. Poland's National Library lists over 500 publications related to Pi\u0142sudski; the U.S. Library of Congress, over 300. Pi\u0142sudski's life was the subject of a 2001 Polish television documentary, \"Marsza\u0142ek Pi\u0142sudski\", directed by Andrzej Trzos-Rastawiecki. He was also the subject of paintings by artists such as Jacek Malczewski (1916) and Wojciech Kossak (leaning on his sword, 1928; and astride his horse, \"Kasztanka\", 1928), as well as photos and caricatures. He has been reported to be quite fond of the latter.\nDescendants.\nBoth daughters of Marshal Pi\u0142sudski returned to Poland in 1990, after the Revolutions of 1989 and the fall of the Communist system. Jadwiga Pi\u0142sudska's daughter Joanna Jaraczewska returned to Poland in 1979. She married a Polish Solidarity activist Janusz Onyszkiewicz in a political prison in 1983. Both were very involved in the Solidarity movement between 1979 and 1989.\nHonours.\nPi\u0142sudski was awarded numerous military honours, domestic and foreign. The government of Poland has issued many postage stamps in Pilsudski's honor\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\na. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ J\u00f3zef Klemens Pi\u0142sudski was commonly referred to without his middle name, as \"J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski\". A few English sources translate his first name as \"Joseph\", but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including \"\"Wiktor\", \"Mieczys\u0142aw\" and \"Ziuk\" (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called \"Dziadek\"\" (\"Grandpa\" or \"the Old Man\") and \"Marsza\u0142ek\" (\"the Marshal\"). His ex-soldiers from the Legions also referred to him as \"Komendant\" (\"the Commandant\").\nb. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Pi\u0142sudski sometimes spoke of being a Lithuanian of Polish culture. For several centuries, declaring both Lithuanian and Polish identity was commonplace, but around the turn of the last century it became much rarer in the wake of arising modern nationalisms. Timothy Snyder, who calls him a \"Polish-Lithuanian\", notes that Pi\u0142sudski did not think in terms of 20th-century nationalisms and ethnicities; he considered himself \"both\" a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nc. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Polish Socialist Party \u2013 Revolutionary Faction from 1906 to 1909\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"This is only a small selection.

As the largest financial centre in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City has the largest gross regional domestic product out of all Vietnam provinces and municipalities, contributing around a quarter of the country's total GDP. Ho Chi Minh City's metropolitan area is ASEAN's 5th largest economy, also the biggest outside an ASEAN country capital.\nThe area was initially part of Cambodian states until it became part of the Vietnamese Nguy\u1ec5n lords in 1698, due to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's expansionist policy of \"Nam ti\u1ebfn\". It was capital of the Nguy\u1ec5n lords at the end of their existence before the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty was formed. After the fall of the Citadel of Saigon, it became the capital of French Cochinchina from 1862 to 1949. It was also the capital of French Indochina from 1887 to 1902, and again from 1945 until its cessation in 1954. After France recognized Vietnam's independence and unity, it was the capital of the State of Vietnam from 1949 to 1955. Following the 1954 partition, it became the capital of South Vietnam until it was captured by North Vietnam, leading to a unified communist state in 1976. The city was subsequently renamed after the late leader Ho Chi Minh, though \"Saigon\" remains widely used informally and has been the official name of the city's administrative center since 2025. Beginning in the 1990s, the city underwent rapid expansion and modernization, which contributed to Vietnam's post-war economic recovery and helped revive its international trade hub status.\nHo Chi Minh City has a long tradition of being one of the centers of economy, entertainment and education in Southern Vietnam in particular and Vietnam in general. It is also the busiest international transport hub in Vietnam, with T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t International Airport accounting for nearly half of all international arrivals to Vietnam, and the Port of Saigon among the busiest container ports in Southeast Asia. The city is also a tourist attraction; some of its historic landmarks with modern landmarks, including the Independence Palace, Bitexco Financial Tower, Landmark 81 Tower, the War Remnants Museum, and B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh Market. It is also known for its narrow walkable alleys and bustling nightlife, most notably the Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o Ward and its B\u00f9i Vi\u1ec7n street.\nIn 2025, the B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u provinces were merged into Ho Chi Minh City, making it a megacity while inheriting the major industrial towns and coastal cities of the two former provinces. Currently, Ho Chi Minh City is facing increasing threats of sea level rise and flooding as well as heavy strains on public infrastructures.\nEtymology.\nThe first known human habitation in the area was either a Cham settlement called Baigaur, or a Cambodian city named Prey Nokor, which was a small fishing village. Over time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh (\u5609\u5b9a) in 1698, a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name , francized as , although the city was still indicated as on Vietnamese maps written in ch\u1eef H\u00e1n until at least 1891. An old name of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh was , which was later commonly glossed as .\nThe current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after reunification in 1976 to honour Ho Chi Minh.\nEven today, however, the informal name of remains in daily speech. However, there is a technical difference between the two terms: is commonly used to refer to the city centre in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while \"Ho Chi Minh City\" refers to all of its urban and rural districts.\nSaigon.\nThe original toponym behind S\u00e0i G\u00f2n was attested earliest as , with two phonograms whose Sino-Vietnamese readings are s\u00e0i and c\u00f4n respectively, in L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n's \"Miscellaneous Chronicles of the Pacified Frontier\" (, c. 1776), wherein L\u00ea relates that, in 1674, Cambodian prince Ang Nan was installed as uparaja in (S\u00e0i G\u00f2n) by Vietnamese forces.\n also appears later in Tr\u1ecbnh Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c's \"Comprehensive Records about the Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Citadel\" (, , c. 1820), \"Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country\" (, , 1908), etc.\nAdrien Launay's (1688\u20131823), \"Documents Historiques II: 1728 \u2013 1771\" (1924: https://) cites 1747 documents containing the toponyms: provincia Rai-gon, Rai-gon thong (for *S\u00e0i G\u00f2n th\u01b0\u1ee3ng \"Upper Saigon\"), &amp; Rai-gon-ha (for *S\u00e0i G\u00f2n h\u1ea1 \"Lower Saigon\").\nIt is probably a transcription of Khmer (Prey Nok\u00f4r), or Khmer (Prey K\u00f4r).\nThe proposal that S\u00e0i G\u00f2n is from non-Sino-Vietnamese reading of Chinese (\"embankment\", , SV: \u0111\u00ea ng\u1ea1n), the Cantonese name of Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, (e.g. by V\u01b0\u01a1ng H\u1ed3ng S\u1ec3n) has been critiqued as folk-etymological, as: (1) the Vietnamese source Ph\u1ee7 bi\u00ean t\u1ea1p l\u1ee5c (albeit written in literary Chinese) was the earliest extant one containing the local toponym's transcription; (2) has variant form , thus suggesting that both were transcriptions of a local toponym and thus are cognates to, not originals of, S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. Saigon is unlikely to be from since in \"Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country\", it also lists Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn as separate from S\u00e0i G\u00f2n.\nHo Chi Minh City.\nThe current official name, ', was first proposed by the Viet Minh in August 1946 and was later officially adopted in July 1976. It is abbreviated as TP.HCM, and translated in English as \"Ho Chi Minh City\", abbreviated as HCMC, and in French as ' (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated as HCMV.\nThe name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (, &lt;templatestyles src=\"vi-nom/fonts.css\" /&gt;\u80e1) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese, \u5fd7 \u660e; meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\".\nNowadays, \"Saigon\" is still used as a semi-official name for the city, in some cases being used interchangeably with Ho Chi Minh City, partly due to its long history and familiarity.\nHistory.\nEarly settlement.\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Ph\u1ee5ng S\u01a1n Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa. Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor after conquest by the Khmer Empire around 1145, Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest.\nThe first Vietnamese people crossed the sea to explore this land completely without the organisation of the Nguy\u1ec5n Lords. Thanks to the marriage between\u00a0Princess Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Ng\u1ecdc V\u1ea1n \u2013 daughter of Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean \u2013 and the King of Cambodia\u00a0Chey Chettha II in 1620, the relationship between Vietnam\u00a0and Cambodia became smooth, and the people of the two countries could freely move back and forth. In exchange, Chey Chettha II gifted Prei Nokor to the Nguy\u1ec5n lords. Vietnamese settlers began to migrate to the area of Saigon,\u00a0\u0110\u1ed3ng Nai. Before that, the Funanese,\u00a0Khmer, and Cham had lived there, scattered from time immemorial.\nThe period from 1623 to 1698 is considered the period of the formation of later Saigon. In 1623, Lord Nguyen sent a mission to ask his son-in-law, King Chey Chettha II, to set up tax collection stations in Prey Nokor (S\u00e0i G\u00f2n) and Kas Krobei (B\u1ebfn Ngh\u00e9). Although this was a deserted jungle area, it was located on the traffic routes between Vietnam,\u00a0Cambodia,\u00a0and\u00a0Siam. The next two important events of this period were the establishment of the barracks and residence of Vice King Ang Non and the establishment of a palace at T\u00e2n M\u1ef9 (near the present-day\u00a0C\u1ed1ng Qu\u1ef3nh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i\u00a0crossroads). It can be said that Saigon was formed from these three government agencies.\nNguy\u1ec5n dynasty rule.\nIn 1679, Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac T\u1ea7n allowed a group of Chinese refugees from the Qing dynasty to settle in M\u1ef9 Tho, Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and Saigon to seek refuge. In 1698, Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers of Hu\u1ebf by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. King Chey Chettha IV of Cambodia tried to stop the Vietnamese but was defeated by Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh in 1700. In February 1700, he invaded Cambodia from An Giang. In March, the Vietnamese expedition under C\u1ea3nh and a Chinese general Tr\u1ea7n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Xuy\u00ean (Chen Shangchuan) defeated the main Cambodian army at B\u00edch \u0110\u00f4i citadel, king Chey Chettha IV took flight while his nephew Ang Em surrendered to the invaders, as the Vietnamese marched onto and captured Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh. As a result, Saigon and Long An were officially and securely obtained by the Nguy\u1ec5n, more Vietnamese settlers moved into the new conquered lands.\nIn 1788, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh captured the city, and used it as a centre of resistance against T\u00e2y S\u01a1n. Two years later, a large Vauban citadel called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh, or \"Th\u00e0nh B\u00e1t Qu\u00e1i\" (\"Eight Diagrams\") was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's French mercenaries. The citadel was captured by L\u00ea V\u0103n Kh\u00f4i during his revolt of 1833\u201335 against Emperor Minh M\u1ea1ng. Following the revolt, Minh M\u1ea1ng ordered it to be dismantled, and a new citadel, called \"Ph\u1ee5ng Th\u00e0nh\", was built in 1836. In 1859, the citadel was destroyed by the French following the Battle of K\u1ef3 H\u00f2a. Initially called Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.\nFrench colonial era.\nCeded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, the city was planned by the French to transform into a large town for colonization. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, construction of various French-style buildings began, including a botanical garden, the Norodom Palace, Hotel Continental, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh Market, among many others. In April 1865, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh B\u00e1o was established in Saigon, becoming the first newspaper published in Vietnam. During the French colonial era, Saigon became known as \"Pearl of the Orient\" (\"\"), or \"Paris of the Extreme Orient\".\nOn 27 April 1931, a new r\u00e9gion called Saigon\u2013Cholon consisting of Saigon and Cholon was formed; the name Cholon was dropped after South Vietnam gained independence from France in 1955. From about 256,000 in 1930, Saigon's population rose to 1.2 million in 1950.\nState of Vietnam and Republic of Vietnam era.\nOn 14 June 1949, 10 days after France returned Cochinchina to Vietnam, former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam within the French Union with himself as head of state. The state was proclaimed in July. In July 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River), with the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the southern half remained the rule of the State of Vietnam.\nThe State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1955 referendum, with Saigon as its capital. On 22 October 1956, the city was given the official name, \"\" (\"Capital City Saigon\"). After the decree of 27 March 1959 came into effect, Saigon was divided into eight districts and 41 wards.\nIn December 1966, two wards from old An Kh\u00e1nh Commune of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh, were formed into District 1, then seceded shortly later to become District 9. In July 1969, District 10 and District 11 were founded, and by 1975, the city's area consisted of eleven districts, Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh, C\u1ee7 Chi District (H\u1eadu Ngh\u0129a), and Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a District (B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng).\nSaigon served as the financial, industrial and transport centre of the Republic of Vietnam. In the late 1950s, with the U.S. providing nearly $2 billion in aid to the Di\u1ec7m regime, the country's economy grew rapidly under the capitalist model; by 1960, over half of South Vietnam's factories were located in Saigon. However, beginning in the 1960s, Saigon experienced economic downturn and high inflation, as it was completely dependent on U.S. aid and imports from other countries. As a result of widespread urbanisation, with the population reaching 3.3 million by 1970, the city was described by the USAID as being turned \"into a huge slum\". The city also suffered from \"prostitutes, drug addicts, corrupt officials, beggars, orphans, and Americans with money\", and according to Stanley Karnow, it was \"a black-market city in the largest sense of the word\".\nOn 28 April 1955, the Vietnamese National Army launched an attack against B\u00ecnh Xuy\u00ean military force in the city. The battle lasted until May, killing an estimated 500 people and leaving about 20,000 homeless. Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m then later turned on other paramilitary groups in Saigon, including the H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o Buddhist reform movement. On 11 June 1963, Buddhist monk Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c self-immolated in the city, in protest of the Di\u1ec7m regime. On 2 November of the same year, Di\u1ec7m was assassinated in Saigon, in a successful coup by D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh.\nDuring the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. Seven years later, on 30 April 1975, Saigon was captured, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam, and the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army.\nPost\u2013Vietnam War and today.\nIn July 1976, upon the establishment of the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including the Cholon area), the province of Gia \u00d0\u1ecbnh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City, in honour of the late Communist leader Ho Chi Minh.\nAt the time, the city covered an area of with eight districts and five rurals: Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, H\u00f3c M\u00f4n, C\u1ee7 Chi, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh, and Nh\u00e0 B\u00e8. Since 1978, administrative divisions in the city have been revised numerous times, most recently in 2020, when District 2, District 9, and Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c District were consolidated to form a municipal city.\nOn 29 October 2002, 60 people died and 90 were injured in the International Trade Center building fire in Ho Chi Minh City. Today, Ho Chi Minh City, along with its surrounding provinces, is described as \"the manufacturing hub\" of Vietnam, and \"an attractive business hub\". In terms of cost, it was ranked the 178th-most expensive major city in the world according to the Mercer Cost Of Living 2024 survey of 226 cities. In terms of international connectedness, as of 2024, the city was classified as a \"Beta+\" city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\nGeography.\nThe city is located in the south-eastern region of Vietnam, south of Hanoi. The average elevation is above sea level for the city centre and for the suburb areas. It borders T\u00e2y Ninh Province and B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng Province to the north, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u province to the east, Long An Province to the west, and Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and the South China Sea to the south with a coast long. The city covers an area of or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to C\u1ee7 Chi District ( from the Cambodian border) and down to C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd on the Eastern Sea.\nThe distance from the northernmost point (Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9 H\u01b0ng Commune, C\u1ee7 Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long H\u00f2a Commune, C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd District) is , and from the easternmost point (Long B\u00ecnh ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh Commune, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh District) is . Due to its location on the Mekong Delta, the city is fringed by tidal flats that have been heavily modified for agriculture.\nFlooding.\nSaigon is considered one of the most vulnerable cities to the effects of flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city. A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to suffer flooding.\nClimate.\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically tropical savanna (Aw), with a high average humidity of 78\u201382%. The year is divided into two distinct seasons. The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November. The dry season lasts from December to April.\nThe average temperature is , with little variation throughout the year. The highest temperature recorded was in April while the lowest temperature recorded was in January. On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.\nAdministration.\nThe city is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, and is divided into 113 wards, 54 communes, and 1 special administrative zone (as of 2025):\n113 wards ( in area), which are designated as urban or suburban (\"\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n54 communes ( in area), which are designated rural (\"\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOne special administrative zone ( in area), which is designated municipal city (\"\"):\nCity government.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n \u0110\u01b0\u1ee3c. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments.\nThe legislative branch of the city is the \"Ho Chi Minh City People's Council\" and consists of 105 members. The current chairman is V\u00f5 V\u0103n Minh. The judiciary branch of the city is the \"Ho Chi Minh City People's Court\". The current chief judge is L\u00ea Thanh Phong.\nThe executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City. The current secretary is Tr\u1ea7n L\u01b0u Quang. The permanent deputy secretary of the Communist Party is ranked second in the city politics after the Secretary of the Communist Party, while chairman of the People's Committee is ranked third and the chairman of the People's Council is ranked fourth.\nDemographics.\nThe population of the city, as of the 1 October 2004 census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and five suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants).\nIn mid-2007, the city's population was 6,650,942 \u2013 with the 19 inner districts home to 5,564,975 residents and the five suburban districts containing 1,085,967 inhabitants. The result of the 2009 Census shows that the city's population was 7,162,864 people, about 8.34% of the total population of Vietnam, making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As of the end of 2012, the total population of the city was 7,750,900 people, an increase of 3.1% from 2011.\nAs an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincial level. According to the 2019 census, Ho Chi Minh City has a population of over 8.9\u00a0million within the city proper and over 21\u00a0million within its metropolitan area.\nIn August 2017, the city's mayor, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u00e0nh Phong, admitted that previous estimates of 8\u201310\u00a0million were drastic underestimations.\nThe actual population (including those who have not officially registered) was estimated 13\u00a0million in 2017.\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the southeast region plus Ti\u1ec1n Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of with a population of 20\u00a0million inhabitants by 2020. Inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as \"Saigonese\" in English and \"d\u00e2n S\u00e0i G\u00f2n\" in Vietnamese.\nEthnic groups.\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) at about 93.52%.

Within the city, the two main stations are S\u00f3ng Th\u1ea7n and S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D\u0129 An, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c, B\u00ecnh Tri\u1ec7u, G\u00f2 V\u1ea5p. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.\nWater transport.\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh.\nTraffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the \u0110\u00f4i and T\u1ebb Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13\u00a0million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011\u201314. In 2017, the Saigon Waterbus launched, connecting District 1 to Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c City.\nPublic transport.\nMetro.\nThe HCMC Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. Line 1 was opened in late 2024. The line connects B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh to Su\u1ed1i Ti\u00ean Park in District 9, with a depot in Long B\u00ecnh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily. A line between B\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh and Tham L\u01b0\u01a1ng in District 12 has been approved by the government, and several more lines (Lines 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.\nBus.\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus.

The largest coach station \u2013 in terms of passengers handled \u2013 is the Mi\u1ec1n \u0110\u00f4ng Coach Station in the B\u00ecnh Th\u1ea1nh District.\nPrivate transport.\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre.\nFor short trips, \"\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. You can also book motorcycle and car taxis through ride-hailing apps like Grab and GoJek. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5\u00a0million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi. The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.\nExpressway.\nThe city has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces. The first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City \u2013 Trung L\u01b0\u01a1ng Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Ti\u1ec1n Giang and the Mekong Delta.\nThe second one is Ho Chi Minh City \u2013 Long Th\u00e0nh \u2013 D\u1ea7u Gi\u00e2y Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u and the Southeast of Vietnam.

{"id": "66958", "revid": "43070105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66958", "title": "Renminbi", "text": "Currency of China\nThe renminbi ( ; symbol: \u00a5; ISO code: CNY; abbreviation: RMB) is the official currency of China. The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. It is the world's as of April 2022. The Chinese yuan () is the basic unit of the renminbi. \nOne yuan is divided into 10 jiao (), and the jiao is further subdivided into 10 fen (). The word \"yuan\" is widely used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts.\nValuation.\nUntil 2005, the value of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar. As China pursued its transition from central planning to a market economy and increased its participation in foreign trade, the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry. It has previously been claimed that the renminbi's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity. However, more recently, appreciation actions by the Chinese government, as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the American Federal Reserve and other major central banks, have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012. Since 2006, the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies. By 2015, the IMF assessed it as suggested to be no longer undervalued. The Chinese government has announced that it will gradually increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the world's 8th most traded currency in 2013, 5th by 2015, but 6th in 2019.\nOn 1 October 2016, the renminbi became the first emerging market currency to be included in the IMF's special drawing rights basket, the basket of currencies used by the IMF as a reserve currency. Its initial weighting in the basket was 10.9%.259\nTerminology.\nThe ISO code for the renminbi is \"CNY\", the PRC's country code (CN) plus \"Y\" from \"yuan\". Hong Kong markets that trade renminbi at free-floating rates use the unofficial code CNH. This is to distinguish the rates from those fixed by Chinese central banks on the mainland. The abbreviation \"RMB\" is not an ISO code but is sometimes used like one by banks and financial institutions.\nThe currency symbol for the yuan unit is \u00a5, but when distinction from the Japanese yen is required \"RMB\" (e.g. RMB\u00a010,000) or \"\u00a5\u00a0RMB\" (e.g. \u00a510,000\u00a0RMB) is used. However, in written Chinese contexts, the Chinese character for yuan () or, in formal contexts , usually follows the number in lieu of a currency symbol.\n\"Renminbi\" is the name of the currency while \"yuan\" is the name of the primary unit of the renminbi. This is analogous to the distinction between \"sterling\" and \"pound\" when discussing the official currency of the United Kingdom. \"Jiao\" and \"fen\" are also units of renminbi.\nIn everyday Mandarin, kuai () is usually used when discussing money and \"renminbi\" or \"yuan\" are rarely heard. Similarly, Mandarin speakers typically use mao () instead of jiao. For example, \u00a58.74 might be read as () in everyday conversation, but read () formally.\nRenminbi is sometimes referred to as the \"redback\", a play on \"greenback\", a slang term for the US dollar.\nHistory.\nThe various currencies called yuan or dollar issued in mainland China as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore were all derived from the Spanish dollar, which China imported in large quantities from Spanish America from the 16th to 20th centuries. The first locally minted silver dollar or yuan accepted all over Qing dynasty China (1644\u20131912) was the silver dragon dollar introduced in 1889. Various banknotes denominated in dollars or yuan were also introduced, which were convertible to silver dollars until 1935 when the silver standard was discontinued and the Chinese yuan was made \"fabi\" (; legal tender fiat currency).\nThe renminbi was introduced by the People's Bank of China in December 1948, about a year before the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It was issued only in paper form at first, and replaced the various currencies circulating in the areas controlled by the Communists. One of the first tasks of the new government was to end the hyperinflation that had plagued China in the final years of the Kuomintang (KMT) era. That achieved, a revaluation occurred in 1955 at the rate of 1 new yuan = 10,000 old yuan.\nIn 2019, the People's Bank of China released an updated edition of the fifth series of renminbi banknotes and coins. The update included new versions of the \u00a550, \u00a520, \u00a510, and \u00a51 banknotes, as well as the \u00a51, \u00a50.5, and \u00a50.1 coins. These featured improved security features, enhanced printing quality, and brighter coloration to combat counterfeiting and improve recognizability. Notably, the \u00a5100 banknote from the 2015 issue remained unchanged in this release.\nAs the Chinese Communist Party took control of ever larger territories in the latter part of the Chinese Civil War, its People's Bank of China began to issue a unified currency in 1948 for use in Communist-controlled territories. Also denominated in \"yuan\", this currency was identified by different names, including \"People's Bank of China banknotes\" (; from November 1948), \"New Currency\" (; from December 1948), \"People's Bank of China notes\" (; from January 1949), \"People's Notes\" (\u4eba\u6c11\u5238, as an abbreviation of the last name), and finally \"People's Currency\", or \"renminbi\", from June 1949.\nIn the early 2020s, China launched the digital renminbi, also known as the digital yuan or e-CNY, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) developed by the People's Bank of China. Pilot programs began in 2020 in cities such as Shenzhen, Suzhou, and Chengdu. By 2023, e-CNY had been integrated into a wide range of applications, including public transportation, government subsidies, retail payments, and cross-border trials. The digital yuan is intended to enhance payment system resilience, offer an alternative to private payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, and support financial inclusion.\nEra of the command economy.\nFrom 1949 until the late 1970s, the state fixed China's exchange rate at a highly overvalued level as part of the country's import-substitution strategy. During this time frame, the focus of the state's central planning was to accelerate industrial development and reduce China's dependence on imported manufactured goods. The overvaluation allowed the government to provide imported machinery and equipment to priority industries at a lower domestic currency cost than otherwise would have been possible.\nTransition to an equilibrium exchange rate.\nChina's transition by the mid-1990s to a system in which the value of its currency was determined by supply and demand in a foreign exchange market was a gradual process spanning 15 years that involved changes in the official exchange rate, the use of a dual exchange rate system, and the introduction and gradual expansion of markets for foreign exchange.\nThe most important move to a market-oriented exchange rate was an easing of controls on trade and other current account transactions, as occurred in several very early steps. In 1979, the State Council approved a system allowing exporters and their provincial and local government owners to retain a share of their foreign exchange earnings, referred to as foreign exchange quotas. At the same time, the government introduced measures to allow retention of part of the foreign exchange earnings from non-trade sources, such as overseas remittances, port fees paid by foreign vessels, and tourism.\nAs early as October 1980, exporting firms that retained foreign exchange above their own import needs were allowed to sell the excess through the state agency responsible for the management of China's exchange controls and its foreign exchange reserves, the State Administration of Exchange Control. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the government sanctioned foreign exchange markets, known as swap centres, eventually in most large cities.\nThe government also gradually allowed market forces to take the dominant role by introducing an \"internal settlement rate\" of \u00a52.8 to 1 US dollar which was a devaluation of almost 100%.\nForeign exchange certificates, 1980\u20131994.\nIn the process of opening up China to external trade and tourism, transactions with foreign visitors between 1980 and 1994 were done primarily using foreign exchange certificates () issued by the Bank of China. Foreign currencies were exchangeable for FECs and vice versa at the renminbi's prevailing official rate which ranged from US$1 = \u00a52.8\u00a0FEC to \u00a55.5\u00a0FEC. The FEC was issued as banknotes from \u00a50.1 to \u00a5100, and was officially at par with the renminbi. Tourists used FECs to pay for accommodation as well as tourist and luxury goods sold in Friendship Stores. However, given the non-availability of foreign exchange and Friendship Store goods to the general public, as well as the inability of tourists to use FECs at local businesses, an illegal black market developed for FECs where touts approached tourists outside hotels and offered over \u00a51.30\u00a0RMB in exchange for \u00a51\u00a0FEC. \nEvolution of exchange policy since 1994.\nIn November 1993, the Third Plenum of the 14th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved a comprehensive reform strategy in which foreign exchange management reforms were highlighted as a key element for a market-oriented economy. A floating exchange rate regime and convertibility for renminbi were seen as the ultimate goal of the reform. Conditional convertibility under current account was achieved by allowing firms to surrender their foreign exchange earning from current account transactions and purchase foreign exchange as needed. Restrictions on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was also loosened and capital inflows to China surged.\nConvertibility.\nDuring the era of the command economy, the value of the renminbi was set to unrealistic values in exchange with Western currency and severe currency exchange rules were put in place, hence the dual-track currency system from 1980 to 1994 with the renminbi usable only domestically, and with Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) used by foreign visitors.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, China worked to make the renminbi more convertible. Through the use of swap centres, the exchange rate was eventually brought to more realistic levels of above \u00a58/US$1 in 1994 and the FEC was discontinued. It stayed above \u00a58/$1 until 2005 when the renminbi's peg to the dollar was loosened and it was allowed to appreciate.\nAs of 2013, the renminbi is convertible on current accounts but not capital accounts. The ultimate goal has been to make the renminbi fully convertible. However, partly in response to the Asian financial crisis in 1998, China has been concerned that the Chinese financial system would not be able to handle the potential rapid cross-border movements of hot money, and as a result, as of 2012, the currency trades within a narrow band specified by the Chinese central government.\nFollowing the internationalization of the renminbi, on 30 November 2015, the IMF voted to designate the renminbi as one of several main world currencies, thus including it in the basket of special drawing rights. The renminbi became the first emerging market currency to be included in the IMF's SDR basket on 1 October 2016. The other main world currencies are the dollar, the euro, sterling, and the yen.\nDigital renminbi.\nIn October 2019, China's central bank, PBOC, announced that a digital renminbi was going to be released after years of preparation. This version of the currency, also called DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment), can be \"decoupled\" from the banking system to give visiting tourists a taste of the nation's burgeoning cashless society. The announcement received a variety of responses: some believe it is more about domestic control and surveillance. Some argue that the real barriers to internationalisation of the renminbi are China's capital controls, which it has no plans to remove. Maximilian K\u00e4rnfelt, an expert at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, said that a digital renminbi \"would not banish many of the problems holding the renminbi back from more use globally\". He went on to say, \"Much of China's financial market is still not open to foreigners and property rights remain fragile.\"\nThe PBOC has filed more than 80 patents surrounding the integration of a digital currency system, choosing to embrace the blockchain technology. The patents reveal the extent of China's digital currency plans. The patents, seen and verified by the \"Financial Times\", include proposals related to the issuance and supply of a central bank digital currency, a system for interbank settlements that uses the currency, and the integration of digital currency wallets into existing retail bank accounts. Several of the 84 patents reviewed by the \"Financial Times\" indicate that China may plan to algorithmically adjust the supply of a central bank digital currency based on certain triggers, such as loan interest rates. Other patents are focused on building digital currency chip cards or digital currency wallets that banking consumers could potentially use, which would be linked directly to their bank accounts. The patent filings also point to the proposed 'tokenomics' being considered by the DCEP working group. Some patents show plans towards programmed inflation control mechanisms. While the majority of the patents are attributed to the PBOC's Digital Currency Research Institute, some are attributed to state-owned corporations or subsidiaries of the Chinese central government.\nUncovered by the Chamber of Digital Commerce (an American non-profit advocacy group), their contents shed light on Beijing's mounting efforts to digitise the renminbi, which has sparked alarm in the West and spurred central bankers around the world to begin exploring similar projects. Some commentators have said that the U.S., which has no current plans to issue a government-backed digital currency, risks falling behind China and risking its dominance in the global financial system. Victor Shih, a China expert and professor at the University of California San Diego, said that merely introducing a digital currency \"doesn't solve the problem that some people holding renminbi offshore will want to sell that renminbi and exchange it for the dollar\", as the dollar is considered to be a safer asset. Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said that the digital renminbi \"will hardly put a dent in the dollar's status as the dominant global reserve currency\" due to the United States' \"economic dominance, deep and liquid capital markets, and still-robust institutional framework\". The U.S. dollar's share as a reserve currency is above 60%, while that of the renminbi is about 2%.\nIn April 2020, \"The Guardian\" reported that the digital currency e-RMB had been adopted into multiple cities' monetary systems and \"some government employees and public servants [will] receive their salaries in the digital currency from May. \"The Guardian\" quoted a \"China Daily\" report which stated \"A sovereign digital currency provides a functional alternative to the dollar settlement system and blunts the impact of any sanctions or threats of exclusion both at a country and company level. It may also facilitate integration into globally traded currency markets with a reduced risk of politically inspired disruption.\" There were talks of testing out the digital renminbi in the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022, but China's overall timetable for rolling out the digital currency was unclear.\nInterest rate and green bonds.\nIn May 2023, RMB interest rate swaps was launched. In June 2023, under the Government Green Bond Programme, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (HKSAR) announced a green bonds offering, of approximately US$6 billion denominated in USD, EUR and RMB.\nIssuance.\nAs of 2019, renminbi banknotes are available in denominations of \u00a50.1, \u00a50.5 (1 and 5 jiao), \u00a51, \u00a55, \u00a510, \u00a520, \u00a550 and \u00a5100. These denominations have been available since 1955, except for the \u00a520 notes (added in 1999 with the fifth series) \u00a550 and \u00a5100 notes (added in 1987 with the fourth series). Coins are available in denominations from \u00a50.01 to \u00a51. Thus some denominations exist in both coins and banknotes. On rare occasions, larger yuan coin denominations such as \u00a55 have been issued to commemorate events but use of these outside of collecting has never been widespread.\nThe denomination of each banknote is printed in simplified written Chinese. The numbers themselves are printed in financial Chinese numeral characters, as well as Arabic numerals. The denomination and the words \"People's Bank of China\" are also printed in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur and Zhuang on the back of each banknote, in addition to the boldface Hanyu Pinyin \"Zhongguo Renmin Yinhang\" (without tones). The right front of the note has a tactile representation of the denomination in Chinese Braille starting from the fourth series. See corresponding section for detailed information.\nThe \"fen\" and \"jiao\" denominations have become increasingly unnecessary as prices have increased. Coins under \u00a50.1 are used infrequently. Chinese retailers tend to avoid fractional values (such as \u00a59.99), opting instead to round to the nearest yuan (such as \u00a59 or \u00a510).\nCoins.\nIn 1953, aluminium \u00a50.01, \u00a50.02, and \u00a50.05 coins began being struck for circulation, and were first introduced in 1955. These depict the national emblem on the obverse (front) and the name and denomination framed by wheat stalks on the reverse (back). In 1980, brass \u00a50.1, \u00a50.2, and \u00a50.5 and cupro-nickel \u00a51 coins were added, although the \u00a50.1 and \u00a50.2 were only produced until 1981, with the last \u00a50.5 and \u00a51 issued in 1985. All ji\u01ceo coins depicted similar designs to the f\u0113n coins while the yu\u00e1n depicted the Great Wall of China.\nIn 1991, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of an aluminium \u00a50.1, brass \u00a50.5 and nickel-clad steel \u00a51. These were smaller than the previous ji\u01ceo and yu\u00e1n coins and depicted flowers on the obverse and the national emblem on the reverse. Issuance of the aluminium \u00a50.01 and \u00a50.02 coins ceased in 1991, with that of the \u00a50.05 halting in 1994. The small coins were still struck for annual uncirculated mint sets in limited quantities, and from the beginning of 2005, the \u00a50.01 coin got a new lease on life by being issued again every year since then up to present.\nNew designs of the \u00a50.1, \u00a50.5 (now brass-plated steel), and \u00a51 (nickel-plated steel) were again introduced in between 1999 and 2002. The \u00a50.1 was significantly reduced in size, and in 2005 its composition was changed from aluminium to more durable nickel-plated steel. An updated version of these coins was announced in 2019. While the overall design is unchanged, all coins including the \u00a50.5 are now of nickel-plated steel, and the \u00a51 coin was reduced in size.\nThe frequency of usage of coins varies between different parts of China, with coins typically being more popular in urban areas (with 5-ji\u01ceo and 1-yu\u00e1n coins used in vending machines), and small notes being more popular in rural areas. Older f\u0113n and large ji\u01ceo coins are uncommonly still seen in circulation, but are still valid in exchange.\nBanknotes.\nAs of 2025, there have been five series of renminbi banknotes issued by the People's Republic of China:\nThese first renminbi notes were printed with the words \"People's Bank of China\", \"Republic of China\", and the denomination, written in Chinese characters by Dong Biwu.\nCommemorative issues of the renminbi banknotes.\nIn 1999, a commemorative red \u00a550 note was issued in honour of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China. This note features Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong on the front and various animals on the back.\nAn orange polymer note, commemorating the new millennium was issued in 2000 with a face value of \u00a5100. This features a dragon on the obverse and the reverse features the China Millennium monument (at the Center for Cultural and Scientific Fairs).\nFor the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a green \u00a510 note was issued featuring the Bird's Nest Stadium on the front with the back showing a classical Olympic discus thrower and various other athletes.\nOn 26 November 2015, the People's Bank of China issued a blue \u00a5100 commemorative note to honour China's aerospace science and technology.\nIn commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Renminbi, the People's Bank of China issued 120\u00a0million \u00a550 banknotes on 28 December 2018.\nIn recognition of the imminent 2022 Winter Olympics, the People's Bank of China issued \u00a520 commemorative banknotes in both paper and polymer in December 2021.\nIn recognition of the imminent 2024 and 2025 Chinese New Year celebrations, the People's Bank of China issued \u00a520 commemorative banknotes in polymer.\nUse in ethnic minority regions of China.\nThe renminbi yuan has different names when used in ethnic minority regions of China. \nProduction and minting.\nRenminbi currency production is carried out by a state owned corporation, China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation (CBPMC; ) headquartered in Beijing. CBPMC uses several printing, engraving and minting facilities around the country to produce banknotes and coins for subsequent distribution. Banknote printing facilities are based in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, and Nanchang. Mints are located in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Also, high grade paper for the banknotes is produced at two facilities in Baoding and Kunshan. The Baoding facility is the largest facility in the world dedicated to developing banknote material according to its website. In addition, the People's Bank of China has its own printing technology research division that researches new techniques for creating banknotes and making counterfeiting more difficult.\nSuggested future design.\nOn 13 March 2006, some delegates to an advisory body at the National People's Congress proposed to include Sun Yat-sen and Deng Xiaoping on the renminbi banknotes. However, the proposal was not adopted.\nEconomics.\nValue.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nFor most of its early history, the renminbi was pegged to the U.S. dollar at \u00a52.46 per dollar. During the 1970s, it was revalued until it reached \u00a51.50 per dollar in 1980. When China's economy gradually opened in the 1980s, the renminbi was devalued in order to improve the competitiveness of Chinese exports. Thus, the official exchange rate increased from \u00a51.50 in 1980 to \u00a58.62 by 1994 (the lowest rate on record). Improving current account balance during the latter half of the 1990s enabled the Chinese government to maintain a peg of \u00a58.27 per US$1 from 1997 to 2005.\nThe renminbi reached a record high exchange value of \u00a56.0395 to the US dollar on 14 January 2014. Chinese leadership have been raising the yuan to tame inflation, a step U.S. officials have pushed for years to lower the massive trade deficit with China. Strengthening the value of the renminbi also fits with the Chinese transition to a more consumer-led economic growth model. \nIn 2015 the People's Bank of China again devalued their country's currency. As of 2015[ [update]], the exchange rate for US$1 is \u00a56.38.\nDepegged from the US dollar.\nOn 21 July 2005, the peg was finally lifted, which saw an immediate one-time renminbi revaluation to \u00a58.11 per dollar. The exchange rate against the euro stood at \u00a510.07060 per euro.\nHowever, the peg was reinstituted unofficially when the financial crisis hit: \"Under intense pressure from Washington, China took small steps to allow its currency to strengthen for three years starting in July 2005. But China 're-pegged' its currency to the dollar as the financial crisis intensified in July 2008.\"\nOn 19 June 2010, the People's Bank of China released a statement simultaneously in Chinese and English claiming that they would \"proceed further with reform of the renminbi exchange rate regime and increase the renminbi exchange rate flexibility\". The news was greeted with praise by world leaders including Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy and Stephen Harper. The PBoC maintained there would be no \"large swings\" in the currency. The renminbi rose to its highest level in five years and markets worldwide surged on Monday, 21 June following China's announcement.\nIn August 2015, Joseph Adinolfi, a reporter for MarketWatch, reported that China had re-pegged the renminbi. In his article, he narrated that \"Weak trade data out of China, released over the weekend, weighed on the currencies of Australia and New Zealand on Monday. But the yuan didn't budge. Indeed, the Chinese currency, also known as the renminbi, has been remarkably steady over the past month despite the huge selloff in China's stock market and a spate of disappointing economic data. Market strategists, including Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, and Marc Chandler, head currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said that is because China's policy makers have effectively re-pegged the yuan. \"When I look at the dollar-renminbi right now, that looks like a fixed exchange rate again. They've re-pegged it,\" Chandler said.\"\nManaged float.\nThe renminbi has now moved to a managed floating exchange rate based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of foreign currencies. In July 2005, the daily trading price of the US dollar against the renminbi in the inter-bank foreign exchange market was allowed to float within a narrow band of 0.3% around the central parity published by the People's Bank of China; in a later announcement published on 18 May 2007, the band was extended to 0.5%. On 14 April 2012, the band was extended to 1.0%. On 17 March 2014, the band was extended to 2%. China has stated that the basket is dominated by the United States dollar, euro, Japanese yen and South Korean won, with a smaller proportion made up of sterling, Thai baht, roubles, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and Singaporean dollars.\nOn 10 April 2008, it traded at \u00a56.9920 per US dollar, which was the first time in more than a decade that a dollar had bought less than \u00a57, and at \u00a511.03630 per euro.\nBeginning in January 2010, Chinese and non-Chinese citizens have an annual exchange limit of a maximum of US$50,000. Exchanges within this limit require only a passport or Chinese ID and no additional documentation showing the purpose of the exchange. Currency exchange transactions are centrally registered. The maximum dollar withdrawal is $10,000 per day, the maximum purchase limit of US dollars is $500 per day. This stringent management of the currency leads to a bottled-up demand for exchange in both directions. It is viewed as a major tool to keep the currency peg, preventing inflows of \"hot money\".\nA shift of Chinese reserves into the currencies of their other trading partners has caused these nations to shift more of their reserves into dollars, leading to no great change in the value of the renminbi against the dollar.\nFutures market.\nRenminbi futures are traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The futures are cash-settled at the exchange rate published by the People's Bank of China.\nPurchasing power parity.\nScholarly studies suggest that the yuan is undervalued on the basis of purchasing power parity analysis. One 2011 study suggests a 37.5% undervaluation.\nThe People's Bank of China lowered the renminbi's daily fix to the US dollar by 1.9 per cent to \u00a56.2298 on 11 August 2015. The People's Bank of China again lowered the renminbi's daily fix to the US dollar from \u00a56.620 to \u00a56.6375 after Brexit on 27 June 2016. It had not been this low since December 2010.\nReal exchange rate.\nIn 2015, the IMF assessed the renminbi's real exchange rate as suggested to be no longer undervalued due to \"[t]he subsequent sizable REER appreciation appear[ing] to be more than would be suggested by changes in fundamentals (productivity growth and improved ToT)[.]\"\nInternationalisation.\nBefore 2009, the renminbi had little to no exposure in the international markets because of strict government controls by the central Chinese government that prohibited almost all export of the currency, or use of it in international transactions. Transactions between Chinese companies and a foreign entity were generally denominated in US dollars. With Chinese companies unable to hold US dollars and foreign companies unable to hold Chinese yuan, all transactions would go through the People's Bank of China. Once the sum was paid by the foreign party in dollars, the central bank would pass the settlement in renminbi to the Chinese company at the state-controlled exchange rate.\nIn June 2009 the Chinese officials announced a pilot scheme where business and trade transactions were allowed between limited businesses in Guangdong province and Shanghai, and only counterparties in Hong Kong, Macau, and select ASEAN nations. Proving a success, the program was further extended to 20 Chinese provinces and counterparties internationally in July 2010, and in September 2011 it was announced that the remaining 11 Chinese provinces would be included.\nIn steps intended to establish the renminbi as an international reserve currency, China has agreements with Russia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Japan, allowing trade with those countries to be settled directly in renminbi instead of requiring conversion to US dollars, with Australia and South Africa to follow soon. In September 2023, the Renminbi passed the euro as the second most utilized currency in international trade, having tripled in the last three years.\nInternational reserve currency.\nCurrency restrictions regarding renminbi-denominated bank deposits and financial products were greatly liberalised in July 2010. In 2010 renminbi-denominated bonds were reported to have been purchased by Malaysia's central bank and that McDonald's had issued renminbi denominated corporate bonds through Standard Chartered Bank of Hong Kong. Such liberalisation allows the yuan to look more attractive as it can be held with higher return on investment yields, whereas previously that yield was virtually none. Nevertheless, some national banks such as Bank of Thailand (BOT) have expressed a serious concern about renminbi since BOT cannot substitute the deprecated US dollars in its US$200\u00a0billion foreign exchange reserves for renminbi as much as it wishes because:\nTo meet IMF requirements, China gave up some of its tight control over the currency.\nCountries that are left-leaning in the political spectrum had already begun to use the renminbi as an alternative reserve currency to the United States dollar; the Central Bank of Chile reported in 2011 to have US$91\u00a0million worth of renminbi in reserves, and the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela, Nelson Merentes, made statements in favour of the renminbi following the announcement of reserve withdrawals from Europe and the United States.\nIn Africa, the central banks of Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa either hold renminbi as a reserve currency or have taken steps to purchase bonds denominated in renminbi. The \"Report on the Internationalization of RMB in 2020\", which was released by the People's Bank of China in August 2020, said that renminbi's function as international reserve currency has gradually emerged. In the first quarter 2020, the share of renminbi in global foreign exchange reserves rose to 2.02%, a record high. As of the end of 2019, the People's Bank of China has set up renminbi clearing banks in 25 countries and regions outside of mainland China, which has made the use of renminbi more secure and transaction costs have decreased.\nUse as a currency outside mainland China.\nThe two special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macau, have their own respective currencies, according to the \"one country, two systems\" principle and the basic laws of the two territories. Therefore, the Hong Kong dollar and the Macanese pataca remain the legal tenders in the two territories, and the renminbi, although sometimes accepted, is not legal tender. Banks in Hong Kong allow people to maintain accounts in RMB. Because of changes in legislation in July 2010, banks around the world offer foreign currency accounts for deposits in Chinese renminbi.\nThe renminbi had a presence in Macau even before the 1999 return to the People's Republic of China from Portugal. Banks in Macau can issue credit cards based on the renminbi, but not loans. Renminbi-based credit cards cannot be used in Macau's casinos.\nThe government of Taiwan believes that wide usage of the renminbi would create an underground economy and undermine its sovereignty. Tourists are allowed to bring in up to \u00a520,000 when visiting Taiwan. These renminbi must be converted to Taiwanese currency at trial exchange sites in Matsu and Kinmen. The Chen Shui-bian administration insisted that it would not allow full convertibility until the mainland signs a bilateral foreign exchange settlement agreement, though president Ma Ying-jeou, who served from 2008 to 2016, sought to allow full convertibility as soon as possible.\nThe renminbi circulates in some of China's neighbors, such as Pakistan, Mongolia and northern Thailand. Cambodia welcomes the renminbi as an official currency and Laos and Myanmar allow it in border provinces such as Wa and Kokang and economic zones like Mandalay. Though unofficial, Vietnam recognizes the exchange of the renminbi to the \u0111\u1ed3ng. In 2017 \u00a5215\u00a0billion was circulating in Indonesia. In 2018 a Bilateral Currency Swap Agreement was made by the Bank of Indonesia and the Bank of China which simplified business transactions, and in 2020 about 10% of Indonesia's global trade was in renminbi.\nSince 2007, renminbi-nominated bonds have been issued outside mainland China; these are colloquially called dim sum bonds. In April 2011, the first initial public offering denominated in renminbi occurred in Hong Kong, when the Chinese property investment trust Hui Xian REIT raised \u00a510.48\u00a0billion ($1.6\u00a0billion) in its IPO. Beijing has allowed renminbi-denominated financial markets to develop in Hong Kong as part of the effort to internationalise the renminbi. There is limited (under 1%) issuing of renminbi bonds in Indonesia.\nOther markets.\nSince currency flows in and out of mainland China are still restricted, renminbi traded in off-shore markets, such as the Hong Kong market, can have a different value to renminbi traded on the mainland. The offshore RMB market is usually denoted as CNH, but there is another renminbi interbank and spot market in Taiwan for domestic trading known as CNT.\nOther renminbi markets include the dollar-settled non-deliverable forward (NDF), and the trade-settlement exchange rate (CNT).\nNote that the two CNTs mentioned above are different from each other.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66962", "revid": "27199084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66962", "title": "Typha", "text": "Genus of flowering plants\nTypha is a genus of about 30 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Typhaceae. These plants have a variety of common names, in British English bulrush or (mainly historically) reedmace, in American English cattail or punks, in Australia cumbungi or bulrush, in Canada bulrush or cattail, and in New Zealand raup\u014d, bullrush, cattail, or reed.\nThe genus is largely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, where it is found in a variety of wetland habitats. Although they can accumulate toxins in polluted areas, many parts of the plant are edible, including the starchy rhizomes.\nDescription.\n\"Typha\" are aquatic or semi-aquatic, rhizomatous, herbaceous perennial plants growing between in height. The leaves are long and narrow, up to wide, glabrous (hairless), linear, alternate and mostly basal on a simple, jointless stem that bears the flowering spikes.\nThe plants are monoecious, with unisexual flowers that develop in dense racemes. The numerous male flowers form a narrow spike at the top of the vertical stem. Each male (staminate) flower is reduced to a pair of stamens and hairs, and withers once the pollen is shed. Large numbers of tiny female flowers form a dense, sausage-shaped spike on the stem below the male spike. This can be up to long and thick. The seeds are minute, long, and attached to fine hairs. When ripe, the heads disintegrate into a cottony fluff from which the seeds disperse by wind.\nTaxonomy.\nFruits of \"Typha\" have been found as long ago as 69 million years ago in modern Central Europe.\nTaxa.\nThe following species and hybrids are currently accepted:\nEtymology.\n\"Typha\" is an ancient Greek name for the plant. It may be related to \"typhos\" ('marsh').\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe most widespread species is \"Typha latifolia\", which is distributed across the entire temperate Northern Hemisphere. It has also been introduced to Australia. \"T.\u00a0angustifolia\" is nearly as widespread, but does not extend as far north; it may be introduced and invasive in North America. \"T.\u00a0domingensis\" has a more southern American distribution and also occurs in Australia. \"T.\u00a0orientalis\" is widespread in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. \"T.\u00a0laxmannii\", \"T.\u00a0minima\", and \"T.\u00a0shuttleworthii\" are largely restricted to Asia and southern Europe.\nThe plants grow in open swampy areas from sea level to .\nEcology.\n\"Typha\" are often among the first wetland plants to colonize areas of newly exposed wet mud, with their abundant wind-dispersed seeds. Buried seeds can survive in the soil for long periods of time. They germinate best with sunlight and fluctuating temperatures, which is typical of many wetland plants that regenerate on mud flats. The plants also spread by rhizomes, forming large, interconnected stands.\n\"Typha\" are considered to be dominant competitors in wetlands in many areas and they often exclude other plants with their dense canopy. In the bays of the Great Lakes, for example, they are among the most abundant wetland plants. Different species of cattails are adapted to different water depths.\nWell-developed aerenchyma make the plants tolerant of submersion. Even the dead stalks are capable of transmitting oxygen to the rooting zone.\nAlthough \"Typha\" are native wetland plants, they can be aggressive in their competition with other native species. They have been problematic in many regions in North America, from the Great Lakes to the Everglades. Native sedges are displaced and wet meadows shrink, likely as a response to altered hydrology of the wetlands and increased nutrient levels. An introduced or hybrid species may be contributing to the problem. Control is difficult. The most successful strategy appears to be mowing or burning to remove the aerenchymous stalks, followed by prolonged flooding. It may be more important to prevent invasion by preserving water level fluctuations, including periods of drought, and to maintain infertile conditions.\n\"Typha\" are frequently eaten by wetland mammals such as muskrats, which also use them to construct feeding platforms and dens, thereby also providing nesting and resting places for waterfowl.\nPotential toxicity.\nSome species are known to accumulate toxins and so must first undergo treatment before being eaten. Plants growing in polluted water can accumulate lead and pesticide residues in their rhizomes and should not be eaten.\nUses.\nCulinary.\nMany parts of \"Typha\" plants are edible to humans, with various parts being usable throughout the year. The starchy rhizomes are nutritious, with a protein content comparable to that of maize or rice. They can be processed into a flour with 266 kcal per 100 grams. They are fibrous and the starch must be scraped or sucked from the tough fibers. Evidence of preserved starch grains on grinding stones suggests the rhizomes were already eaten in Europe 30,000 years ago. Also underground is a carbohydrate lump which can be peeled and eaten raw or cooked like a potato.\nBaby shoots emerging from the rhizomes, which are sometimes subterranean, can be picked and eaten raw. Before the plants flower, the tender inside of the shoots can be squeezed out and eaten raw or cooked. The rind of young stems can be peeled off and the tender white heart inside can be eaten raw or boiled and eaten like asparagus. This food has been popular among the Cossacks in Ukraine and has been called \"Cossack asparagus\". The inner stalk of the leaf bases can be eaten raw or cooked, especially in late spring when they are young and tender. In early summer, both the male and female green flower spikes can be boiled (after removing the sheath of the female spike) and eaten like corn on the cob. In mid-summer when the male flowers are mature, the pollen can be collected and used as a flour supplement or thickener; the M\u0101ori of New Zealand have a special bread called \"pungapunga\" made from the pollen of \"T.\u00a0orientalis\".\nAgriculture.\nThe seeds have a high linoleic acid content and can be used to feed cattle and chickens. They can also be found in African countries like Ghana.\nHarvesting cattail removes nutrients from the wetland that would otherwise return via the decomposition of decaying plant matter. Floating mats of cattails remove nutrients from eutrophied bodies of freshwater.\nBuilding material.\nFor local native tribes around Lake Titicaca in Peru and Bolivia, \"Typha\" were among the most important plants and every part of the plant had multiple uses. For example, they were used to construct rafts and other boats.\nDuring World War II, the United States Navy used the down of \"Typha\" as a substitute for kapok in life vests and aviation jackets. Tests showed that even after 100 hours of submersion, the buoyancy was still effective.\n\"Typha\" are used as thermal insulation in buildings as an organic alternative to conventional insulating materials such as glass wool or stone wool.\nPaper.\n\"Typha\" stems and leaves can be used to make paper. It is strong with a heavy texture and it is hard to bleach, so it is not suitable for industrial production of graphical paper. In 1853, considerable amounts of cattail paper were produced in New York State due to a shortage of raw materials. In 1948, French scientists tested methods for annual harvesting of the leaves. Because of the high cost, these methods were abandoned and no further research was done. Today \"Typha\" is used to make decorative paper.\nFiber.\nFibers up to long can be obtained from the stems when they are treated mechanically or chemically with sodium hydroxide. The stem fibers resemble jute and can be used to produce raw textiles. The leaf fibers can be used as an alternative to cotton and linen in clothing. The yield of leaf fiber is 30 to 40 percent and \"T.\u00a0glauca\" can produce 7 to 10 tons per hectare annually.\nBiofuel.\n\"Typha\" can be used as a source of starch to produce ethanol. Because of their high productivity in northern latitudes, \"Typha\" are considered to be a bioenergy crop.\nOther.\nThe seed hairs were used by some indigenous peoples of the Americas as tinder for starting fires. Some tribes also used \"Typha\" down to line moccasins, and for bedding, diapers, baby powder, and cradleboards. One Native American word for \"Typha\" meant \"fruit for papoose's bed\". \"Typha\" down is still used in some areas to stuff clothing items and pillows. \"Typha\" can be dipped in wax or fat and then lit as a candle, the stem serving as a wick. Without the use of wax or fat it will smolder slowly, somewhat like incense, and may repel insects. \nThe flower stalks can be made into chopsticks. The leaves can be treated to weave into baskets, mats, or sandals. The rushes are harvested and the leaves often dried for later use in chair seats. Re-wetted, the leaves are twisted and wrapped around the chair rungs to form a densely woven seat that is then stuffed (usually with the left over rush).\nSmall-scale experiments have indicated that \"Typha\" are able to remove arsenic from drinking water.\nThe boiled rootstocks have been used as a diuretic for increasing urination, or mashed to make a jelly-like paste for sores, boils, wounds, burns, scabs, and smallpox pustules.\nCattail pollen is used as a banker source of food for predatory insects and mites (such as \"Amblyseius swirskii\") in greenhouses.\nThe cattail, or, as it is commonly referred to in the American Midwest, the sausage tail, has been the subject of multiple artist renditions, gaining popularity in the mid-twentieth century. The term, sausage tail, derives from the similarity that cattails have with sausages, a name given to the plant by the Midwest Polish community, which had noticed a striking similarity between the plant and kielbasa, a common Polish dish.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
