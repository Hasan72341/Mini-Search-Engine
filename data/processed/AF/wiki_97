Ulmer\nDetour is a 1945 American independent film noir directed by Edgar G. Ulmer and starring Tom Neal and Ann Savage. The screenplay was adapted by Martin Goldsmith and an uncredited Martin Mooney from Goldsmith's 1939 novel of the same title, and released by the Producers Releasing Corporation, one of the so-called Poverty Row film studios in mid-20th-century Hollywood.\nThe film, which today is in the public domain and freely available for viewing at various online sources, was restored by the Academy Film Archive in 2018. In April that year, the 4K restoration premiered in Los Angeles at the TCM Festival. In 1992, \"Detour\" was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nAl Roberts, an unemployed piano player, hitches a ride, arriving at a roadside diner in Reno, Nevada. Another customer in the diner plays a song on the jukebox that disturbs Al, for it reminds him of his former life in New York City.\nAl recalls a time there when he was bitter about squandering his musical talent playing in a cheap nightclub. After his girlfriend Sue Harvey, the nightclub's lead singer, quits her job and leaves New York to seek fame in Hollywood, Al becomes depressed. After anguishing a while, Al decides to travel to California to marry Sue. With little money to his name, Al is forced to hitchhike across the country.\nIn Arizona, bookie Charles Haskell Jr. gives Al a ride in his convertible and tells him that he is in luck, for he is driving to Los Angeles to place a bet on a horse. During the drive, he has Al pass him his pills on several occasions, which he swallows as he drives. That night, Al drives while Haskell sleeps. When a rainstorm forces Al to pull over to put up the convertible's top, he is unable to rouse Haskell. Al opens the passenger-side door and Haskell tumbles out, falling to the ground and striking his head on a rock.\nAl realizes the bookie is dead. It is likely that Haskell died earlier from a heart attack, but Al is certain that if he calls the police, they will arrest him for killing Haskell, so Al hides the body in the brush. He takes the dead man's money, clothes, and identification, and drives away, intent on abandoning the car near Los Angeles.\nAl crosses into California and spends a night in a motel. The next day, as he leaves a gas station near Desert Center Airport, he picks up a hitchhiker, who gives her name as Vera. At first, she travels silently with Al, who has identified himself as Haskell, but suddenly challenges his identity and ownership of the car, revealing that she had been picked up by Haskell earlier in Louisiana, but got out in Arizona after he tried to force himself on her. Al tells her how Haskell died, but she blackmails him by threatening to turn him over to the police. She takes the cash that Al retrieved from Haskell's wallet and demands whatever money they get by selling the car.\nIn Hollywood, they rent an apartment, posing as Mr. and Mrs. Haskell, to provide an address when they sell the car. When they are about to make the sale, Vera learns from a local newspaper that Haskell's wealthy father is near death and a search is under way for his long-estranged son. Vera demands that Al impersonate Haskell and position himself to inherit the estate. Al refuses, arguing that the impersonation would require detailed knowledge he lacks.\nBack at the apartment, Vera gets drunk and they begin arguing intensely. In a drunken rage, she threatens to call the police and runs into the bedroom with the telephone. She locks the door then falls on the bed and begins to fall asleep, the telephone cord tangled around her neck. From the other side of the door, Al pulls on the cord to try to disconnect the phone. When he breaks down the door, he discovers he has inadvertently strangled Vera.\nAl gives up the idea of contacting Sue again and returns to hitchhiking. He later finds out that Haskell is wanted in connection with the murder of \"his wife.\" Back in the diner in Reno where the film opened, he imagines his inevitable arrest.\nProduction.\nIn 1972, Ulmer said in an interview that the film was shot in six days. However, in a 2004 documentary, Ulmer's daughter Arianne presented a shooting script title page which noted, \"June 14, 1945-June 29. Camera days 14.\" Moreover, Ann Savage was contracted to Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) for the production of \"Detour\" for three six-day weeks, and she later said the film was shot in four six-day weeks, with an additional four days of location work in the desert at Lancaster, California.\nWhile popular belief long held that \"Detour\" was shot for about $20,000, Noah Isenberg, in conducting research for his book on the film, discovered that the production's final cost was closer to $100,000. Even so, it still had one of the highest profit margins, if not the highest, of any film noir listed in the National Film Registry.\nBilly Halop was tested for the role of Al Roberts, was selected for the part, but was replaced by Tom Neal just three days before filming began.\nEditing.\nAs detailed in \"Savage Detours: The Life and Work of Ann Savage\", great care was taken during the postproduction of \"Detour\". The final picture was tightly cut down from a much longer shooting script, which had been shot with more extended dialogue sequences that are not in the released print. The soundtrack is also fully realized, with ambient backgrounds, motivated sound effects, and a carefully scored original musical soundtrack by Leo Erdody, who had previously worked with Ulmer on \"Strange Illusion\" (1945). Erdody took extra pains to underscore Vera's introduction with a sympathetic theme, giving the character a light musical shading in contrast to her razor-sharp dialogue and its ferocious delivery by Savage.\nThe film was completed, negative cut, and printed throughout the late summer and fall of 1945, and was released in November of that year. The total period of preproduction through postproduction at PRC ran from March through November 1945.\nIn contrast, during the period \"Detour\" was in post-production, PRC shot, posted, and released \"Apology for Murder\" (1945), also starring Savage. \"Apology\" was given a shorter production period and a quick sound job, and used library music for the soundtrack. Clearly, \"Detour\" was a higher priority to PRC, and the release was well promoted in theaters with a full array of color print support, including six-sheet posters, standees, hand drawn portraits of the actors, and a jukebox tie-in record with Bing Crosby singing \"I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me\" (1926).\nWith reshoots out of the question for such a low-budget movie, director Ulmer put storytelling above continuity. For example, he flipped the negative for some of the hitchhiking scenes. This showed the westbound New York City to Los Angeles travel of the character with a right-to-left flow across the screen, though it also made cars seem to be driving on the \"wrong\" side of the road, with the hitchhiker getting into the car on the driver's side.\nCharlie Haskell's car.\nThe car owned by the character Charlie Haskell and later driven by Al Roberts is a customized 1941 Lincoln Continental V-12 convertible, a base model of a \"Cabriolet\" but one that features bolted-on rear fender skirts and some exterior components added later from Lincoln's limited 1942 version of the same model. Reportedly, the production budget for \"Detour\" was so tight that director Ulmer decided to use this car, his \"personal car\", for the cross-country crime drama.\nCensorship.\nThe Motion Picture Production Code did not allow murderers to get away with their crimes, so Ulmer satisfied the censors by having Al picked up by a police car at the very end of the film after foreseeing his arrest in the earlier narration.\nReception and legacy.\n\"Detour\" was generally well received on its initial release, with positive reviews in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Hollywood Reporter\", \"Variety\", and other major newspapers and trade publications. Contemporary screenings of \"Detour\" were also not confined to grindhouse theaters; they were presented at top \"movie houses\". For example, in downtown Los Angeles in May 1946, it played at the 2,200-seat Orpheum in combination with a live stage show featuring the hit Slim Gaillard Trio and the Buddy Rich Orchestra. Business was reported to be excellent despite a transit strike.\nShortly after the film's release in November 1945, Mandel Herbstman, the reviewer for the trade journal \"Motion Picture Herald\", rated the production as only \"fair\". Herbstman was impressed, however, with the film's overall structure. \"Venturing far from the familiar melodramatic pattern\", he wrote, \"director Edgar G. Ulmer has turned out an adroit, albeit unpretentious production about a man who stumbles into a series of circumstances which seals his doom.\" He especially liked its conclusion and noted, \"Making no compromise with the 'happy ending' formula, the film has a number of ironic and suspenseful moments.\"\nThe film was released to television in the early 1950s, and it was broadcast in syndicated TV markets until the advent of mass cable systems. TV reviewers casually recommended it in the 1960s and 1970s as a worthwhile \"B\" movie. Then, by the 1980s, critics began citing \"Detour\" increasingly as a prime example of \"film noir\", and revival houses, universities and film festivals began presenting the crime drama in tributes to Edgar G. Ulmer and his work. The director died in 1972, unfortunately before the full revival of \"Detour\" and the critical re-evaluation of his career occurred. Tom Neal died the same year as Ulmer, but Ann Savage lived long enough to experience the newfound acclaim. From 1985 until just two years before her death in 2008, she made a series of live appearances at public screenings of the film.\nCritical response to the film decades after its release is almost universally positive. More current reviewers contrast the technical shoddiness of the film with its successful atmospherics as film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his essay for \"The Great Movies\", \"This movie from Hollywood's poverty row, shot in six days, filled with technical errors and ham-handed narrative, starring a man who can only pout and a woman who can only sneer, should have faded from sight soon after it was released in 1945. And yet it lives on, haunting and creepy, an embodiment of the guilty soul of film noir. No one who has seen it has easily forgotten it.\" \"Sight and Sound\" reviewer Philip Kemp later wrote, \"Using unknown actors and filming with no more than three minimal sets, a sole exterior (a used-car lot) to represent Los Angeles, a few stock shots and some shaky back-projection, Ulmer conjures up a black, paranoid vision, totally untainted by glamour, of shabby characters trapped in a spiral of irrational guilt.\" Novelists Edward Gorman and Dow Mossman wrote, \"\"Detour\" remains a masterpiece of its kind. There have been hundreds of better movies, but none with the feel for doom portrayed by ... Ulmer. The random universe Stephen Crane warned us about\u2014the berserk cosmic impulse that causes earthquakes and famine and AIDS\u2014is nowhere better depicted than in the scene where Tom Neal stands by the roadside, soaking in the midnight rain, feeling for the first time the noose drawing tighter and tighter around his neck.\"\nIn 2007, Richard Corliss, the former editor-in-chief of \"Film Comment\" and a notable film critic for \"Time\" magazine, ranked Savage's portrayal of Vera number 6 on his list of the \"Top 25 Greatest Villains\" in cinema history, placing her just behind Barbara Stanwyck's character Phyllis Dietrichson in \"Double Indemnity\" (1944). As part of his assessment of Vera, Corliss describes her effects on not only her traveling companion Al Roberts but on viewers of the film as well:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0Hell truly is other people\u2014if the person is Vera. Picked up on a trip out west by a man (Tom Neal) fleeing from a death scene, she instantly and spectacularly gets on his and the audience's nerves. When she's not playing the domestic harridan (\"Stop makin\u2019 noises like a husband\"), she's threatening to send him to the gas chamber (\"sniffin' that perfume Arizona hands out free to murderers\"). With a final fatal phone call, Vera leads her poor prey to his motel-room doom. Even in death, she makes the survivor the sucker.\nEddie Muller listed it as one of his Top 25 Noir Films: \"Incredibly, it still casts its fetid, doom-laden spell, every time.\"\nRemake.\nA remake of \"Detour\" was produced in 1992, starring Neal's son, Tom Neal Jr., and Lea Lavish, along with Susanna Foster making her first acting appearance in 43 years and her final appearance on film. Produced, written, and directed by Wade Williams and released by his distribution company, Englewood Entertainment, it was released on VHS and in 1998 on DVD.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Lee, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Richard Edson, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Nunn, John Turturro and Samuel L. Jackson and is the feature film debut of Martin Lawrence and Rosie Perez. The story explores a Brooklyn neighborhood's simmering racial tension between its African-American residents and the Italian-American owners of a local pizzeria, culminating in tragedy and violence on a hot summer's day.\n\"Do the Right Thing\" premiered in the 42nd Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 1989, and was released on June 30, 1989, by Universal Pictures. A critical and commercial success, the film received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (for Aiello's portrayal of Sal, the pizzeria owner). In 1999, it was selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, citing its preservation as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" becoming just the second film to be selected in its first year of eligibility. In 2022, the film was ranked the 24th greatest of all time in \"Sight and Sound\" magazine's decennial poll of international critics, programmers, curators, archivists and academics. It has been featured on many other lists of the greatest films of all time by numerous critics.\nPlot.\nTwenty-five-year-old Mookie lives in Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with his sister Jade, has a toddler son named Hector with his Latina girlfriend Tina, and works as a delivery man at a pizzeria owned by Italian-American Salvatore \"Sal\" Frangione. Sal's oldest son, Pino, is a racist who holds contempt for all the neighborhood blacks. Sal's younger son, Vito, is friends with Mookie, which Pino feels undermines their fraternal bond.\nOther residents of the neighborhood include friendly drunk Da Mayor; Mother Sister, who observes the block from her brownstone; Radio Raheem, who blasts Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" on his boombox; Buggin' Out, a fast-talking young man who talks about black civil rights to anyone who will listen; Smiley, a mentally disabled man who meanders around town with hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.; and local DJ Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy.\nAt Sal's, Buggin' Out questions Sal about his \"Wall of Fame\", which is decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. He demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since the pizzeria's customers are mostly black. Sal refuses, feeling he has no obligation to put other photos on the wall, and ejects him. Buggin' Out attempts to start boycotting the pizzeria, but only Raheem joins him.\nDuring the day, local teenagers open a fire hydrant to beat the heat wave before white police officers Mark Ponte and Gary Long intervene. Mookie confronts Pino about his contempt towards African Americans. Later, Pino expresses his hatred for African Americans to Sal, who insists on keeping the business in the majority African-American neighborhood.\nThat night, Buggin' Out and Raheem march into Sal's and demand that the Wall of Fame include Black celebrities. Sal demands that Raheem turn his boombox off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out badmouths Sal and threatens to shutter the pizzeria for good. Finally, Sal snaps and smashes Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat. Enraged, Raheem attacks Sal. A fight ensues that spills out into the street, attracting a crowd. The police arrive, including Long and Ponte, who break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. As the officers attempt to restrain Raheem, Long begins choking him with his nightstick. Though Ponte and the onlookers plead for him to stop, Long tightens his choke-hold on Raheem, killing him. Attempting to save face, the duo place his body in the back of a police car and drive off.\nThe onlookers blame Sal for Raheem's death, despite Da Mayor's unsuccessful attempts to defuse the situation. Suddenly, Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the pizzeria's window, sparking the crowd to destroy it. Smiley sets the building ablaze, and Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito away from the mob, which turns toward the Korean market across the street to destroy it, too. Sonny, the owner, eventually dissuades the group.\nThe police return with the fire department and riot patrols to extinguish the fire and disperse the crowd. The firefighters, after several warnings to the crowd, turn their hoses on the mob, enraging them and causing more arrests. The next day, Mookie returns to Sal and demands his weekly pay. After an argument, Sal pays Mookie, and the two part. Mookie leaves to visit Hector as Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy announces that the mayor of New York City has founded a committee to investigate the incident and dedicates a song to Raheem.\nAn epilogue shows two quotations that demonstrate the dichotomy of the film's theme\u2014one from Martin Luther King, who claims violence is never justified, and one from Malcolm X, who claims violence is \"intelligence\" when used in self-defense\u2014and dedicates the film to six black people, five killed by police officers (Eleanor Bumpurs, Arthur Miller Jr., Edmund Perry, Yvonne Smallwood, and Michael Stewart) and one killed by a white mob (Michael Griffith).\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nWriter, director, and actor Spike Lee conceived the idea for \"Do the Right Thing\" after discussing a 1986 incident at Howard Beach, Queens, with actor Robert De Niro. This incident involved an attack on African-American men in a predominantly Italian-American neighborhood, resulting in one victim being struck by a car and killed. Lee was also influenced by the \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" episode \"Shopping for Death,\" in which the main characters discuss their theory that hot weather increases violent tendencies, and the killing of Eleanor Bumpurs by police. He wrote the screenplay in two weeks.\nThe original script of \"Do the Right Thing\" ended with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal than Lee used in the film. In this version, Sal's comments to Mookie are similar to Da Mayor's earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground and perhaps Sal's understanding of why Mookie tried to destroy his restaurant. Lee has not explicitly explained why he changed the ending but his contemporaneous notes compiled in the film's companion book indicate Lisa Jones expressed Sal's reaction as \"too nice\" as originally written.\nCasting.\nInitially considering De Niro for the role of \"Sal,\" Lee eventually cast Danny Aiello at De Niro's suggestion. Aiello's son Rick played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. Roger Guenveur Smith, who was pestering Lee for a role in the film, created the character of Smiley, who was not in the original script. Four of the cast members were stand-up comedians: Martin Lawrence, Steve Park, Steve White and Robin Harris. Samuel L. Jackson was chosen for the role of Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy. Jackson later revealed that he spent much of his time on set sleeping as he has no scenes outside. Lee originally wanted Bill Nunn to play the role of Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy but later recast him as Radio Raheem. The acting couple Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, who were friends of Lee's father Bill, were cast as Da Mayor and Mother Sister. Perez was cast as Mookie's love interest Tina after Lee saw her dancing at a Los Angeles dance club. Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set. She had never been in a film before and became upset during the filming of Radio Raheem's death scene.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography commenced on July 18, 1988, on a single block in Brooklyn, New York. The film crew transformed the dilapidated Stuyvesant Avenue, between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant neighborhood, creating new structures such as the Korean grocery store, a functional pizza parlor representing Sal's Famous Pizzeria, and a radio station replacing a burnt-out building. Some characters' residences were set in a former crack house shut down by the production, and the brownstone serving as the home of the only white resident, \"Clifton,\" was a vacant building before filming. Lee organized a block party before principal photography to foster a positive relationship between the neighborhood residents and the filmmakers. Production designer Wynn Thomas altered the street's color scheme, using a great deal of red and orange paint to convey the sense of a heatwave. During filming, the neighborhood's crack dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business, leading Lee to hire Fruit of Islam members to provide security. Filming wrapped on September 14, 1988, with a budget of $6.2 million.\nDuring the final confrontation between Aiello's \"Sal\" and Giancarlo Esposito's character, \"Buggin Out,\" Lee allowed the actors to improvise racist remarks. Esposito, who was of half-Italian and half-African-American descent, found the scene cathartic.\nRadio Raheem.\nThe character of Radio Raheem (Nunn) was the subject of much analysis. In the film, Raheem recites a soliloquy on love and hate, an ode to a similar monologue delivered by Robert Mitchum in \"The Night of the Hunter\" (1955). In this scene, he is wearing brass knuckle rings that say \"hate\" on his left hand and \"love\" on his right. Lee shoots this scene by having the camera replace the position of Mookie, opposite Raheem. Thus, Raheem breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the camera and the audience. This deliberate cinematography frames Raheem's monologue as a moment of sincerity and importance, resulting in the effect of Raheem commenting on black history and the struggle against racism in the real world, on the other side of the camera. Raheem poetically articulates the allure of both love and hate and the constant fluctuation that occurs between these two opposing forces. His monologue can be seen to reveal that the solution to such a nuanced historical issue as racism lies in the combined effort and fluctuation of both forces. In \"The Night of the Hunter\", a serial killer masking as a preacher (Mitchum) speaks of love and hate as an internal struggle within oneself. Raheem's performance of the same topic, however, is portrayed as an external struggle against the outside world.\nCritic Ted Kulczycky comments on Spike Lee's use of direct address in Radio Raheem's soliloquy on love and hate as a \"break from realism\", thus creating an \"atypical effect\". Kulczycky cites the influence of Jean-Luc Godard's film \"Weekend\". Kulczycky describes Raheem's direct address as having the dual effect of reminding viewers of the constructed nature of the film, but also \"fueling their involvement\". The boombox prop used in the film is on display in the \"A Changing America: 1968 and Beyond\" exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\nReception and legacy.\nCritical reception.\nAt the time of the film's release, both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later each ranked it as one of the top 10 films of the decade (No.\u202f6 for Siskel and No.\u202f4 for Ebert). Siskel described the film as \"a spiritual documentary that shows racial joy, hatred and confusion at every turn\", while Ebert lauded it for coming \"closer to reflecting the current state of race relations in America than any other movie of our time.\" Ebert later added the film to his list of \"The Great Movies\". In a retrospective review in 2019, Kambole Campbell of the British magazine \"Little White Lies\" noted the film's lasting relevance and called it \"a bold expression of love and frustration and care and anger that is so vivid and expressive it feels like it exists in the here and now.\" \"New York Times\" film critic Wesley Morris has called \"Do the Right Thing\" his favorite film.\nSome critics were less favorable in their reviews. Dave Kehr of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film two stars out of four; while calling the film \"amiable\", he resented it for employing white guilt and \"seeing violence as a liberating symbol rather than a debasing reality.\" Ralph Novak, writing for \"People\", panned the film as incoherent and having an unclear message and no likable characters: \"If Lee is saying that racism is profoundly painful, frustrating and confusing, no one will argue. But this film states the case without offering any insight.\"\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 92%, based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Smart, vibrant and urgent without being didactic, \"Do the Right Thing\" is one of Spike Lee's most fully realized efforts \u2013 and one of the most important films of the 1980s.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 93 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\", and placing it as the 68th-highest film of all-time on the site.\nControversies.\nAfter release, many reviewers protested its content. Some columnists opined that the film could incite Black audiences to riot. Lee criticized White reviewers in turn for suggesting that Black audiences were incapable of restraining themselves while watching a fictional motion picture. In a 2014 interview, Lee said, \"That still bugs the shit out of me\", calling the remarks \"outrageous, egregious and, I think, racist.\" He said, \"I don't remember people saying people were going to come out of theaters killing people after they watched Arnold Schwarzenegger films.\"\nAn open question near the end of the film is whether Mookie \"does the right thing\" by throwing the garbage can through the window, inciting the riot that destroys Sal's pizzeria. Some critics have interpreted Mookie's action as one that saves Sal's life by redirecting the crowd's anger away from Sal to his property, while others say that it was an \"irresponsible encouragement to enact violence\". The quotations by two major Black leaders used at the end of the film provide no answers: one advocates nonviolence, the other advocates armed self-defense in response to oppression.\nLee has remarked that only White viewers ask him if Mookie did the right thing; Black viewers do not ask him the question. Lee believes the key point is that Mookie was angry at the wrongful death of Radio Raheem, stating that viewers who question the riot are explicitly failing to see the difference between property damage and the death of a Black man.\nLee has been criticized for his treatment of women in his films. bell hooks said that he wrote Black women in the same objectifying way that White male filmmakers write the characters of White women. Rosie Perez, who made her acting debut as Tina in the film, later said that she was very uncomfortable with doing the nude scene in the film:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My first experience [with doing nude scenes] was \"Do the Right Thing\". And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think\u2014that's what was really bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I don't want to do this.\nSubsequently, Perez stated that Lee had offered an apology, and the two remained friends.\nIn June 2006, \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed \"Do the Right Thing\" at No. 22 on its list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever.\nIn the 2021 Cannes Film Festival award ceremony, Chaz Ebert, the wife of the late film critic Roger Ebert, noted that her husband had been appalled that the film had not received any awards from the Cannes jury in 1989, and he had even threatened to boycott the festival as a result. Lee noted that the U.S. press at the time thought the film \"would start race riots all across America\". Drawing loud applause from attending press, he pointed to the continued relevance of the film's story, more than three decades on, saying: \"You would think and hope that 30-something motherfucking years later that Black people would have stopped being hunted down like animals.\"\nAfrican-American avant-garde filmmaker Tony Cokes thought the juxtaposition of both the MLK and Malcolm X quotes was \"muddle-headed politically\" in the same way the riot started by Mookie was absurd as expression/response to things happening to people of color all over NYC's Metro area during the period. He also criticized the narrative as \"producing an uncannily heavy identification with Sal and sons pizza shop as 'victims' of 'irrational black violence' for many critics and white viewers thinking that Radio Raheem deserved what he got from the police and thought the way Lee's construction of situations like the Michael Stewart case functioned was misrepresented and \"a disservice\".\nIt also topped the list of the \"Orlando Sentinel\"'s overrated films of 1989 calling it \"a tiresome combination of sitcom and message movie\" that is \"full of honest anger but expresses little else\". The article also stated that:\nIt's hard to oppose a film that opposes racism without sounding racist \u2013 or at least racially biased \u2013 even if the film is superficial in its approach to the issue.\nAwards and nominations.\nAmerican Film Institute lists\nHome media.\n\"Do the Right Thing\" was released on VHS after its theatrical run, and on DVD by The Criterion Collection on February 20, 2001. It was released on Blu-ray by Universal Pictures on June 30, 2009, for its 20th anniversary. A special edition Blu-ray based on a 4K remaster of the film was released by Criterion on July 23, 2019, for the film's 30th anniversary. It was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Universal Pictures on February 2, 2021, based on the Criterion remaster.\nSoundtrack.\nThe film's score (composed and partially performed by jazz musician Bill Lee, father of Spike Lee) was released in early July 1989 while the soundtrack was released in late June 1989 on Columbia Records and Motown Records, respectively. The soundtrack was successful, reaching the number eleven spot on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and peaking at sixty-eight on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nOn the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart, the Perri track \"Feel So Good\" reached the fifty-first spot, while Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" reached number twenty, and Guy's \"My Fantasy\" went all the way to the top spot. \"My Fantasy\" also reached number six on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart, and sixty-two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Fight the Power\" also charted high on the Hot Dance Music chart, peaking at number three, and topped the Hot Rap Singles chart.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 1990, the film was parodied in a sketch on \"In Living Color\". Many television series have parodied the trash can scene, including \"The Critic\", \"The Boondocks\", and \"Bob's Burgers\".\nThe scene where Buggin' Out confronts the white Celtics fan about scuffing his Air Jordans is parodied in the music video for the 2008 Nelly song \"Stepped on My J'z\".\nIn 2016, Air Jordan released a special Radio Raheem sneaker.\nIn 2014, the film's 25th anniversary, Barack and Michelle Obama praised the film, and said they went to see it together on their first date. This was later referenced in the 2016 film \"Southside with You\" where Barack discusses Mookie's motives with a white colleague after seeing the film.\nIn the cartoon The Critic, Jay Sherman reviews a parody where Mookie throws a garbage can through the window, and Sal thanks him for finding his stolen garbage can.\nDo The Right Thing Way.\nThe section of Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, where the entire film was shot, was renamed Do The Right Thing Way in 2015. The renaming came from a push by Bed-Stuy's city council representative Robert Cornegy Jr. and was included as part of a bill to honor important figures from New York City's history. The renaming was meant to occur in 2014, but was delayed by the city.

The movie was adapted by Jules Furthman from the John Monk Saunders story \"The Dock Walloper\".\nPlot.\nAn American tramp steamer docks in New York harbor sometime in the early years of the 20th century before prohibition. In the bowels of the ship, coal stokers are shutting down the furnaces in the anticipation of shore leave for the night. The bullying third engineer, Andy (Mitchell Lewis), warns the exhausted crew that they will be punished if they return drunk when the vessel sails the following morning. The stokers gather to leer at crude pornographic graffiti scrawled on the engine room wall before debarking to carouse at the local gin-mills. \nOn shore, Andy enters The Sandbar, dance-hall saloon, craving a beer and female companionship. He has an unexpected encounter with his estranged wife, Lou (Olga Baclanova). During his absence of three years, she has become a \"habitu\u00e9\" of the saloon, where she freely enjoys male companionship. The \u201ccouple\u201d join one another for a drink; no love is lost between them.\nThe stoker Bill Roberts (George Bancroft) \u2013 a swaggering brawler when on leave \u2013 rescues a drowning prostitute named Mae (Betty Compson) who has leapt off the dock to end her sordid life. Bill, ignoring the admonishment of his sidekick \u201cSugar\u201d Steve (Clyde Cook), impassively carries the semi-conscious woman to a room above The Sandbar, indifferent to the protests from the proprietor's wife, Mrs. Crimp (May Foster). Lou intercedes to provide first-aid and revives Mae, a fallen angel like herself. Bill's growing awareness of Mae's physical beauty assumes a proprietary quality. He fetches her a beverage from the bar and presents her with a pretty dress he steals from a pawn shop next door. Bill exhorts her to join him for the evening, and Mae, distraught and vulnerable, accepts his invitation. They meet downstairs in the raucous tavern.\nAndy attempts to pull rank and cut in on the couple, but the powerful stoker drives him off with blows. Lou, observing her husband's boorishness, looks on with contempt. Mae and Bill mutually confess their sexual histories to one another, she with regret, he with masculine pride. So as to win Mae's favors for the night, Bill consents to marry her on the spot, and Mae wistfully obliges.\nThe local missionary \u201cHymn Book\u201d Harry (Gustav von Seyffertitz) is summoned and sternly delivers the sacrament. Lou provides Mae with a ring: her own, now superfluous wedding ring. The couple takes their vows, each shamefacedly, and the formerly boisterous patrons observe with mock solemnity, then erupt in cheers when the newlyweds kiss.\nThe following morning, Bill slips quietly from the flophouse honeymoon suite, without a word to Mae. Andy, observing that the stoker is abandoning his \u201cwife\u201d, goes to Mae's room, where she has just discovered Bill's desertion. Andy attempts to force himself on her, but Lou arrives and guns him down. The police suspect Mae of the murder, but Lou confesses and is arrested.\nUnder the blandishments of \u201cSugar\u201d Steve, Bill takes leave of Mae. Driven to distraction by his perfidy, she angrily drives him from her room.\nAboard the steamer, Bill has an epiphany. He bolts from the subterranean furnaces to the sunny deck, leaps overboard and swims to shore. There he inquires as to Mae's whereabouts and discovers that she is in custody at Night Court, charged with stealing the clothing he had bestowed on her. Moments after the judge sentences her to jail, Bill presents himself and confesses to the crime, exonerating Mae. He pledges to reunite with Mae after he serves his 60-day sentence, and she agrees to wait for him.\nProduction.\nOn May 5, 1928, Paramount Pictures announced their next picture would be \"The Docks of New York\"; with Josef von Sternberg enlisted to direct and George Bancroft to star with an adapted script of Monk Saunders's \"The Dock Walloper\" provided by Jules Furthman. Before production von Sternberg and Furthman went to New York to conduct research for the film.\nA highly collaborative work, \"The Docks of New York\" benefited from the screenwriting of Jules Furthman, such that \u201cthe director\u2019s vision...cannot be easily distinguished from Furthman\u2019s scenarios.\" Scripting for Sternberg's most celebrated movies, among them \"Morocco\" (1930), \"Shanghai Express\" (1932) and \"Blonde Venus\" (1932) was provided by Furthmann. Sternberg also benefited from the cinematography of Harold Rosson, who was inspired by the director's \u201cfresh, innovative ideas.\u201d Art director Hans Dreier, formerly of Germany's UFA, created the evocative set for the \"Sandbar\" saloon with its subjective \"demimonde\" atmosphere of Sternberg's New York waterfront. Dreier would subsequently oversee studio production design for decades as head of Paramount's art department.\nProduction began on the film on June 25, with principal photography beginning on July 10, 1928. The production was shot entirely at Paramount Studios where they created sets to resemble the New York City waterfront.\nThe Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, formed by the film industry in 1922, regulated the content of films through a list of subjects that were to be avoided. While Betty Compson portrayed a prostitute in \"The Docks of New York\", this was acceptable as prostitution was not explicitly barred so long as it was not forced (i.e., white slavery) and aspects of her work was not directly shown in the film. The wedding ceremony held in the bar makes later activities in the film ambiguous.\nRelease.\nThe film opened in New York City on September 16, 1928, at the Paramount Theatre and was released on September 29 throughout other parts of the country. The film earned $88,000 in its first week of release at the Paramount Theatre, breaking a record set previously by von Sternberg's 1927 film \"Underworld\", also starring George Bancroft.\nReception.\n\"Variety\" called the film \u201ca corking program picture\u201d and says the film misses greatness by a \u201cwhisker\u201d. They also praised the performance of Bancroft, the direction of von Sternberg, the cinematography of Harold Rosson, and the intertitles from Julian Johnson.\nFilm critic John Baxter observed that \"\"The Docks of New York\"...is today the most popular of Sternberg's silent films, although it did poorly at the box-office on its release.\"\n\"The Docks of New York\" was one of the last films of the silent era. Previewed by the New York City press during the same week that saw the fanfare opening of Al Jolson\u2019s \"The Singing Fool\", Sternberg\u2019s film was \u201ccompletely passed over in the clamor\u201d that accompanied the advent of talking pictures. Film critic Andrew Sarris lamented that Sternberg's film \u201cquickly vanished in undeserved oblivion...confirm[ing] Chaplin\u2019s observation that the silent movies learned their craft just about the time they went out of business.\u201d\nMuseum of Modern Art film curator Charles Silver ranked \"The Docks of New York\" as \u201cprobably the last genuinely great silent film made in Hollywood [rivaling] Chaplin\u2019s masterpieces of the 1930s.\u201d With respect to Sternberg's oeuvre, \"The Docks of New York\" was \u201cthe first in which his prodigious pictorial genius was fully realized.\u201d A \u201cdeceptively simple\u201d and \u2018emotionally affecting film\u201d, Sternberg combined spectacle and emotion, where \"his characters gain in clarity what they lose in complexity.\"\n\"The Docks of New York\" was added to the Criterion Collection as part of the \u201cThree Silent Classics by Josef von Sternberg\u201d series.\nThemes.\nDespite the lurid mise-en-sc\u00e8ne that provides the canvas for Sternberg's imagination, the film is neither \"a crime thriller, nor a hardboiled noir...\"The Docks of New York\" is an elegant and elegiac love story [and] the most emotionally affecting film\" of Sternberg's career.\nA standard melodrama with a \"deceptively simple\" plot, Sternberg does not dwell upon the social conditions of the working class figures; he is \"not concerned with the class consciousness of the characters.\" Rather than striving to be realistic, Sternberg's photography served to \"give visual experience feelings more than facts.\" Through the combination of camera movement (as opposed to montage) and his mise-en-sc\u00e8ne compositions \"that closely resemble German expressionist cinema\", Sternberg conveys a \"deeply felt emotional maturity and raw passion not previously seen on the American screen.\"\nFilm critic William Blick reserves special mention for the film's wedding scene:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The wedding scene is perhaps the most memorable in the film, after Bill has agreed to marry Mae as a dare. In the crowded bar, a preacher is dragged in to issue the vows. Bill takes his vows knowing that he cannot keep them, and Mae earnestly accepts hers while others mock. The sharp contrast between the barroom setting and the solemnity of the wedding vows makes for an interesting paradox; one that runs throughout the film and focuses upon doomed companionship amidst the canvas of the docks of New York.\"\nCritic Andrew Sarris considers the \"sewing\" scene, with its use of \"subjective camera\" the key psychological moment of the film:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Sternberg quietly dramatizes the emotional transition with a scene in which Compson sews Bancroft's pocket after it has been torn by Bancroft's jealous buddy [Clyde Cook]. This pocket, like Desdemona's handkerchief, becomes the visual correlative of the drama, the battleground between conjugal feelings and fraternal loyalties. To emphasize the stakes in this struggle, Sternberg even shifts from an objective to a subjective camera viewpoint by photographing out-of-focus the needle Compson tries to thread through her tears. When Bancroft take the needle away and threads it himself, the domestic irony of the situation takes on a new dimension. It becomes psychologically through this external gesture that Bancroft needs Compson's love more than her care, and that, conversely, Compson has more love in her than care...\"\nAccolades.\nIn 1999, \"The Docks of New York\" was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and recommended for preservation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released in installments between 1961 and 1964 and comprises a prelude and four parts. In 1992, \"Dog Star Man\" was included in its entirety in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and recommended for preservation.\nDescribed as a \"cosmological epic\" and \"creation myth\" (particularly the \"Prelude\"), \"Dog Star Man\" illustrates the odyssey of a bearded woodsman (Brakhage) climbing through a snow-covered mountain with his dog to chop down a tree. While doing so, he witnesses various mystical visions with various recurring imagery such as a woman, child, nature, and the cosmos while making his ascent.\nThe five short films all form one larger film, and they are almost always shown together as one film. In 1965, Brakhage used the same footage from \"Dog Star Man\" and re-edited it into a much longer film, \"The Art of Vision\". Both are generally considered the greatest works of his first mature period.\nBackground.\nAfter editing and completing \"Cat's Cradle,\" Brakhage began filming \"Dog Star Man.\" At the time when he began work on the project, Brakhage had not set on any particular idea on what the project would be about. In addition to this, he had also faced different sets of crisis including the questioning of his distant relationship with his wife Jane at the time, experiencing visions, and contemplations of death and decay. The filming of \"Dog Star Man\" took on gradually as Brakhage also worked on \"The Dead.\"\nStructure.\nEver since he formed the idea of the project, Brakhage had already had a prelude and four parts in mind. \"Dog Star Man,\" like Brakhage's other works, is characterized and known for their abstract imagery and techniques such as scratching and punching holes into the film. While the work is considered difficult and unorthodox by many, there is a general structure to the narrative of the film cycle that comprises the prelude and four parts. \nPrelude.\nThe opening of \"Dog Star Man\" is entitled \"Prelude\" and runs at around 26 minutes, making it one of the longer parts of the film cycle. Brakhage described the \"Prelude\" as a \"created dream\" for the film as opposed to Surrealism in which the work itself is inspired by the dream of the artist. In it, the \"Prelude\" contains many of the images that recur throughout the rest of the film series, creating a visual leitmotif of the many symbols and concepts of the series of films. There are also many instances to what Brakhage calls \"close-eyed vision\". Broadly, the \"Prelude\" exemplifies, among other things, the creation of the universe.\nPart I.\nThe longest of the film cycle, running at about 30 minutes, \"Part I\" comprises most of the narrative of the film cycle in which the woodsman struggles with his journey up the mountain along with his dog. Unlike the \"Prelude,\" where there are many instances of superimposed images that are more abstract to the eye, \"Part I\" is more impressionistic. Major parts of the film are in slow-motion; others, in time-lapse photography, speeding up motion. One of the most important images in \"Part I\" is the mountain that Brakhage attempts to climb.\nPart II.\nIn contrast to the lengthy running times of the earlier films, \"Part II\" begins a series of shorter segments that run from around 5\u20137 minutes. Its central focus is on the birth of a child which was filmed on black and white film stock as a part of Brakhage's home movies that he shot during the time; stylistically, the filming of childbirth in an almost documentary-like way is quite similar to \"Window Water Baby Moving\". Two layers of imagery are imposed over one another, suggesting that the woodsman's life is passing right before his eyes.\nLegacy.\nThe entire film (Prelude and Parts 1 through 4) was named to the National Film Registry in 1992.\nBelow are the individual films of the series and their release dates:\nThe film is part of the collection DVD from The Criterion Collection.\nThe film has received a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews including praise from film critics like J.

Pennebaker\nDont Look Back is a 1967 American documentary film directed by D. A. Pennebaker that covers Bob Dylan's 1965 concert tour in England.\nIn 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In a 2014 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll, film critics voted \"Dont Look Back\" the joint ninth best documentary film of all time.\nSynopsis.\nThe opening scene of the film has Bob Dylan displaying and discarding a series of cue cards bearing selected words and phrases from the lyrics to his 1965 song \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" (including intentional misspellings and puns). This was the first single from his most recent album, \"Bringing It All Back Home\", and a top ten hit in the UK when he filmed it there (a fact discussed in the film). Allen Ginsberg appears in the background having a discussion with Bob Neuwirth.\nThe film features Joan Baez, Donovan and Alan Price (who had just left the Animals), Dylan's manager Albert Grossman and his road manager Neuwirth. Marianne Faithfull, John Mayall, Ginger Baker and Allen Ginsberg may also be glimpsed in the background. Notable scenes include:\nTitle.\nThe original title of this film is \"Dont Look Back\", without an apostrophe in the first word. D. A. Pennebaker, the film's writer director, decided to punctuate the title this way because \"It was my attempt to simplify the language\". Many sources, however, have assumed this to be a typographical error and have \"corrected\" the title to \"Don't Look Back\". In the commentary track to the DVD release, Pennebaker said that the title came from the Satchel Paige quote, \"Don't look back. Something might be gaining on you,\" and that Dylan shared this view.\nProduction.\n\"Dont Look Back\" was shot in black-and-white with a handheld 16mm-film camera and utilized direct sound, thus creating the template for the \"rockumentary\" film genre. Production began when Dylan arrived in England on April 26, 1965, and ended shortly after his final UK concert at the Royal Albert Hall on May 10. Pennebaker has stated that the famous \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" music video that is shown at the beginning of the film was actually shot at the very end of filming. Pennebaker decided during editing to place it at the beginning of the film as a \"stage\" for Dylan to begin the film.\nRelease.\nThe film was first shown publicly May 17, 1967, at the Presidio Theater in San Francisco, and opened that September at the 34th Street East Theater in New York.\nA transcript of the film, with photographs, was published in 1968 by Ballantine Books.\nReception and legacy.\n\"Dont Look Back\" has been very well received by critics. It has a rating of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews. The websites critics consensus reads, \"\"Dont [sic] Look Back\" leaves the mysteries of Dylan largely intact while offering a gripping verite-style account of a pivotal moment in his incredible career.\" The film received a 5-star review from AllMovie and has a Metacritic score of 84, indicating \"universal acclaim\". In August 1967, a \"Newsweek\" reviewer wrote, \"\"Dont Look Back\" is really about fame and how it menaces art, about the press and how it categorizes, bowdlerizes, sterilizes, universalizes or conventionalizes an original like Dylan into something it can dimly understand\".\nKurt Cobain identified it as the only \"good documentary about rock and roll\" in a 1991 interview with his Nirvana bandmates, a sentiment with which Dave Grohl concurred.\nThe film has been parodied and paid homage to by many other films and television shows including \"This Is Spinal Tap\", \"All You Need Is Cash\", \"Bob Roberts\", and \"Documentary Now!\". The opening sequence featuring \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" has likewise inspired many music videos, including INXS' \"Mediate\", MC Evidence's \"The Far Left,\" \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Bob\", Hozier's \"Almost (Sweet Music)\", Kim Gordon's \"Bye Bye 25\", and Margo Price's \"Don't Wake Me Up\", and was cited by journalist Roger Friedman as \"the most copied, most revered, music video of all time\".\nHome media.\n\"Dont Look Back\" has been released and re-released on home video in many formats, from VHS to Blu-ray, over the decades. A digitally remastered deluxe DVD edition was released on February 27, 2007. The two-disc edition contained the remastered film, five additional audio tracks, commentary by filmmaker D. A.

Wilder and Raymond Chandler adapted the screenplay from James M. Cain's novel of the same name, which ran as an eight-part serial in \"Liberty\" magazine in 1936.\nThe film stars an insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who plots with a woman (Barbara Stanwyck) to kill her husband in order to claim a life insurance payment, arousing the suspicion of claims manager Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). The title refers to a \"double indemnity\" clause which doubles life insurance payouts when death occurs in a statistically rare manner.\nThe film was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Widely regarded as a classic, \"Double Indemnity\" is often cited as having set the standard for film noir and as one of the greatest films of all time.\nPlot.\nWounded from a gunshot, insurance salesman Walter Neff stumbles late at night into his empty Los Angeles office. He records a dictaphone confession for claims manager Barton Keyes.\nOne year earlier, Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson during a house call about her husband's automobile insurance. Phyllis asks about getting a policy on Mr. Dietrichson's life without his knowledge. Deducing that she is contemplating murder, Neff wants no part of it but is fascinated with her and struggles with temptation to use his knowledge to outsmart the insurance company. Later, Phyllis visits his apartment, where Neff concocts a plan to have Dietrichson sign an accident insurance policy without realizing it, murder him, and frame it as a train-related accident to trigger the policy's double indemnity clause with a higher payout.\nDietrichson signs the policy slipped in as a \u201ccopy\u201d of his automotive insurance renewal. Before the murder can take place, Dietrichson unexpectedly breaks his leg, delaying and complicating the scheme. Neff hides in the back seat of Phyllis' car while she drives Dietrichson to a train station. Neff strangles Dietrichson, leaving the dead body in the car with Phyllis, while he boards the train posing as Dietrichson, with a fake plaster cast on his leg. A helpful passenger almost foils the plan, requiring Neff to keep his hat pulled low and face averted; to vacate the observation car, Neff sends him on an errand for cigars. Neff jumps off the train at a pre-arranged spot, where Phyllis helps him stage Dietrichson's body on the tracks.\nNeff's boss believes Dietrichson's death a suicide. Keyes, a dogged claims manager proud of his track record in spotting fraud, nevertheless scoffs at the idea he considers statistically implausible. Keyes does find it strange that Dietrichson did not file a claim after breaking his leg. He begins to suspect that Phyllis and an accomplice murdered Dietrichson. Reasoning that Dietrichson was unaware of the policy, Keyes questions Neff, the salesman, who affirms that Dietrichson signed the policy. Based on 11 years of respect and friendship, the ordinarily suspicious Keyes does not question Neff's account. Meanwhile, Neff befriends Phyllis' stepdaughter, Lola, who has a resentful boyfriend named Nino Zachetti, a medical school dropout for lack of funds. Lola tells Neff that she saw Phyllis trying on mourning clothes several days before Dietrichson's death and that she believes Phyllis, her mother's nurse during an illness, had killed her mother to marry Dietrichson. Lola now fears that Phyllis plans to kill her next for the money. Neff now begins to see the extent of Phyllis's manipulations.\nKeyes finds the witness from the train's observation car who says that the man he saw on the train was not the Dietrichson in photos, but fails to recognize Neff, who is present. Neff warns Phyllis that pursuing the insurance claim in court risks exposing the murder, and insists that they should not see each other until the investigation ends. Nino Zachetti has been visiting Phyllis every night since the murder, and Keyes now suspects Nino is her accomplice.\nSuspecting that Phyllis is now manipulating Nino to eliminate him and kill Lola, Neff confronts Phyllis and threatens to kill her. Phyllis shoots Neff, but when he comes closer and dares her to shoot again, she does not. She says that she never loved him \"until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot.\" As they embrace, Neff shoots her twice with her gun. As Neff leaves, he sees Nino walking up to the house. Neff convinces Nino to call Lola and make up with her.\nFinishing recording his confession, Neff looks up to see Keyes, summoned by a janitor who saw blood drippings. When Neff asks how long Keyes has been listening, Keyes responds \"Long enough.\" Asking for a head start, Neff intends to flee to Mexico, but Keyes says he won't make it to the elevator. Neff collapses in the doorway as Keyes calls for an ambulance and the police, and the two wait for them to arrive. Chuckling ruefully, Neff says that Keyes couldn't solve this one because the culprit was too close, right across the desk. Keyes responds, \u201cCloser than that, Walter.\u201d Walter responds, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff\nUncredited\nProduction.\nBackground.\nJames M. Cain based his novella \"Double Indemnity\" on a 1927 murder perpetrated by Ruth Snyder, married to Albert Snyder, and her lover Henry Judd Gray, who colluded with an insurance agent to obtain a $45,000 policy with a double-indemnity clause without Albert's knowledge and then have him murdered.\nCain had become a popular crime novelist following the publication of \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" in 1934, and \"Double Indemnity\" began making the rounds in Hollywood shortly after it was serialized in \"Liberty\" magazine in 1936. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Bros., Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, RKO Radio Pictures, and Columbia competed over the rights to adapt \"Double Indemnity\", but the fervor ended when Hays Office censor Joseph Breen warned in a letter to the studios:\nThe general low tone and sordid flavor of this story makes it, in our judgment, thoroughly unacceptable for screen presentation before mixed audiences in the theater. I am sure you will agree that it is most important...to avoid what the code calls \"the hardening of audiences,\" especially those who are young and impressionable, to the thought and fact of crime.\nIn 1943, Cain's novella was anthologized with two others in \"Three of a Kind\". Paramount's Joseph Sistrom bought the rights for $15,000, envisioning Billy Wilder as the director of an adaptation. Paramount resubmitted the novella to the Hays Office and got an identical response as seven years earlier; Paramount then submitted a partial screenplay to the Hays Office. It was approved with three objections about portraying the disposal of a corpse, the gas chamber execution scene, and the skimpiness of the towel worn by the female lead.\nCain felt Joseph Breen owed him $10,000 for vetoing the purchase of the property for $25,000 in 1936.\nWriting.\nThe restrictions imposed by the Hays Code made adapting \"Double Indemnity\" a challenge. Wilder's writing partner Charles Brackett helped with the treatment before bowing out. Wilder characterized their time apart: \"1944 was 'The Year of Infidelities'...Charlie produced \"The Uninvited\"...I don't think he ever forgave me. He always thought I cheated on him with Raymond Chandler.\"\nCain was Wilder's first choice as a replacement for Brackett; because Cain was working at 20th Century Fox, he was never asked to work on the film. Sistrom suggested Raymond Chandler, whose 1939 novel \"The Big Sleep\" he had admired.\nNew to Hollywood, Chandler demanded $1,000 and at least one week to complete the screenplay, not realizing he would be paid $750 per week and that it would take fourteen. Wilder characterized Chandler's first draft as \"useless camera instruction\"; to teach Chandler screenwriting, Wilder gave him a copy of his script for \"Hold Back the Dawn\". They did not get along during the next four months. Chandler quit once, submitting a long list of grievances about Wilder to Paramount. Chandler did agree to appear in the film, glancing up from a magazine as Neff walks outside Keyes' office; this is the only professional footage of him.\nChandler and Wilder made considerable changes to Cain's story. Because the Hays Code demanded criminals pay onscreen for their transgressions, the double suicide at the end of the novella was not permissible. The solution was to have the two protagonists mortally wound each other. The character of Barton Keyes was changed from a fairly clueless colleague into a mentor and antagonist to Neff.\nChandler felt that Cain's dialogue would not play well onscreen, but Wilder disagreed; after he hired contract players to read passages of Cain's text aloud, he conceded to Chandler. Chandler also scouted for locations including Jerry's Market on Melrose Avenue, where Phyllis and Walter discreetly meet to plan and discuss the murder.\nChandler was a recovering alcoholic. Wilder said that \"He was in Alcoholics Anonymous...I drove him back into drinking.\" An embittered Chandler wrote in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" in November 1945 that \"The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award...but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio.\" Wilder responded, \"How could we? He was under the table drunk...\" Wilder's experience with Chandler drew him to adapt Charles R. Jackson's novel \"The Lost Weekend\", about an alcoholic writer, as his next film; Wilder wanted the film \"to explain Chandler to himself.\" Library of America included the \"Double Indemnity\" screenplay in its second volume of Chandler's work, \"Later Novels and Other Writings\" (1995).\nCain was impressed with the screenplay, calling it \"the only picture I ever saw made from my books that had things in it I wish I had thought of. Wilder's ending was much better than my ending, and his device for letting the guy tell the story by taking out the office dictating machine \u2013 I would have done it if I had thought of it.\"\nCasting.\nSistrom and Wilder wanted Barbara Stanwyck to play Phyllis Dietrichson. She was the highest-paid woman in America. Stanwyck was reluctant to play a femme fatale, fearing it would have an adverse effect on her career. She recalled being \"a little afraid after all these years of playing heroines to go into an out-and-out killer.\" Wilder asked, \"Well, are you a mouse or an actress?\" She was grateful for his encouragement.\nAlan Ladd, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March all passed on the role of Neff. Wilder scraped \"the bottom of the barrel\" and approached George Raft. Since Raft did not read scripts, Wilder described the plot. Raft interrupted, \"Let's get to the lapel bit...when the guy flashes his lapel, you see his badge, you know he's a detective.\" Since Neff was not a cop, Raft turned the part down. This was the last in a series of films Raft declined which turned out to be classics. Wilder realized the part needed someone who could play a cynic and a nice guy simultaneously.\nFred MacMurray was accustomed to playing \"happy-go-lucky good guys\" in light comedies. In 1943, he was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood. When Wilder approached him about the role, MacMurray said, \"You're making the mistake of your life!\" He felt he lacked the skill for a serious part, but Wilder pestered the actor until he relented. MacMurray felt Paramount would never let him play a \"wrong\" role, because the studio carefully crafted his image. Paramount let him take the unsavory role, hoping to teach him a lesson during negotiations for his contract renewal. MacMurray's success in the role came as a surprise to both him and Paramount; he later recalled that he \"never dreamed it would be the best picture [he] ever made.\"\nEdward G. Robinson was reluctant to step down to third billing as Barton Keyes, reflecting that \"At my age, it was time to begin thinking of character roles, to slide into middle and old age with the same grace as that marvelous actor Lewis Stone\". Robinson agreed to take the role in part because he would receive the same salary as the two leads for fewer shooting days.\nFor Jean Heather as Lola it was her credited first film role, for Byron Barr as Nino it was his first film role ever, and for Tom Powers as Mr. Dietrichson it was his first film role since 1917.\nFilming.\nFilming ran from September 27 to November 24, 1943. John F. Seitz was the premier director of photography at Paramount, having worked since the silent era. Seitz was nominated for an Academy Award for Wilder's \"Five Graves to Cairo\" (1943). The director praised Seitz's willingness to experiment. They gave the film a look reminiscent of German expressionist cinema, with dramatic deployment of light and shadows. Wilder recalled, \"Sometimes the rushes were so dark that you couldn't see anything. He went to the limits of what could be done.\" Bright Southern California exteriors contrasted with gloomy interiors to suggest what lurked beneath the facade. The effect was heightened by dirtying up the set with overturned ashtrays and blowing aluminum particles into the air to simulate dust.\nSeitz used \"Venetian blind\" lighting to simulate prison bars trapping the characters. Barbara Stanwyck reflected that \"the way those sets were lit, the house, Walter's apartment, those dark shadows, those slices of harsh light at strange angles \u2013 all that helped my performance. The way Billy staged it and John Seitz lit it, it was all one sensational mood.\"\nFor Neff's office at Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set designer Hal Pereira copied the Paramount headquarters in New York City as an inside joke at the studio's expense.\nStanwyck wears a blonde wig \"to complement her anklet...and to make her look as sleazy as possible.\" Paramount production head Buddy DeSylva did not approve of the wig, remarking that \"We hired Barbara Stanwyck, and here we get George Washington.\" In response, Wilder insisted that the wig was \"meant to show that she's a phony character and that all of her emotions are fraudulent\". A week into filming, Wilder came to consider the wig a mistake, but too much of the film had been shot to remove it; he later referred to the use of the wig as the biggest mistake of his career.\nEdith Head designed Barbara Stanwyck's costumes. Her designs focus on bias-cut gowns, blouses with wide sleeves, and the waistline. Shoulder pads were the style of the 1940s, but they also accentuated the femme fatale's power. In Stanwyck's death scene, her wig and white jumpsuit contrast with Neff's dark suit, creating a chiaroscuro effect.\nWhen Phyllis and Walter dump the corpse on the tracks, they were supposed to get in their car and drive away. The crew shot the scene as written. As Wilder left the exterior location, however, his car would not start. He ordered the crew back and reshot the scene with Phyllis struggling to start her car. Wilder insisted MacMurray turn the ignition so slowly that the actor protested.\nWilder managed to bring the whole production in under budget at $927,262 despite $370,000 in salaries for just four people: $100,000 each for MacMurray, Stanwyck, and Robinson; $44,000 for Wilder's writing plus $26,000 for his directing. Wilder considered \"Double Indemnity\" his best film because it had so few scripting and shooting errors. He marked Cain's praise for \"Double Indemnity\" and Agatha Christie's praise for his adaptation of \"Witness for the Prosecution\" as two high points in his career.\nOriginal ending.\nThe screenplay ends with Keyes watching Neff's execution in the gas chamber. Wilder shot the scene from Neff's perspective, looking out of the gas chamber at Keyes. Wilder shot for five days and spent $150,000 on the scene, which he felt was one of the best he ever directed. Production stills of this scene exist, and the footage may still be in Paramount's vaults.\nHowever, the director ultimately decided to end the film with Keyes and Neff in their office, because \"You couldn't have a more meaningful scene between two men...The story was between the two guys.\" Chandler objected to the change. Joseph Breen felt the execution was \"unduly gruesome\", and its removal settled his office's last issue with the film.\nSoundtrack.\nWilder liked Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa's work on \"Five Graves to Cairo\" and hired him to score \"Double Indemnity\". Wilder suggested a restless string figure to reflect the conspiratorial activities of Walter and Phyllis. He had in mind the opening of Franz Schubert's \"Unfinished Symphony\", which is heard onscreen in the scene at the Hollywood Bowl. R\u00f3zsa liked the idea, and Wilder was enthusiastic about the score as it took shape.\nParamount's music director Louis Lipstone reprimanded R\u00f3zsa for writing \"Carnegie Hall music\"; R\u00f3zsa mistook this as a compliment. Lipstone suggested he watch \"Madame Curie\" to learn how to properly score a film. He felt R\u00f3zsa's music was more appropriate for \"The Battle of Russia\". He expected Paramount's artistic director Buddy DeSylva to agree, but when DeSylva heard the music, his only note was that there should be more of it. The score was nominated for an Academy Award, and the success brought R\u00f3zsa more studio work.\nLocations.\nExterior shots of the Dietrichson house in the film were shot at a Spanish Colonial Revival house on 6301 Quebec Drive in Beachwood Canyon. The production team copied the interior of the house, including the spiral staircase, on a Paramount soundstage.\nThe Southern Pacific Railroad station in Burbank was used in the film with a prop sign for Glendale; the site now hosts the Burbank Metrolink station. Walter Neff's apartment building was located at 1825 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, and the Hollywood &amp; Western Building also appears in the film.\nRelease.\n\"Double Indemnity\"'s first theatrical engagement was at the Keith's in Baltimore on July 3, 1944; the film opened nationwide three days later. It was an immediate hit with audiences despite a campaign against the film by singer Kate Smith. James M. Cain recalled that \"there was a little trouble caused by this fat girl, Kate Smith, who carried on a propaganda asking people to stay away from the picture. Her advertisement probably put a million dollars on its gross.\"\nWhen \"Double Indemnity\" was released, David O. Selznick was promoting \"Since You Went Away\" with trade magazine ads that claimed its title had become \"the four most important words uttered in motion picture history since \"Gone with the Wind\".\" Wilder riposted with an ad of his own claiming that \"Double Indemnity\" were the two most important words uttered in motion picture history since \"Broken Blossoms\". Selznick was not amused, and threatened to stop advertising in any of the trades if they continued to run Wilder's ads.\nReception.\nReviews.\nContemporary reviews of the film were largely positive, though its content made some uncomfortable. While some critics found the story implausible and disturbing, others praised it as an original thriller. In \"The New York Times\", Bosley Crowther called the picture \"Steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length.\" He complained that the two lead characters \"lack the attractiveness to render their fate of emotional consequence\", but also felt the movie possessed a \"realism reminiscent of the bite of past French films\".\nFilm critic and author James Agee reviewed it in 1944: \"In many ways \"Double Indemnity\" is really quite a gratifying and even a good movie, essentially cheap I will grant, but smart and crisp and cruel... \" \"New York Herald Tribune\"'s Howard Barnes wrote it was \"one of the most vital and arresting films of the year\", praising Wilder's \"magnificent direction and a whale of a script\". \"Variety\" felt it \"sets a new standard for screen treatment in its category\".\nRadio host and Hearst paper columnist Louella Parsons said, \"\"Double Indemnity\" is the finest picture of its kind ever made, and I make that flat statement without any fear of getting indigestion later from eating my words.\"\nThe \"Brooklyn Eagle\" was highly complimentary, \"Besides MacMurray, who shows up as a top flight dramatic actor in a role that is a new type for him, and Miss Stanwyck, who has never given a more striking performance, 'Double Indemnity' has a third standout star, Edward G. Robinson, in his best role in many a film...By the way, there's no need to warn the teenagers away from this one; they wouldn't skip it in any case, and besides, 'Double Indemnity' makes it beautifully clear that murder doesn't pay\u2014and certainly the insurance company doesn't, without sharp investigation.\"\nIn the \"Los Angeles Times\", Philip K. Scheur ranked it with \"The Human Comedy\", \"The Maltese Falcon\", and \"Citizen Kane\" as Hollywood trailblazers. Alfred Hitchcock wrote to Wilder saying, \"Since \"Double Indemnity\", the two most important words in motion pictures are 'Billy' and 'Wilder'.\"\nThe film's critical reputation has only grown over the years. In 1977, Leslie Halliwell raved, \"Brilliantly filmed and incisively written, perfectly capturing the decayed Los Angeles atmosphere of a Chandler novel, but using a simpler story and more substantial characters.\" In a 1998 review for his \"Great Films\" series, Roger Ebert wrote, \"The photography by John F. Seitz helped develop the noir style of sharp-edged shadows and shots, strange angles and lonely Edward Hopper settings.\" Pauline Kael stated: \"Every turn and twist is exactly calculated and achieves its effect with the simplest of means; this shrewd, smoothly tawdry thriller is one of the high points of 40s films.\"\nIn \"Empire\", Rob Fraser enthused, \"Film noir at its finest, a template of the genre, etc. Billy Wilder in full swing, Barbara Stanwyck's finest hour, and Fred MacMurray makes a great chump.\"\nThe film holds a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 105 reviews. It scores 95/100 based on 18 reviews on Metacritic.\nAccolades.\nFilmed and released during the dark days of World War II, the film was not popular with the Academy. Wilder went to the awards ceremony expecting to win. The studio had been backing its other big hit of the year, Leo McCarey's \"Going My Way\", and their employees were expected to vote for the studio favorite. As \"Double Indemnity\" kept losing during the awards show, it became evident that there would be a \"Going My Way\" sweep. When McCarey was named Best Director, a bitter Wilder tripped him on his way to accept the award. After the ceremony, Wilder yelled so everyone could hear him, \"What the hell does the Academy Award mean, for God's sake? After all \u2013 Luise Rainer won it two times. Luise Rainer!\"\nLegacy.\nIn 1992, the U.S. Library of Congress selected \"Double Indemnity\" for preservation in the National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nAmerican Film Institute included the film on several lists:\n\"Double Indemnity\" is often referenced as one of the greatest films of all time:\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"Double Indemnity\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nFilm noir.\n\"Double Indemnity\" is a seminal example of film noir. It is often compared with Wilder's other acclaimed film noir \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950). Film scholar Robert Sklar explains, \"[T]he unusual juxtaposition of temporalities gives the spectator a premonition of what will occur/has occurred in the flashback story...Besides \"Double Indemnity\" and \"Detour\", voice-over is a key aspect of \"Mildred Pierce\", \"Gilda\", \"The Lady from Shanghai\", and \"Out of the Past\"...as well as many others.\" Critic and writer Wendy Lesser notes that the narrator of \"Sunset Boulevard\" is dead before he begins narrating, but in \"Double Indemnity\", \"the voice-over has a different meaning. It is not the voice of a dead man...it is...the voice of an already doomed man.\"\nWilder claimed that \"I never heard that expression film noir when I made \"Double Indemnity\"...I just made pictures I would have liked to see. When I was lucky, it coincided with the taste of the audience. With \"Double Indemnity\", I was lucky.\"\nEddie Muller listed it as one of his Top 25 Noir Films.\nAdaptations.\n\"The Screen Guild Theater\" twice adapted \"Double Indemnity\" as a radio drama. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck reprised their roles in the first broadcast on March 5, 1945. Stanwyck appeared again on the February 16, 1950 version, this time opposite Robert Taylor.\nOn October 15, 1948, \"Ford Theatre\" produced another radio adaptation with Burt Lancaster and Joan Bennett. \"Lux Radio Theater\" broadcast one with MacMurray and Stanwyck on October 30, 1950.\nThe movie was remade as a television film, with direction by Jack Smight and a teleplay adapted by Steven Bochco. It aired on ABC on October 13, 1973.\n\"Double Indemnity\" is parodied in 1993's \"Fatal Instinct\". The hero's wife conspires to have him shot on a moving train and fall into a lake so that she can collect on his insurance, which has a \"triple indemnity\" rider. Carol Burnett parodied the film as \"Double Calamity\" on \"The Carol Burnett Show\".\nImitators.\nAfter the success of \"Double Indemnity\", imitators were rampant. In 1945, Producers Releasing Corporation, one of the B movie studios of Hollywood's Poverty Row, financed \"Single Indemnity\" starring Ann Savage and Hugh Beaumont. Marketed as \"Apology for Murder\", Paramount was not fooled by the title change and obtained an injunction against the film's release that still remains in effect.\nSo many imitations flooded the market that Cain believed he deserved credit and remuneration. Cain was also disaffected about the extortionate practices of the film studios which could pay writers thousands of dollars for a copyright and earn millions from the resulting movie. He led a movement within the Screen Writers Guild to create the American Author's Authority, a union that would own its members' works, negotiate better subsidiary deals, and protect against copyright infringement. The AAA never got off the ground, partially due to the growing momentum of the Red Scare.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The short was released on February 28, 1953, as part of the \"Merrie Melodies\" series, and stars Daffy Duck.\nIn the cartoon, Daffy Duck is tormented by an unseen and mischievous animator, who constantly changes Daffy's locations, clothing, voice, physical appearance and even shape, much to Daffy's aggravation, embarrassment and finally rage. Pandemonium reigns throughout the cartoon as Daffy attempts to steer the action back to some kind of normality, only for the animator to either ignore him or, more frequently, to over-literally interpret his increasingly frantic demands. In the end, the tormenting animator is revealed to be Bugs Bunny.\nIn 1994, it was voted #2 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, behind only \"What's Opera, Doc?\", also directed by Jones and written by Maltese. In 1999, \"Duck Amuck\" was added to the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nThe short inspired the 2007 Nintendo DS game \"\".\nPlot.\nThe cartoon's title sequence and opening scene suggest Daffy Duck is to star as a musketeer, and he appears, boldly engaging in an action scene with a fencing foil. As he thrusts the foil and advances, the background abruptly disappears, leaving a plain white screen. Confused by this, Daffy turns to the animator and asks them to complete the scenery. However, the animator fills in a new background that has nothing to do with the previous scene. Daffy returns and starts to repeat his opening scene, but quickly notices the different background and leaves, returning in a different costume and altering his performance to match the new scene. The animator substitutes several different unrelated backgrounds, each time prompting Daffy to change costumes until the background finally disappears completely again.\nWhile Daffy tries to reason with the animator, he becomes completely erased and, upon asking where he is, he gets redrawn as a cowboy with a guitar. Daffy tries to play it, but there is only silence. Using a sign, he requests sound and is granted various non-guitar sound effects. Daffy also finds himself generating random sound effects when he tries to speak, only finally regaining his voice when he becomes enraged and shouts angrily at the animator \"And I've never been so humiliated in all my life!\".\nRegaining his composure, Daffy demands some new scenery and is given an amateurish line-art cityscape background in pencil. Daffy unpleasantly asks for color, prompting the animator to cover him in various colors and patterns, for which he harshly scolds the animator. All but Daffy's face is erased and, upon asking where the rest of him has gone, he is redrawn as a bizarre mismatched creature. As Daffy walks off, he becomes aware of not feeling quite like himself; the animator creates a mirror and, upon seeing his hideous self, Daffy shrieks in alarm before scolding the animator again. Everything is erased and Daffy is redrawn this time in a sailor suit. Daffy seems to be pleased with this and begins to sing \"The Song of the Marines\" as the animator draws an ocean scene with an island in the background, but draws nothing under Daffy, resulting in him falling into the ocean and surfacing on the island. When he requests a close-up, the screen contracts around him, at which he says that is not a close-up and screams for a proper close-up; the camera zooms up uncomfortably close to his angry bloodshot eyes. He walks away muttering a sarcastic thanks to the animator.\nAs Daffy tries once again to negotiate with the animator to have an understanding, a black curtain falls on him. After failing to keep the curtain up, Daffy goes ballistic and rips it apart. Now at the end of his rope, Daffy demands for the cartoon to resume, only to become even more frustrated when the animator attempts to end it. Daffy suggests that he and the animator go their separate ways and, hoping against hope that nothing further will happen, begins a dance routine which is quickly interrupted when the film runs out of alignment, resulting in two Daffys on screen. They argue with each other and almost start a fight, but one Daffy is quickly erased just before the other attempts to get physical.\nDaffy is then drawn into an airplane, which he excitedly flies around in until a mountain is drawn in his path. The plane crashes into it, leaving Daffy with nothing but the plane's steering wheel and windshield. He jumps out of the plane's remains and floats downward with his parachute, which is replaced with an anvil. Crashing to the ground, a disoriented Daffy hammers the anvil while dizzily reciting \"The Village Blacksmith\". The animator changes the anvil into an artillery shell, which explodes after a few more hammer strikes. Daffy finally snaps and angrily demands to know who the animator is, only for them to draw a door in front of Daffy and close it on him. The camera pulls back to show the animator's drawing table and they are revealed to be Bugs Bunny, who says to the audience, \"Ain't I a stinker?\".\nHistory.\n\"Duck Amuck\" is included in the compilation film \"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie,\" along with other Chuck Jones cartoons including \"What's Opera, Doc?\"\nMel Blanc performed the voices. It was directed by Chuck Jones with a story by Michael Maltese. The film contains many examples of self-referential humor, breaking the fourth wall. The cartoon's plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, \"Rabbit Rampage\" (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator (Elmer Fudd).\nThe 1980 television special \"Daffy Duck's Easter Egg-citement\" (notably directed &amp; co-produced by Friz Freleng rather than Jones) features similar interactions between Daffy and an unseen animator in the opening credits and bridging sequences. A similar plot was also included in the episode \"Duck's Reflucks\" of \"Baby Looney Tunes,\" in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. It is done once again with Daffy tormenting Bugs in the \"New Looney Tunes\" episode \"One Carroter in Search of an Artist\" (for this reason, this version has garnered the alternative name \"Rabbit Rampage II\" among series fans) with the technology updated and the pencil and paintbrush replaced by a digital pen, the victim is Bugs Bunny and the animator is Daffy Duck. The ending of the \"Looney Tunes Cartoons\" short \"Rage Rover\", is a reference to the ending of \"Duck Amuck\".\nIn issue #94 of the \"Looney Tunes\" comic, Bugs Bunny gets back at Daffy Duck by making him the victim, in switching various movie roles, from Duck Twacy in \"Who Killed Daffy Duck\",\" a video game character, and a talk show host, and they always wind up with Daffy starring in \"Moby Dick\" (the story's running gag). After this, Bugs comments, \"Eh, dis guy needs a new agent.\"\nA Nintendo DS was published based upon the short, where the player takes the role of the animator and is tasked with finding ways to anger Daffy. The game's ending, triggered once the player sufficiently enrages Daffy enough, reveals that the animator is another Daffy.\nA 2021 segment of the \"Animaniacs\" revival series titled \"Yakko Amakko\" parodies the plot of \"Duck Amuck\", with Yakko Warner explicitly referencing the original 1953 cartoon.\nReception.\nIn 1999 the film was deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. This was the second of three animated shorts by Jones to receive this honor; the others are \"What's Opera, Doc?\" (1957) and \"One Froggy Evening\" (1955).\nAnimation historian Greg Ford writes, \"The duck glowers directly at the camera, the eye contact always implicating us, the viewers, in the cartoon's gleeful sadism. While Mel Blanc's voice acting is masterful, writer Michael Maltese's gags are great, Maurice Noble's mismatched backgrounds are hilarious, and the Disney-derived yet highly defined 'stop and start' animation executed by Ken Harris is extra crispy here, the film belongs to Chuck Jones. It's as if the misadventures that Jones customarily plunged Daffy into throughout the decade have all converged in \"Duck Amuck\".\"\nHome media.\nThe short was included on Disc 2 of the ' DVD box set (with optional audio commentary by historian Michael Barrier), \"The Essential Daffy Duck\" DVD box set, and the ' Blu-ray box set."}
{"id": "73440", "revid": "49829305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73440", "title": "Duck Soup (1933 film)", "text": "Marx Brothers film by Leo McCarey\nDuck Soup is a 1933 American pre-Code musical comedy film written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby (with additional dialogue by Arthur Sheekman and Nat Perrin) and directed by Leo McCarey. Released by Paramount Pictures on November 17, 1933, it stars the four Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo in his final film appearance) and also features Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres and Edgar Kennedy.\n\"Duck Soup\" was the last of the five Marx Brothers films released by Paramount Pictures. In the film, Groucho portrays Rufus T. Firefly, the newly installed president of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo is his secretary, while Chico and Harpo are spies for the neighboring country of Sylvania. Relations between Firefly and the Sylvanian ambassador (Calhern) deteriorate during the film, eventually leading the two countries to war.\nCompared to the Marx Brothers' previous films, \"Duck Soup\" was a financial disappointment, though not an outright box-office failure as is sometimes reported. The film opened to mixed reviews, although this by itself did not end the group's association with Paramount. Bitter contract disputes, including a threat by the Marxes to leave and found their own production company, soured their negotiations with the studio just as \"Duck Soup\" went into production. After the film fulfilled their contractual obligations to Paramount, the Marxes and the studio agreed to part ways.\nWhile contemporaneous critics of \"Duck Soup\" felt it did not quite rise to the level of its predecessors, critical and popular opinion has evolved and the film has since achieved the status of a classic. \"Duck Soup\" is now widely considered to be a masterpiece of comedy and the Marx Brothers' finest film.\nIn 1990, the United States Library of Congress deemed \"Duck Soup\" \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nWealthy widow Gloria Teasdale is asked to give twenty million dollars to the small, financially struggling nation of Freedonia; she agrees on the condition that Rufus T. Firefly is appointed the country's leader. Meanwhile, Ambassador Trentino of neighboring Sylvania is scheming to provoke a revolution in Freedonia in order to annex it. He sends two spies, Chicolini and Pinky, to Freedonia to find out information about Firefly. To his disappointment, Chicolini and Pinky end up spying on the wrong man, but he agrees to give them another chance.\nTo collect information on Firefly, Chicolini and Pinky pose as peanut vendors and station their food cart outside of Firefly's office. Firefly hires Chicolini as Freedonia's Secretary of War. A short time later, Firefly's secretary, Bob Roland, warns Firefly of this scheme. Roland advises Firefly to insult Trentino, hoping that he will slap Firefly in response; this would give Firefly an excuse to ban Trentino from the country. Firefly agrees to the plan, but after a series of personal insults exchanged with Trentino, the plan goes awry when Firefly slaps Trentino instead. The incident brings the two countries to the brink of war. Meanwhile, Firefly and Trentino both attempt to woo Mrs. Teasdale in the hopes of getting their respective hands on her late husband's wealth.\nTrentino learns from Sylvanian spy Vera Marcal that Freedonia's plans of war are in Mrs. Teasdale's possession, and tells Vera to assist Chicolini and Pinky in stealing the plans. Chicolini is eventually caught by Firefly and put on trial, during which Firefly again slaps Trentino. This causes Trentino to declare war on Freedonia; overcome with excitement, everyone at the trial then begins singing and dancing. Chicolini and Pinky join Firefly and Roland in the anarchic battle that follows.\nSome time later, Freedonia is losing the war and army morale is breaking down amidst a series of violent mishaps. Firefly, Chicolini, Pinky, Roland, and Teasdale take refuge in Teasdale's hideout, which is soon overrun by Sylvanian troops accompanied by Trentino. When the Freedonians recognize him, they pin him in a makeshift pillory and throw fruit at him. Trentino surrenders, but Firefly tells him that he will stay in the pillory \"till the fruit runs out\". When Mrs. Teasdale victoriously begins singing the Freedonian national anthem, the four men start throwing fruit at her instead.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Groucho Marx as Rufus T. Firefly, the leader of Freedonia\nCast notes.\nComparing the original scripts with the finished film, most of the characters' initial scripted names were later changed. Only the names of Chicolini and Mrs. Teasdale were kept. Groucho's character\u2014originally named \"Rufus T. \"Firestone\"\"\u2014eventually became Rufus T. Firefly, while the name of Harpo's character\u2014named Pinky in the final product\u2014was given in the Paramount pressbook as \"Brownie\". \"Ambassador Frankenstein of Amnesia\" was quickly changed to Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania. Zeppo's character remained Firefly's son until very late in production, finally becoming Bob Roland, his secretary; also, Mrs. Teasdale's niece \"June Parker\" transformed into Vera Marcal, first introduced as Trentino's \"niece\" before ultimately becoming his companion.\nProduction notes.\nDevelopment.\nThe Marx Brothers' previous film, \"Horse Feathers\", had been Paramount's highest-grossing film of 1932. Encouraged by this success, the studio suggested on August 2, 1932, that they rush out a follow-up. Already at this early stage, the story (provisionally entitled \"Oo La La\") was set in a mythical kingdom. On August 11, 1932, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that production would commence in five weeks with the famed Ernst Lubitsch directing.\nThis was a turbulent time in the Marx Brothers' career. The Great Depression was raging and Paramount Pictures was attempting to stave off bankruptcy. A reorganization of the studio brought fears that money due the Marxes would never be paid; as a result, the Brothers threatened to leave Paramount and form their own company, Marx Bros., Inc. Their first planned independent production was a film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway musical \"Of Thee I Sing\", with Norman McLeod leaving Paramount to direct. During late 1932 and early 1933, Groucho and Chico were also working on \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\", a radio show written by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman; there was even, at one time, talk of casting the two as their radio characters for the new film, an idea that was eventually used by Perrin in the 1941 Marx Brothers film \"The Big Store\".\nBy October 4, 1932, Arthur Sheekman, Harry Ruby, and Bert Kalmar began writing the screenplay for the next Paramount film, which was now called \"Firecrackers\". Herman Mankiewicz was to supervise production, beginning in January 1933. By December 1932, \"Firecrackers\" had become \"Cracked Ice\". Grover Jones was also reported to have contributed to the first draft by Ruby and Kalmar. In \"The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia\", Glenn Mitchell says that \"the first script's content is difficult to determine\".\nOn January 18, 1933, Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar and Grover Jones submitted to Paramount their \"Second Temporary Script\" for \"Cracked Ice\", and Paramount announced that shooting would commence on February 15. This script shows that the basic plot of \"Duck Soup\" was in place. In February, Paramount announced that the title had been changed to \"Grasshoppers\" (\"because animal stories are so popular\"), and that filming was set back to February 20.\nHowever, on May 11, 1933, the Marx Brothers' father Sam \"Frenchie\" Marx died in Los Angeles, and shortly afterward the contract dispute with Paramount was settled. The \"New York Post\" reported on May 17 that the Brothers would make a new comedy for Paramount, called \"Duck Soup\". Leo McCarey was set for direction of the film. Three days later \"The New York Sun\" reported that \"Duck Soup\" would start filming in June. \"Duck Soup\"'s script was completed by July 11. The script was a continuation of Ruby and Kalmar's \"Firecrackers\"/\"Cracked Ice\" drafts, but contained more elements. Many of the film's clever gags and routines were lifted from \"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel\", giving Perrin and Sheekman an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\nTitle.\nDirector McCarey reportedly came up with the title for the film, having previously used it for an earlier directorial effort with Laurel and Hardy. This continued the \"animal\" titles of the Brothers' previous three films, \"Animal Crackers\", \"Monkey Business\" and \"Horse Feathers\".\n\"Duck soup\" was American English slang referring to something easy to do. Conversely, \"to duck something\" meant to avoid it. When Groucho was asked for an explanation of the title, he quipped, \"Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life.\"\nMcCarey also thought up \"the very Laurel &amp; Hardy-like sequence in which Harpo and Chico stage a break-in at Mrs Teasdale's house.\" Another McCarey contribution was the \"mirror scene\", a revival of an old Marx Brothers vaudeville act.\nMirror scene.\nIn the \"mirror scene\", Pinky, dressed as Firefly, pretends to be Firefly's reflection in a missing mirror, matching his every move\u2014including absurd ones that begin out of sight\u2014to near perfection. At one point, the two men swap positions, introducing the question of which is the reflection. Eventually, Chicolini, also disguised as Firefly, enters the frame and collides with both of them.\nAlthough its appearance in \"Duck Soup\" is the best known instance, the concept of the mirror scene did not originate in this film. Harold Lloyd used essentially the same routine in his short \"The Marathon\" (1919). Max Linder included it in \"Seven Years Bad Luck\" (1921), where a man's servants have accidentally broken a mirror and attempt to hide the fact by imitating his actions in the mirror's frame. Charlie Chaplin used a similar joke in \"The Floorwalker\" (1916), though it did not involve a mirror.\nThis scene has been imitated many times; for instance, in the Bugs Bunny cartoon \"Hare Tonic\", the Mickey Mouse cartoon \"Lonesome Ghosts\", \"The Square Peg\" (1959), \"The Pink Panther\" (1963), the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"Cat and Dupli-cat\" (1967), \"Big Business\" (1988), the \"X-Files\" episode \"Dreamland\" (1998), \"\" (2006) and the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Road to Germany\". Harpo himself did a reprise of this scene, dressed in his usual costume, with Lucille Ball also donning the fright wig and trench coat, in the \"I Love Lucy\" episode \"Lucy and Harpo Marx\".\nOther scenes and jokes.\nThe Arden Villa lily pond was a filming location.&lt;ref name=\"cityofpasadena/1145-ATTCH-B\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nFirefly (Groucho) is in Margaret Dumont's room, and unbeknownst to them, Chicolini (Chico) is hiding under the bed. When Groucho leaves the room, she turns her back to prepare for bed and Chico gets up from under the bed, and when she turns around, she is startled to still see him: \n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Your Excellency, I thought you left.\"\n\"Oh no, I no leave.\"\n\"But I saw you with my own eyes.\"\n\"Well, who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe climactic production number ridicules war by comparing nationalism to a minstrel show. One segment is a variant on the old Negro spiritual \"All God's Chillun Got Wings\":\n&lt;poem&gt;They got guns,\nWe got guns,\nAll God's chillun got guns!\nI'm gonna walk all over the battlefield,\n'Cause all God's chillun got guns!&lt;/poem&gt;\nAnother repeated gag involved Harpo, who drives a motorcycle with a sidecar, as a chauffeur, to transport Groucho. Twice, after Groucho gives the orders to Harpo, Harpo rides his motorcycle away, leaving Groucho stranded in the sidecar. Later, Groucho has Harpo sit in the sidecar, while Groucho gets on the motorcycle, the sidecar, with Harpo in it, rides off away, again, leaving Groucho stranded.\nShortly after, during the final battle scenes, \"rightfully [...] called the funniest of all of cinema\", Firefly can be seen wearing a different costume in almost every sequence until the end of the film, including American Civil War uniforms (first Union and then Confederate), a British palace guard uniform, a Boy Scout Scoutmaster's uniform, and even a Davy Crockett coonskin cap. Meanwhile, the exterior view of the building they are occupying changes appearance from a bunker to an old fort, etc. One of Firefly's generals assures him that he has \"a man combing the countryside for volunteers.\" Sure enough, Pinky is wandering out on the front lines wearing a sandwich board sign reading, \"Join the Army and see the Navy.\" Later, Chicolini volunteers Pinky to carry a message through enemy lines; Firefly tells him, \"[...] and remember, while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker \"you\" are.\" Thomas Doherty has described this line as \"sum[ming] up the Great War cynicism towards all things patriotic\".\nThe melodramatic exclamation \"This means war!\" certainly did not originate with \"Duck Soup\", but it is used several times in the film\u2014at least twice by Trentino and once by Firefly\u2014and was repeated by Groucho in \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races\". Variations of this phrase later became a frequently used catch-phrase for Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny in Warner Bros. cartoons.\nIn another scene, the film pokes fun at the Hays Code. Due to the code, a man and woman could not be shown in bed together. The camera begins the scene in a woman's bedroom, panning across the foot of the bed. A pair of men's shoes are shown on the floor, then a pair of women's shoes and then four horseshoes. The camera cuts to a shot of the entire room: Pinky is sleeping in one bed with the horse, while the woman is in another bed.\nThe film's writers recycled a joke used in \"Horse Feathers\" in this dialogue with Chico:\nProsecutor: Chicolini, isn't it true you sold Freedonia's secret war code and plans?Chicolini: Sure! I sold a code and two pairs o' plans!\nThe street vendor confrontations are also well-crafted pieces of physical comedy: Chico and Harpo harass a lemonade seller (comedy film veteran Edgar Kennedy), egged on by his irritation that they have stolen his pitch.\nFirst, there is a scene involving the knocking off, dropping, picking up and exchanging of hats. Later, Kennedy (a much larger man) steals bags of Harpo's peanuts, and Harpo responds by burning Kennedy's new straw boater hat; in return, Kennedy pushes over their peanut wagon. Harpo responds by stepping knee-deep into Kennedy's lemonade tank, where he imitates a stereotypical Italian grape-crushing peasant; this drives off Kennedy's waiting line of customers.\nJust before the Mirror Scene is the Radio Scene. Harpo tries the combination to the safe on a box which proves to be a radio, and it starts blaring the break-up strain of John Philip Sousa's \"Stars and Stripes Forever\". The music continues despite frantic efforts to silence, and finally destroy, the radio, by throwing it out the window, shattering the glass.\nHarpo often doffed his hat on-screen, but Chico very rarely removed his Tyrolean hat, even when indoors. For a few seconds on-screen in the earlier scene, Chico's head is uncovered, revealing a wavy wig. Chico had already started going bald when the brothers appeared in their first Broadway production, \"I'll Say She Is\", in 1924. All of the Brothers' natural receding-hairline patterns were similar, but Harpo and Chico covered theirs with wigs (Groucho later sported an obvious toupee in the films \"At The Circus\" and \"Go West\").\nSoundtrack.\nBreaking with their usual pattern, neither Harpo's harp nor Chico's piano is used in the film, although Harpo briefly pretends to play harp on the strings of a piano.\nThe musical introduction to Groucho's character is similar to those in \"Animal Crackers\" and \"Horse Feathers\", but it did not become closely associated with him as did \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" from \"Animal Crackers\".\nZeppo, playing according to James Agee \"a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man\", sings with the group, including soloing the first few lines of the first song, \"When the Clock on the Wall Strikes 10\". He also sings with the others in \"Freedonia's Going to War\", filling out the four-cornered symmetry as the Brothers sing and dance in pairs during the number.\nOriginal songs by Kalmar and Ruby.\nThe \"Freedonia National Anthem\" is used frequently throughout the film, both as vocal and instrumental; the entire song seems to consist of \"Hail, Hail, Freedonia, land of the brave and free\", contrasting with the final line of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". The \"Sylvania theme\", which sounds vaguely like \"Rule, Britannia!\", is also used several times. \"When The Clock On The Wall Strikes 10\", the first musical number in the film, is part of the same scene as \"Just Wait 'Til I Get Through With It\", Groucho's song about the laws of his administration. \"This Country's Going To War\" is the final musical ensemble in the film. Technically it is the only musical number in the Marx Brothers' films to feature all four of the brothers. However, in \"Monkey Business\", Chico briefly bangs on the piano while the other three play saxophones while eluding their pursuers on an ocean liner.\nThe introductory scene, showing ducks swimming in a kettle and quacking merrily, is scored with an instrumental medley of the aforementioned songs, and it is also the only scene in the film that has to do with ducks and soup.\nReception.\nAlthough \"Duck Soup\" did not perform as well as \"Horse Feathers\", it was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1933, according to Glenn Mitchell in \"The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia\" and Simon Louvish in \"Monkey Business\". However, \"Duck Soup\" was a box office disappointment for Paramount.\nOne possible reason for the film's lukewarm reception is that it was released during the depths of the Great Depression. Audiences were taken aback by its cynicism at a time of economic and political crisis. According to Leonard Maltin in \"The Great Movie Comedians\":\nAs wonderful as \"Monkey Business\", \"Horse Feathers\", and \"Duck Soup\" seem today, some critics and moviegoers found them unpleasant and longed for the more orderly world of \"The Cocoanuts\" with its musical banalities. [...] Many right-thinkers laughed themselves silly in 1933\u2014but a large number didn't. [...] The unrelieved assault of Marxian comedy was simply too much for some people.\nYears later, Groucho's son Arthur Marx described Irving Thalberg's assessment of the film's purported failure during a National Public Radio interview:\n[Thalberg] said the trouble with \"Duck Soup\" is you've got funny gags in it, but there's no story and there's nothing to root for. You can't root for the Marx Brothers because they're a bunch of zany kooks. [Thalberg] says, \"You gotta put a love story in your movie so there'll be something to root for, and you have to help the lovers get together.\"\nMost critics at the time disliked \"Duck Soup\" because of its \"dated\" look at politics. Christopher Null believes that \"the send-up of Mussolini-types doesn't quite pan out. Take the comedy, leave the story.\"\nGroucho did not initially think highly of the film. When asked the significance of the film's politics, Groucho only shrugged and said: \"What significance? We were just four Jews trying to get a laugh.\" Nevertheless, the Brothers were ecstatic when Mussolini took the film as a personal insult and banned it in Italy. Residents of Fredonia, New York, also protested the film because they feared that the similar-sounding nation would hurt their city's reputation. The Marx Brothers quipped in response, telling them to change the name of their town to keep from hurting their movie.\nDespite the tepid critical and commercial response at the time, \"Duck Soup\" is now seen as a classic political farce. Film critic Danel Griffin believes that \"Duck Soup\" is \"on par with other war comedies like Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\" and Kubrick's \"Dr. Strangelove\", only slightly more unnerving in that \"Duck Soup\" doesn't seem to realize it is anything more than innocent fluff.\" Fellow film critic Roger Ebert believed, \"The Marx Brothers created a body of work in which individual films are like slices from the whole, but \"Duck Soup\" is probably the best.\" British film critic Barry Norman considered \"Duck Soup\" the Marx Brothers' best work, and included it in his list of the 100 best films of the 20th century.\nRevived interest in the film during the 1960s and '70s dovetailed with the counterculture of the era. American literary critic Harold Bloom considers the end of \"Duck Soup\" one of the greatest works of American art produced in the 20th century.\nIn 1990, \"Duck Soup\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2000, readers of \"Total Film\" magazine voted \"Duck Soup\" the 29th greatest comedy film of all time. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% rating based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 9.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Fueled by inspired silliness and blessed with some of the Marx brothers' most brilliant work, \"Duck Soup\" is one of its \u2013 or any \u2013 era's finest comedies\". It is also one of the earliest films to appear on Roger Ebert's list of \"The Great Movies\".\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nInfluence.\nThe United States Library of Congress has added \"Duck Soup\" to the National Film Registry, and the film was included in both the original (1998) broadcast of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies and the 2007 update.\nAnother testament to \"Duck Soup\"'s legacy is its influence on Woody Allen's films. Near the end of Allen's \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986), a chance screening of \"Duck Soup\" convinces Allen's character that life is still worth living, and he abandons his suicidal impulses. His earlier \"Bananas\" (1971), a film chronicling the humorous rise of an unlikely dictator, has been dubbed a \"spiritual sequel to \"Duck Soup\".\"\n\"Duck Soup\" is also frequently cited as a major influence on the comedic side of The Beatles, and The Beatles themselves admitted that it was an inspiration for their film \"Help!\"\nThe film has influenced animation as well, with homages appearing in various animated television series. It was spoofed in \"Animaniacs\" as the full-episode sketch \"King Yakko\". One specific gag from the original, the constant singing of the Freedonian national anthem, was spoofed in particular with a Perry Como caricature. Groucho's entrance in the film was borrowed in another \"Animaniacs\" cartoon, \"The Three Muska-Warners\".\nThe film also inspired parts of Sacha Baron Cohen's 2012 film \"The Dictator\". A critic for \"The A.V. Club\" noted that \"Admiral General Aladeen and Rufus T. Firefly share the same bloodline, representing a more generalized contempt for world leaders of any stripe, whether they don a 'supreme beard' or a greasepaint moustache.\" The \"Nashville Scene\" considered the film to be \"an echo here of that funniest of xenophobe-baiting funnies, \"Duck Soup\".\" \"Rolling Stone\" claimed that Baron Cohen's film \"dodges soothing convention and ultimately merits comparisons to The Marx Brothers' \"Duck Soup\" and Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\".\"\nThe company FASA, which publishes role-playing games, derives its name from an imaginary Freedonian version of NASA, the \"Freedonian Aeronautics and Space Administration\".\nHome media.\nUniversal Home Video released \"Duck Soup\" on DVD, unrestored but uncut, as part of a two-disc box set \"The Marx Brothers: Silver Screen Collection\", which includes also the Brothers' other Paramount films, \"The Cocoanuts\", \"Animal Crackers\", \"Monkey Business\", and \"Horse Feathers\". Reviewing the set, film critic Mark Bourne writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Shortly before this DVD set hit the streets, a pre-release report by nationally syndicated entertainment columnist Marilyn Beck stated that \"racially-offensive material\" would be edited from this edition of \"Duck Soup\". Specifically, material \"that has been deplored and debated in the 'We're Going to War' production number.\" Beck didn't say what the exact cut was, or who's doing all that deploring and debating, though presumably she meant the \"All God's Chillun Got Guns\" section. The possibility of new contextually obtuse editing is bad enough. What made her column even more galling was the satisfied tone in her statement that such a \"well-made edit makes the film a pure zany joy without an ugly blot in it to spoil the fun.\" It's a pleasure to report that Marilyn Beck is full of it. No such edits exist in this edition. Another potentially sensitive moment in the film\u00a0\u2014 Groucho's punchline, \"and that's why darkies were born\", a dated reference to a popular song from the '30s\u00a0\u2014 is also still intact.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nReviews\nMetadata"}
{"id": "73441", "revid": "29323357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73441", "title": "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", "text": "1982 film by Steven Spielberg\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (or simply E.T.) is a 1982 American science fiction film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison. It tells the story of Elliott, a boy who befriends an extraterrestrial that he names E.T. who has been stranded on Earth. Along with his friends and family, Elliott must find a way to help E.T. find his way home. The film stars Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton, and Drew Barrymore.\nThe film's concept was based on an imaginary friend that Spielberg created after his parents' divorce. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the unrealized project \"Night Skies\". In less than two months, Mathison wrote the first draft of the script, titled \"E.T. and Me\", which went through two rewrites. The project was rejected by Columbia Pictures, who doubted its commercial potential. Universal Pictures eventually purchased the script for $1 million. Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million. Unlike most films, \"E.T.\" was shot in rough chronological order to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. The animatronics for the film were designed by Carlo Rambaldi.\n\"E.T.\" premiered as the closing film of the Cannes Film Festival on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11. The film was a smash hit at the box office, surpassing \"Star Wars\" (1977) to become the highest-grossing film of all time, a record it held for eleven years until Spielberg's own \"Jurassic Park\" surpassed it in 1993. \"E.T.\" received universal acclaim from critics, and is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. It received nine nominations at the 55th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing in addition to being nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. It also won five Saturn Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. The film was re-released in 1985 and again in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots, visual effects, and additional scenes. It was also re-released in IMAX on August 12, 2022, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. In 1994, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, who deemed it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nA race of diminutive aliens visit Earth at night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. One of them, fascinated by the distant lights of a neighborhood, separates from the group, before U.S. government agents arrive and chase the startled creature. The aliens are forced to depart before the agents can find them, leaving their lone member behind. While the agents search the forest, the creature takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Initially scared by the creature, who runs away, Elliott spends the following day leaving a trail of Reese's Pieces to lure the alien back to the Taylor's home, where he hides the creature in his room. The following morning, Elliott feigns illness to stay off school and play with the creature, whom he dubs E.T. Elliott eventually introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and five-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep E.T. hidden from their hardworking single mother, Mary.\nWhen the children ask about his origins, E.T. displays telekinetic abilities by levitating several balls to represent his planetary system, and later demonstrates other extraordinary abilities by reviving a dead chrysanthemum and instantly healing a cut on Elliott's finger. As Elliott and the creature begin to bond, they start to share thoughts and emotions, the two being simultaneously startled when E.T. accidentally opens an umbrella in a different room. At school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because, at home, E.T. is drinking beer and watching television. Sensing E.T.'s desire to be rescued, Elliott impulsively frees the frogs about to be vivisected in his biology class, inspiring the other children to follow his lead, and romantically kisses a girl he likes because E.T. is watching John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in \"The Quiet Man\" (1952); Elliott is sent to the principal's office for his disruptive behavior.\nInspired by a Buck Rogers comic strip, depicting the character calling for help with a communication device, E.T. builds a makeshift device to \"phone home\", using various parts around the Taylor home. E.T. also learns to speak English, and requests the children's help to build the device. They agree to help find the missing components, unaware that agents are covertly searching for the alien. On Halloween, the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks E.T. into the forest, where they set up the device to call E.T.'s people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the next day. Elliott returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding him pale and weakened in a culvert. He takes him home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveals the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house.\nThe lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott's help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T's arrival a genuine miracle. However, E.T. dies while Elliott rapidly recovers. Left alone to say goodbye, Elliott tells E.T. that he loves him, so E.T.'s heart begins to glow and he is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that his people are returning for him. Elliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael's friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.'s ship arrives, and he says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gifts him the chrysanthemum he previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but E.T. places his glowing finger on Elliott's head and tells him that he will always be there. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as the ship blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nAfter his parents' divorce in 1960, Steven Spielberg filled the void with an imaginary alien companion that he later recalled as \"a friend who could be the brother [he] never had and a father that [he] didn't feel [he] had anymore\". In 1978, he announced that he would shoot a film entitled \"Growing Up\", which he would film in four weeks. However, the project was set aside due to delays on \"1941\", but the concept of making a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with him. He also thought about a follow-up to \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", and began to develop a darker project he had planned with John Sayles called \"Night Skies\", in which malevolent aliens terrorize a family.\nFilming \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" in Tunisia caused a sense of loneliness in Spielberg, far from his family and friends, and made memories of his childhood creation resurface. He told screenwriter Melissa Mathison about \"Night Skies\", and developed a subplot from the failed project in which Buddy, the only friendly alien, befriends an autistic child. Buddy's abandonment on Earth in the script's final scene inspired the concept of \"E.T.\" Mathison wrote a first draft titled \"E.T. and Me\" in eight weeks, which Spielberg considered perfect. The script went through two more drafts, one by Matthew Robbins which deleted an \"Eddie Haskell\"\u2013esque friend of Elliott's, named Lance. Robbins helped create the chase sequence and he suggested the scene where E.T. got drunk.\nIn mid-1981, while \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was being promoted, Columbia Pictures met with Spielberg to discuss the script, after having to develop \"Night Skies\" with the director as the intended sequel to \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". However, Marvin Atonowsky, the head of Columbia Pictures' marketing and research development, concluded that it had limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly young children. John Veitch, president of Columbia's worldwide productions, also felt that the script was not good or scary enough to be financially viable. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia CEO Frank Price, who had already funneled nearly $1 million into the film's development (mostly on creature designer Rick Baker's alien models), was now calling it \"a wimpy Walt Disney movie\". He informed Spielberg that the project was officially being put into turnaround; Spielberg took the project to Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, then the parent company of Universal Pictures. Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film's net profits. Veitch later recalled that \"I think [in 1982] we made more on that picture than we did on any of \"our\" films.\"\nPre-production.\nCarlo Rambaldi, who designed the aliens for \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", was hired to design the animatronics for \"E.T.\" Rambaldi's own painting \"Women of Delta\" led him to give the creature a unique, extendable neck. Its face was inspired by those of Carl Sandburg, Albert Einstein and Ernest Hemingway. Producer Kathleen Kennedy visited the Jules Stein Eye Institute to study real and glass eyes. She hired Institute staffers to create E.T.'s eyes, which she felt were particularly important in engaging the audience. Four heads were created for filming, one as the main animatronic and the others for facial expressions, as well as a costume. A team of puppeteers controlled E.T.'s face with animatronics. Two little people, Tamara De Treaux and Pat Bilon, as well as 12-year-old Matthew DeMeritt, who was born without legs, took turns wearing the costume, depending on what scene was being filmed. DeMeritt actually walked on his hands and played all scenes where E.T. walked awkwardly or fell over. The head was placed above that of the actors, and the actors could see through slits in its chest. Caprice Roth, a professional mime, filled prosthetics to play E.T.'s hands. The puppet was created in three months at the cost of $1.5million. Spielberg declared that it was \"something that only a mother could love\".\nMars, Incorporated refused to allow M&amp;M's to be used in the film, believing that E.T. would frighten children. The Hershey Company was asked if Reese's Pieces could be used, and it agreed. This product placement resulted in a large increase in Reese's Pieces sales.\nScience and technology educator Henry Feinberg created E.T.'s communicator device.\nCasting.\nHaving worked with Cary Guffey on \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", Spielberg felt confident in working with a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys, including Keith Coogan; before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the film \"Raggedy Man\", which Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt that Drew Barrymore had the right imagination for the mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said that the experience made him feel ready to be a father. Ralph Macchio was considered for the role of Tyler, before it went to his eventual \"The Outsiders\" co-star C. Thomas Howell.\nThe major voice work of E.T. for the film was performed by Pat Welsh. She smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, which gave her voice a quality that sound effects creator Ben Burtt liked. She spent nine-and-a-half hours recording her part, and was paid $380 by Burtt for her services. He also recorded 16 other people and various animals to create E.T.'s \"voice\". These included Spielberg, actress Debra Winger, his sleeping wife sick with a cold, a burp from his University of Southern California film professor, raccoons, otters, and horses.\nDoctors working at the USC Medical Center were recruited to play the ones who try to save E.T. after government agents take over Elliott's house. Spielberg felt that actors in the roles, performing lines of technical medical dialogue, would come across as unnatural. During post-production, he decided to cut a scene featuring Harrison Ford as the principal at Elliott's school. It featured his character reprimanding Elliott for his behavior in biology class and warning of the dangers of underage drinking. He is then taken aback as Elliott's chair rises from the floor, while E.T. is levitating his \"phone\" equipment up the stairs with Gertie. Ford's face is never seen. The footage of this scene was included on the film's 1996 LaserDisc release as a bonus feature. It was not included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases that followed.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography began in neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and in the San Fernando Valley on September 8, 1981. The project was filmed under the cover name \"A Boy's Life\", as Spielberg did not want anyone to discover and plagiarize the plot. The actors had to read the script behind closed doors, and everyone on set had to wear an ID card. The shoot began with two days at Culver City High School, and the crew spent the next 11 days moving between locations at Northridge and Tujunga. The next 42 days were spent at Laird International Studios in Culver City for the interiors of Elliott's home. The crew shot at a redwood forest near Crescent City in Northern California for the production's last six days. The exterior Halloween scene and the \"flying bicycle\" chase scenes were filmed in Porter Ranch.\nSpielberg shot the film in roughly chronological order to achieve convincing emotional performances from his cast; it was also done to help the child actors with the workload. Spielberg calculated that the film would hit home harder if the children were really saying goodbye to E.T. at the end. In the scene in which Michael first encounters E.T., his appearance caused MacNaughton to jump back and knock down the shelves behind him. The chronological shoot gave the young actors an emotional experience as they bonded with E.T., making the quarantine sequences more moving. Spielberg ensured that the puppeteers were kept away from the set to maintain the illusion of a real alien. For the first time in his career, Spielberg did not storyboard most of the film, in order to facilitate spontaneity in the performances. The film was shot so adults, except for Dee Wallace, are never seen from the waist up in its first half, as a tribute to the cartoons of Tex Avery. According to Spielberg, the scene in which E.T. disguises himself as a stuffed toy in Elliott's closet was suggested by fellow director Robert Zemeckis after he read a draft of the screenplay that Spielberg had sent him. In between takes, the young actors spent time doing activities such as riding bicycles around the sound stages, playing \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", the game that Elliott, Michael, Steve, Tyler, and Greg play in a scene early in the film, and attending school lessons. The shoot was completed in 61 days, four ahead of schedule.\nIn a 2022 interview, Sean Frye, who played Steve, revealed how the visual effect close-up shots for the climax of the \"flying bicycle\" chase scene were filmed and reflected on the experience, saying: \"We were on these rigs ... They're pulling the trees backwards, past us on tracks, so it looks like we're going through and up and through and over to create this illusion that we're going forward when we're going nowhere. Then the pushing and pulling of the things so that the bike is up and down, and we can get the 'Whoaaaa' effects. That was great.\" BMX riders Robert Cardoza, Greg Maes, and David Lee served as stunt doubles for the scene.\nMusic.\nSpielberg's regular collaborator John Williams described the challenge of creating a score that would generate sympathy for such an odd-looking creature. As with their previous collaborations, Spielberg liked every theme Williams composed and had it included. Spielberg loved the music for the final chase so much that he edited the sequence to suit it. Williams took a modernist approach, especially with his use of polytonality, which refers to the sound of two different keys played simultaneously. The Lydian mode can also be used in a polytonal way. Williams combined polytonality and the Lydian mode to express a mystic, dreamlike and heroic quality. His theme, emphasizing coloristic instruments such as the harp, piano, celesta, and other keyboards, as well as percussion, suggests E.T.'s childlike nature and his \"machine\". The soundtrack album was first released on June 11, 1982, the same day as the film. An audiobook companion album featuring Williams's score, produced by Quincy Jones and narrated by Michael Jackson, was released on November 15, 1982, exactly two weeks prior to Jackson's acclaimed sixth studio album \"Thriller\".\nThemes.\nSpielberg drew the story of the film from his parents' divorce. Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"essentially a spiritual autobiography, a portrait of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination.\" References to Spielberg's childhood occur throughout: Elliott fakes illness by holding a thermometer to the bulb in his lamp while covering his face with a heating pad, a trick frequently employed by the young Spielberg. Michael picking on Elliott echoes Spielberg's teasing of his younger sisters, and Michael's evolution from tormentor to protector reflects how Spielberg had to take care of his sisters after their father left.\nCritics have focused on the parallels between the lives of E.T. and Elliott, who is \"alienated\" by the loss of his father. Pauline Kael noted that \"Elliot (his name begins with an 'E' and ends with a T.') is a dutiful, too sober boy who never takes off his invisible thinking cap; the telepathic communication he develops with E.T. eases his cautious, locked-up worries, and he begins to act on his impulses.\" A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote that while E.T. \"is the more obvious and desperate foundling,\" Elliott \"suffers in his own way from the want of a home.\" At the film's heart is the theme of growing up. Some critics have suggested that Spielberg's portrayal of suburbia is very dark, contrary to popular belief. According to A.O. Scott, \"the suburban milieu, with its unsupervised children and unhappy parents, its broken toys and brand-name junk food, could have come out of a Raymond Carver story.\" Charles Taylor of Salon.com wrote that \"Spielberg's movies, despite the way they're often characterized, are not Hollywood idealizations of families and the suburbs. The homes here bear what the cultural critic Karal Ann Marling called 'the marks of hard use'.\" Relatedly, scholarship has emerged on the film regarding its subversion of the nuclear family dynamic, in which Elliott is growing up with a physically absent father and an emotionally absent mother; this aspect of the movie offers an exploration of upbringing within a nontraditional family structure.\nOther critics found religious parallels between E.T. and Jesus. Andrew Nigels described E.T.'s story as \"crucifixion by military science\" and \"resurrection by love and faith.\" According to Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride, Universal Pictures appealed directly to the Christian market, with a poster reminiscent of Michelangelo's \"The Creation of Adam\" (more specifically the \"fingers touching\" detail) and a logo reading \"Peace\". Spielberg answered that he did not intend the film to be a religious parable, joking, \"If I ever went to my mother and said, 'Mom, I've made this movie that's a Christian parable,' what do you think she'd say? She has a Kosher restaurant on Pico and Doheny in Los Angeles.\"\nSeveral writers have seen the movie as a modern fairy tale. Critic Henry Sheehan described the film as a retelling of Peter Pan from the perspective of a Lost Boy (Elliott): E.T. cannot survive physically on Earth, as Pan could not survive emotionally in Neverland; government scientists take the place of Neverland's pirates. Furthering the parallels, there is a scene in the film where Mary reads \"Peter Pan\" to Gertie. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" similarly observed that the film \"freely recycles elements from\" \"Peter Pan\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\". Kael writes that \"from the opening in the dense, vernal woodland that adjoins Elliot's suburb (it's where we first hear E.T.'s frightened sounds), the film has the soft, mysterious inexorability of the classic tale of enchantment. The little shed in the back of the house where Elliott tosses in a ball and E.T. sends it back is part of a dreamscape.\"\nProducer Kathleen Kennedy noted that an important theme of the film is tolerance, which would be central to future Spielberg films such as \"Schindler's List\". Having been a loner as a teenager, Spielberg described it as \"a minority story\". Spielberg's characteristic theme of communication is partnered with the ideal of mutual understanding; he has suggested that the story's central alien-human friendship is an analogy for how real-world adversaries can learn to overcome their differences.\nReception.\nRelease and sales.\n\"E.T.\" was previewed in Houston, Texas, and premiered at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival's closing gala on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. It opened at number one at the US box office with a gross of $11million, and stayed at the top of the box office for six weeks; it then fluctuated between the first and second positions until October, before returning to the top spot for the final time in December following a Christmas re-release. In its second weekend, it recorded the highest-grossing second weekend of all time, surpassing the record of $10,765,687 set by \"Superman II\" in 1981. In its fourth weekend, it recorded the highest-grossing weekend of all time, surpassing the record of $16,706,592 set earlier that year by \"Rocky III\". It had a record eight weekends with a gross of over $10 million, a feat not matched until \"Home Alone\" (1990), and set a record for being at number one for 16 weeks in total.\nThe film began its international rollout in Australia on November 26, 1982, and grossed $839,992 in its first 10 days from nine theatres, setting five weekly house records and 43 daily records. In South Africa, it opened in late November and grossed $724,340 in eight days from 14 screens, setting 13 weekly highs. In France, it opened on December 1, and had 930,000 admissions in its first five days on 250 screens, setting an all-time record in Paris for most daily admissions (Saturday, December 4). In Japan, it opened on December 4, and grossed $1,757,527 in two days from 35 theatres in 11 cities, setting 10 house records on Saturday and 14 on Sunday. In the United Kingdom, it opened on December 9 after a charity performance in London and grossed a record \u00a31 million in its opening weekend. The film added another 138 screens in Japan on December 11, with advance sales of 1.3 million tickets. It later opened in the Philippines in January 1983. In Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the film had minimum age ratings of 8, 12, and 11, respectively, while Denmark had no minimum age limit. There were Swedish people who were opposed to the age limit.\nIn 1983, \"E.T.\" surpassed \"Star Wars\" to become the highest-grossing film of all time; by the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $359million in the United States and Canada and $619million worldwide. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 120million tickets in its initial U.S. theatrical run. Spielberg earned $500,000 a day from his share of the profits, while The Hershey Company's profits rose 65% due to the film's prominent placement of Reese's Pieces. The \"Official E.T. Fan Club\" offered photographs, a newsletter that let readers \"relive the film's unforgettable moments [and] favorite scenes\", and a vinyl record with \"phone home\" and other sound clips.\nThe film was also a merchandising success, with dolls selling 15 million units by September 1982 and becoming the best-selling toy that Christmas season. \"E.T.\" went on to generate over $ in merchandise sales by 1998. Following the success of the film, Kuwahara, the company that created the BMX bikes featured in the film, began producing red and white \"E.T.\" models in three price and quality levels. Kuwahara reissued the E.T. model in 2002, as part of the film's 20th anniversary, and again in 2022 as part of the film's 40th anniversary.\nThe film was re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60million and $68million respectively, for a worldwide total of $792million with $435million from the United States and Canada. It held the global record until it was surpassed by \"Jurassic Park\", another Spielberg film, in 1993, although it managed to hold on to the United States and Canada record for a further four years, until the release of the Special Edition of \"Star Wars\".\nIt was re-released in IMAX on August 12, 2022, in the United States and Canada, to commemorate the film's 40th anniversary, alongside an IMAX and RealD 3D reissue of another Spielberg film \"Jaws\" scheduled for September 2. Jim Orr, Universal's president of distribution remarked \"No filmmaker, it's fair to say, has had a greater or more enduring impact on American cinema or has created more indelible cinematic memories for tens of billions of people worldwide. We couldn't think of a more perfect way to celebrate the anniversary of \"E.T.\" and the first Universal-Spielberg summer blockbuster, \"Jaws\", than to allow audiences to experience these films in a way they've never been able to before.\" The IMAX release grossed $490,000 on its first day from 389 theaters, for a three-day total of $1.07 million and a $438million running total.\nThe film would remain one of Universal's top three highest-grossing films of all time in North America, behind \"Jurassic World\" (2015) and \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" (2023), until 2024 with the release of \"Wicked\", the first installment of the musical's two-part film adaptation. As of 2025, the film remains the studio's fifteenth highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.\nHome media.\n\"E.T.\" was eventually released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 27, 1988. The videos were priced with a recommended retail price of $24.95, the lowest initial price at the time for a major movie compared to the normal price of $89.95. To combat piracy, the tape guards and tape hubs on the videocassettes were colored green, and the tape itself was affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on a credit card), and encoded with Macrovision. The film doubled the record pre-orders of \"Cinderella\" released the same month and went on to sell over 15million VHS units in the United States, and grossed over $ in video sales revenue. The VHS cassette was also rented over six million times during its first two weeks in 1988, a record it held until the VHS release of \"Batman\" the following year. Conservative Christians who were still angry about Universal's release of \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" earlier in the year called for a boycott of this release. Initial orders internationally exceeded $30 million despite the film often being sold at full price, setting records in the United Kingdom with over 81,000 units and Australia with 35,500 units. It initially shipped 152,000 units in Japan and 87,000 in Germany. In 1991, Sears began selling \"E.T.\" videocassettes exclusively at their stores as part of a holiday promotion. It was reissued on VHS and LaserDisc again in 1996, with the latter including a 90-minute documentary produced and directed by Laurent Bouzereau; it included interviews with Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy, composer John Williams, and other cast and crew members, as well as two theatrical trailers, an isolated music score, deleted scenes, and still galleries. The VHS included a 10-minute version of the same documentary from the LaserDisc. Both 1996 home video releases of the film were also THX certified as well. The 2012 release of \"E.T.\" on DVD and Blu-ray grossed $ in sales revenue as of 2017[ [update]] in the United States.\nCritical response.\nRoger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, \"It works as science fiction, it's sometimes as scary as a monster movie, and at the end, when the lights go up, there's not a dry eye in the house.\" He later added it to his canon of \"Great Movies\", structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about watching it with them. Of the scene with the flying bicycles, he writes: \"I remember when I saw the movie at Cannes: Even the audience there, people who had seen thousands of movies, let out a whoop at that moment.\" \nPauline Kael for \"The New Yorker\" wrote \"Spielberg respects the conventions of children's stories, and because he does he's able to create the atmosphere for a mythic experience\" going on to say \"Spielberg has earned the tears that some people in the audience, and not just children, shed.\"\nMichael Sragow of \"Rolling Stone\" called Spielberg \"a space age Jean Renoir... for the first time, [he] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings\". Derek Malcolm of \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"\"E.T.\" is a superlative piece of popular cinema [...] a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children but anyone able to remember being one\". Leonard Maltin included it in his list of \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\" as one of only two movies from the 1980s. Political commentator George Will was one of few to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.\nJohn Nubbin reviewed \"E.T.\" for \"Different Worlds\" magazine and stated that \"\"E.T.\" is a totally enjoyable film. The detail lavished on the movie makes it an exquisite viewing experience well above the crowd of the summer releases.\"\nThe film holds a 99% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 146 reviews, and an average rating of 9.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Playing as both an exciting sci-fi adventure and a remarkable portrait of childhood, Steven Spielberg's touching tale of a homesick alien remains a piece of movie magic for young and old.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 92/100 based on 30 reviews. In addition to the film's wide acclaim, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were moved by it after a screening at the White House on June 27, 1982. Princess Diana was in tears after watching it. On September 17, 1982, it was screened at the United Nations, and Spielberg received a UN Peace Medal. CinemaScore reported that audiences polled during the opening weekend gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, the first film to earn that grade.\nAccolades.\nThe film was nominated for nine Oscars at the 55th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. \"Gandhi\" won that award, but its director, Richard Attenborough, said, \"I was certain that not only would \"E.T.\" win, but that it should win. It was inventive, powerful, wonderful. I make more mundane movies.\" \"E.T.\" won four Academy Awards: Best Original Score, Best Sound (Robert Knudson, Robert Glass, Don Digirolamo, and Gene Cantamessa), Best Sound Effects Editing (Charles L. Campbell and Ben Burtt), and Best Visual Effects (Carlo Rambaldi, Dennis Muren, and Kenneth F. Smith). At the 40th Golden Globe Awards, the film won Best Picture in the Drama category and Best Original Score; it was also nominated for Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best New Male Star for Henry Thomas. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association awarded the film Best Picture, Best Director, and a \"New Generation Award\" for Melissa Mathison. The film won Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Writing, Best Special Effects, Best Music, and Best Poster Art, while Henry Thomas, Robert McNaughton, and Drew Barrymore won Young Artist Awards. In addition to his Academy, Golden Globe and Saturn, composer John Williams won two Grammy Awards and a BAFTA for the score. The film's audiobook album also won the Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards in 1984.\nLegacy.\nIn American Film Institute polls, the film has been voted the 24th greatest film of all time, the 44th most heart-pounding, and the sixth most inspiring. Other AFI polls rated it as having the 14th greatest music score and as the third greatest science-fiction one. The line \"E.T. phone home\" was ranked 15th on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list, and 48th on \"Premiere\"'s top movie quote list. In 2005, it topped a Channel 4 poll in the UK of the 100 greatest family films, and was listed by \"Time\" as one of the 100 best movies ever made. The February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"E.T.\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nIn 2003, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the film the eighth most \"tear-jerking\"; in 2007, in a survey of both films and television series, the magazine declared it the seventh greatest work of science-fiction media in the past 25 years. \"The Times\" also named it as their ninth favorite alien in a film, calling it \"one of the best-loved non-humans in popular culture\". It is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. In 1994, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2011, ABC aired \"Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time\", revealing the results of a poll of fans conducted by ABC and \"People\" magazine: It was selected as the fifth best film of all time and the second best science fiction film. On October 22, 2012, Madame Tussauds unveiled wax likenesses of E.T. at six of its international locations.\nA species of sponge, \"Advhena magnifica\", was given the common name \"E.T. sponge\" due to its resemblance of the creature.\nIn 2023, actress Rita Moreno, who starred in Spielberg's 2021 film adaptation of the musical \"West Side Story\", named \"E.T.\" as one of her top five favorite films, saying \"Number one, it has superb child actors, which can really only happen because of Steven Spielberg. He is just great with children because he's like a child himself. It's a very interesting phenomenon.\"\nElements of the film, particularly the story, iconography and musical score, would go on to influence or be referenced in other media, including the films \"Back to the Future\" (1985), \"Stand by Me\" (1986), \"Super 8\" (2011), \"Arrival\" (2016), \"Nope\" (2022) and \"Elio\" (2025), as well as the Netflix series \"Stranger Things\" (2016\u20132025).\n20th anniversary version.\nAn extended version of the film, dubbed the \"Special Edition\" (currently out of circulation), including altered dialogue and visual effects, premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on March 16, 2002; it was released on home media six days later. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. The first flying sequence where Elliott and E.T. fly on their bicycle through the forest now had the cape of Elliott's Halloween costume flap in the wind as it appeared to have originally been intended to be, a change done to have the sequence, particularly the iconic shot of them flying past the Moon, match the film's poster and the logo of Spielberg's production company Amblin Entertainment.\nScenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Mary's dialogue, during the offscreen argument with Michael about his Halloween costume, was altered to replace the word \"terrorist\" with \"hippie\" in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies. Spielberg later admitted that he regretted editing out the guns from the film, stating that the film should be left untouched to represent the culture of its time.\nAt the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the score. The new release grossed $68million in total, with $35million coming from Canada and the United States. The changes to it, particularly the escape scene, were criticized as political correctness. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" wondered \"Remember those guns the feds carried? Thanks to the miracle of digital, they're now brandishing walkie-talkies... Is this what two decades have done to free speech?\" Chris Hewitt of \"Empire\" wrote, \"The changes are surprisingly low-key... while ILM's CGI E.T. is used sparingly as a complement to Carlo Rambaldi's extraordinary puppet.\" \"South Park\" ridiculed many of the changes in the 2002 episode \"Free Hat\".\nThe two-disc DVD release which followed on October 22, 2002, contained the original theatrical and 20th Anniversary extended versions of the film. The features on disc one included deleted scenes, an introduction with Spielberg, a \"Reunion\" featurette and a \"Look Back\" featurette. Disc two included a 24-minute documentary about the 20th Anniversary edition changes, a 20th Anniversary premiere featurette, John Williams' performance at the 2002 premiere, a Space Exploration game, a trailer, cast and filmmaker bios, production notes, and the still galleries ported from the 1996 LaserDisc set. The two-disc edition, as well as a three-disc collector's edition containing a \"making of\" book, a certificate of authenticity, a film cell, and special features that were unavailable on the two-disc edition, were placed in moratorium on December 31, 2002. Later, it was re-released on DVD as a single-disc re-issue in 2005, featuring only the 20th Anniversary version.\nIn a June 2011, interview, Spielberg said,\n[In the future,] ... There's going to be no more digital enhancements or digital additions to anything based on any film I direct... When people ask me which \"E.T.\" they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 \"E.T.\" If you notice, when we did put out \"E.T.\" we put out two \"E.T.\"s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always tell people to go back to the '82 version.\nFor the film's 30th anniversary release on Blu-ray in 2012 and for its 35th anniversary release on Ultra HD Blu-ray in 2017, as well as its corresponding digital releases, only the original theatrical edition was released, with the 20th anniversary edition now out of circulation.\nOther portrayals.\nAtari, Inc. produced a video game based on the film for the Atari 2600 and hired Howard Scott Warshaw to program the game. The game was rushed in five weeks to release within the 1982 Christmas season. Released in Christmas 1982, the game was critically panned, with nearly every aspect of the game facing heavy criticism. It has since been considered to be one of the worst video games ever made. It was also a commercial failure. It has been cited as a major contributing factor to the video game industry crash of 1983, and has been frequently referenced and mocked in popular culture as a cautionary tale about the dangers of rushed game development and studio interference. In what was initially deemed an urban legend, reports from 1983 stated that as a result of overproduction and returns, millions of unsold cartridges were secretly buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill and covered with a layer of concrete. In April 2014, diggers hired to investigate the claim confirmed that the Alamogordo landfill contained many E.T. cartridges, among other games.\nWilliam Kotzwinkle, author of the film's novelization, wrote a sequel, \"E.T.: The Book of the Green Planet\", which was published in 1985. In the novel, E.T. returns home to the planet Brodo Asogi, but is subsequently demoted and sent into exile. He attempts to return to Earth by effectively breaking all of Brodo Asogi's laws.\nE.T. Adventure, a theme park ride based on the film and drawing inspiration from \"The Book of the Green Planet\", debuted at Universal Studios Florida on June 7, 1990. The $40million attraction features the title character saying goodbye to visitors by name, along with his home planet. In 1998, E.T. was licensed to appear in television public service announcements produced by the Progressive Corporation. The announcements featured his voice reminding drivers to \"buckle up\" their seat belts. Traffic signs depicting a stylized E.T. wearing one were installed on selected roads around the United States. The following year, British Telecommunications launched the \"Stay in Touch\" campaign, with him as the star of various advertisements. The campaign's slogan was \"B.T. has E.T.\", with \"E.T.\" also taken to mean \"extra technology\".\nAt Spielberg's suggestion, George Lucas included members of E.T.'s species as background characters in \"\". \"E.T.\" was one of the franchises featured in the 2015 crossover game \"Lego Dimensions\". E.T. appears as one of the playable characters, and a world based on the film where players can receive side quests from the characters is available. During E.T.'s trailer in the sketch for the series known as \"Meet that Hero!\", Supergirl explains his backstory and how they have many things in common, including being aliens that crashed down to Earth and how they both have superpowers that they use to help other people. In 2017, video game developer Zen Studios released a pinball adaptation as part of the Universal Classics add-on pack for the virtual pinball game \"Pinball FX 3\". It features 3-D animated figures of Elliot, E.T. and his spacecraft.\nSequels.\nCancelled sequel.\nIn July 1982, during the film's first theatrical run, Spielberg and Mathison wrote a treatment for a sequel to be titled \"E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears\", which would have shown Elliott and his friends getting kidnapped by evil aliens, and attempting to contact E.T. for help. Spielberg decided against pursuing it, feeling it \"would do nothing but rob the original of its virginity. \"E.T.\" is not about going back to the planet\". Spielberg also revealed in a January 2025 interview with Indiewire that he briefly considered adapting \"E.T.: The Book of the Green Planet\" into a film. He ultimately decided against it, believing that \"it was better as a novel than I think it would have been as a film.\" In 2022, Henry Thomas said that he hopes a feature-length sequel never gets made, but added \"I guarantee you, there are a few men in a very big room now salivating and using their abacus and slide rules to come up with some really, really big numbers.\"\nShort film sequel.\nOn November 28, 2019, during NBC's broadcast of the 93rd Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Xfinity released a four-minute commercial directed by Lance Acord, calling it a \"short film sequel\" to the original film, titled \"A Holiday Reunion\". The commercial stars Henry Thomas, reprising his role as Elliott, now an adult with a family of his own. Julianne Hoyak played his wife, Grace, while Zebastin Borjeau and Alivia Drews played their children, Elliott Jr. and Maggie. The story follows E.T. as he returns to Earth for the Christmas season, and focuses on the importance of bringing family together. References and nods to the original film are featured, such as a photo of the Taylors' family dog Harvey on the kitchen fridge and a replica of the makeshift Speak &amp; Spell communication device.\nThe commercial uses a practical puppet for E.T. himself. In an interview with \"Deadline\", Acord said that he went this route in order to elicit more realistic performances from the actors, the same way Spielberg did on the original film. John Williams' score from the original film is mixed into the commercial. Spielberg was consulted by Comcast (parent company of NBCUniversal, which itself owns Universal Pictures) before production on the commercial began.\nPeter Intermaggio, SVP for Marketing Communications for Comcast remarked on the making of the commercial: \"Our goal is to show how Xfinity and Sky technology connects family, friends and loved ones, which is so important during the holidays ... The classic friendship between E.T. and Elliott resonates around the world.\" Before the commercial was released, Thomas assured that viewers would \"get everything they want out of a sequel without the messy bits that could destroy the beauty of the original and the special place it has in people's minds and hearts ... Looking at the storyboards, I could see exactly why Steven was really behind it, because the integrity of the story isn't lost in this retelling.\"\nThe full commercial also played on Syfy and theatrically during cinema pre-shows through January 5, 2020, and a two\u2013minute version was edited for Comcast's British subsidiary, Sky UK.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A sequence of characters is called a \"string\".\nSome character encoding systems represent each character using a fixed number of bits whereas other systems use varying sizes. Various fixed-length sizes were used for now obsolete systems such as the six-bit character code, the five-bit Baudot code and even 4-bit systems (with only 16 possible values). The more modern ASCII system uses the 8-bit byte for each character. Today, the Unicode-based UTF-8 encoding uses a varying number of byte-sized code units to define a code point which combine to encode a character.\nTerminology.\nCharacter.\nIn general, a character is a symbol (such as a letter or number) that represents information, and in the context of computing is a representation of such a symbol that may be accepted by a computer. A character implies an encoding of information; often as defined by a standard such as ANSI or Unicode.\nCharacter set.\nA character set identifies a repertoire of characters that are each mapped to a unique numeric value. \nGlyph.\nGlyph describes a particular visual appearance of a character. Many computer fonts consist of glyphs that are indexed by the numerical code of the corresponding character.\nWith the advent and widespread acceptance of Unicode and bit-agnostic \"coded character sets\", a character is increasingly being seen as a unit of information, independent of any particular visual manifestation. The ISO/IEC 10646 (Unicode) International Standard defines \"character\", or \"abstract character\" as \"a member of a set of elements used for the organization, control, or representation of data\". Unicode's definition supplements this with explanatory notes that encourage the reader to differentiate between characters, graphemes, and glyphs, among other things. Such differentiation is an instance of the wider theme of the separation of presentation and content.\nFor example, the Hebrew letter aleph (\"\u05d0\") is often used by mathematicians to denote certain kinds of infinity (\u2135), but it is also used in ordinary Hebrew text. In Unicode, these two uses are considered different characters, and have two different Unicode numerical identifiers (\"code points\"), though they may be rendered identically. Conversely, the Chinese logogram for water (\"\u6c34\") may have a slightly different appearance in Japanese texts than it does in Chinese texts, and local typefaces may reflect this. But nonetheless in Unicode they are considered the same character, and share the same code point.\nThe Unicode standard differentiates between these abstract characters and \"coded characters\" or \"encoded characters\" that have been paired with numeric codes that facilitate their representation in computers.\nCombining character.\nThe combining character is addressed by Unicode which allocates a code point to each of:\nThis makes it possible to code the middle character of the word 'na\u00efve' either as a single character '\u00ef' or as a combination of the character 'i\u200a' with the combining diaeresis: (U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I + U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS); this is also rendered as 'i\u0308\u200a'.\nchar.\nIn C, (short for character) is a data type with size one byte, but unlike the defacto size of byte as 8 bits, this use of byte is less specific. Byte is defined to be large enough to contain any member of the \"basic execution character set\". The number of bits used by a compiler is accessible via the macro. By far the most common size is 8 bits, and POSIX \"requires\" it to be 8 bits. In modern C standards, is required to hold UTF-8 code units which requires a \"minimum\" size of 8 bits.\nSince a Unicode code point may require as many as 21 bits. the type is generally not large enough for every character. Nonetheless, the type is well-suited for the UTF-8 encoding where each code point requires 1 to 4 bytes. \nThe fact that a character was historically stored in a single byte has led to the terms \"char\" and \"character\" being used interchangeably and this leads to confusion today when multibyte encodings such as UTF-8 are used. Modern POSIX documentation attempts to fix this by defining \"character\" as a sequence of one or more bytes representing a single graphic symbol or control code, and uses \"byte\" when referring to char data. However it still contains errors such as defining an array of as a \"character array\" (rather than a \"byte array\").\nUnicode can be stored in strings of code units that are larger than ; called wide characters. The original C type was called \"wchar_t\". Due to some platforms defining as 16 bits and others defining it as 32 bits, current versions provide unambiguous and . Even then the objects being stored might not be characters, for instance the variable-length UTF-16 is often stored in arrays of .\nOther languages also have a type. Many, including C++, use 8-bit bytes like C. Others, such as Java, use 2-byte, wide storage to more directly accommodate UTF-16.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was produced by Fonda and directed by Hopper. Fonda and Hopper play two bikers who travel through the American Southwest and the South, carrying money made from a cocaine deal. Other actors in the film include Jack Nicholson, Karen Black, and Toni Basil. The success of \"Easy Rider\" helped spark the New Hollywood era of filmmaking during the early 1970s.\nA landmark counterculture film, and a \"touchstone for a generation\" which \"captured the national imagination\" and \"mood of the drug culture\" at the time. \"Easy Rider\" explores the societal landscape, issues, and tensions towards adolescents in the United States during the 1960s including the rise of the hippie movement, drug use, and communal lifestyle. Real drugs were used in scenes showing the use of marijuana and other substances.\nAn independent production, the film was released by Columbia Pictures on July 14, 1969, and earned $60 million worldwide compared to a modest filming budget of $400,000. Critics have praised the performances, directing, writing, soundtrack, and visuals. It received two Academy Awards nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson). In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nWyatt and Billy are freewheeling motorcyclists. After\u00a0smuggling cocaine from Mexico to Los Angeles, they sell their haul receiving a large sum of money. With the cash stuffed into a plastic tube hidden inside the Stars &amp; Stripes\u2013painted fuel tank of Wyatt's California-style chopper (motorcycle), they ride eastward aiming to reach New Orleans in time for the Mardi Gras festival.\nDuring their trip, Wyatt and Billy stop to repair a flat tire on Wyatt's bike at a farmstead in Arizona and have a meal with the farmer and his family. Later, Wyatt picks up a hippie hitch-hiker, and he invites them to visit his commune, where they stay for the rest of the day. The notion of \"free love\" appears to be practiced, with two of the women, Lisa and Sarah, seemingly sharing the affections of the hitch-hiking commune member before turning their attention to Wyatt and Billy. As the bikers leave, the hitch-hiker gives Wyatt some LSD for him to share with \"the right people, at the right time\".\nLater while riding along with a parade in New Mexico, the pair are arrested for \"parading without a permit\" and thrown in jail. There they befriend lawyer George Hanson, who has spent the night in jail after overindulging in alcohol. After mentioning having done work for the ACLU along with other conversation, George helps them get out of jail and decides to travel with Wyatt and Billy to New Orleans. As they camp that night, Wyatt and Billy introduce George to marijuana. As an alcoholic and a \"square\", George is reluctant to try it due to his fear of becoming \"hooked\" and it leading to worse drugs, but quickly relents.\nStopping to eat at a small-town Louisiana diner, the trio attracts the attention of the locals. The girls in the restaurant think they are exciting, but the local men and a police officer make denigrating comments and taunts. Wyatt, Billy, and George decide to leave without any fuss. They make camp outside town. In the middle of the night, a group of locals attack the sleeping trio, beating them with clubs. Billy screams and brandishes a knife, and the attackers leave. Wyatt and Billy suffer minor injuries, but George has been bludgeoned to death. Wyatt and Billy wrap George's body in his sleeping bag, gather his belongings, and vow to return the items to his family.\nThey continue to New Orleans and find a brothel George had told them about earlier. Taking prostitutes Karen and Mary with them, Wyatt and Billy wander the parade-filled streets of the Mardi Gras celebration. They end up in a French Quarter cemetery, where all four ingest the LSD the hitch-hiker had given to Wyatt. Later at their campsite, while Billy enthusiastically recounts their travels, Wyatt melancholically muses that they \"blew it\" in their quest.\nThe next morning, as they are overtaken on a two-lane country road by two local men in an older pickup truck, the passenger in the truck reaches for a shotgun, saying he will scare them. As they pass Billy, the passenger fires, and Billy has a lowside crash. The truck passes Wyatt who has stopped, and Wyatt rides back to Billy, finding him lying flat on the side of the road and covered in blood. Wyatt tells Billy he is going to get help and covers Billy's wound with his own leather jacket. Wyatt then rides down the road toward the pickup as it makes a U-turn. Passing in the opposite direction, the passenger fires the shotgun again, this time through the driver's-side window. Wyatt's riderless motorcycle flies through the air and comes apart before landing and being engulfed in flames.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nWriting.\nHopper and Fonda's first collaboration was in \"The Trip\" (1967), written by Jack Nicholson, which had themes and characters similar to those of \"Easy Rider\". Peter Fonda had become \"an icon of the counterculture\" in \"The Wild Angels\" (1966), where he established \"a persona he would develop further in \"The Trip\" and \"Easy Rider\".\" \"The Trip\" also popularized LSD, while \"Easy Rider\" went on to \"celebrate '60s counterculture\" but does so \"stripped of its innocence.\" Author Katie Mills said that \"The Trip\" is a way point along the \"metamorphosis of the rebel road story from a Beat relic into its hippie reincarnation as \"Easy Rider\"\", and connected Peter Fonda's characters in those two films, along with his character in \"The Wild Angels\", deviating from the \"formulaic biker\" persona and critiquing \"commodity-oriented filmmakers appropriating avant-garde film techniques.\" It was also a step in the transition from independent film into Hollywood's mainstream, and while \"The Trip\" was criticized as a faux, popularized underground film made by Hollywood insiders, \"Easy Rider\" \"interrogates\" the attitude that underground film must \"remain strictly segregated from Hollywood.\" Mills also wrote that the famous acid trip scene in \"Easy Rider\" \"clearly derives from their first tentative explorations as filmmakers in \"The Trip\".\" \"The Trip\" and \"The Wild Angels\" had been low-budget films released by American International Pictures and were both successful. When Fonda took \"Easy Rider\" to AIP, however, as it was Hopper's first film as director, they wanted to be able to replace him if the film went overbudget, so Fonda took the film to Bert Schneider of Raybert Productions and Columbia Pictures instead.\nWhen seeing a still of himself and Bruce Dern in \"The Wild Angels\", Peter Fonda had the idea of a modern Western, involving two bikers traveling across the country after a drug sale. He called Dennis Hopper, and the two decided to turn that into a movie, \"The Loners\", with Hopper directing, Fonda producing, and both starring and writing. Back in LA, Fonda introduced Hopper to Cliff Vaughs, who Peter had met after his second arrest for marijuana in 1967, when Cliff interviewed Peter for radio station KRLA. Over multiple meetings, Vaughs provided his experiences riding a chopper through the South while working on civil rights with the SNCC in 1963\u20131965, including being shot at by two duck hunters in a pickup while he was riding his chopper with Iris Greenburg on the back, between Jackson and Little Rock. Vaughs had a handmade poster on his living room wall with collaged letters spelling 'Where has my easy rider gone?' atop a poster from the Mae West film \"She Done Him Wrong\". Vaughs was made Associate Producer of the film, and designed/built the two choppers, with the assistance of Ben Hardy and Larry Marcus. Fonda and Hopper later brought in screenwriter Terry Southern. The film was mostly shot without a screenplay, with ad-libbed lines, and production started with only the outline and the names of the protagonists. Keeping the Western theme, Wyatt was named after Wyatt Earp and Billy after Billy the Kid. However, Southern disputed that Hopper wrote much of the script. In an interview published in 2016 [Southern died in 1995] he said, \"You know if Den Hopper improvises a dozen lines and six of them survive the cutting room floor he'll put in for screenplay credit. Now it would be almost impossible to exaggerate his contribution to the film\u2014but, by George, he manages to do it every time.\" According to Southern, Fonda was under contract to produce a motorcycle film with A.I.P., which Fonda had agreed to allow Hopper to direct. According to Southern, Fonda and Hopper didn't seek screenplay credit until after the first screenings of the film, which required Southern's agreement due to writers guild policies. Southern says he agreed out of a sense of camaraderie, and that Hopper later took credit for the entire script.\nAccording to Terry Southern's biographer, Lee Hill, the part of George Hanson had been written for Southern's friend, actor Rip Torn. When Torn met with Hopper and Fonda at a New York restaurant in early 1968 to discuss the role, Hopper began ranting about the \"rednecks\" he had encountered on his scouting trip to the South. Torn, a Texan, took exception to some of Hopper's remarks, and the two almost came to blows, as a result of which Torn withdrew from the project. Torn was replaced by Jack Nicholson. In 1994, Jay Leno interviewed Hopper about \"Easy Rider \"on \"The Tonight Show\", and during the interview, Hopper falsely claimed that Torn had pulled a knife on him during the altercation when it was actually the other way around. This infuriated Torn, so he sued Hopper for defamation seeking punitive damages. Torn ultimately prevailed against Hopper on all counts.\nFilming.\nThe filming budget of \"Easy Rider\" was $360,000 to $400,000 ($ to $ in 2024). Peter Fonda said that on top of this, he personally paid for the costs of travel and lodging for the crew, saying, \"Everybody was taking my credit cards and would pay for all the hotels, the food, the gas, everything with Diner's Club\". Cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs said that an additional $1 million, \"about three times the budget for shooting the rest of the film\" was spent on the licensed music tracks that were added during the editing. He already had made two outlaw biker films and suggested that a 1968 Chevy Impala convertible be purchased to carry his camera smoothly, with speeds not exceeding .\nAccording to associate producer Bill Hayward in interviews included as part of the bonus DVD feature, \"Shaking the Cage\", Hopper was difficult on set. During test shooting on location in New Orleans, with documentary filmmaker Baird Bryant on camera, Hopper fought with the production's ad hoc crew for control. At one point, a paranoid Hopper demanded camera operator Barry Feinstein hand over the footage he shot that day so he could keep it safe with him in his hotel room. Enraged, Feinstein hurled the film cans at Hopper and the two got into a physical confrontation. After this turmoil, Hopper and Fonda decided to assemble a proper crew for the rest of the film. Consequently, the rest of the film was shot on 35mm film, while the New Orleans sequences were shot on 16mm film. The hippie commune was recreated from pictures and shot at a site overlooking Malibu Canyon on Piuma Canyon Road, since the New Buffalo commune in Arroyo Hondo near Taos, New Mexico, did not permit shooting there. Among the extras who appear in the sequence are actors Dan Haggerty and Carrie Snodgress, musician Jim Sullivan, and Fonda's daughter Bridget.\nA short clip near the beginning of the film shows Wyatt and Billy on Route 66 in Flagstaff, Arizona, passing a large figure of a lumberjack. That lumberjack statue\u2014once situated in front of the Lumberjack Caf\u00e9\u2014remains in Flagstaff, but now stands inside the J. Lawrence Walkup Skydome on the campus of Northern Arizona University. A second, very similar statue was also moved from the Lumberjack Caf\u00e9 to the exterior of the Skydome. Most of the film is shot outside with natural lighting. Hopper said all the outdoor shooting was an intentional choice on his part, because \"God is a great gaffer.\" Besides the camera car, the production used two five-ton trucks, one for the equipment and pulling an 750 Amp generator trailer, and one for the up to four motorcycles, with the cast and crew in a motor home. One of the locations was Monument Valley.\nThe restaurant scenes with Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson were shot in Morganza, Louisiana. The men and girls in the scenes were Morganza locals. In order to inspire more vitriolic commentary from the local men, Hopper told them the characters of Billy, Wyatt, and George had raped and killed a girl outside of town. The scene in which Billy and Wyatt were shot was filmed on Louisiana Highway 105 North, just outside Krotz Springs, and the two men in the pickup truck\u2014Johnny David and D.C. Billodeau\u2014were Krotz Springs locals.\nWhile shooting the cemetery scene, Hopper tried to convince Fonda to talk to the statue of the Madonna as though it were Fonda's mother, who had taken her own life when he was 10, and ask her why she left him. Although Fonda was reluctant, he eventually complied. Later Fonda used the inclusion of this scene, along with the concluding scene, as leverage to persuade Bob Dylan to allow the use of Roger McGuinn's cover of \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\".\nPost-production.\nDespite being filmed in the first half of 1968, roughly between Mardi Gras and the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, with production starting on February 22, the film did not have a U.S. premiere until July 1969, after having won an award at the Cannes film festival in May. The delay was partially due to a protracted editing process. Inspired by \",\" one of Hopper's proposed cuts was 220 minutes long, including extensive use of the \"flash-forward\" narrative device, wherein scenes from later in the movie are inserted into the current scene. Only one flash-forward survives in the final edit: when Wyatt in the New Orleans brothel has a premonition of the final scene. At the request of Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, Henry Jaglom was brought in to edit the film into its current form, while Schneider purchased a trip to Taos for Hopper so he wouldn't interfere with the recut. Upon seeing the final cut, Hopper was originally displeased, saying that his movie was \"turned into a TV show,\" but he eventually accepted, claiming that Jaglom had crafted the film the way Hopper had originally intended. Despite the large part he played in shaping the film, Jaglom only received credit as an \"Editorial Consultant.\"\nIt is unclear what the exact running time of original rough cut of the movie was: four hours, four and a half hours, or five hours. In 1992, the film's producers, Schneider and Rafelson, sued Columbia Pictures over missing negatives, edit footage and damaged prints, holding them negligent concerning these assets. Some of the scenes which were in the original cut but were deleted are:\n\"Easy Rider\"'s style\u2014the jump cuts, time shifts, flash forwards, flashbacks, jerky hand-held cameras, fractured narrative and improvised acting\u2014can be seen as a cinematic translation of the psychedelic experience. Peter Biskind, author of \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\" wrote, \"LSD did create a frame of mind that fractured experience and that LSD experience had an effect on films like \"Easy Rider\".\"\nMotorcycles.\nWhile \"Easy Rider\" is famous for the Harley-Davidson choppers, the movie actually begins with the characters riding two European-made dirt bikes, Fonda on a red Bultaco Pursang, Hopper on Norton P11 Ranger. In total, two dirt bikes, and four former police bikes were used in the film. The 1949, 1950 and 1952 Harley-Davidson FL \"Hydra-Glide\" bikes were purchased at an auction for $500, equivalent to about $ in 2024. Each bike had a backup to make sure that shooting could continue in case one of the old machines failed or got wrecked accidentally. The main motorcycles for the film, based on hardtail frames and panhead engines, were designed and built by two African American chopper builders\u2014Cliff Vaughs and Ben Hardy\u2014reflecting chopper designs popular among Black motorcyclists at the time, and following ideas of Peter Fonda, and were handled by Tex Hall and Dan Haggerty during shooting. Cliff Vaughs and Ben Hardy were not mentioned in the movie credits.\nOne \"Captain America\" was demolished in the final scene, while the other three were stolen and probably taken apart before their significance as movie props became known. The demolished bike was rebuilt by Dan Haggerty and offered for auction in October 2014 by Profiles in History, a Calabasas, California-based auction house with an estimated value of $1\u20131.2 million. The provenance of existing Captain America motorcycles is unclear, and has been the subject of much litigation. The EMP Museum in Seattle identified a Captain America chopper displayed there as a rebuilt original movie prop. Many replicas have been made since the film's release, including examples at the Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum (Germany), National Motorcycle Museum (Iowa), Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum (Alabama), and Harley-Davidson Museum (Milwaukee).\nHopper and Fonda hosted a wrap party for the movie and then realized they had not yet shot the final campfire scene. Thus, it was shot after the bikes had already been stolen, which is why they are not visible in the background as in the other campfire scenes.\nReception and legacy.\nCritical reception.\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called it \"pretty but lower case cinema\" despite the \"upper case\" \"pious statement about our society which is sick\". He was mildly impressed by the photography, rock score and Nicholson's performance. Penelope Gilliatt in \"The New Yorker\" said that it \"speaks tersely and aptly for this American age, that is both the best of times and the worst of times.\"\nRoger Ebert added \"Easy Rider\" to his \"Great Movies\" list in 2004. \"Easy Rider\" holds an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site's consensus says, \"Edgy and seminal, \"Easy Rider\" encapsulates the dreams, hopes, and hopelessness of 1960s counterculture.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 85 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating .\nBox office.\nThe film opened on July 14, 1969, at the Beekman theater in New York City, and grossed a house record of $40,422 ($ in 2024) in its first week. It grossed even more the following week with $46,609. In its 14th week of release, it was the number one film at the U.S. box office and remained there for three weeks. It was the fourth highest-grossing film of 1969, with a worldwide gross of $60 million ($ in 2024), including $41.7 million domestically in the U.S. and Canada.\nAccolades.\nIn 1998, \"Easy Rider\" was added to the United States National Film Registry, having been deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nIn April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\nSignificance.\nAlong with \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and \"The Graduate\", \"Easy Rider\" helped kick-start the New Hollywood era during the late 1960s and 1970s. The major studios realized that money could be made from low-budget films made by avant-garde directors. Heavily influenced by the French New Wave, the films of the so-called \"post-classical Hollywood\" came to represent a counterculture generation increasingly disillusioned with its government as well as the government's effects on the world at large and the establishment in general. Although Jack Nicholson appears only as a supporting actor and in the last half of the film, the standout performance signaled his arrival as a movie star, along with his subsequent film \"Five Easy Pieces\" in which he had the lead role. Vice President Spiro Agnew criticized \"Easy Rider\", along with the band Jefferson Airplane, as examples of the permissiveness of the 1960s counterculture.\nThe film's success, and the new era of Hollywood which it helped usher in, gave Hopper the chance to direct again with complete artistic control. The result was 1971's \"The Last Movie\", which was a notable box office and critical failure, effectively ending Hopper's career as a director for well over a decade.\nIt also gave Fonda the chance to direct with \"The Hired Hand\", although he rarely produced again.\nMusic.\nThe movie was financed with money made from the Monkees, and features a cameo of record producer Phil Spector in the opening scenes, but neither provided any music. The \"groundbreaking\" soundtrack featured popular rock artists including the Band, the Byrds, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Steppenwolf. Editor and negative cutter Donn Cambern used various music from his own record collection to make watching up to 80 hours of bike footage more interesting during editing. Most of Cambern's music was used, with licensing costs of $1 million, triple the film's budget. The film's extensive use of pop and rock music for the soundtrack was similar to what had recently been used for 1967's \"The Graduate\", including songs being used more than once, or being adapted for the movie.\nBob Dylan was asked to contribute music, but was reluctant to use his own recording of \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\", so a version performed by Byrds frontman Roger McGuinn was used instead. Also, instead of writing an entirely new song for the film, Dylan simply wrote out the first verse of \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" and told the filmmakers, \"Give this to McGuinn, he'll know what to do with it.\" McGuinn completed the song and performed it in the film.\nOriginally, Peter Fonda had intended the band Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young to write an entirely original soundtrack for the film, but this failed to materialize for two reasons. For one, Cambern edited the footage much more closely to what were only meant as temporary tracks than was customary at the time, which led to everyone involved finding them much more suited to the material than they had originally thought. Also, upon watching a screening of the film with Cambern's edits, the group felt they could not improve on the music that was used. On the other hand, Hopper increasingly got control over every aspect over the course of the project and decided to throw CSNY out behind Fonda's back, telling the band as an excuse, \"Look, you guys are really good musicians, but honestly, anybody who rides in a limo can't comprehend my movie, so I'm gonna have to say no to this, and if you guys try to get in the studio again, I may have to cause you some bodily harm.\"\nInspired by the movie, Hendrix later wrote a song \"Ezy Ryder\", with lyrics reflecting the film's themes, while Iron Butterfly wrote \"Easy Rider (Let the Wind Pay the Way)\".\nHome media.\nThe film was first released to DVD on December 7, 1999, as a special edition from Columbia Pictures. Special features included an audio commentary track with Dennis Hopper; the documentary \"Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage\" (1999); production notes; and new interviews with Peter Fonda and Hopper. It received a Blu-ray release on October 20, 2009.\nIn November 2010, the film was digitally remastered and released by The Criterion Collection as part of the box set \"America Lost and Found: The BBS Story\". It included features from previous DVD releases; the documentary \"Born to Be Wild\" (1995); television excerpts showing Hopper and Fonda at the Cannes Film Festival; and a new video interview with BBS co-founder Stephen Blauner. On November 23, 2014, a Blu-ray SteelBook was released. On May 3, 2016, Criterion re-released \"Easy Rider\" as a 2-disc collection.\nSequel.\nIn 2012, a sequel to the movie was released, titled \"\" and directed by Dustin Rikert. The film is about the family of Wyatt \"Captain America\" Williams from the 1940s to the present day. No members of the original cast or crew were involved with the film, which was produced and written by amateur filmmaker Phil Pitzer, who had purchased the sequel rights to \"Easy Rider\". Pitzer pursued legal action against Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider in order to block them from reclaiming the rights to the film.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading"}

Mangroves grow in an equatorial climate, typically along coastlines and tidal rivers. They have particular adaptations to take in extra oxygen and remove salt, allowing them to tolerate conditions that kill most plants. The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species. Mangroves are taxonomically diverse due to convergent evolution in several plant families. They occur worldwide in the tropics and subtropics and even some temperate coastal areas, mainly between latitudes 30\u00b0\u00a0N and 30\u00b0\u00a0S, with the greatest mangrove area within 5\u00b0 of the equator. Mangrove plant families first appeared during the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene epochs and became widely distributed in part due to the movement of tectonic plates. The oldest known fossils of mangrove palm date to 75 million years ago.\nMangroves are salt-tolerant (halophytic) and are adapted to live in harsh coastal conditions. They contain a complex salt filtration system and a complex root system to cope with saltwater immersion and wave action. They are adapted to the low-oxygen conditions of waterlogged mud, but are most likely to thrive in the upper half of the intertidal zone.\nThe mangrove biome, often called the mangrove forest or mangal, is a distinct saline woodland or shrubland habitat characterized by depositional coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure seawater (3 to 4% salinity), to water concentrated by evaporation to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 9% salinity).\nBeginning in 2010, remote sensing technologies and global data have been used to assess areas, conditions and deforestation rates of mangroves around the world. In 2018, the Global Mangrove Watch Initiative released a new global baseline which estimates the total mangrove forest area of the world as of 2010 at , spanning 118 countries and territories. A 2022 study on losses and gains of tidal wetlands estimates a net decrease in global mangrove extent from 1999 to 2019. Mangrove loss continues due to human activity, with a global annual deforestation rate estimated at 0.16%, and per-country rates as high as 0.70%. Degradation in quality of remaining mangroves is also an important concern.\nThere is interest in mangrove restoration for several reasons. Mangroves support sustainable coastal and marine ecosystems. They protect nearby areas from tsunamis and extreme weather events. Mangrove forests are also effective at carbon sequestration and storage. The success of mangrove restoration may depend heavily on engagement with local stakeholders, and on careful assessment to ensure that growing conditions will be suitable for the species chosen.\nThe International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem is celebrated every year on 26 July.\nEtymology.\nEtymology of the English term \"mangrove\" is speculative and disputed. \nThe term may have come to English from the Portuguese \" or the Spanish\n\". Further back, it may be traced to South America and Cariban and Arawakan languages such as Ta\u00edno. Other possibilities include the Malay language .\nThe English usage may reflect a corruption via folk etymology of the words \"mangrow\" and \"grove\".\nThe word \"mangrove\" is used in at least three senses:\nBiology.\nAccording to Hogarth (2015), among the recognized mangrove species there are about 70 species in 20 genera from 16 families that constitute the \"true mangroves\" \u2013 species that occur almost exclusively in mangrove habitats. Demonstrating convergent evolution, many of these species found similar solutions to the tropical conditions of variable salinity, tidal range (inundation), anaerobic soils, and intense sunlight. Plant biodiversity is generally low in a given mangrove. The greatest biodiversity of mangroves occurs in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Indonesian archipelago.\nAdaptations to low oxygen.\nThe red mangrove (\"Rhizophora mangle\") survives in the most inundated areas, props itself above the water level with stilt or prop roots and then absorbs air through lenticels in its bark.\nThe black mangrove (\"Avicennia germinans\") lives on higher ground and develops many specialized root-like structures called pneumatophores, which stick up out of the soil like straws for breathing.\nThese \"breathing tubes\" typically reach heights of up to , and in some species, over . The roots also contain wide aerenchyma to facilitate transport within the plants.\nNutrient uptake.\nBecause the soil is perpetually waterlogged, little free oxygen is available. Anaerobic bacteria liberate nitrogen gas, soluble ferrum (iron), inorganic phosphates, sulfides, and methane, which make the soil much less nutritious. Pneumatophores (aerial roots) allow mangroves to absorb gases directly from the atmosphere, and other nutrients such as iron, from the inhospitable soil. Mangroves store gases directly inside the roots, processing them even when the roots are submerged during high tide.\nLimiting salt intake.\nRed mangroves exclude salt by having significantly impermeable roots that are highly suberised (impregnated with suberin), acting as an ultrafiltration mechanism to exclude sodium salts from the rest of the plant. One study found that roots of the Indian mangrove \"Avicennia officinalis\" exclude 90% to 95% of the salt in water taken up by the plant, depositing the excluded salt in the cortex of the root. An increase in the production of suberin and in the activity of a gene regulating cytochrome P450 were observed in correlation with an increase in the salinity of the water to which the plant was exposed. In a frequently cited concept that has become known as the \"sacrificial leaf\", salt which does accumulate in the shoot (sprout) then concentrates in old leaves, which the plant then sheds. However, recent research on the Red mangrove \"Rhizophora mangle\" suggests that the older, yellowing leaves have no more measurable salt content than the other, greener leaves.\nLimiting water loss.\nBecause of the limited fresh water available in salty intertidal soils, mangroves limit the amount of water they lose through their leaves. They can restrict the opening of their stomata (pores on the leaf surfaces, which exchange carbon dioxide gas and water vapor during photosynthesis). They also vary the orientation of their leaves to avoid the harsh midday sun and so reduce evaporation from the leaves. A captive red mangrove grows only if its leaves are misted with fresh water several times a week, simulating frequent tropical rainstorms.\nFiltration of seawater.\nA 2016 study by Kim \"et al.\" investigated the biophysical characteristics of sea water filtration in the roots of the mangrove \"Rhizophora stylosa\" from a plant hydrodynamic point of view. \"R. stylosa\" can grow even in saline water and the salt level in its roots is regulated within a certain threshold value through filtration. The root possesses a hierarchical, triple layered pore structure in the epidermis and most Na+ ions are filtered at the first sublayer of the outermost layer. The high blockage of Na+ ions is attributed to the high surface zeta potential of the first layer. The second layer, which is composed of macroporous structures, also facilitates Na+ ion filtration. The study provides insights into the mechanism underlying water filtration through halophyte roots and could serve as a basis for the development of a bio-inspired method of desalination.\nUptake of Na+ ions is desirable for halophytes to build up osmotic potential, absorb water and sustain turgor pressure. However, excess Na+ ions may work on toxic element. Therefore, halophytes try to adjust salinity delicately between growth and survival strategies. In this point of view, a novel sustainable desalination method can be derived from halophytes, which are in contact with saline water through their roots. Halophytes exclude salt through their roots, secrete the accumulated salt through their aerial parts and sequester salt in senescent leaves and/or the bark. Mangroves are facultative halophytes and \"Bruguiera\" is known for its special ultrafiltration system that can filter approximately 90% of Na+ions from the surrounding seawater through the roots. The species also exhibits a high rate of salt rejection. The water-filtering process in mangrove roots has received considerable attention for several decades. Morphological structures of plants and their functions have been evolved through a long history to survive against harsh environmental conditions.\nIncreasing survival of offspring.\nIn this harsh environment, mangroves have evolved a special mechanism to help their offspring survive. Mangrove seeds are buoyant and are therefore suited to water dispersal. Unlike most plants, whose seeds germinate in soil, many mangroves (e.g. red mangrove) are viviparous, meaning their seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree. Once germinated, the seedling grows either within the fruit (e.g. \"Aegialitis\", \"Avicennia\" and \"Aegiceras\"), or out through the fruit (e.g. \"Rhizophora\", \"Ceriops\", \"Bruguiera\" and \"Nypa\") to form a propagule (a ready-to-go seedling) which can produce its own food via photosynthesis.\nThe mature propagule then drops into the water, which can transport it great distances. Propagules can survive desiccation and remain dormant for over a year before arriving in a suitable environment. Once a propagule is ready to root, its density changes so that the elongated shape now floats vertically rather than horizontally. In this position, it is more likely to lodge in the mud and root. If it does not root, it can alter its density and drift again in search of more favorable conditions.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nThe following listings, based on Tomlinson, 2016, give the mangrove species in each listed plant genus and family. Mangrove environments in the Eastern Hemisphere harbor six times as many species of trees and shrubs as do mangroves in the New World. Genetic divergence of mangrove lineages from terrestrial relatives, in combination with fossil evidence, suggests mangrove diversity is limited by evolutionary transition into the stressful marine environment, and the number of mangrove lineages has increased steadily over the Tertiary with little global extinction.\nSpecies distribution.\nMangroves are a type of tropical vegetation with some outliers established in subtropical latitudes, notably in South Florida and southern Japan, as well as South Africa, New Zealand and Victoria (Australia). These outliers result either from unbroken coastlines and island chains or from reliable supplies of propagules floating on warm ocean currents from rich mangrove regions.\n\"At the limits of distribution, the formation is represented by scrubby, usually monotypic \"Avicennia\"-dominated vegetation, as at Westonport Bay and Corner Inlet, Victoria, Australia. The latter locality is the highest latitude (38\u00b0 45'S) at which mangroves occur naturally. The mangroves in New Zealand, which extend as far south as 37\u00b0, are of the same type; they start as low forest in the northern part of the North Island but become low scrub toward their southern limit. In both instances, the species is referred to as \"Avicennia marina\" var. \"australis\", although genetic comparison is clearly needed. In Western Australia, \"A. marina \" extends as far south as Bunbury (33\u00b0 19'S). In the northern hemisphere, scrubby \"Avicennia gerrninans\" in Florida occurs as far north as St. Augustine on the east coast and Cedar Point on the west. There are records of \"A. germinans\" and \"Rhizophora\" mangle for Bermuda, presumably supplied by the Gulf Stream. In southern Japan, \"Kandelia obovata\" occurs to about 31 \u00b0N (Tagawa in Hosakawa et al., 1977, but initially referred to as \"K. candel\").\"\nMangrove forests.\nMangrove forests, also called \"mangrove swamps\" or \"mangals\", are found in tropical and subtropical tidal areas. Areas where mangroves occur include estuaries and marine shorelines.\nThe intertidal existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat. High tide brings in salt water, and when the tide recedes, solar evaporation of the seawater in the soil leads to further increases in salinity. The return of tide can flush out these soils, bringing them back to salinity levels comparable to that of seawater.\nAt low tide, organisms are also exposed to increases in temperature and reduced moisture before being then cooled and flooded by the tide. Thus, for a plant to survive in this environment, it must tolerate broad ranges of salinity, temperature, and moisture, as well as several other key environmental factors\u2014thus only a select few species make up the mangrove tree community.\nAbout 110 species are considered mangroves, in the sense of being trees that grow in such a saline swamp, though only a few are from the mangrove plant genus, \"Rhizophora\". However, a given mangrove swamp typically features only a small number of tree species. It is not uncommon for a mangrove forest in the Caribbean to feature only three or four tree species. For comparison, the tropical rainforest biome contains thousands of tree species, but this is not to say mangrove forests lack diversity. Though the trees themselves are few in species, the ecosystem that these trees create provides a home (habitat) for a great variety of other species, including as many as 174 species of marine megafauna.\nMangrove plants require a number of physiological adaptations to overcome the problems of low environmental oxygen levels, high salinity, and frequent tidal flooding. Each species has its own solutions to these problems; this may be the primary reason why, on some shorelines, mangrove tree species show distinct zonation. Small environmental variations within a mangal may lead to greatly differing methods for coping with the environment. Therefore, the mix of species is partly determined by the tolerances of individual species to physical conditions, such as tidal flooding and salinity, but may also be influenced by other factors, such as crabs preying on plant seedlings.\nOnce established, mangrove roots provide an oyster habitat and slow water flow, thereby enhancing sediment deposition in areas where it is already occurring. The fine, anoxic sediments under mangroves act as sinks for a variety of heavy (trace) metals which colloidal particles in the sediments have concentrated from the water. Mangrove removal disturbs these underlying sediments, often creating problems of trace metal contamination of seawater and organisms of the area.\nMangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during tropical cyclones), and tsunamis. They limit high-energy wave erosion mainly during events such as storm surges and tsunamis.\nThe mangroves' massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy. Likewise, they slow down tidal water so that its sediment is deposited as the tide comes in, leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs. In this way, mangroves build their environments. Because of the uniqueness of mangrove ecosystems and the protection against erosion they provide, they are often the object of conservation programs, including national biodiversity action plans.\nThe unique ecosystem found in the intricate mesh of mangrove roots offers a quiet marine habitat for young organisms. In areas where roots are permanently submerged, the organisms they host include algae, barnacles, oysters, sponges, and bryozoans, which all require a hard surface for anchoring while they filter-feed. Shrimps and mud lobsters use the muddy bottoms as their home. Mangrove crabs eat the mangrove leaves, adding nutrients to the mangal mud for other bottom feeders. In at least some cases, the export of carbon fixed in mangroves is important in coastal food webs.\nLarger marine organisms benefit from the habitat as a nursery for their offspring. Lemon sharks depend on mangrove creeks to give birth to their pups. The ecosystem provides little competition and minimizes threats of predation to juvenile lemon sharks as they use the cover of mangroves to practice hunting before entering the food web of the ocean.\nMangrove plantations in Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, and India host several commercially important species of fish and crustaceans.\nMangrove forests can decay into peat deposits because of fungal and bacterial processes as well as by the action of termites. It becomes peat in good geochemical, sedimentary, and tectonic conditions. The nature of these deposits depends on the environment and the types of mangroves involved. In Puerto Rico, the red, white, and black mangroves occupy different ecological niches and have slightly different chemical compositions, so the carbon content varies between the species, as well between the different tissues of the plant (e.g., leaf matter versus roots).\nIn Puerto Rico, there is a clear succession of these three trees from the lower elevations, which are dominated by red mangroves, to farther inland with a higher concentration of white mangroves. Mangrove forests are an important part of the cycling and storage of carbon in tropical coastal ecosystems. Knowing this, scientists seek to reconstruct the environment and investigate changes to the coastal ecosystem over thousands of years using sediment cores. However, an additional complication is the imported marine organic matter that also gets deposited in the sediment due to the tidal flushing of mangrove forests. Termites play an important role in the formation of peat from mangrove materials. They process fallen leaf litter, root systems and wood from mangroves into peat to build their nests, and stabilise the chemistry of this peat that represents approximately 2% of above ground carbon storage in mangroves. As the nests are buried over time this carbon is stored in the sediment and the carbon cycle continues.\nMangroves are an important source of blue carbon. Globally, mangroves stored of carbon in 2012. Two percent of global mangrove carbon was lost between 2000 and 2012, equivalent to a maximum potential of of emissions of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere.\nGlobally, mangroves have been shown to provide measurable economic protections to coastal communities affected by tropical storms.\nMangrove microbiome.\nPlant microbiomes play crucial roles in the health and productivity of mangroves. Many researchers have successfully applied knowledge acquired about plant microbiomes to produce specific inocula for crop protection. Such inocula can stimulate plant growth by releasing phytohormones and enhancing uptake of some mineral nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen). However, most of the plant microbiome studies have focused on the model plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" and economically important crop plants, such as rice, barley, wheat, maize and soybean. There is less information on the microbiomes of tree species. Plant microbiomes are determined by plant-related factors (e.g., genotype, organ, species, and health status) and environmental factors (e.g., land use, climate, and nutrient availability). Two of the plant-related factors, plant species and genotypes, have been shown to play significant roles in shaping rhizosphere and plant microbiomes, as tree genotypes and species are associated with specific microbial communities. Different plant organs also have specific microbial communities depending on plant-associated factors (plant genotype, available nutrients, and organ-specific physicochemical conditions) and environmental conditions (associated with aboveground and underground surfaces and disturbances).\nRoot microbiome.\nMangrove roots harbour a repertoire of microbial taxa that contribute to important ecological functions in mangrove ecosystems. Like typical terrestrial plants, mangroves depend upon mutually beneficial interactions with microbial communities. In particular, microbes residing in developed roots could help mangroves transform nutrients into usable forms before plant assimilation. These microbes also provide mangroves phytohormones for suppressing phytopathogens or helping mangroves withstand heat and salinity. In turn, root-associated microbes receive carbon metabolites from the plant via root exudates, thus close associations between the plant and microbes are established for their mutual benefits.\nThe taxonomic class level shows that most Proteobacteria were reported to come from Gammaproteobacteria, followed by Deltaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. The diverse function and the phylogenic variation of Gammaproteobacteria, which consisted of orders such as Alteromonadales and Vibrionales, are found in marine and coastal regions and are high in abundance in mangrove sediments functioning as nutrient recyclers. Members of Deltaproteobacteria found in mangrove soil are mostly sulfur-related, consisting of Desulfobacterales, Desulfuromonadales, Desulfovibrionales, and Desulfarculales among others.\nHighly diverse microbial communities (mainly bacteria and fungi) have been found to inhabit and function in mangrove roots. For example, diazotrophic bacteria in the vicinity of mangrove roots could perform biological nitrogen fixation, which provides 40\u201360% of the total nitrogen required by mangroves; the soil attached to mangrove roots lacks oxygen but is rich in organic matter, providing an optimal microenvironment for sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens, ligninolytic, cellulolytic, and amylolytic fungi are prevalent in the mangrove root environment; rhizosphere fungi could help mangroves survive in waterlogged and nutrient-restricted environments. These studies have provided increasing evidence to support the importance of root-associated bacteria and fungi for mangrove growth and health.\nRecent studies have investigated the detailed structure of root-associated microbial communities at a continuous fine-scale in other plants, where a microhabitat was divided into four root compartments: endosphere, episphere, rhizosphere, and nonrhizosphere or bulk soil. Moreover, the microbial communities in each compartment have been reported to have unique characteristics. Root exudates selectively enrich adapted microbial populations; however, these exudates were found to exert only marginal impacts on microbes in the bulk soil outside the rhizosphere. Furthermore, it was noted that the root episphere, rather than the rhizosphere, was primarily responsible for controlling the entry of specific microbial populations into the root, resulting in the selective enrichment of Proteobacteria in the endosphere. These findings provide new insights into the niche differentiation of root-associated microbial communities. Nevertheless, amplicon-based community profiling may not provide the functional characteristics of root-associated microbial communities in plant growth and biogeochemical cycling. Unraveling functional patterns across the four root compartments holds a great potential for understanding functional mechanisms responsible for mediating root\u2013microbe interactions in support of enhancing mangrove ecosystem functioning.\nThe diversity of bacteria in disturbed mangroves is reported to be higher than in\nwell-preserved mangroves Studies comparing mangroves in different conservation states show that bacterial composition in disturbed mangrove sediment alters its structure, leading to a functional equilibrium, where the dynamics of chemicals in mangrove soils lead to the remodeling of its microbial structure.\nSuggestions for future mangrove microbial diversity research.\nDespite many research advancements in mangrove sediment bacterial metagenomics\ndiversity in various conditions over the past few years, bridging the research gap and\nexpanding our knowledge towards the relationship between microbes mainly constituted of bacteria and its nutrient cycles in the mangrove sediment and direct and indirect impacts on mangrove growth and stand-structures as coastal barriers and other ecological service providers. Thus, based on studies by Lai et al.'s systematic review, here they suggest sampling improvements and a fundamental environmental index for future reference.\nMangrove virome.\nMangrove forests are one of the most carbon-rich biomes, accounting for 11% of the total input of terrestrial carbon into oceans. Viruses are thought to significantly influence local and global biogeochemical cycles, though as of 2019, little information was available about the community structure, genetic diversity, and ecological roles of viruses in mangrove ecosystems.\nViruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth, present in virtually all ecosystems. By lysing their hosts, that is, by rupturing their cell membranes, viruses control host abundance and affect the structure of host communities. Viruses also influence their host diversity and evolution through horizontal gene transfer, selection for resistance and manipulation of bacterial metabolisms. Importantly, marine viruses affect local and global biogeochemical cycles through the release of substantial amounts of organic carbon and nutrients from hosts and assist microbes in driving biogeochemical cycles with auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs).\nIt is presumed that AMGs augment viral-infected host metabolism and facilitate the production of new viruses. AMGs have been extensively explored in marine cyanophages and include genes involved in photosynthesis, carbon turnover, phosphate uptake and stress response. Cultivation-independent metagenomic analysis of viral communities has identified additional AMGs that are involved in motility, central carbon metabolism, photosystem I, energy metabolism, iron\u2013sulphur clusters, anti-oxidation and sulphur and nitrogen cycling. Interestingly, a recent analysis of Pacific Ocean Virome data identified niche-specialised AMGs that contribute to depth-stratified host adaptations. Given that microbes drive global biogeochemical cycles, and viruses infect a large fraction of microbes at any given time, viral-encoded AMGs must play important roles in global biogeochemistry and microbial metabolic evolution.\nMangrove forests are the only woody halophytes that live in salt water along the world's subtropical and tropical coastlines. Mangroves are one of the most productive and ecologically important ecosystems on earth. The rates of primary production of mangroves equal those of tropical humid evergreen forests and coral reefs. As a globally relevant component of the carbon cycle, mangroves sequester approximately 24 million metric tons of carbon each year. Most mangrove carbon is stored in soil and sizable belowground pools of dead roots, aiding in the conservation and recycling of nutrients beneath forests. Although mangroves cover only 0.5% of the earth's coastal area, they account for 10\u201315% of the coastal sediment carbon storage and 10\u201311% of the total input of terrestrial carbon into oceans. The disproportionate contribution of mangroves to carbon sequestration is now perceived as an important means to counterbalance greenhouse gas emissions.\nDespite the ecological importance of the mangrove ecosystem, knowledge of mangrove biodiversity is notably limited. Previous reports mainly investigated the biodiversity of mangrove fauna, flora, and bacterial communities. Particularly, little information is available about viral communities and their roles in mangrove soil ecosystems. In view of the importance of viruses in structuring and regulating host communities and mediating element biogeochemical cycles, exploring viral communities in mangrove ecosystems is essential. Additionally, the intermittent flooding of sea water and resulting sharp transition of mangrove environments may result in substantially different genetic and functional diversity of bacterial and viral communities in mangrove soils compared with those of other systems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The screenplay was written by Gregory Nava and Anna Thomas, based on Nava's story. The movie was first presented at the Telluride Film Festival in 1983, and its wide release was in January 1984.\nThe drama features Zaide Silvia Guti\u00e9rrez and David Villalpando, in their first film roles, as two indigenous youths who flee Guatemala due to the ethnic and political persecution of the Guatemalan Civil War. They head north and travel through Mexico to the United States, arriving in Los Angeles, California, after an arduous journey.\nThe picture was partly funded by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), a non-profit public broadcasting television service in the United States.\n\"El Norte\" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay in 1985. In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nThe writing team of Nava and Thomas split the story into three parts:\n\"Arturo Xuncax\".\nThe first part takes place in a small rural Guatemalan village called San Pedro and introduces the Xuncax family, a group of indigenous Mayans. Arturo is a coffee picker and his wife a homemaker. Arturo explains his worldview to his son Enrique and how the \"indio\" fares in Guatemalan life, noting that, \"to the rich, the peasant is just a pair of strong arms\". Arturo and his family then discuss the possibility of going to the United States where \"all the people, even the poor, have their own cars\".\nBecause of his attempts to form a labor union among the workers, Arturo and the other organizers are attacked and murdered by government troops when a co-worker is bribed to betray them\u2014Arturo's severed head is seen hanging from a tree. When Enrique attempts to climb the tree that displays his father's head, a soldier attacks him. Enrique fights back and kills the attacker, then escapes with his sister Rosa and hides in a safe house until morning. Enrique and Rosa thus escape capture, only to learn that many of their fellow villagers have been rounded up by soldiers. The children's mother too \"disappears\": abducted by soldiers. So, using money given to them by their godmother, Enrique and Rosa decide to flee Guatemala, the land of their birth, and head north.\n\"Coyote\".\nDuring the second part of the film, the two teenagers flee Guatemala, travel through Mexico, and meet a Mexican coyote who guides them across the border. This section includes various comic scenes relating to mutual stereotyping among different ethnic groups; the two attempt to pass themselves off as indigenous Mexicans, failing to convince one Mexican truck driver after naming the wrong destination, but later succeeding in convincing a U.S. Border Patrol officer by copiously peppering their responses with the Mexican word for \"fuck\", which a neighbor had suggested was how all Mexicans speak.\nThus, Enrique and Rosa are only deported to a border town in Mexico and not to Guatemala, giving them a base for a second attempt to cross the border. After their first failed attempt to cross the \"frontera\", in which a man posing as a coyote deceives and attempts to rob them, they have a horrific experience when they finally cross the U.S.-Mexico border through a sewer pipe laden with rats; critic Roger Ebert noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The scene is horrifying, not least because it's pretty clear these are real rats. Disease-free rats purchased from a laboratory, yes, but real rats all the same, and although Gutierrez was phobic about rats, she insisted on doing her own scenes, and her panic is real.\n\"El Norte\".\nIn the final part of the film, Rosa and Enrique discover the difficulties of living in the U.S. without official documentation. The brother and sister find work and a place to live and initially feel good about their decision. However, Rosa is nearly caught up in an immigration raid and must find a new job. Working as a domestic, she is puzzled when her Anglo employer shows her a washing machine. Enrique becomes a busboy and, as his English classes begin to improve his command of the language, is promoted to a position as a waiter's assistant. He is later approached by a businesswoman who has a better-paying job for him in Chicago as a foreman, which he initially declines; he too encounters problems when a jealous Chicano co-worker reports him to immigration, causing him to flee the restaurant and seek out the businesswoman.\nWhen Enrique finally decides to take the position, Rosa becomes gravely ill with typhus contracted from the rat bites she received during their border crossing. When this happens, Enrique must make the tough decision of missing the flight to Chicago to be by her side, and thus loses the position. As Enrique sits by her bedside in the hospital, a dying Rosa laments that she will not live to enjoy the fruits of their harrowing journey to the U.S. Rosa sums up the film's major theme when she says to Enrique:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In our own land, we have no home. They want to kill us...In Mexico, there is only poverty. We can't make a home there either. And here in the north, we aren't accepted. When will we find a home, Enrique? Maybe when we die, we'll find a home.\nAfter Rosa dies, Enrique is shown once again waiting with the other day-labor hopefuls in a parking lot, offering his services to a man looking for \"strong arms\"; reviewer Renee Scolaro Rathke observes: \"It is a bitter realization that Arturo's words about the poor being nothing but arms for the rich holds true even in El Norte.\"\nAlthough Enrique is temporarily employed once again, he is distracted by haunting daydreams about his sister's lost desires for a better life. The final shot in the film again shows a severed head hanging from a rope, which may be the same image used in Part I of the film; one critic has commented that a hanging, severed head is \"a symbolic device used in some Latin films to signify that the character has committed suicide\".\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Zaide Silvia Guti\u00e9rrez as Rosa Xuncax\nBackground.\nThe origins of \"El Norte\" are the director's experiences in San Diego, California, where he grew up. Nava came from a border family and has relatives on the other side in Tijuana, Baja California. As a youth, he crossed the border several times a week, often wondering who lived in all those cardboard shacks on the Mexican side.\nFor research the producers of \"El Norte\" learned about the plight of indigenous Guatemalans from years of research, much of it conducted among exiles living in Southern California. Nava said \"There are hundreds of thousands of refugees from Central America in Los Angeles alone. Nobody knows the exact number, but a recent television inquiry estimated 300,000 to 400,000. In our own research, we came across a community of Mayans from Guatemala\u20145,000 from one village\u2014now in Los Angeles. The original village, which is now dead, had 15,000.\"\nAnnette Insdorf of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Nava discussed the singular nature of the US-Mexico border. Nava said:\nThe border is unique\u2014the only place in the world where an industrialized first-world nation shares the border with a third-world country. In California, it's just a fence: on one side are the Tijuana slums, on the other side\u2014San Diego. It's so graphic! This was the germ of the story.\nThe movie has become a staple of high school Spanish language and Human Geography classes throughout the United States and multiculturalism studies in college.\nFinancing.\nNava and Anna Thomas spent two years raising money for \"El Norte\" but they did not pursue film studios or television networks because much of what makes \"El Norte\" special would have been jeopardized if a major studio had been involved in the filmmaking process .\nFinancing for the film was provided by PBS's American Playhouse (50%) and the rest in pre-sales. One such pre-sale was made to the United Kingdom's Channel 4.\nThemes.\nMagical realism.\nParts of \"El Norte\" provide an example of how Latin American magical realism, primarily found in novels, has been depicted in a theatrical film. Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" wrote: \"\"El Norte\" was seminal, both for its graceful blend of classical narrative and magic realism, and the power with which it brought an otherwise invisible world to life.\"\nIndigenous view and bigotry.\n\"El Norte\" portrays an Amerindian point-of-view and this is exemplified by the religion they follow. An example is when Rosa Xuncax sings the eulogy at the funeral of her father and its Native American-Maya religious theme. A traditional Maya belief is that life has a cyclical nature. Rosa sings in her Maya language:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We came only to sleep, to dream. All things are lent to us. We are only on Earth in passing.\nThroughout \"El Norte\" young Rosa and Enrique and their family are subjected to many epithets, hatred, and bigotry due to their indigenous heritage. When the father Arturo inadvertently kills a soldier, for example, a ladino screams:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That bastard Indian killed Puma!\nAnd, when Rosa and Enrique reach their destination in Mexico, a passenger screams at the protagonists:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We have arrived to Tijuana, you damn Indians.\nGuatemalan exodus.\nDavid Villalpando, the actor who played Enrique Xuncax, gave an interview to \"Lear Media\" about what the film meant to him and why he believes the film is important. Villalpando said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fifteen years ago, the indigenous people in Guatemala were living a cruel extermination that forced them to flee toward Mexico and the United States. This exodus lasted a decade and half a million Guatemalans made the journey to the United States seeking for asylum and refuge...\"El Norte\" became a powerful fighting element, grew an audience, searched audiences, and left the theaters to tell its truth.\nProduction.\nWhen Nava and his production crew were, in effect, kicked out of Mexico during the film shoot, he had to re-create a Mexican village in California. Nava said \"We were filming in Mexico during the end of the L\u00f3pez Portillo presidency, one of the last of the old-fashioned caciques to rule Mexico. One day, men with machine guns took over the set. I had guns pointed at my head. We were forced to shut down production, bribe our way out of the country, fight to get our costumes back, and start shooting again in California. Ironically, in the United States our extras were real Mayan refugees. They were the people the movie was about.\"\nNava tells the story that, at one point, Mexican police kidnapped their accountant and held him for ransom, and at the same time, his parents had to pose as tourists in order to smuggle exposed film out of the country in their suitcases.\nFilming locations.\nThe film was shot in Mexico and California. In Mexico, the locations were Chiapas, Morelos, M\u00e9xico, D.F., and Tijuana. In California, the locations were San Diego and Los Angeles.\nDistribution.\nThe film was released in Scotland on October 11, 1983.

{"id": "73452", "revid": "1412854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73452", "title": "The Emperor Jones", "text": "1920 play by Eugene O'Neill\nThe Emperor Jones is a 1920 tragic play by American dramatist Eugene O'Neill that tells the tale of Brutus Jones, a resourceful, self-assured African American and a former Pullman porter, who kills another black man in a dice game, is jailed, and later escapes to a small, backward Caribbean island where he sets himself up as emperor. The play recounts his story in flashbacks as Brutus makes his way through the jungle in an attempt to escape former subjects who have rebelled against him.\nOriginally called \"The Silver Bullet\", the play is one of O'Neill's major experimental works, mixing expressionism and realism, and the use of an unreliable narrator and multiple points of view. It was also an oblique commentary on the U.S. occupation of Haiti after bloody rebellions there, an act of imperialism that was much condemned in O'Neill's radical political circles in New York. \"The Emperor Jones\" draws on O'Neill's own hallucinatory experience hacking through the jungle while prospecting for gold in Honduras in 1909, as well as the brief, brutal presidency of Haiti's Vilbrun Guillaume Sam.\n\"The Emperor Jones\" was O'Neill's first big box-office hit. It established him as a successful playwright, after he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his first play, the much less well-known \"Beyond the Horizon\" (1920). \"The Emperor Jones\" was included in Burns Mantle's \"The Best Plays of 1920\u20131921\".\nSynopsis.\n\"The Emperor Jones\" is about Brutus Jones, a Black American Pullman porter who escapes to an island in the West Indies. In two years, Jones makes himself \"Emperor\" of the place. A native tried to shoot Jones, but the gun misfired; thereupon Jones announced that he was protected by a charm and that only silver bullets could harm him.\nWhen the play begins, he has been Emperor long enough to amass a fortune by imposing heavy taxes on the islanders and carrying on all sorts of large-scale corruption. Rebellion is brewing. The islanders are whipping up their courage to a fighting point by calling on the local gods and demons of the forest. From the deep of the jungle, the steady beat of a big drum sounded by them is heard, increasing its tempo towards the end of the play and showing the rebels' presence dreaded by the Emperor. It is the equivalent of the heart-beat which assumes a higher and higher pitch; while coming closer it denotes the premonition of approaching punishment and the climactic recoil of internal guilt of the hero; he wanders and falters in the jungle, present throughout the play with its primeval terror and blackness.\nThe play is virtually a monologue for its leading character, Jones, in a Shakespearean range from regal power to the depths of terror and insanity, comparable to Lear or Macbeth. Scenes 2 to 7 are from the point of view of Jones, and no other character speaks. The first and last scenes are essentially a framing device with a character named Smithers, a white trader who appears to be part of illegal activities. In the first scene, Smithers is told about the rebellion by an old woman, and then has a lengthy conversation with Jones. In the last scene, Smithers converses with Lem, the leader of the rebellion. Smithers has mixed feelings about Jones, though he generally has more respect for Jones than for the rebels. During the final scene, Jones is killed by a silver bullet, which was the only way that the rebels believed Jones could be killed, and the way in which Jones planned to kill himself if he was captured.\nCharacters.\nThe Little Formless Fears; Jeff; The Negro Convicts; The Prison Guard; The Planters; The Auctioneer; The Slaves; The Congo Witch-Doctor; The Crocodile God\nInspiration.\nThe expansive personality and style of speech seen in Brutus Jones was modeled on Adam Scott, an African-American and close friend of O'Neill's. Scott tended bar at O'Neill's favorite tavern, at the rear of Holt's Grocery on Main Street, in his hometown of New London, Connecticut. In their biography of O'Neill, Arthur and Barbara Gelb report that, Scott's imperious personality so impressed O'Neill that he later borrowed it for \"The Emperor Jones\". While the play was also derived from other sources, it was Scott's bravado, his superstition and his religious convictions that imbued the character of Brutus Jones.\nProductions.\n1920 premiere.\n\"The Emperor Jones\" was first staged on November 1, 1920, by the Provincetown Players at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York City. Charles Sidney Gilpin, a respected leading man from the all-black Lafayette Players of Harlem, was the first actor to play the role of Brutus Jones on stage. There was some conflict over Gilpin's tendency to change O'Neill's use of the word \"nigger\" to Negro and colored during the play. This production was O'Neill's first real smash hit. The Players' small theater was too small to cope with audience demand for tickets, and the play was transferred to another theater. It ran for 204 performances and was hugely popular, touring in the States with this cast for the next two years.\n1925 revival.\nAlthough Gilpin continued to perform the role of Brutus Jones in the US tour that followed the Broadway closing of the play, he eventually had a falling out with O'Neill. Gilpin wanted O'Neill to remove the word \"nigger,\" which occurred frequently in the play, but the playwright felt its use was consistent with his dramatic intentions. Further, O'Neill defended the language as consistent with the behavior and speech of Adam Scott, the character's inspiration. When they could not come to a reconciliation, O'Neill replaced Gilpin with the young and then unknown Paul Robeson, who previously had only performed on the concert stage. Robeson starred in the title role in the 1925 New York revival (28 performances) and later in the London production.\nRobeson starred in the summer production in 1941 at the Ivoryton Playhouse, Ivoryton, Ct.\n1926 revival.\nThe show was again revived in 1926 at the Mayfair Theatre in Manhattan, with Gilpin again starring as Jones and also co-directing the show with James Light. The production, which ran for 61 performances, is noted for the acting debut of a young Moss Hart as Smithers.\nFederal Theatre Project.\nThe Federal Theatre Project of the Works Progress Administration launched several productions of the play in cities across the United States, including a production with marionettes in Los Angeles in 1938.\nRecent productions.\nIn 1980 Richard Negri directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Pete Postlethwaite and Albie Woodington.\nThe Wooster Group started to develop a production of the play in 1992 through a series of work in progress showings. The finished piece opened in 1993 at The Performing Garage. As part of its postdramatic aesthetics, this staging was notable for having an actor play the part of Jones who was female, white, and performed in blackface (Kate Valk). Blackface had been a suggestion for the original production, which O'Neill vetoed.\nIn 2005 Thea Sharrock directed the play, with Paterson Joseph in the title role, for the Bush Theatre in London. The audience looked down into a sand-filled pit. The claustrophic effect was admired by Michael Billington among others. The production transferred to the Olivier auditorium at The National Theatre, London, in 2007.\nNew York's Irish Repertory Theatre staged a 2009 revival, which received positive reviews. John Douglas Thompson portrayed Jones.\nAdaptations.\nThe play was adapted for a 1933 feature film starring Paul Robeson and directed by Dudley Murphy, an avant-garde filmmaker of O'Neill's Greenwich Village circle who pursued the reluctant playwright for a decade before getting the rights from him.\nLouis Gruenberg wrote an opera based on the play, which was premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1933. Baritone Lawrence Tibbett sang the title role, performing in blackface. Paul Robeson's 1936 film \"Song of Freedom\" features a scene from the opera with Robeson singing the role of Jones. This has sometimes resulted in a confusion that the 1933 film of O'Neill's play is a film of the opera.\nIn the UK, BBC Television produced an adaptation in 1938, starring Robert Adams, and another in 1953, starring Gordon Heath.\nSeveral revivals were made in the 1950s when Robeson himself was blacklisted, denied his passport by the State Department and his films \u2014 including the 1933 film \u2014 recordings and performances were banned in the United States; these new productions were implicitly in defiance of the persecution and suppression of this great star by McCarthyism and the FBI from 1950 until 1958, and part of a worldwide effort of artists to lift the ban.\nFirst, the legendary New York actor Ossie Davis starred in a television adaptation for the \"Kraft Television Theatre\" in 1955 \u2014 this at a time when black faces were rarely seen on American television sets.\nIn 1956 Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote a ballet based on the play that was commissioned by The Empire Music Festival of New York, and danced by Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n's company, most of them in blackface \u2014 Lim\u00f3n himself a revered teacher at Juilliard and breakthrough performer of color.\nA live British television production by ABC Television for the first season of its \"Armchair Theatre\" series was seen on UK television on March 30, 1958. It features African-American singer Kenneth Spencer, and was directed by the Canadian director Ted Kotcheff and adapted by the American \"beat\" novelist Terry Southern in his first screenwriting job. Unlike other British television versions, it still exists, and has been released on DVD.\nIt was adapted for Australian television in 1960.\nAn experimental video by Christopher Kondek and Elizabeth LeCompte showcases the production of the play by the New York-based performance troupe The Wooster Group, starring Kate Valk and Willem Dafoe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73453", "revid": "37024255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73453", "title": "Cinderella", "text": "European folk tale\nCinderella or The Little Glass Slipper, is a French folk tale with thousands of variants that are told throughout the world. The protagonist is a young girl living in unfortunate circumstances who is suddenly blessed with remarkable fortune, ultimately ascending to the throne through marriage. The story of Rhodopis\u2014recounted by the Greek geographer Strabo sometime between 7 BC and AD 23\u2014is about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt, and is usually considered to be the earliest known variant of the Cinderella story.\nThe first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his \"Pentamerone\" in 1634. The version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in \"Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9\" (translation: \"Histories or tales of times passed\") in 1697 as \"Cendrillon,\" and was anglicized as \"Cinderella\". Another version was later published as \"Aschenputtel\" by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\" in 1812.\nAlthough the story's title and main character's name change in different languages, in English-language folklore Cinderella is an archetypal name. The word Cinderella has, by analogy, come to mean someone whose attributes are unrecognized or someone who unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect. In the world of sports, \"a Cinderella\" is used for an underrated team or club winning over stronger and more favoured competitors. The still-popular story of Cinderella continues to influence popular culture internationally, lending plot elements, allusions, and tropes to a wide variety of media.\nAncient versions.\nEuropean.\nThe oldest known oral version of the Cinderella story is the ancient Greek story of Rhodopis, a Greek courtesan living in the colony of Naucratis in Egypt, whose name means \"Rosy-Cheeks\". The story is first recorded by the Greek geographer Strabo in his \"Geographica\" (book 17, 33): \"They [the Egyptians] tell the fabulous story that, when she was bathing, an eagle snatched one of her sandals from her maid and carried it to Memphis; and while the king was administering justice in the open air, the eagle, when it arrived above his head, flung the sandal into his lap; and the king, stirred both by the beautiful shape of the sandal and by the strangeness of the occurrence, sent men in all directions into the country in quest of the woman who wore the sandal; and when she was found in the city of Naucratis, she was brought up to Memphis, and became the wife of the king.\"\nThe same story is also later reported by the Roman orator Aelian (c.\u2009175 \u2013 c.\u2009235) in his \"Miscellaneous History\", which was written entirely in Greek. Aelian's story closely resembles the story told by Strabo, but adds that the name of the pharaoh in question was Psammetichus. Aelian's account indicates that the story of Rhodopis remained popular throughout antiquity.\nHerodotus, some five centuries before Strabo, records a popular legend about a possibly related courtesan named Rhodopis in his \"Histories\", claiming that she came from Thrace, was the slave of Iadmon of Samos and a fellow-slave of the story-teller Aesop, was taken to Egypt in the time of Pharaoh Amasis, and freed there for a large sum by Charaxus of Mytilene, brother of Sappho the lyric poet.\nThe resemblance of the shoe-testing of Rhodopis with Cinderella's slipper has already been noted in the 19th century, by Edgar Taylor and Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould.\nAspasia of Phocaea.\nA second predecessor for the Cinderella character, hailing from late Antiquity, may be Aspasia of Phocaea. Her story is told in Aelian's \"Varia Storia\": lost her mother in early childhood and raised by her father, Aspasia, despite living in poverty, has dreamt of meeting a noble man. As she dozes off, the girl has a vision of a dove transforming into a woman, who instructs her on how to remove a physical imperfection and restore her own beauty. In another episode, she and other courtesans are made to attend a feast hosted by Persian regent Cyrus the Younger. During the banquet, the Persian King sets his sights on Aspasia herself and ignores the other women.\n\"Le Fresne\".\nThe twelfth-century of (\"The Ash-Tree Girl\"), retold by Marie de France, is a variant of the \"Cinderella\" story in which a wealthy noblewoman abandons her infant daughter at the base of an ash tree outside a nunnery with a ring and brocade as tokens of her identity. Because she is one of twin sisters, the mother fears that she will be accused of infidelity. (According to popular belief at the time, twins were evidence of two different fathers.) The infant is discovered by the porter, who names her , meaning \"Ash Tree\", and she is raised by the nuns. After she has attained maturity, a young nobleman sees her and becomes her lover. The nobleman, however, is forced to marry a woman of noble birth. Fresne accepts that she will never marry her beloved but waits in the wedding chamber as a handmaiden. She covers the bed with her own brocade but, unknown to her, her beloved's bride is actually her twin sister, and her mother recognizes the brocade as the same one she had given to the daughter she had abandoned so many years before. Fresne's true parentage is revealed and, as a result of her noble birth, she is allowed to marry her beloved, while her twin sister is married to a different nobleman.\nfrom Malta.\nThe Maltese Cinderella is named . She is portrayed as an orphaned child during her early childhood. Before his death, her father gave her three magical objects: a chestnut, a nut, and an almond. She used to work as a servant in the King's palace. Nobody ever took notice of the poor girl. One day she heard of a big ball and with the help of a magical spell turned herself into a beautiful princess. The prince fell in love with her and gave her a ring. On the following night the Prince gave her a diamond and on the third night he gave her a ring with a large gem on it. By the end of the ball would run away hiding herself in the cellars of the Palace. She knew that the Prince was very sad about her disappearance so one day she made some krustini (typical Maltese biscuits) for him and hid the three gifts in each of them. When the Prince ate the biscuits he found the gifts he had given to the mysterious Princess and soon realized the huge mistake he had made of ignoring because of her poor looks. They soon made marriage arrangements and she became his wife.\nOutside Europe.\nThe tale of Ye Xian first appeared in \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\" written by Duan Chengshi around 860. In this version, Ye Xian is the daughter of the local tribal leader whose mother died when she was young. Because her mother died early, she is now under the care of her father's second wife, who abused her. She befriends a fish, which is the reincarnation of her deceased mother. Her stepmother and half-sister kill the fish, but Ye Xian finds the bones, which are magical, and they help her dress appropriately for a local Festival, including a very light golden shoe. Her stepfamily recognizes her at the festival, causing her to flee and accidentally lose the shoe. Afterwards, the king of another island obtains the shoe and is curious about it as no one has feet that can fit the shoe. The King searches everywhere and finally reaches Ye's house, where she tries on the shoe. The king realises she is the one and takes her back to his kingdom. Her cruel stepmother and half-sister are killed by flying rocks. Variants of the story are also found in many ethnic groups in China.\n\" and \".\n\"The Story of and\", from Vietnam, is similar to the Chinese version. The heroine T\u1ea5m also had a fish that was killed by the stepmother and the half-sister C\u00e1m, and its bones also give her clothes. Later after marrying the king, T\u1ea5m was killed by her stepmother and sister, and reincarnated several times in form of a bird, a loom and a gold apple. She finally reunited with the king and lived happily ever after. Cam asked her about her beauty secret. Tam led her to a hole and told her to jump inside. She then commanded the royal guards to pour boiling water on Cam. Her corpse was used to make a fermented sauce, to which she sent to the stepmother. The stepmother ate it with every single meal. After she reached the bottom of the jar, she looked down only to see her daughter's skull. She died of shock.\nThere are many variations for the ending of this story, with the family friendly version one usually ending with the stepmother and Cam being exiled, and then struck by lightning, killing them both. Other versions either have a different ending for the story or simply omit the revenge part entirely.\n\"Kongjwi and Patjwi\".\nOriginating from Korea, Kongjwi and Patjwi is a tale similar to Disney's Cinderella, with two distinguishing characteristics: the degree of violence and the plot's continuance past the marriage to the prince charming. The protagonist, Kongjwi, loses her mother when she was a child and her father remarries a widow. The widow also has a daughter, named Patjwi. After her father passes, the stepmother and Patjwi abuse Kongjwi by starving, beating, and working her brutally. Kongjwi is aided by animals and supernatural helpers, like a cow, a toad, a flock of birds, and a fairy. These helpers aid Kongjwi in attending a dance in honor of a magistrate. On her way back from the dance, Kongjwi loses one of her shoes, and the magistrate searches the towns to find the one who can fit the shoe. When he finds Kongjwi, he marries her.\nWhere the story usually ends, Kongjwi's hardships continue into the marriage. Patjwi, envious of this marriage, pretends to ask for Kongjwi's forgiveness and then drowns Kongjwi in a pond. Patjwi then pretends to be Kongjwi and marries the magistrate. Kongjwi is then reincarnated into a lotus flower, burned by Patjwi, and reincarnated once more into a marble. With help from additional characters, Kongjwi is able to inform her husband of Patjwi's doings. As punishment, Patjwi is ripped apart alive, her body made into jeotgal, and sent to her mother. She eats it in ignorance, and when told that it is Patjwi's flesh, she dies out of shock. There are 17 variants of this tale known in South Korea.\nA notable difference from other versions of Cinderella is that Kongjwi avenges her death with her own determination and willpower. Unlike Perrault's version of Cinderella, named Cendrillon, who forgives her stepfamily when they plead for forgiveness, Kongjwi takes ownership of the principle of () and accomplishes her vengeance herself. The violent degree of the punishments stems from the increased violence (starvation, beating, betrayal, and ultimately murder) that Kongjwi suffered compared to the abuses other versions went through.\nOther East and Southeast Asian versions.\nThere exists a Cambodian version (called \"Khmer\" by the collectors) with the name \"N\u00e9ang Kantoc\". Its collectors compared it to the Vietnamese story of \"Tam and Cam\".\nAnother version was collected from the Cham people of Southeast Asia, with the name (\"The Golden Sandal\") or (\"The tale of the ladies Hulek and Kjong\").\nIn Indonesian and Malay folklore there is a similar story with the name \"Bawang Merah dan Bawang Putih\" (\"The tale of Shallot and Garlic\").\n20th century folktale collector Kenichi Mizusawa published an analysis of Japanese variants of Cinderella, separating them into two types: \"Nukabuku, Komebuku\" (about rival step-sisters) and \"Ubagawa\" (about the heroine's disguise).\nWest Asian versions.\nThe Iranian version of the story is called Moon-Forehead or in Persian, Mahpishooni (). The story is very similar to the German version but the girl is described as having been born with a shining moon on her forehead and after losing her natural mother, was forced to live under the ashes, to block her shining moon that could overshadow the two daughters of her stepmother. The contrast between the shining moon and ash denotes potential, similar to fire under the ashes. The location of the shine on the forehead could be a reference to superior knowledge or personality.\nGerman scholar Ulrich Marzolph listed the Iranian variants of \"Cinderella\" under tale type *510A, \"Aschenputtel\", and noted that, in Iranian tradition, the type only exists in combination with type 480, .\n\"One Thousand and One Nights\".\nSeveral different variants of the story appear in the medieval \"One Thousand and One Nights\", including \"The Second Shaykh's Story\", \"The Eldest Lady's Tale\", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others, they are male. One of the tales, departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.\nLiterary versions.\nThe first European version written in prose was published in Naples, Italy, by Giambattista Basile, in his \"Pentamerone\" (1634). The story itself was set in the Kingdom of Naples, at that time the most important political and cultural center of Southern Italy and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the Neapolitan dialect. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by Charles Perrault in \"Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9\" (1697), and by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\" (1812).\nThe name \"Cenerentola\" derives from the Italian word \"cenere\" \"ash, cinder,\" an allusion to the fact that servants and scullions of the time were usually soiled with ash, partly as a result of their cleaning duties and partly because they lived in cold basements and so tended to huddle close to fireplaces for warmth.\n\"La gatta Cenerentola\", by Basile.\nGiambattista Basile, a writer, soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled \"Lo cunto de li cunti\" (\"The Tale of Tales\"), or \"Pentamerone\". It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.\nPlot:\nA prince has a daughter, Zezolla (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla's help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sardinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king's servant captures one of her pattens. The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a patten-test, identifies Zezolla after the patten jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her.\n\"Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de verre\", by Perrault.\nOne of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name \"Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle de verre\". The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of \"glass\" slippers.\nPlot:\nA wealthy widower marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two daughters, who are equally vain and selfish. But the man also has a beautiful young daughter from his first wife, a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The stepmother, jealous of the young girl because her good graces show up her own two daughters' faults, forces her into servitude, where the girl is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After her chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in ashes, giving rise to the mocking nickname \"Cendrillon\" (Cinderella) by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.\nOne day, the prince invites all the people in the land to a royal ball. The two stepsisters gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids are not invited to the ball.\nAs the two stepsisters and the stepmother depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her fairy godmother magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Fairy Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before midnight, when the spells will be broken.\nAt the ball, the entire court is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Fairy Godmother. She then innocently greets the two stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.\nAnother ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Fairy Godmother's help. The prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.\nThe prince's herald tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the herald arrives at Cinderella's home, the two stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the two stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always. Cinderella marries the prince and forgives her two stepsisters, then marrying them off to two wealthy noblemen of the court. They all lived happily ever after.\nThe first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless. Without it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything.\nHowever, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the criticism that Perrault is aiming at: That \"without doubt it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense. These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.\"\nCinderella's father is alive in this version, but is only briefly mentioned in two sentences at the beginning of the tale. It is explained that he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter because his wife controls him and the household entirely.\n\"Aschenputtel\", by the Brothers Grimm.\nAnother well-known version was recorded by the German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century. The tale is called \"Aschenputtel\" or \"Ashputtle\" or \"Ashputtel\" [\"The Little Ash Girl\"] (or \"Cinderella\" in English translations). This version is much more violent than that of Charles Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father has not died and the two stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother in this version of the Brothers Grimm, but rather help comes from a wishing tree, which the heroine had planted on her deceased mother's grave, when she recites a certain chant. In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Brothers Grimm supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the two stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment by the princess Cinderella for their cruelty. A fairy tale very similar to the Grimm one, \"Aschenbr\u00f6del\", was published by Ludwig Bechstein in 1845 in \"Deutsches M\u00e4rchenbuch\".\nSummary.\nA wealthy gentleman's wife falls gravely ill, and as she lies on her deathbed, she calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Ashfool\"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.\nOne day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The elder one asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.\nThe king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.\nThe girl goes back to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.\nThe next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the elder stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a \"dirty little Cinderella\" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the horror of the stepmother and the two limping sisters, their mere servant-girl had won without any subterfuge. The prince put Aschenputtel before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right.\nIn a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel's royal wedding, the stepsisters had hoped to worm their way into her favour as the future queen. As she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, Aschenputtel's doves strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. It is their last chance of redemption, but since they are desperate to win the new princess' affections, they don't give up and go through the ceremony, so when the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her beloved prince march out of the church, her doves fly again, promptly striking the remaining eyes of the two evil stepsisters blind, a truly awful comeuppance they have to endure.\n1812 version.\nIn addition to the absence of the punishment of the stepsisters, there are other minor differences in the first edition of 1812, some of which are reminiscent of Perrault's version. In the first edition, Cinderella's mother herself tells her to plant a tree on her grave. No bird perches on the tree but the tree itself gives the girl what she wants. The birds appear only when they help Cinderella collect lentils, a task that is assigned to her by her stepsisters rather than her stepmother, and they are not a flock but just two pigeons. On the evening of the first ball, Cinderella does not participate but she watches her stepsisters dance with the prince from the pigeon coop. Later Cinderella tells the sisters she saw them dancing, and they destroy the pigeon coop out of jealousy. In the 1812 version the tree also gives Cinderella a carriage with six horses to go to the ball and the pigeons tell her to return before midnight. The episodes in which Cinderella hides in the pigeon coop and on the pear tree were added in the 1819 version. Furthermore, not knowing Cinderella's home, the prince makes other girls in the kingdom try on the slipper before her.\nPlot variations and alternative tellings.\nFolklorists have long studied variants on this tale across cultures. In 1893, Marian Roalfe Cox, commissioned by the Folklore Society of Britain, produced \"Cinderella: Three Hundred and Forty-Five Variants of Cinderella, Catskin and, Cap o'Rushes, Abstracted and Tabulated with a Discussion of Medieval Analogues and Notes.\" Further morphology studies have continued on this work.\nJoseph Jacobs has attempted to reconstruct the original tale as \"The Cinder Maid\" by comparing the common features among hundreds of variants collected across Europe. The Aarne\u2013Thompson\u2013Uther system classifies \"Cinderella\" as type 510A, \"Persecuted Heroine\". Others of this type include \"The Sharp Grey Sheep\"; \"The Golden Slipper\"; \"The Story of Tam and Cam\"; \"Rushen Coatie\"; \"The Wonderful Birch\"; \"Fair, Brown and Trembling\"; and \"Katie Woodencloak\".\nThe magical help.\nInternational versions lack the fairy godmother present in the famous Perrault's tale. Instead, the donor is her mother, incarnated into an animal (if she is dead) or transformed into a cow (if alive). In other versions, the helper is an animal, such as a cow, a bull, a pike, or a saint or angel. The bovine helper appears in some Greek and Armenian versions, in \"the Balkan-Slavonic tradition of the tale\", and in some Central Asian variants. The mother-as-cow is killed by the heroine's sisters, her bones gathered and from her grave the heroine gets the wonderful dresses.\nAfricanist Sigrid Schmidt stated that \"a typical scene\" in Kapmalaien (Cape Malays) tales is the mother becoming a fish, being eaten in fish form, the daughter burying her bones and a tree sprouting from her grave.\nProfessor Gra\u017eina Skabeikyt\u0117-Kazlauskien\u0117 recognizes that the fish, the cow, even a female dog (in other variants), these animals represent \"the [heroine's] mother's legacy\". Jack Zipes, commenting on a Sicilian variant, concluded much the same: Cinderella is helped by her mother \"in the guise of doves, fairies, and godmothers\". In his notes to his own reconstruction, Joseph Jacobs acknowledged that the heroine's animal helper (e.g., cow or sheep) was \"clearly identified with her mother\", as well as the tree on Cinderella's mother's grave was connected to her.\nVillains.\nAlthough many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type 510A is a female persecutor: in \"Fair, Brown and Trembling\" and \"Finette Cendron\", the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are \"Cap O' Rushes\", \"Catskin\", and \"Allerleirauh\" (or \"All-Kinds-of-Fur\"), and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job as a scullery maid there. In \"Katie Woodencloak\", the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.\nIn \"La Cenerentola\", Gioachino Rossini inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is mistreated by her stepfather. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.\nIn some retellings, at least one stepsister is somewhat kind to Cinderella and second guesses the Stepmother's treatment. This is seen in \"Ever After\", to Walt Disney's 1950 film, and the 2013 Broadway musical.\nBall, ballgown, and curfew.\nThe number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three, and neither does the event have to be a ball, with some heroines going to church instead. The fairy godmother is Perrault's own addition to the tale. The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the Grimms's version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as in the Finnish \"The Wonderful Birch\". Playwright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical \"Into the Woods\". Giambattista Basile's \"La gatta Cenerentola\" combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in \"Katie Woodencloak\", \"Rushen Coatie\", \"Bawang Putih Bawang Merah\", \"The Story of Tam and Cam\", or \"The Sharp Grey Sheep\"\u2014these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in \"The Golden Slipper\", a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. Gioachino Rossini, having agreed to do an opera based on \"Cinderella\" if he could omit all magical elements, wrote \"La Cenerentola\", in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.\nThe midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.\nIdentifying item.\nThe glass slipper is unique to Charles Perrault's version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the Brothers Grimm, German: \"Aschenbroedel\" and \"Aschenputtel\", for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity. What matters to the story is that the identifying item will fit only one woman.\nIn Rossini's opera \"La Cenerentola\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant \"The Wonderful Birch\", the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (\"pantoufle de verre\") had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (\"pantoufle de vair\") in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words. However, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part. Nabokov has Professor Timofey Pnin assert as fact that \"Cendrillon's shoes were not made of glass but of Russian squirrel fur \u2013 \"vair\", in French\".\nThe 1950 Disney adaptation takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered by the spiteful stepmother just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on. Earlier in the film the Duke warns that the slipper could fit any number of women, but Cinderella then produces the beautiful matching slipper, proving beyond all doubt that she is the one from the ball.\nRevelation.\nIn many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it. The prince nevertheless insists on her trying. Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).\nConclusion.\nAccording to Korean scholarship, East Asian versions of \"Cinderella\" \"typically\" continue as the heroine's stepmother replaces the Cinderella-like character for her own daughter, while the heroine goes through a cycle of transformations. Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.\nSuch a substitution also occurs in the Finnish and Russian tale \"The Wonderful Birch\", where the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth and turn the true bride into reindeer, and the Irish \"Fair, Brown and Trembling\", where the oldest sister pushes the true bride into the sea to be swallowed by a whale and takes her place. However, in Western tales, substituting the stepdaughter for the transformed bride is commonly found in other tales, such as \"The White Bride and the Black One\", \"The White Duck\", \"Brother and Sister\", and \"The Three Little Men in the Wood\". Neither is the motif limited to stepmothers, as in \"The Love for Three Oranges\", where a new character appears to transform the bride and substitute for her.\nIn \"The Thousand Nights and A Night\", in a tale called \"The Anklet\", the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night.\nWorks based on the Cinderella story.\nWorks based on the story of Cinderella include:\nTheatre.\nIn 1804, \"Cinderella\" was presented at Drury Lane Theatre, London, described as \"A new Grand Allegorical Pantomimic Spectacle\", though it was very far in style and content from the modern pantomime. However, it included notable clown Joseph Grimaldi playing the part of a servant called Pedro, the antecedent of today's character Buttons. In 1820 \"Harlequin and Cinderella\" at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden had much of the modern story (taken from the opera La Cenerentola) by Rossini, but was a Harlequinade, again featuring Grimaldi. In 1830, Rophino Lacy used Rossini's music, but with spoken dialogue in a comic opera with many of the main characters: the Baron, the two stepsisters and Pedro the servant all as comic characters, plus a Fairy Queen instead of a magician. However, it was the conversion of this via burlesque and rhyming couplets by Henry Byron that led to what was effectively the modern pantomime in both story and style at the Royal Strand Theatre in 1860: \"Cinderella! Or the Lover, the Lackey, and the Little Glass Slipper\".\nIn the traditional pantomime version, the opening scene takes place in a forest with a hunt in progress; here, Cinderella first meets Prince Charming and his \"right-hand man\" Dandini, whose name and character come from Gioachino Rossini's opera (\"La Cenerentola\"). Cinderella mistakes Dandini for the Prince, and the Prince for Dandini. Her father, Baron Hardup, is under the thumb of his two stepdaughters, the Ugly sisters, and has a servant, Cinderella's friend Buttons. Throughout the pantomime, the Baron is continually harassed by the Broker's Men (often named after current politicians) for outstanding rent. The Fairy Godmother must magically create a coach (from a pumpkin), footmen (from mice), a coach driver (from a frog), and a beautiful dress (from rags) for Cinderella to go to the ball. However, she must return by midnight, as it is then that the spell ceases.\nFilms and television.\nOver the decades, hundreds of films have been made that are either direct adaptations from \"Cinderella\" or have plots loosely based on the story.\nEnglish language live-action feature films.\nModernizations and parodies\nEnglish language live-action TV films and series.\nTelevision parodies and modernizations\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Clutching Hand was the first mystery villain to appear in a film serial. The concept was widely used for the remainder of the format's existence.\nThe serial stars Pearl White (who also starred in \"The Perils of Pauline\"), Arnold Daly, Sheldon Lewis, Creighton Hale, and Riley Hatch. Lionel Barrymore had a small role. The serial was written by Arthur B. Reeve (novel), Charles W. Goddard, and George B. Seitz, and directed by Louis J. Gasnier, Seitz, and Leopold Wharton. The film was produced by the Wharton Studio of Ithaca, New York, and distributed by Path\u00e9 Exchange, the American distribution branch of the French company Path\u00e9 at that time. Path\u00e9 was the largest film equipment and production company in the world during the first part of the 20th century.\nThe film was followed in 1915 by \"The New Exploits of Elaine\".\nThe serial, which is extant, was named to the United States National Film Registry in 1994 for its cultural and historic importance.\nProduction.\n\"The Exploits of Elaine\" was based on a book in the \"Craig Kennedy, Scientific Detective\" series by Arthur B. Reeve. It was a prototype for the scientific mystery serials but has less interest for later audiences. A lot of the technology and science demonstrated in the serial soon became out of date or considered mundane. For example, the serial has to explain the concept of fingerprinting in dramatic fashion. Nevertheless, the serial was a success on its release and led to two sequels, \"The New Exploits of Elaine\" (1915) and \"The Romance of Elaine\" (1915).\nCliffhangers.\nSimilar to other film serials, each chapter typically closed with a cliffhanger with Elaine in some physical peril or confronted with a shocking revelation. For example, at the close of Chapter 10 Elaine actually dies. She is then brought back to life in the next chapter by Craig Kennedy.\nCritical reception.\nIn the opinion of film critic Stedman, this serial is an improvement on \"The Perils of Pauline\", with better acting, script, and direction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73458", "revid": "15881234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73458", "title": "Ottawa River", "text": "River in Canada\nThe Ottawa River (, ) is a river in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It is named after the Algonquin word \"to trade\", as it was the major trade route of Eastern Canada at the time. For most of its length, it defines the border between these two provinces. It is a major tributary of the St. Lawrence River and the longest river in Quebec.\nGeography.\nThe river rises at Lac des Outaouais, north of the Laurentian Mountains of central Quebec, and flows west to Lake Timiskaming. From there its route has been used to define the interprovincial border with Ontario. \nFrom Lake Timiskaming, the river flows southeast to Ottawa and Gatineau, where it tumbles over Chaudi\u00e8re Falls and further takes in the Rideau and Gatineau rivers.\nThe Ottawa River drains into the Lake of Two Mountains and the St. Lawrence River at Montreal. The river is long; it drains an area of , 65\u00a0per cent in Quebec and the rest in Ontario, with a mean discharge of . It has a maximum depth of at the Carillon Reservoir and is wide at its widest part.\nThe average annual mean waterflow measured at Carillon dam, near the Lake of Two Mountains, is , with average annual extremes of . Record historic levels since 1964 are a low of in 2010 and a high of in 2017.\nThe river flows through large areas of deciduous and coniferous forest formed over thousands of years as trees recolonized the Ottawa Valley after the ice age. Generally, the coniferous forests and blueberry bogs occur on old sand plains left by retreating glaciers, or in wetter areas with clay substrate. The deciduous forests, dominated by birch, maple, beech, oak and ash occur in more mesic areas with better soil, generally around the boundary with the La Varendrye Park. These primeval forests were occasionally affected by natural fire, mostly started by lightning, which led to increased reproduction by pine and oak, as well as fire barrens and their associated species. The vast areas of pine were exploited by early loggers. Later generations of logging removed hemlock for use in tanning leather, leaving a permanent deficit of hemlock in most forests. Associated with the logging and early settlement were vast wild fires which not only removed the forests, but led to soil erosion. Consequently, nearly all the forests show varying degrees of human disturbance. Tracts of older forest are uncommon, and hence they are considered of considerable importance for conservation.\nThe Ottawa River has large areas of wetlands. Some of the more biologically important wetland areas include (going downstream from Pembroke), the Westmeath sand dune/wetland complex, Mississippi Snye, Breckenridge Nature Reserve, Shirleys Bay, Ottawa Beach/Andrew Haydon Park, Petrie Island, the Duck Islands and Greens Creek. The Westmeath sand dune/wetland complex is significant for its relatively pristine sand dunes, few of which remain along the Ottawa River, and the many associated rare plants. Shirleys Bay has a biologically diverse shoreline alvar, as well as one of the largest silver maple swamps along the river. Like all wetlands, these depend upon the seasonal fluctuations in the water level. High water levels help create and maintain silver maple swamps, while low water periods allow many rare wetland plants to grow on the emerged sand and clay flats. There are five principal wetland vegetation types. One is swamp, mostly silver maple. There are four herbaceous vegetation types, named for the dominant plant species in them: \"Scirpus\", \"Eleocharis\", \"Sparganium\" and \"Typha\". Which type occurs in a particular location depends upon factors such as substrate type, water depth, ice-scour and fertility. Inland, and mostly south of the river, older river channels, which date back to the end of the ice age, and no longer have flowing water, have sometimes filled with a different wetland type, peat bog. Examples include Mer Bleue and Alfred Bog.\nTributaries.\nMajor tributaries include:\nCommunities.\nCommunities along the Ottawa River include (in down-stream order): \nIslands.\nOntario.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nQuebec.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGeology.\nThe Ottawa River lies in the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, which is a Mesozoic rift valley that formed 175 million years ago. Much of the river flows through the Canadian Shield, although lower areas flow through limestone plains and glacial deposits.\nAs the glacial ice sheet began to retreat at the end of the last ice age, the Ottawa River valley, which, along with the St. Lawrence River valley and Lake Champlain, had been depressed to below sea level by the glacier's weight, filled with sea water. The resulting arm of the ocean is known as the Champlain Sea. Fossil remains of marine life dating 12 to 10 thousand years ago have been found in marine clay throughout the region. Sand deposits from this era have produced vast plains, often dominated by pine forests, as well as localized areas of sand dunes, such as Westmeath and Constance Bay. Clay deposits from this period have resulted in areas of poor drainage, large swamps, and peat bogs in some ancient channels of this river. Hence, the distribution of forests and wetlands is very much a product of these past glacial events.\nLarge deposits of a material commonly known as Leda clay also formed. These deposits become highly unstable after heavy rains. Numerous landslides have occurred as a result. The former site of the town of Lemieux, Ontario collapsed into the South Nation River in 1993. The town's residents had previously been relocated because of the suspected instability of the earth in that location.\nAs the land gradually rose again the sea coast retreated and the fresh water courses of today took shape. Following the demise of the Champlain Sea the Ottawa River Valley continued to drain the waters of the emerging Upper Great Lakes basin through Lake Nipissing and the Mattawa River. Owing to the ongoing uplift of the land, the eastward flow became blocked around 4000 years ago. Thereafter Lake Nipissing drained westward, through the French River which later became a link in the historic canoe route to the West.\nHistory.\nAs it does to this day, the river played a vital role in life of the Algonquin people, who lived throughout its watershed at contact. The river is called \"Kichis\u00ecpi\", meaning \"Great River\" in Anicin\u00e0bemowin, the Algonquin language. The Algonquin define themselves in terms of their position on the river, referring to themselves as the Om\u00e0miwinini, 'down-river people'. Although a majority of the Algonquin First Nation lives in Quebec, the entire Ottawa Valley is Algonquin traditional territory. Present settlement is a result of adaptations made as a result of settler pressures.\nSome early European explorers, possibly considering the Ottawa River to be more significant than the Upper St. Lawrence River, applied the name \"River Canada\" to the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River below the confluence at Montreal. As the extent of the Great Lakes became clear and the river began to be regarded as a tributary, it was variously known as the \"Grand River\", \"Great River\" or \"Grand River of the Algonquins\" before the present name was settled upon. This name change resulted from the Ottawa peoples' control of the river circa 1685. However, only one band of Ottawa, the Kinouncherpirini or Keinouch, ever inhabited the Ottawa Valley.\nIn 1615, Samuel de Champlain and \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9, assisted by Algonquin guides, were the first Europeans to travel up the Ottawa River and follow the water route west along the Mattawa and French Rivers to the Great Lakes. See Canadian Canoe Routes (early). For the following two centuries, this route was used by French fur traders, voyageurs and coureurs des bois to Canada's interior. The river posed serious hazards to these travellers. The section near Deux Rivi\u00e8res used to have spectacular and wild rapids, namely the \"Rapide de la Veill\u00e9e\", the \"Trou\", the \"Rapide des Deux Rivi\u00e8res\", and the \"Rapide de la Roche Capitaine\". (These rapids are now submerged under the reservoir of Holden Lake.) In 1800, explorer Daniel Harmon reported 14 crosses marking the deaths of voyageurs who had drowned in the dangerous waters along this section of the Ottawa.\nThe main trading posts along the river were: Lachine, Fort Coulonge, Lac des Allumettes, Mattawa House, where west-bound canoes left the river and Fort T\u00e9miscamingue. From Lake Timiskaming a portage led north to the Abitibi River and James Bay.\nIn the early 19th century, the Ottawa River and its tributaries were used to gain access to large virgin forests of white pine. A booming trade in timber developed, and large rafts of logs were floated down the river. A scattering of small subsistence farming communities developed along the shores of the river to provide manpower for the lumber camps in winter. In 1832, following the War of 1812, the Ottawa River gained strategic importance when the Carillon Canal was completed. Together with the Rideau Canal, the Carillon Canal was constructed to provide an alternate military supply route to Kingston and Lake Ontario, bypassing the route along the Saint Lawrence River.\nPower generation.\nA pulp and paper mill (at T\u00e9miscaming) and several hydroelectric dams have been constructed on the river. In 1950, the dam at Rapides-des-Joachims was built, forming Holden Lake behind it and thereby submerging the rapids and portages at Deux Rivi\u00e8res. These hydro dams have had negative effects upon shoreline and wetland ecosystems, and are thought to also be responsible for the near extermination of American eels, which were once an abundant species in the river, but which are now uncommon. As an economic route, its importance was eclipsed by railroad and highways in the 20th century. It is no longer used for log driving, however, it is still extensively used for recreational boating. Some 20,000 pleasure boaters visit the Carillon Canal annually.\nToday, Outaouais Herald Emeritus at the Canadian Heraldic Authority is named after the river.\nHydroelectric installations.\nHydroelectric installations on the Upper Ottawa (in downstream order):\nLower Ottawa (in downstream order):\nProtected areas.\nNumerous non-contiguous areas of the Ottawa River and its shores are protected in a variety of provincial parks, conservation areas, and municipal parks.\nIn Quebec, there are 3 national parks directly along the Ottawa River (Oka National Park, Plaisance National Park, and Op\u00e9mican National Park), as well as one major nature reserve through which the river runs (La V\u00e9rendrye Wildlife Reserve). Several ZECs (zone d'exploitation contr\u00f4l\u00e9e) also line the Ottawa River.\nOntario has 7 provincial parks along the banks of the Ottawa River: Voyageur Provincial Park, Fitzroy Provincial Park, Ottawa River Provincial Park, Westmeath Provincial Park, Petawawa Terrace Provincial Park, Driftwood Provincial Park, and Alexander Lake Forest Provincial Park).\nOttawa River Provincial Park.\nThe Ottawa River Provincial Park is in the Township of Whitewater Region, Ontario, protecting a series of pristine islands and a small undeveloped section of shoreline along the Ontario side of the Ottawa River. This section of the Ottawa River is known for its whitewater, and is used by a number of commercial rafting companies and many recreational kayakers and canoeists.\nThe park is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no services and facilities for visitors. The park can be used for backcountry camping, whitewater canoeing, swimming, hunting, and fishing.\nSome of the islands included in the park are Big, Butternut, Cedar, Hazelton, and Lorne Islands, in addition to many unnamed islands. They consists of marble bedrock or low-lying alluvial sands and silts. A total of sixteen regionally significant plant species, such as little bluestem (\"Andropogon scoparius\"), cordgrass (\"Spartina pectinata\") and Indiangrass (\"Sorghastrum nutans\") have been found in the park, as well as the nationally significant lake cress (\"Rorippa aquatica\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are related to the Inuit and I\u00f1upiat. Yupik peoples include the following:\nPopulation.\nThe Yup\u02bcik people are by far the most numerous of the various Alaska Native groups. They speak the Central Alaskan Yup\u02bcik language, a member of the Eskaleut family of languages.\nAs of the 2002 United States Census, the Yupik population in the United States numbered more than 24,000, of whom more than 22,000 lived in Alaska; the vast majority live in the 70 or so communities in the traditional Yup\u02bcik territory of western and southwestern Alaska. United States census data for Yupik include 2,355 Sugpiat; there are also 1,700 Yupik living in Russia. According to 2019-based United States Census Bureau data, there are 700 Alaskan Natives in Seattle, many of whom are Inuit and Yupik; there are also almost 7,000 Yupik in the state of Washington.\nEtymology of name.\n\"Yup\u02bcik\" (plural \"Yupiit\") comes from the Yupik word \"yuk\" meaning \"person\" plus the post-base \"-pik\" meaning \"real\" or \"genuine\". Thus, it literally means \"real people.\" The ethnographic literature sometimes refers to the Yup\u02bcik people or their language as \"Yuk\" or \"Yuit\". In the Hooper Bay-Chevak and Nunivak dialects of Yup\u02bcik, both the language and the people are known as \"Cup\u02bcik\".\nThe use of an apostrophe in the name \"Yup\u02bcik\", compared to Siberian \"Yupik\", exemplifies the Central Alaskan Yup\u02bcik's orthography, where \"the apostrophe represents gemination [or lengthening] of the \u2018p\u02bc sound\".\nThe \"person/people\" (human being) in the Yupik and Inuit languages:\nOrigins.\nThe common ancestors of the Indigenous and Aleut (as well as various Paleo-Siberian groups) are believed by anthropologists to have their origin in eastern Siberia, arriving in the Bering Sea area approximately 10,000 years ago. Research on blood types, supported by later linguistic and DNA findings, suggests that the ancestors of other indigenous peoples of the Americas reached North America before the ancestors of the Indigenous and Aleut. There appear to have been several waves of migration from Siberia to the Americas by way of the Bering land bridge, which became exposed between 20,000 and 8,000 years ago during periods of glaciation. By about 3,000 years ago, the progenitors of the Yupiit had settled along the coastal areas of what would become western Alaska, with migrations up the coastal rivers\u2014notably the Yukon and Kuskokwim\u2014around 1400 AD, eventually reaching as far upriver as Paimiut on the Yukon and Crow Village on the Kuskokwim.\nThe Siberian Yupik may represent a back-migration of the Indigenous people to Siberia from Alaska.\nCulture.\nTraditionally, families spent the spring and summer at fish camp, then joined others at village sites for the winter. Many families still harvest the traditional subsistence resources, especially Pacific salmon and seal.\nThe men's communal house, the \"qasgiq\", was the community center for ceremonies and festivals that included singing, dancing, and storytelling. The qasgiq was used mainly during the winter months because people would travel in family groups following food sources throughout the spring, summer, and fall months. Aside from ceremonies and festivals, the qasgiq was also where the men taught the young boys survival and hunting skills, as well as other life lessons. The young boys were also taught how to make tools and \"qayaq\" (kayaks) during the winter months in the qasgiq. The ceremonies involve a shaman.\nThe women's house, the \"ena\", was traditionally right next door. In some areas, the two communal houses were connected by a tunnel. Women taught the young girls how to tan hides and sew, process and cook game and fish, and weave. Boys would live with their mothers until they were approximately five years old, then they would join the men in the qasgiq.\nFor a period varying between three and six weeks, the boys and girls would switch cultural educational situations, with the men teaching the girls survival, hunting skills, and toolmaking, and the women teaching the boys the skills they taught to the girls.\nIn Yup\u02bcik group dances, individuals often remain stationary while moving their upper body and arms rhythmically, their gestures accentuated by handheld dance fans, very similar in design to Cherokee dance fans. The limited motion by no means limits the expressiveness of the dances, which can be gracefully flowing, bursting with energy, or wryly humorous.\nThe Yup\u02bcik are unique among native peoples of the Americas in that they name children after the most recent person in the community to have died.\nThe \"kuspuk\" (\"qaspeq\") is a traditional Yup\u02bcik garment worn by both genders. In Alaska, it is worn in both casual and formal settings.\nThe seal-oil lamp \"(naniq)\" was an important piece of furniture.\nLanguages.\nFive Yupik languages (related to Inuktitut) are still very widely spoken; Yup\u02bcik is the most spoken Native language in Alaska by both population and speakers. This makes Yup\u02bcik the second most spoken indigenous language in the US, after Navajo.\nLike the Alaskan I\u00f1upiat, the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik adopted the system of writing developed by Moravian Church missionaries during the 1760s in Greenland. Late 19th-century Moravian missionaries to the Yupik in southwestern Alaska used Yupik in church services and translated the scriptures into the people's language.\nRussian explorers in the 1800s erroneously identified the Yupik people bordering the territory of the somewhat unrelated Aleut as also Aleut, or \"Alutiiq\", in Yupik. By tradition, this term has remained in use, as well as \"Sugpiaq\", both of which refer to the Yupik of Southcentral Alaska and Kodiak.\nThe whole Eskaleut languages family is shown below:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73460", "revid": "5839510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73460", "title": "Fantasia (1940 film)", "text": "1940 animated film by Walt Disney\nFantasia is a 1940 American animated musical anthology film produced by Walt Disney Productions, with story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer and production supervision by Walt Disney and Ben Sharpsteen. It consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film's Master of Ceremonies who introduces each segment in live-action.\nDisney settled on the film's concept in 1938 as work neared completion on \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", originally an elaborate \"Silly Symphony\" cartoon designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs surpassed what the short could earn, Disney decided to include it in a feature-length film of multiple segments set to classical pieces with Stokowski and Taylor as collaborators. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound system developed by Disney and RCA that made \"Fantasia\" the first commercial film shown in stereo and a precursor to surround sound.\n\"Fantasia\" was first released as a theatrical roadshow that was held in 13 cities across the U.S. between 1940 and 1941 by RKO Radio Pictures; the first began at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. While acclaimed by critics, it failed to make a profit owing to World War II cutting off distribution to the European market, the film's high production costs, and the expense of building Fantasound equipment and leasing theatres for roadshow presentations. Since 1942, the film has been reissued multiple times by RKO Radio Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution, with its original footage and audio being deleted, modified, or restored in each version. When adjusted for inflation, \"Fantasia\" is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S.\nThe \"Fantasia\" franchise has grown to include video games, Disneyland attractions, and a live concert series. A sequel, \"Fantasia 2000\", co-produced by Walt Disney's nephew Roy E. Disney, was released in 1999. \"Fantasia\" has grown in reputation over the years and is now widely acclaimed as one of the greatest animated films of all time; in 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their 100 Years...100 Movies and the fifth greatest animated film in their 10 Top 10 list. In 1990, \"Fantasia\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\n\"Fantasia\" opens with live-action scenes of members of an orchestra gathering against a blue background and tuning their instruments in half-light, half-shadow. Master of ceremonies Deems Taylor enters the stage (also in half-light, half-shadow) and introduces the program.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\n\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and expansion to feature film.\nIn 1936, Walt Disney felt that his cartoon studio's star character Mickey Mouse needed a boost in popularity as newcomers Donald Duck and Goofy had become new favorites amongst audiences. He decided to star Mickey in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", a deluxe cartoon short based on Goethe's poem of the same name and set to the orchestral piece by Paul Dukas also inspired by the original tale. Although Disney had explored the concept of matching animation to classical music since 1928 with his \"Silly Symphony\" cartoons, he wanted to go beyond the usual slapstick in those shorts and produce ones where \"sheer fantasy unfolds\". Upon receiving the rights to use the Dukas piece in July 1937, Disney considered using a well-known conductor to record the music for added prestige. He happened to meet Leopold Stokowski, then the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, at Chasen's restaurant in Hollywood and talked about his plans for the short. An enthusiastic Stokowski informed Disney that he liked the piece and offered to conduct for free.\nDisney's New York representative met Stokowski on a subsequent train journey, and reported the conductor was serious in his offer and \"had some very interesting ideas on instrumental coloring, which would be perfect for an animation medium.\" Disney felt \"all steamed up over the idea\" and thought the partnership \"would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation.\" He had already begun working on a story outline and wished to use \"the finest men\u00a0... from color\u00a0... down to animators\" on the new short that was to be promoted as a special and unique film, outside of the Mickey Mouse cartoon series. On December 16, 1937, Stokowski signed a contract with Disney that allowed him to \"select and employ a complete symphony orchestra\" for the recording of \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", and was paid $5,000 for his services. The three-hour recording session began at midnight on January 9, 1938 at Culver Studios in California, with 85 Hollywood musicians. When production costs surpassed $125,000, as much as four times greater than the average \"Silly Symphony\", Disney and his brother Roy, who managed the studio's finances, realised that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own. Roy urged his brother to keep additional costs to a minimum \"because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature\u00a0... we have no idea what can be expected from such a production.\" Ben Sharpsteen, a production supervisor on \"Fantasia\", recalled that Disney \"saw this trouble in the form of an opportunity. This was the birth of a new concept, a group of separate numbers\u2014regardless of their running time\u2014put together in a single presentation. It turned out to be a concert\u2014something novel and of high quality.\"\nIdeas to expand \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and produce a full-length feature film began in February 1938, when inquiries were made to extend Stokowski's contract with the studio. In August, Disney asked Stokowski to return to the studios to help select musical pieces for the new film, which was initially titled \"The Concert Feature\". Disney agreed to pay Stokowski $80,000 plus royalties for his services. The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on-screen host to introduce each number in the program. Both had heard composer and music critic Deems Taylor provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic and agreed that he would be most suitable for the role. Disney did contact Taylor about the project and invited him to collaborate with Stokowski and himself, but by then work on \"Pinocchio\", \"Bambi\", and development on his new Burbank studio kept him too busy to work on the new feature. In a change of plans, Taylor was asked during a call on September 3, 1938, to come to the studios as soon as possible. He was paid $1,440 per week during his one month visit.\nStory meetings and program selection.\nThe program for \"The Concert Feature\" was assembled in a series of meetings in September 1938. Disney made story writers Joe Grant and Dick Huemer gather a preliminary selection of music and along with Stokowski, Taylor, and the heads of various departments, discussed their ideas. Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review. As selections were considered, a recording of the piece was played back at the next gathering. Disney did not contribute much to early discussions; he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained. In one meeting, he inquired about a piece \"on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme\u00a0... with animals\". The group was considering \"The Firebird\" by Igor Stravinsky, but Taylor noted that his \"\"Le Sacre du printemps\" would be something on that order\", to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording, \"This is marvelous! It would be perfect for prehistoric animals. There would be something terrific in dinosaurs, flying lizards, and prehistoric monsters. There could be beauty in the settings.\"\nNumerous choices were discarded as talks continued, including \"Moto Perpetuo\" by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini with \"shots of dynamos, cogs, pistons\" and \"whirling wheels\" to show the production of a collar button. Other deleted material included \"Prelude in G minor\" and \"Troika\" by Sergei Rachmaninoff, and a rendition of \"The Song of the Flea\" by Mussorgsky, which was to be sung by Lawrence Tibbett. On September 29, 1938, around sixty of Disney's artists gathered for a two-and-a-half hour piano concert while he provided a running commentary about the new musical feature. A rough version of \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" was also shown that, according to one attendee, had the crowd applauding and cheering \"until their hands were red\". The final pieces were chosen the following morning, which included Toccata and Fugue in D minor, \"Cydalise et le Ch\u00e8vre-pied\" by Gabriel Piern\u00e9, \"The Nutcracker Suite\", \"Night on Bald Mountain\", \"Ave Maria\", \"Dance of the Hours\", \"Clair de Lune\" by Claude Debussy, \"The Rite of Spring\" and \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". Disney had already begun working out the details for the segments, and showed greater enthusiasm and eagerness as opposed to his anxiety while starting on the problematic \"Pinocchio\".\n\"Clair de Lune\" was soon removed from the program, and Disney and his writers encountered problems of setting a concrete story to \"Cydalise\". Its opening march, \"The Entry of the Little Fauns\", attracted Disney to the piece which at first provided suitable depictions of fauns he wanted. On January 5, 1939, following a search for a stronger piece to fit the mythological theme, the piece was replaced with sections of Beethoven's sixth symphony. Stokowski disagreed with the switch, believing that Disney's \"idea of mythology\u00a0... is not quite what this symphony is about\". He was also concerned about the reception from classical music enthusiasts who would criticize Disney for venturing too far from the composer's intent. Taylor on the other hand welcomed the change, describing it as \"a stunning one\", and saw \"no possible objection to it\".\nThe new feature continued to be known as \"The Concert Feature\" or \"Musical Feature\" as late as November 1938. Hal Horne, a publicist for Disney's film distributor RKO Radio Pictures, wished for a different title, and gave the suggestion \"Filmharmonic Concert\". Stuart Buchanan then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1,800 suggestions, but the favorite among the film's supervisors was \"Fantasia\", an early working title. Horne said: \"It isn't the word alone but the meaning we read into it.\" From the beginning of its development, Disney expressed the greater importance of music in \"Fantasia\" compared to his past work: \"In our ordinary stuff, our music is always under action, but on this\u00a0... we're supposed to be picturing this music\u2014not the music fitting our story.\" Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to people who, like himself, had previously \"walked out on this kind of stuff\".\nSegments.\nMore than 1,000 artists and technicians were used in the making of \"Fantasia\", which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between preceding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department sculpted three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles. The live action scenes were filmed using the three-strip Technicolor process, while the animated segments were shot in successive yellow, cyan and magenta-exposed frames. The different pieces of film were then spliced together to form a complete print. A multiplane camera that could handle seven levels, three more than the studio's original model, was built specifically for the film. \"Fantasia\" has of multiplane footage, more than \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and \"Pinocchio\" combined.\nToccata and Fugue in D Minor.\nDisney had been interested in producing abstract animation since he saw \"A Colour Box\" by Len Lye from 1935. He explained the work done in the \"Toccata and Fugue\" was \"no sudden idea\u00a0... they were something we had nursed along several years but we never had a chance to try.\" Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young, who produced drawings influenced by the patterns on the edge of a piece of sound film. In late 1938, Disney hired Oskar Fischinger, a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films, including some with classical music, to work with Young. Upon review of three leica reels produced by the two, Disney rejected all three. According to Huemer, all Fishinger \"did was little triangles and designs\u00a0... it didn't come off at all. Too dinky, Walt said.\" Fischinger, like Disney, was used to having full control over his work and not used to working in a group. Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience, Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair, before the segment was completed, in October 1939. Disney had plans to make the \"Toccata and Fugue\" an experimental three-dimensional film, with audiences being given cardboard stereoscopic frames with their souvenir programs, but this idea was abandoned.\n\"The Nutcracker Suite\".\nIn \"The Nutcracker Suite\", animator Art Babbitt is said to have credited The Three Stooges as a guide for animating the dancing mushrooms in the \"Chinese Dance\" routine. He drew with a music score pinned to his desk to work out the choreography so he could relate the action to the melody and the counterpoint, \"those nasty little notes underneath\u00a0... so something has to be related to that\". The studio filmed professional dancers Joyce Coles and Marjorie Belcher wearing ballet skirts that resembled shapes of blossoms that were to sit above water for \"Dance of the Flutes\". An Arabian dancer was also brought in to study the movements for the goldfish in \"Arab Dance\". Jules Engel also worked on the choreography and color-keying for this sequence. To avoid hard ink outlines, new techniques like transparent paint was used on the cels. The snowflakes used in the snowflake fairies sequence was difficult to draw by hand, so a man named Leonard Pickley, from the Special Effects Department, came up with the idea of using stop-motion animation. Diagrams of real snowflakes were traced by the Ink and Paint Department, who used a material a little heavier than regular cels, and painted them in translucent white. They were then cut out and placed on revolving spools attached to small steel rails. The mechanics was hidden under black velvet as the snowflakes were moved one frame at a time. The hand-drawn animation was added later.\n\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\".\nAnimation on \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" began on January 21, 1938, when James Algar, the director of the segment, assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream. Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe's 1797 poem \"Der Zauberlehrling\", and were encouraged to complete a twenty-question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place. Early on Disney considered using Dopey from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" as the apprentice, but he did not want to dilute the impact of his debut feature and chose Mickey Mouse (who was redesigned for the film). Stokowski suggested the cartoon could star \"an entirely new personality\" that represented \"in the mind and heart of everyone seeing the film their own personality, so that they would enter into all the drama and emotional changes of the film in a most intense manner\"; Disney rejected this also. In its original form the segment opened with an overture followed by live action shots of Stokowski conducting in silhouette, filming for which took place in January 1938 with cinematographer James Wong Howe.\nLayout artist Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as \"brilliantly colored thumbnails\" from preliminary storyboard sketches using gouache paints, which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short. Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils to his eyes for the first time to achieve greater ranges of expression. Most of the segment was shot in live action, including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio's sound stages with barrels in the way, which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water. English silent film actor Nigel De Brulier was hired to portray Yen Sid for the camera for the animators to use for reference. A sorcerer's robe and hat was bought from a costume rental shop and decorated with stars and crescent moons.\n\"The Rite of Spring\".\nAn early concept for \"The Rite of Spring\" was to extend the story to the age of mammals and the first humans and the discovery of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To gain a better understanding of the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History; English biologist Julian Huxley; paleontologist Barnum Brown; and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory; they also observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The viewpoint was kept low throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.\n\"The Pastoral Symphony\".\nAccording to Ward Kimball, the animators were \"extremely specific on touchy issues\". The female centaurs were originally drawn bare-breasted, but the Hays office enforcing the Motion Picture Production Code insisted that they discreetly hung garlands around the necks. The male centaurs were also toned down to appear less intimidating to the audience. Originally, the segment included a pair of black centaurs who tended to the others, but these were cut from the film in later releases due to their implications of racism. (see ).\n\"Dance of the Hours\".\n\"Dance of the Hours\" was directed by Norman Ferguson and Thornton Hee and was completed by eleven animators. Most of the story was outlined in a meeting in October 1938, including the creation of the main alligator character, Ben Ali Gator. Its story, direction, layout, and animation underwent several rewrites, yet Disney wanted to present animals performing a legitimate caricature ballet sequence with comedic \"slips\". The design of the elephants and alligators were based on those by German illustrator Heinrich Kley, while the hippos and ostriches were based on those by cartoonist T. S. Sullivant. To gain a better idea on the animals' movements, the crew visited Griffith Park Zoo in Los Angeles. Animator John Hench was assigned to work on the segment, but resisted as he knew little about ballet. Disney then gave Hench season tickets to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo with backstage access so he could learn more about it.\nThe studio filmed several people in live action to help with the animation of the characters. The lead ostrich, Madmoiselle Upanova, is based on Irina Baronova. Hyacinth Hippo, the prima ballerina, was inspired by dancers Marge Champion and Tatiana Riabouchinska and actress Hattie Noel who weighed over , the animators studying the \"least quiver of her flesh, noticing those parts of her anatomy that were subjected to the greatest stress and strain\". Riabouchinska's husband David Lichine was used for Ben Ali Gator's movements.\n\"Night on Bald Mountain\" and \"Ave Maria\".\n\"Night on Bald Mountain\" was directed by Wilfred Jackson. Its story closely follows the descriptions that Mussorgsky had written on his original score of the tone poem. Chernabog was animated by Vladimir \"Bill\" Tytla, his design inspired from a pencil sketch by Swiss artist Albert Hurter of a demon sitting atop a mountain unfolding its wings. Despite Hurter never producing animation for Disney, the studio temporarily hired him to produce pencil sketches for the animators to gain inspiration from. Chernabog and parts of the segment were developed further by Danish-born illustrator Kay Nielsen. Tytla conducted research on all the characters he had animated and being Ukrainian, was familiar with the folklore that the story detailed. Actor B\u00e9la Lugosi, best known for his role in \"Dracula\" (1931), was brought in to provide reference poses for Chernabog, but Tytla disliked the results. He then got Jackson to pose shirtless which gave him the images he needed. At one point in its development, the idea of using black cats to represent evil was considered, but Disney rejected it as he thought cats had always been used.\nThe film's program reads that \"Ave Maria\" provides \"an emotional relief to audiences tense from the shock\" of \"Night on Bald Mountain\". Disney did not want much animated movement, but wanted the segment to bring the background artwork to the forefront which became a showcase for the multiplane camera. An early story outline had the segment end with a Madonna presented on the screen with the clouds, but Disney decided against this as he did not want to suggest overly religious imagery. There were ideas of releasing scents throughout the theater during \"Fantasia\", including the smell of incense during \"Ave Maria\".\nThe final shot, beginning with a black foreground and a shining white light in the background, measured of film; according to Disney historian John Culhane, this was likely the longest continuous scene in animation history to date. Ed Gershman, who worked on the segment, described how the animation of the procession figures was so closely drawn, \"a difference in the width of a pencil line was more than enough to cause jitters, not only to the animation, but to everyone connected with the sequence.\" The jittering created on the first shoot led Disney to order a time-consuming and expensive redo. The studio had no camera that moved slowly and continuously enough to film the segment as Disney wanted, so a custom horizontal camera crane was built that accommodated glass panes wide, with the artwork painted on them, so they could be shifted out of the way as the camera tracked through. Workers shot continuously for six days and nights, but following processing they discovered the camera was fitted with the wrong type of lens and had photographed the track, stands, and themselves. Three days into the third reshoot, a minor earthquake rocked the wooden stands and panels that kept the glass panes in place. Rather than carry on with the risk of jittered footage, they started over for a fourth time and completed one day before the film's premiere. The finished film was rushed to New York on a charter plane and spliced into place with four hours to spare.\nLive-action.\nThe live action scenes were the first to be filmed inside Stage 1, a 11,000 sq ft production sound stage built at Disney's Burbank studios in 1940. It was subsequently dedicated to the film. The on-screen musicians were not the Philadelphia Orchestra but in fact local players, with Disney sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald on timpani and composer Paul Smith on violin. Taylor's introductions were filmed in August 1940, with Howe returning as cinematographer. Howe adds visual energy with brief flashes of colour projected onto some instruments as the musicians tune up, and changes the hues of the side lighting for each introduction for variety. The jam session during the intermission includes a theme from \"The Pastoral Symphony\" and \"Bach Goes to Town\", a jazz tune popularised by Benny Goodman. David Butler points out the significance of the brief interlude, demonstrating to the audience that \"these musicians aren't serious all the time\" and that jazz is seen as an \"antidote to serious music.\"\nIn 1940, Ub Iwerks was re-hired at the Disney studios as a technical supervisor for special visual effects. Among his first assignments was the handshake scene with Mickey Mouse and Stokowski. The scene was produced by filming Stokowski shaking hands in thin air, after which the animators placed drawing paper on top of the photographic print and matched Mickey's actions with his. The animation was photographed with the Stokowski film inside the camera to create a single negative that combined both sequences.\nSoundtrack.\nRecording.\nDisney wanted to experiment in more sophisticated sound recording and reproduction techniques for \"Fantasia\". He said: \"Music emerging from one speaker behind the screen sounds thin, tinkly and strainy. We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces\u00a0... so that audiences would feel as though they were standing at the podium with Stokowski\". \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" was recorded in a three-hour session that began at midnight at the Culver Studios on January 9, 1938. The venue was chosen as the sound stage at the Disney studio at Hyperion Avenue was too small. Stokowski picked the 85 musicians himself, and felt they would be more alert by working at such a late hour. The session involved a single rehearsal. Engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation that involved recording with multiple audio channels to allow any desired dynamic balance to be achieved upon playback. The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi-circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections and acted as a baffle wall to increase reverberation. Chief Disney sound engineer William Garity was \"very disappointed\" with the overall results and was unable to have a full complete rehearsal and record the orchestra in separate sections as scheduled, but Stokowski insisted the recording was satisfactory.\nOn January 18, 1939, Stokowski signed an eighteen-month contract with Disney to conduct the remaining pieces with the Philadelphia Orchestra. The main recording sessions took place on April 6, 8, and 12, each three hours in length, at the Academy of Music, the orchestra's home which was chosen for its favourable acoustics. The 90-piece orchestra included some students at the Curtis Institute of Music, and each musician was paid a flat fee of $10 per hour with principal players receiving as much as $400. \"Ave Maria\" features Westminster Choir College under the supervision of Charles E. Henderson, and college affiliate Julietta Novis as the soprano solo. Disney commissioned American author Rachel Field to produce a set of original lyrics in English specifically for \"Fantasia\", of which just one verse is sung in the film. The two sound effects heard in the film are used in \"Dance of the Hours\"\u2014a thump when an ostrich ballerina falls to the ground and the crash of the palace doors at the very end. Disney paid almost $18,000 towards the musician's wages, stage personnel, a music librarian, and the orchestra's manager.\nDisney and RCA decided to abandon the multi-channel setup used on \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and devised a more sophisticated one for the Academy sessions. Thirty-three microphones were placed around the orchestra that captured the music onto eight optical sound recording machines placed in the hall's basement, where engineers followed the music in real time and muted microphones when their assigned section was not playing. Each one represented an audio channel that focused on a different section of instruments: cellos and basses, violins, brass, violas, and woodwinds and tympani. The seventh channel was a combination of the first six while the eighth provided an overall sound of the orchestra at a distance. A ninth channel provided a click track function for the animators to time their drawings to the music. The film stock had to be stored in a truck parked outside the Academy as the highly flammable material posed a fire risk for the wooden basement. When the finished recordings arrived at the studio, a meeting was held on July 14, 1939, to allow the artists working on each segment to listen to Stokowski's arrangements, and suggest alterations in the sound to work more effectively with their designs. Some solo parts were subsequently re-recorded in California, but still under Stokowski's direction. In the 42 days it took to record, edit, and produce the final mix of film was used in the process.\nFantasound.\nThe Disney brothers contacted David Sarnoff of RCA regarding the manufacture of a new system that would \"create the illusion that the actual symphony orchestra is playing in the theater.\" Sarnoff backed out at first for financial reasons, but agreed in July 1939 to make the equipment so long as the Disneys could hold down the estimated $200,000 in costs (equivalent to about $million in 2024). Though it was not exactly known how to achieve their goal, engineers at Disney and RCA investigated many ideas and tests made with various equipment setups. The collaboration led to the development of Fantasound, a pioneering stereophonic surround sound system which innovated some processes widely used today, including simultaneous multitrack recording, overdubbing, and noise reduction.\nFantasound, developed in part by Garity, employed two projectors running at the same time. With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes, the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the nine tracks recorded at the Academy to four: three of which contained the audio for the left, center, and right stage speakers respectively, while the fourth became a control track with amplitude and frequency tones that drove variable-gain amplifiers to control the volume of the three audio tracks. In addition were three \"house\" speakers placed on the left, right, and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and right stage channels which acted as surround channels. As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase signal-to-noise ratio, the control track was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they should be. For this, a tone-operated gain-adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers.\nThe illusion of sound traveling across the speakers was achieved with a device named the \"pan pot\", which directed the predetermined movement of each audio channel with the control track. Mixing of the soundtrack required six people to operate the various pan pots in real time, while Stokowski directed each level and pan change which was marked on his musical score. To monitor recording levels, Disney used oscilloscopes with color differentiation to minimize eye fatigue. To test recording equipment and speaker systems, Disney ordered eight electronic oscillators from the newly established Hewlett-Packard company. Between the individual takes, prints, and remakes, approximately three million feet of sound film was used in the production of \"Fantasia\". Almost a fifth of the film's budget was spent on its recording techniques.\nRelease history.\nTheatrical runs.\n1940\u20131941 roadshows with Fantasound.\nRKO balked at the idea of distributing \"Fantasia\", which it described as a \"longhair musical\", and believed its duration of two hours and five minutes plus intermission was too long for a general release. It relaxed its exclusive distribution contract with Disney, who wanted a more prestigious exhibit in the form of a limited-run roadshow attraction. A total of thirteen roadshows were held across the United States; each involving two daily screenings with seat reservations booked in advance at higher prices and a fifteen-minute intermission. Disney hired film salesman Irving Ludwig to manage the first eleven engagements, and he was given specific instructions regarding each aspect of the film's presentation, including the setup of outside theater marquees and curtain and lighting cues. Patrons were taken to their seats by staff hired and trained by Disney, and were given a program booklet illustrated by Gyo Fujikawa.\nThe first roadshow opened at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940, the same theater where \"Steamboat Willie\" appeared 12 years earlier. The Disneys had secured a year's lease with the venue that was fully equipped with Fantasound, which took personnel a week working around the clock to install. Proceeds made on the night went to the British War Relief Society following the Battle of Britain. Ticket demand was so great that eight telephone operators were employed to handle the extra calls while the adjoining store was rented out to cater the box office bookings. \"Fantasia\" ran at the Broadway for forty-nine consecutive weeks, the longest run achieved by a film at the time. Its run continued for a total of fifty-seven weeks until February 28, 1942.\nThe remaining twelve roadshows were held throughout 1941, which included a 39-week run at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles from January 29. \"Fantasia\" broke the long-run record at the venue in its twenty-eighth week; a record previously held by \"Gone with the Wind\". Its eight-week run at the Fulton Theatre in Pittsburgh attracted over 50,000 people with reservations being made from cities located one hundred miles from the venue. Engagements were also held at the Geary Theatre in San Francisco for eight months, the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland for nine weeks, the Majestic Theatre in Boston, the Apollo Theater in Chicago, and also in Philadelphia, Detroit, Buffalo, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.\n\"Fantasia\" grossed over $300,000 in the first sixteen weeks in New York; over $20,000 in the opening five weeks in San Francisco; and almost the same amount in the first ten weeks both in Los Angeles and Boston. The first eleven roadshows earned a total of $1.3\u00a0million by April 1941, but the $85,000 in production and installation costs of a single Fantasound setup, along with theatres having to be leased, forced Disney to exceed their loan limits. The onset of the Second World War prevented plans for a potential release in Europe, normally the source of as much as forty-five per cent of the studio's income. Up to eighty-eight engagements were outlined across five years, but wartime demands for material limited the number of Fantasound prints to sixteen. All but one of the Fantasound setups were dismantled and given to the war effort. Upon acquiring the film's distribution rights in April 1941, RKO initially continued the roadshow booking policy but presented the film in mono, which was easier to exhibit. The combined average receipts from each roadshow was around $325,000, which placed \"Fantasia\" at an even greater loss than \"Pinocchio\".\n1942\u20131963 runs.\nDisney allowed RKO to handle the general release of \"Fantasia\", but fought their decision to have the film cut. He gave in as the studio needed as much income as possible to remedy its finances, but refused to cut it himself, \"You can get anybody you want to edit it\u00a0... I can't do it.\" With no input from Disney, musical director Ed Plumb and Ben Sharpsteen reduced \"Fantasia\" to one hour and forty minutes at first, then to one hour and twenty minutes by removing most of Taylor's commentary and the \"Toccata and Fugue\". \"Fantasia\" was re-released in January 1942 at more popular prices with a mono soundtrack, and was placed on the lower half of double bills with the Western film \"Valley of the Sun\".\nRKO reissued \"Fantasia\" once more on September 1, 1946, with the animated sequences complete and the scenes of Taylor, Stokowski, and the orchestra restored but shortened. Its running time was restored to one hour and fifty-five minutes. This edit would be the standard form for subsequent re-releases, and was the basis for the 1990 restoration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI wanted a special show just like Cinerama plays today\u00a0... I had \"Fantasia\" set for a wide screen. I had dimensional sound\u00a0... To get that wide screen I had the projector running sideways\u00a0... I had the double frame. But I didn't get to building my cameras or my projectors because the money problem came in\u00a0... The compromise was that it finally went out standard with dimensional sound. I think if I'd had the money and I could have gone ahead I'd have a really sensational show at that time.\n\u2014Walt Disney on the widescreen release in 1956.\nBy 1955, the original sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound system at the studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across noise-free telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when \"Fantasia\" was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without a break in the film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.\nOn February 20, 1963, \"Fantasia\" was re-released in both standard and SuperScope versions with stereo sound, though existing records are unclear. Its running time was 56 seconds longer than the previous issue which is unexplained. This was the final release that occurred before Disney's (and Taylor's) death in 1966.\n1969\u20131990 runs.\n\"Fantasia\" began to make a profit from its $2.28\u00a0million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was promoted with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people \"thought we were on a trip when we made it\u00a0... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what we were on.\" The release is also noted for the removal of four scenes from \"The Pastoral Symphony\" over racial stereotyping. \"Fantasia\" was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.\nThe film was reissued nationwide once more on April 15, 1977 (the same year as Stokowski's death), this time with simulated stereo sound. This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of Buena Vista Distribution, since RKO had not been part of a release since 1946. It had not been removed earlier as the credit sequence would have required to be re-shot. A two-and-a-half-minute reduction in the film's running time in this version remains unclear in existing records.\nIn 1980, the studio shipped a damaged segment of \"The Nutcracker Suite\" to various film restoration companies; each advised that the sound recording could not be upgraded to a quality suitable for theatre screenings. In late 1981, Disney executives decided to replace the Stokowski soundtrack with a new, digital recording in Dolby Stereo with conductor Irwin Kostal; president and CEO Ron W. Miller said that the original had degraded and \"no longer matched the extraordinary visuals.\" Kostal directed a hand-picked 121-piece orchestra and 50-voice choir for the recording that took place across 18, three-hour sessions in January 1982 at CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles, costing almost $1.4\u00a0million to produce. Five musicians who took part in the 1940 recording performed on the new one. Kostal had the difficult task of pacing his conducting to match Stokowski's, but chose Mussorgsky's orchestration of \"Night on Bald Mountain\" instead of the arrangement Stokowski had used which was based on Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov's version. The new recording also corrected a two-frame lag in projection caused by the recording techniques used at the time the film was made. The Kostal soundtrack was prepared for the film's reissue from April 2, 1982, which had Taylor's scenes replaced with briefer voiceover narration from Hugh Douglas as the studio felt audiences by now had become \"more sophisticated and knowledgeable about music.\" Mickey Mouse and Stokowski's voices in the handshake scene were also redubbed, the former by Wayne Allwine, who would do so again in \"Fantasia 2000\"'s version of the same scene.\nThe 1982 version was reissued from February 1985, which kicked off with a run at the Plitt Century Plaza Theatre in Los Angeles that was fitted with the HPS-4000 digital speaker system. This allowed the digital stereo recording of the Kostal soundtrack to be presented for the first time, and made \"Fantasia\" the first theatrical feature film presented in digital stereo sound. The standard recording was used for the film's wide release to around 400 theaters. This time, actor Tim Matheson provided the narration.\nFor its fiftieth anniversary reissue, \"Fantasia\" underwent a two-year restoration process that began with a six-month search to locate the original negatives, which had been in storage since 1946, and piece them together. This was the first time since then that a print of the film had been prepared using the original negative and not a copy. A new print was formed that was identical to the 1946 version with Taylor's introductions restored but with a new end credits sequence added. As the original opening shots of \"Rite of Spring\" could not be found, footage from the Disney educational film \"A World is Born\", which used footage from the segment, was used instead. This was also the case for a sequence in \"The Pastoral Symphony\", so a duplicate was used. Each of the 535,680 frames were restored by hand with an untouched print from 1951 used for guidance on the correct colors and tone. Theaters that agreed to screen the film were required to install specific stereo sound equipment and present it in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The 1990 reissue also had the Stokowski soundtrack restored, which underwent digital remastering by Terry Porter who worked with the 1955 magnetic soundtrack. He estimated 3,000 pops and hisses were removed from the recording. Released on October 5, 1990, the reissue grossed $25\u00a0million domestically.\nHome media.\nAudio.\nDisney considered releasing the film's soundtrack around the time of the film's roadshow release, but this idea was not realized. The soundtrack was first released as a mono three LP set in sixteen countries by Disneyland and Buena Vista Records in 1957, containing the musical pieces without the narration. A stereo edition LP was issued by Buena Vista Records in 1961. Disney was required to obtain permission from Stokowski, who initially rejected its sale unless the Philadelphia Orchestra Association received a share of the royalties.\nThe Kostal recording was released on two CDs, two LPs and two audio cassettes by Buena Vista Records, in 1982.\nIn September 1990, the remastered Stokowski soundtrack was released on CD and audio cassette by Buena Vista Records., and was later re-released in 2006. In the United States, it debuted the \"Billboard\" 200 chart at number 190, its peak position, for the week of November 17, 1990. Two months after its release, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for 500,000 copies sold in the United States. In January 1993, it was certified platinum for sales in excess of one million copies.\nFor the film's 75th anniversary in 2015, the Stokowski and Kostal recordings were released by Walt Disney Records on a four-disc album as of \"\". The set includes Stokowski's recording of the deleted \"Clair de Lune\" segment, and a recording of \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and \"Peter and the Wolf\" (from \"Make Mine Music\") with added narration by Sterling Holloway; he himself narrated the latter originally.\nVideo.\n\"Fantasia\" has received four home video releases. The first, featuring the 1990 restored theatrical version, was released on VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc on November 1, 1991, as part of the Walt Disney Classics line. The original soundtrack returned when Fantasound was also recreated in Dolby Stereo for the film's 1990 theatrical release. The result, named \"Fantasound 90,\" was used as a basis of the audio for these releases. The release was limited to just 50 days, prompting 9.25\u00a0million advance orders for cassettes and a record 200,000 for discs, doubling the figure of the previous record. The \"Deluxe Edition\" package included the film, a \"making of\" feature, a commemorative lithograph, a 16-page booklet, a two-disc soundtrack of the Stokowski score, and a certificate of authenticity signed by Roy E. Disney, the nephew of Walt. In 1992, \"Fantasia\" became the biggest-selling sell-through cassette of all time in the US with 14.2\u00a0million copies being purchased. The record was surpassed later that year by \"Beauty and the Beast\". It was also the UK's top selling video at the time, with sales of 3 million. By October 1994, 21.7 million copies of the video had been sold worldwide.\nIn November 2000, \"Fantasia\" was released on video for the second time, this time along with \"Fantasia 2000\", on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. The films were issued both separately and in a three-disc set called \"The Fantasia Anthology\". A variety of bonus features were included in the bonus disc, \"The Fantasia Legacy\". This edition attempted to follow as closely as possible the runtime and format of the original roadshow version, and included additional restored live action footage of Taylor and the orchestra, including the bookends to the film's intermission. In addition to these changes, this DVD release would be THX certified. Since the 2000 release, Taylor's voice was re-recorded throughout by Corey Burton because most of the audio tracks to Taylor's restored scenes had deteriorated to the point that they could no longer be used. Oddly, the UK DVD still uses the 1990 theatrical version for its video content, albeit with the new audio restoration from the US version.\nBoth films were reissued again by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in November 2010 separately, as a two-disc DVD/Blu-ray set and a combined DVD and Blu-ray four-disc set (named the \"Fantasia 2 Movie Collection\") that featured 1080p high-definition video and 7.1 surround sound. The 2010 version of \"Fantasia\" featured a new restoration by Reliance MediaWorks and a new sound restoration, but was editorially identical to the 2000 version. This also marked the first time in Europe, where it was originally denied a release due to the war, that the roadshow version was released. \"Fantasia\" was withdrawn from release and returned to the \"Disney Vault\" moratorium on April 30, 2011.\nIn 2021, both films, along with the 2018 compilation \"Celebrating Mickey\", a collection of 13 Mickey Mouse shorts, were reissued on DVD, Blu-ray, and digitally as part of the U.S. Disney Movie Club exclusive \"The Best of Mickey Collection\". They were also released for the first time on multiple U.S. purchased streaming platforms, including Movies Anywhere and its retailers.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nEarly reviews.\n\"Fantasia\" garnered significant critical acclaim at the time of release and was seen by some critics as a masterpiece. The West Coast premiere at the Carthay Circle Theatre was a grand affair, attracting some 5000 people, including Shirley Temple, Cecil B. DeMille, Forrest Tucker, James Cagney, Robert Montgomery, James Murphy, Edgar Bergen, and many other notables in the film industry. Among those at the film's premiere was film critic Edwin Schallert of the \"Los Angeles Times\" who considered the film to be a magnificent achievement in film which would go down in cinematic history as a landmark film, noting the rapturous applause the film received by the audience during the various interludes. He stated that \"Fantasia\" was \"caviar to the general, ambrosia and nectar for the intelligentsia\" and considered the film to be \"courageous beyond belief\". Isabel Morse Jones, the newspaper's music critic, had high praise for the soundtrack to the film, describing it as a \"dream of a symphony concert\", and an \"enormously varied concert of pictorial ideas, of abstract music by acknowledged composers, of performers Leopold Stokowski and orchestra players of Hollywood and Philadelphia, and, for the vast majority, new and wonderful sound effects\". Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\", also at the premiere, noted that \"motion-picture history was made last night\u00a0... \"Fantasia\" dumps conventional formulas overboard and reveals the scope of films for imaginative excursion\u00a0... \"Fantasia\"\u00a0... is simply terrific.\" Peyton Boswell, an editor at \"Art Digest\", called it \"an aesthetic experience never to be forgotten\".\n\"Time\" magazine described the premiere as \"stranger and more wonderful than any of Hollywood's\" and the experience of Fantasound \"as if the hearer were in the midst of the music. As the music sweeps to a climax, it froths over the proscenium arch, boils into the rear of the theatre, all but prances up and down the aisles.\" \"Dance Magazine\" devoted its lead story to the film, saying that \"the most extraordinary thing about \"Fantasia\" is, to a dancer or balletomane, not the miraculous musical recording, the range of color, or the fountainous integrity of the Disney collaborators, but quite simply the perfection of its dancing\". \"Variety\" also hailed \"Fantasia\", calling it \"a successful experiment to lift the relationship from the plane of popular, mass entertainment to the higher strata of appeal to lovers of classical music\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" assigned three writers to cover the film's Chicago premiere: society columnist Harriet Pribble; film critic Mae Tinee; and music critic Edward Barry. Pribble left amazed at the \"brilliantly-attired audience\", while Tinee felt the film was \"beautiful\u00a0... but it is also bewildering. It is stupendous. It is colossal. It is an overwhelmingly ambitious orgy of color, sound, and imagination.\" Barry was pleased with the \"program of good music well performed\u00a0... and beautifully recorded\" and felt \"pleasantly distracted\" from the music to what was shown on the screen. In a breakdown of reviews from both film and music critics, Disney author Paul Anderson found 33% to be \"very positive\", 22% both \"positive\" and \"positive and negative\", and 11% negative.\nThose who adopted a more negative view at the time of the film's release came mostly from the classical music community. Many found fault with Stokowski's rearrangements and abridgements of the music. Igor Stravinsky, the only living composer whose music was featured in the film, expressed displeasure at how in Stokowski's arrangement of \"The Rite of Spring\", \"the order of the pieces had been shuffled, and the most difficult of them eliminated\", and criticized the orchestra's performance, observing that the simplification of the score \"did not save the musical performance, which was execrable\". Other composers and music critics leveled criticism at the premise of the film itself, arguing that presenting classical music with visual images would rob the musical pieces of their integrity. Composer and music critic Virgil Thomson praised Fantasound which he thought offered \"good transmission of music\", but disliked the \"musical taste\" of Stokowski, with exception to \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and \"The Rite of Spring\". Olin Downes of \"The New York Times\" too hailed the quality of sound that Fantasound presented, but said, \"much of \"Fantasia\" distracted from or directly injured the scores\". Film critic Pauline Kael dismissed parts of \"Fantasia\" as \"grotesquely kitschy\". Some parents resisted paying the higher roadshow prices for their children, and several complained that the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" segment had frightened them. There were also a few negative reactions that were more political in nature, especially since the film's release happened at a time when Nazi Germany reigned supreme in Europe. One review of the film in this manner, written by Dorothy Thompson for \"The New York Herald Tribune\" on November 25, 1940, was especially harsh. Thompson claimed that she \"left the theater in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown\", because the film was a \"remarkable nightmare\". Thompson went on to compare the film to rampant Nazism, which she described as \"the abuse of power\" and \"the perverted betrayal of the best instincts\". Thompson also claimed that the film depicted nature as being \"titanic\" while man was only \"a moving lichen on the stone of time\". She concluded that the film was \"cruel\", \"brutal and brutalizing\", and a negative \"caricature of the Decline of the West\". In fact, Thompson claimed that she was so distraught by the film that she even walked out of it before she saw the two last segments, \"Night on Bald Mountain\" and \"Ave Maria\", because she did not want to be subject to any more of the film's \"brutalization\".\nLater reviews.\n Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 96 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating . \"TV Guide\" awarded the film four stars, calling it \"the most ambitious animated feature ever to come out of the Disney studios\", noting how the film \"integrates famous works of classical music with wildly uneven but extraordinarily imaginative visuals that run the gamut from dancing hippos to the purely abstract\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" rated the film four stars out of four, and noted that throughout \"Fantasia\", \"Disney pushes the edges of the envelope\". However, \"Empire\" magazine only rated it 2 stars out of 5 (poor), concluding \"this is a very patchy affair \u2013 while some of the animated pieces work, others come across as downright insane\". Remarks have also been made about \"Fantasia\" not being a children's film. Religion writer Mark I. Pinsky considers \"Fantasia\" to be one of the more problematic of Disney's animated features in that it was intended as much as for adults as children and not what people had come to expect.\nAwards and honors.\n\"Fantasia\" was ranked fifth at the 1940 National Board of Review Awards in the category. Disney and Stokowski won a Special Award for the film at the 1940 New York Film Critics Circle Awards. \"Fantasia\" was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26, 1942\u2014one for Disney, William Garity, John N. A. Hawkins, and the RCA Manufacturing Company for their \"outstanding contribution to the advancement of the use of sound in motion pictures through the production of \"Fantasia\"\", and the other to Stokowski \"and his associates for their unique achievement in the creation of a new form of visualized music in Walt Disney's production \"Fantasia\", thereby widening the scope of the motion picture as entertainment and as an art form\".\nIn 1990, \"Fantasia\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". On the 100th anniversary of cinema in 1995, the Vatican included \"Fantasia\" in its list of 45 \"great films\" made under the Art category (the other categories being Religion and Values). \"Fantasia\" is featured in three lists that rank the greatest American films as determined by the American Film Institute. The film ranked number 58 in 100 Years... 100 Movies in 1998, before it was dropped from its ranking in the 10th Anniversary revision in 2007, though it was nominated for inclusion. The 10 Top 10 list formed in 2008 placed \"Fantasia\" fifth under Animation.\nControversies.\nIn April 1939, Philadelphia advertising agent Mark S. Tutelman filed an injunction suit in an attempt to prevent the film being made. Tutelman claimed the film originated from an idea of synchronizing animation with classical music which he first described to Stokowski in 1937, had prepared scenarios and orchestral arrangements at Stokowski's request without acknowledgement or credit, and demanded a cut of the film's proceeds. In April 1940, Tutelman's case was dismissed. In 1942, Tutelman filed a $25,000 damage suit against Stokowski, charging the conductor of a misappropriation of ideas without credit. In April 1942, the Irish Film Censor insisted the film cut Taylor's scientific introduction to \"The Rite of Spring\" due to its \"materialistic portrayal of the origins of life\".\nIn the 1960s, four shots from \"The Pastoral Symphony\" were removed that depicted two characters in a racially stereotyped manner. A black centaurette called Sunflower was depicted polishing the hooves of a white centaurette, and a second named Otika appeared briefly during the procession scenes with Bacchus and his followers. The characters were initially removed for a 1963 re-run of the \"Disneyland\" episode \"Magic and Music\", which originally aired uncut in 1958. Disney himself approved of the changes. The episode aired uncut on television once again in 1966, before the edits were incorporated into the film's 1969 theatrical reissue and has remained on all releases since. John Carnochan, the editor of the 1991 video release, said: \"It's sort of appalling to me that these stereotypes were ever put in\". Film critic Roger Ebert commented on the edit: \"While the original film should, of course, be preserved for historical purposes, there is no need for the general release version to perpetrate racist stereotypes in a film designed primarily for children.\" Several fan restoration projects online re-insert the cut scenes back. \nIn May 1992, the Philadelphia Orchestra Association filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company and Buena Vista Home Video. The orchestra maintained that as a co-creator of \"Fantasia\", the group was entitled to half of the estimated $120\u00a0million in profits from video and laser disc sales. The orchestra dropped its case in 1994 when the two parties reached an undisclosed settlement out of court. British music publisher Boosey &amp; Hawkes filed a further lawsuit in 1993, contending that Disney did not have the rights to distribute \"The Rite of Spring\" in the 1991 video releases because the permission granted to Disney by Stravinsky in 1940 was only in the context of a film to be shown in theaters. A federal district court backed Boosey &amp; Hawkes's case in 1996, but the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling in 1998, stating that Disney's original \"license for motion picture rights extends to video format distribution\".\nAdditional material.\nDisney had wanted \"Fantasia\" to be an ongoing project, with a new edition being released every few years. His plan was to replace one of the original segments with a new one as it was completed, so audiences would always see a new version of the film. From January to August 1941, story material was developed based on additional musical works, including \"Ride of the Valkyries\" by Richard Wagner, \"The Swan of Tuonela\" by Jean Sibelius, \"Invitation to the Dance\" by Carl Maria von Weber, the Polka and Fugue from \"Schwanda the Bagpiper\" by Jarom\u00edr Weinberger, a \"baby ballet\" set to \"Berceuse\" by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and a \"bug ballet\" set to \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which was later adapted into the \"Bumble Boogie\" segment in \"Melody Time\" (1948). The film's disappointing initial box office performance and the USA's entry into World War II brought an end to these plans. Deems Taylor prepared introductions for \"The Firebird\" by Stravinsky, \"La Mer\" by Claude Debussy, \"Adventures in a Perambulator\" by John Alden Carpenter, \"Don Quixote\" by Richard Strauss, and \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" by Mussorgsky \"to have them for the future in case we decided to make any one of them\".\nAnother segment, Debussy's \"Clair de lune\", was developed as part of the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two great blue herons flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night, with more focus towards the segment's background art than story and animation. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the \"Blue Bayou\" segment in \"Make Mine Music\" (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and \"Clair de Lune\" was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in \"The Fantasia Anthology\" DVD in 2000.\n\"Destino\", a collaboration between Walt Disney and surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, was also considered for inclusion as a future \"Fantasia\" segment, but was shelved until it was re-discovered during production of \"Fantasia 2000\". In her host sequence for \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" in that film, Bette Midler mentions several cancelled sequences, specifically \"Ride of the Valkyries\", \"Destino\", \"Flight of the Bumblebee\", \"Berceuse\" and the Polka and Fugue.\nLegacy.\n\"Fantasia\" will enter the American public domain on January 1, 2036.\nSequel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Fantasia\" is timeless. It may run 10, 20 or 30 years. It may run after I'm gone. \"Fantasia\" is an idea in itself. I can never build another \"Fantasia\". I can improve. I can elaborate. That's all.\n\u2014Walt Disney\nIn 1980, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Wolfgang Reitherman and Mel Shaw had begun work on \"Musicana\", \"an ambitious concept mixing jazz, classical music, myths, modern art and more, following the old \"Fantasia\" format\". Animation historian Charles Solomon wrote that development took place between 1982 and 1983, which combined \"ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries\". Proposed segments for the film included a battle between an ice god and a sun goddess set to \"Finlandia\" by Sibelius, one set in the Andes to the songs of Yma Sumac, another featuring caricatures of Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald and an adaptation of The Emperor's Nightingale which would have featured Mickey as the nightingale's owner, similar to his role in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". The project was shelved in favor of \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\", though the artwork made for The Emperor's Nightingale would later be used for a book adaptation by Teddy Slater in 1992.\nRoy E. Disney, the nephew of Walt, co-produced \"Fantasia 2000\" which entered production in 1990 and features seven new segments performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with conductor James Levine. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" is the only segment retained from the original film. \"Fantasia 2000\" premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 17, 1999, as part of a five-city live concert tour, followed by a four-month engagement in IMAX cinemas and a wide release in regular theatres, in 2000.\nEarly development for a third film began in 2002, with a working title of \"Fantasia 2006\". The proposed segments included \"The Little Matchgirl\" by Roger Allers, \"One by One\" by Pixote Hunt, \"Lorenzo\" by Mike Gabriel, and \"Destino\" by Dominique Monf\u00e9ry. The project was shelved in 2004, with the proposed segments released as individual short films.\nParodies and spin-offs.\n\"Fantasia\" is parodied in \"A Corny Concerto\", a Warner Bros. cartoon from 1943 of the \"Merrie Melodies\" series directed by Bob Clampett. The short features Elmer Fudd in the role of Taylor, wearing his styled glasses, who introduces two segments set to pieces by Johann Strauss (\"Tales from the Vienna Woods\" and the \"Blue Danube Waltz\", the former featuring Porky and Bugs and the latter featuring Daffy). In 1976, Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto produced \"Allegro Non Troppo\", a feature-length parody of \"Fantasia\".\nThe animated television series \"The Simpsons\" references \"Fantasia\" in a few episodes. Matt Groening, the creator of the series, expressed a wish to make a parody film named \"Simpstasia\"; it was never produced, partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature-length script. In \"Treehouse of Horror IV\", director David Silverman had admired the animation in \"Night on Bald Mountain\", and made the first appearance of Devil Flanders resemble Chernabog. The episode \"Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land\" references \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" in a snippet titled \"Scratchtasia\", which features the music and several shots parodying it exactly.\nIn 2014, BBC Music created a music education scheme similar to \"Fantasia\" called \"Ten Pieces\", intended to introduce children to classical music. Spanning two films (in 2014 and 2015), several pieces featured in the \"Fantasia\" films are also included.\nThe 2018 film \"Teen Titans Go! To the Movies\" references \"Fantasia\" during the musical sequence \"My Superhero Movie\".\nTheme parks.\nFrom 2001 to 2015, the Sorcerer's Hat was the icon of Disney's Hollywood Studios, one of the four theme parks located at Walt Disney World Resort. The structure was of the magic hat from \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". Also located at the resort is Fantasia Gardens, a miniature golf course that integrates characters and objects from the film in each hole. The fireworks and water show \"Fantasmic!\" features scenes from \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and other \"Fantasia\" segments on water projection screens, and involves the plot of Mickey as the apprentice doing magic whilst also battling the Disney Villains.\nFor the 20th anniversary of Disneyland Paris, Mickey was depicted in a special version of his Sorcerer's Apprentice outfit with his friends wearing similar outfits. The \"Night on Bald Mountain\" segment is featured in the Storybook Land Canal Boats attraction at Disneyland Park in Paris along with the Fantasia Gelati ice cream shop in Fantasyland which is also inspired by the film.\nMickey's outfit, water buckets, and Yen Sid's spell book and chair are on display as props from \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" segment in the queue of the Mickey &amp; Minnie's Runaway Railway attraction at Disneyland.\nVideo games.\nIn 1983, Atari released a game called \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" for the Atari 2600, based on that segment of \"Fantasia\". The player, as Mickey Mouse, must collect falling stars and comets which will prevent the marching brooms from flooding Yen Sid's cavern.\nIn 1991, a side-scrolling \"Fantasia\" video game developed by Infogrames was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis system. The player controls Mickey Mouse, who must find missing musical notes scattered across four elemental worlds based upon the film's segments.\nThere are several film reel levels based on some of the film's segments such as \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and \"Night on Bald Mountain\" that appear in the \"Epic Mickey\" games. Yen Sid and Chernabog also make cameo appearances in the games (Yen Sid narrates the openings and endings of the two games and served as the creator of the Wasteland. Chernabog appears as a painting in the first game and appears in the Night on Bald Mountain film reel levels in the second).\nThe Disney/Square Enix crossover game series \"Kingdom Hearts\" features Chernabog as a boss in the first installment. The \"Night on Bald Mountain\" piece is played during the fight. Yen Sid appears frequently in the series beginning with \"Kingdom Hearts II\", voiced in English by Corey Burton. Symphony of Sorcery, a world based on the film, appears in \"\". Like the Timeless River world in \"Kingdom Hearts II\", it is featured as a period of Mickey Mouse's past.\n\"\", a music game, was developed by Harmonix in association with Disney Interactive for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles. The game utilizes the Kinect device to put players in control of music in a manner similar to Harmonix' previous rhythm games, affecting the virtual environment and interactive objects within it. The game features licensed contemporary rock music such as Queen and Bruno Mars.\nMickey, in his Sorcerer's Apprentice guise, appears as a playable character in \"Disney Infinity\".\nConcert.\nA live concert presentation of the film named \"Disney Fantasia: Live in Concert\", showcases various segments from both \"Fantasia\" and \"Fantasia 2000\". The concert version features a live symphony orchestra and piano soloist accompanying projected high definition video segments. The \"Fantasia\" concert was still touring throughout the world as late as 2022.\nTelevision.\nSeveral elements from the film appear in television series \"Once Upon a Time\". The hat from \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" appears in the fourth season episode \"A Tale of Two Sisters\". As the series progressed, the hat was shown to have the ability to absorb others, and those it absorbed would appear as a star on the hat. The Sorcerer's Apprentice himself makes an appearance, where he is an old man who guards the hat in the Enchanted Forest.\nChernabog from \"Night on Bald Mountain\" also makes an appearance in the episode \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\".\nCredits.\nMusical score conducted by Leopold Stokowski.

{"id": "73462", "revid": "13791031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73462", "title": "Amadeo I of Spain", "text": "King of Spain from 1870 to 1873\nAmadeo I (; 30 May 1845\u00a0\u2013 18 January 1890), also known as Amadeus, was an Italian prince who reigned as King of Spain from 1870 to 1873. The only king of Spain to come from the House of Savoy, he was the second son of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and was known for most of his life as the Duke of Aosta, the usual title for a second son in the Savoyard dynasty.\nHe was elected by the Cortes Generales as Spain's monarch in 1870, following the deposition of Isabel II, and was sworn in the following year. Amadeo's reign was fraught with growing republicanism, Carlist rebellions in the north, and the Cuban independence movement. After three tumultuous years on the throne, he abdicated and returned to Italy in 1873, and the First Spanish Republic was declared as a result.\nHe founded the Aosta branch of Italy's royal House of Savoy, which is junior in agnatic descent to the branch descended from King Umberto I that reigned in Italy until 1946, but senior to the branch of the dukes of Genoa.\nEarly life and first marriage.\nPrince Amadeo of Savoy was born in Turin, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. He was the third child and second son of King Victor Emmanuel II, who would later become the first King of a unified Italy, and of Archduchess Adelaide of Austria. He was granted the hereditary title of Duke of Aosta from birth.\nEntering the Royal Sardinian Army as captain in 1859, he fought through the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866 with the rank of major-general. He led his brigade into action at the Battle of Custoza and was wounded at Monte Croce. In 1868, after his marriage, he was made vice admiral of the Italian Royal Navy, but the position ended when he ascended the Spanish throne.\nIn 1867, his father yielded to the entreaties of the parliamentary deputy Francesco Cassins, and on 30 May of that year, Amedeo was married to Donna Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo. The King initially opposed the match on the grounds that her family was of insufficient rank and that he hoped for his son to marry a German princess. Despite her princely title, Donna Maria Vittoria was not of royal birth and belonged rather to the Piedmontese nobility. She was, however, the sole heir to her father's vast fortune, which subsequent Dukes of Aosta inherited, thereby obtaining wealth independent of their dynastic appanage and allowances from Italy's kings. The wedding day of Prince Amedeo and Donna Maria Vittoria was marred by the death of a station master, who was crushed under the wheels of the honeymoon train.\nIn March 1870, Maria Vittoria appealed to the King to remonstrate with her husband for marital infidelities, which caused her hurt and embarrassment. However, the King wrote in reply that he understood her feelings, but he considered that she had no right to dictate her husband's behaviour, and her jealousy was unbecoming.\nKing of Spain.\nAfter the Glorious Revolution deposed Isabella II in September 1868, the new \"Cortes\" began the task of searching for a suitable liberal-leaning candidate from a new dynasty to replace her. Eventually the Duke of Aosta was taken into consideration. His father was a descendant of King Philip II of Spain through his daughter Infanta Catalina Micaela of Spain and her son Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, while his mother was a descendant of King Charles III of Spain through his daughter Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. The Savoyard prince was elected king as Amadeo I on 16 November 1870 and swore to uphold the Constitution in Madrid on 2 January 1871. While the new king was on his way to Spain, General Juan Prim, his chief supporter, was assassinated and Amadeo took the oath in the presence of Prim's corpse.\nThis event deprived Amadeo I of indispensable support, particularly in the critical early days, and proved decisive considering that the progressive faction ultimately split between Prim's two successors, Pr\u00e1xedes Mateo Sagasta and Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla. The new king entered Madrid on 2 January 1871, and that same day he swore allegiance to the 1869 Constitution before the Cortes. Later, he visited the Church of the Virgin of Atocha, where General Prim's funeral chapel had been set up-\nFirst year.\nGovernment of General Serrano: The Failure of \"Conciliation\".\nFollowing Prim's assassination, a \"conciliation\" government formed at his deathbed request under Admiral Topete, soon transitioning to General Serrano, a Unionist who had served as regent from 1869 until Amadeo's arrival. Amadeo proposed Serrano as President of the Council of Ministers to unify the monarchist-democratic coalition backing his throne. Serrano assembled a diverse cabinet: Progressives Sagasta (Minister of the Interior) and Ruiz Zorrilla (Public Works), monarchist Democrat or \"Cimbrios\" Cristino Martos (Justice), and Unionist Adelardo L\u00f3pez de Ayala (Overseas Territories). This mix aimed to bridge factions supporting the new dynasty.\nSerrano's administration, viewed by some as transitional, prioritized the first elections under Amadeo to secure a strong coalition majority. It enacted an electoral law reverting to district-based voting, abandoning the Progressives' provincial constituencies from 1869. This shift enabled the government to exert \"moral influence\" in rural areas, ensuring a victory of 235 seats\u2014approximately 130 Progressives, over 80 \"borderline\" or \"Aostist\" Unionists loyal to Amadeo, and about 20 monarchist Democrats. However, opposition forces\u201452 Republicans advocating a federal republic, 51 Carlists pushing traditional monarchy, and 18 Moderates\u2014gained significant representation. Dissident Unionists under R\u00edos Rosas, backing the Duke of Montpensier, and Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo, supporting Prince Alfonso of Bourbon, secured 7 and 9 seats, respectively. This opposition's strength magnified the governing coalition's internal fragility.\nAs Serrano's government and the Cortes tackled the Constitution's democratic principles\u2014such as establishing juries, separation of church and state, abolishing Quintos (Spain) (military conscription), and addressing the war and slavery in Cuba\u2014tensions surfaced. Unionists and Sagasta's Progressives argued that crowning the Constitution with the Savoy dynasty required preserving order, while Ruiz Zorrilla's Progressives and Democrats insisted on immediate social, economic, and political reforms to consolidate the regime. Sagasta, likely echoing Prim's vision, sought conciliation with Serrano's Unionists as a dynastic right (conservative party), positioning himself as leader of the dynastic left (liberal party) and opposing Carlists and Republicans outright. Conversely, Ruiz Zorrilla championed an alliance with Democrats (cimbrios) through a reformist agenda, aiming to integrate Republicans into the monarchy by proving their goals were achievable within it. Sagasta saw this as handing the regime to its enemies, rejecting collaboration with Republicans and distrusting Ruiz Zorrilla's loyalty, thus fracturing the coalition and dooming \"conciliation.\"\nOpposition to the Monarchy of Amadeo I.\nThe high nobility and ecclesiastical hierarchy refused to recognize Amadeo's monarchy, viewing it as the embodiment of the 1868 Revolution that ended Isabella II's reign, where they held privilege. They feared it would dismantle their status or pave the way for Republicans and \"socialists\" opposing property and a confessional state. The nobility adopted a Casticism stance, claiming to defend \"Spanish values\" against the \"foreign king,\" boycotting the court and snubbing Amadeo, openly loyal to the Bourbons. A notable incident, the \"Rebellion of the Mantillas,\" described by Father Luis Coloma in Peque\u00f1eces..., saw aristocratic women parade in lace mantillas and fleur-de-lis\u2014symbols of Restoration\u2014isolating Amadeo and Queen Maria Vittoria in a \"court of furrile capes and shopkeepers,\" as critics sneered.\nThe Church opposed Amadeo as the son of Italy's Victor Emmanuel II, who had stripped Pope Pius IX of the Papal States, resisting religious freedom and measures toward church-state separation. Influenced by the Syllabus of Errors, the hierarchy wielded significant sway over Catholic middle classes and rural parishes, amplifying rejection of the regime. Amadeo countered by ennobling industrial and financial bourgeois supporters, but defections grew, especially among those tied to Cuban slavery\u2014threatened by radical abolition plans\u2014and Catalan industrialists opposing the 1869 free trade system, which Radicals upheld.\nThe Carlists, thriving since 1868 beyond their Basque, Catalan, and Valencian strongholds, backed Carlos VII, grandson of Carlos Mar\u00eda Isidro, seeking a traditional monarchy. Their neo-Catholic wing, led by C\u00e1ndido Nocedal, pursued a \"legal route,\" allying with Republicans in 1871 elections to win 51 deputies and 21 senators. Amadeo's election irked them, though Nocedal restrained uprisings until September 1871. Republicans, rejecting monarchy entirely, pushed for a Federal Republic, inspired by France's Second Empire fall. The Federal Republican Party united diverse factions\u2014property defenders, \"socialists,\" and federalists like Francisco Pi y Margall and Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n\u2014split between legalists open to Radical cooperation and insurrectionists favoring revolt.\nFirst Government of Ruiz Zorrilla: Division of the Progressives.\nOn 15 July 1871, radical ministers\u2014Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla, Cristino Martos, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ber\u00e1nger, and Moret\u2014resigned from Serrano's \"conciliation\" government, aiming to end its broad coalition and force a split between conservatives and radicals. King Amadeo I, still favoring unity, reluctantly appointed Ruiz Zorrilla as president on 24 July, sidelining both Unionists and Sagasta's Progressives in their plan to sustain the coalition amid regime threats. Ruiz Zorrilla sought to include Sagasta's faction, but Sagasta refused, arguing in Congress that an \"exclusive party\" policy endangered the monarchy.\nRuiz Zorrilla then formed a government of his Progressive faction and Democrats, taking the Interior portfolio himself. The cabinet included Eugenio Montero R\u00edos (Justice), General Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdova (War), Servando Ruiz G\u00f3mez (Finance), Santiago Diego-Madrazo (Public Works), Tom\u00e1s Mar\u00eda Mosquera (Overseas), and Vice-Admiral Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ber\u00e1nger (Navy). Martos declined the State Ministry. Presented to the Cortes on 25 July, the government's motto\u2014\"liberty, morality, civility\"\u2014signaled a reformist agenda.\nTensions escalated when Democrats maneuvered to replace Salustiano Ol\u00f3zaga as Congress president with their leader Nicol\u00e1s Mar\u00eda Rivero. Sagasta's Progressives countered by nominating Sagasta, fearing Rivero's republican leanings. On 1\u20132 October, Ruiz Zorrilla and Sagasta met to avert a Progressive split, but Ruiz Zorrilla rejected Sagasta's compromise candidate, prioritizing his radical-Democrat (Cimbrios) alliance over party unity. Sagasta warned, \"You stay with the cimbrios and break with your long-standing friends; the consequences will be dire.\" On 3 October, Sagasta defeated Rivero (123\u2013113) for Congress president, a result Ruiz Zorrilla saw as a no-confidence vote, prompting his resignation.\nAmadeo, returning from a popularity-boosting tour of eastern Spain\u2014including a visit to General Espartero in Logro\u00f1o, who pledged loyalty\u2014refused Ruiz Zorrilla's request to dissolve the Cortes, citing no constitutional basis or formal censure. Sagasta confirmed ongoing support for the 25 July program and urged the king to convince Ruiz Zorrilla to stay, highlighting the government's intact majority.\nMalcampo Government: The Failure of the Reunification of the Progressives.\nWith Ruiz Zorrilla unyielding, Amadeo offered the premiership to Espartero, who declined due to age, then to Sagasta, who suggested Jos\u00e9 Malcampo\u2014a revolutionary naval officer from 1868\u2014to avoid direct confrontation. Malcampo, appointed 5 October, was a Progressive seen as non-reactionary due to his role alongside Topete in the Glorious Revolution. His government, a bridge to Sagasta's eventual leadership on 21 December, oversaw the Progressive Party's irreparable split into Sagasta's conservative faction, aligned with the Liberal Union, and Ruiz Zorrilla's \"democratic progressive\" or Radical Party, including Democrats (cimbrios) like Martos and Rivero.\nSagasta's faction pursued reunification on their \"historical\" program, prioritizing national sovereignty over individual rights, which the Cortes could regulate for order. Ruiz Zorrilla's group upheld the sanctity of rights, leaving excesses to courts. Malcampo's all-Progressive cabinet\u2014excluding Unionists\u2014retained Ruiz Zorrilla's 25 July program, signaling a transitional intent. However, \"Zorrillists\" declared Ruiz Zorrilla their \"active head\" (Espartero as \"passive head\"), betting on reforms to align the monarchy with the people and win Republican support. Sagasta's Progressives responded by forming their own party board on 20 October, formalizing the divide. Reconciliation efforts by figures like \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez de los R\u00edos failed, with elders like Ol\u00f3zaga and Espartero favoring Sagasta.\nDebate on Illegalizing the Spanish IWA.\nMalcampo sought to prove the monarchy's firmness by proposing to outlaw the Spanish IWA, founded in 1870, amid fears sparked by the Paris Commune (March\u2013May 1871). Unionists, Sagasta's Progressives, and Carlists backed the ban, viewing the IWA as a threat, while Republicans opposed it, defending freedom of association. Ruiz Zorrilla's faction, torn between supporting rights and avoiding a \"disorder\" label, abstained, missing a chance for unity. On 10 November, the Cortes voted 192\u201338 to ban the IWA, but the Supreme Court's prosecutor blocked enforcement, citing constitutional protections, allowing the IWA to persist.\nVote of No Confidence and Municipal Elections.\nOn 13 November, Radicals moved a no-confidence vote against Malcampo, dubbed a \"pirate ministry\" for alleged corruption, aiming to preempt elections. Carlists joined with a religious motion, but on 17 November, Malcampo's 127 supporters (Sagasta's Progressives and Unionists) lost to 166 opposition votes (Radicals, Republicans, Carlists). Amadeo suspended the Cortes, avoiding resignation, citing the radical-anti-dynastic alliance as a scandal. In the 9 December municipal elections, Radicals allied with Republicans, claiming 400 of 600 key municipalities against Malcampo's 200, though the government won 25 of 47 provincial capitals. High abstention (40\u201350%) muddied results, and Amadeo rejected Ruiz Zorrilla's bid for power.\nEnd of Malcampo's Government\nFacing Cortes reopening, Malcampo resigned 19 December, seeing no path to Progressive unity. Amadeo appointed Sagasta on 21 December, honoring parliamentary norms as Congress president succeeded a resigning premier without constitutional breach.\nSecond year.\nIn 1872, persistent government crises worsened political and parliamentary stability, undermining Amadeo I's monarchy. Historian \u00c1ngel Bahamonde observes, \"If in 1871 there had been a succession of government crises, in 1872 the persistence of the same crises led to a progressive deterioration of political and parliamentary life,\" with dire consequences for the Savoy dynasty.\nSagasta's Government: The Constitutional Conservatives in Power.\nOn 21 December 1871, Pr\u00e1xedes Mateo Sagasta formed a government, initially offering Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla's Radicals four of eight cabinet posts\u2014half the government\u2014to unify Progressives. The Radicals declined, unwilling to abandon their alliance with Democrats (Cimbrios) or their \"benevolent pact\" with Republicans. At a meeting, Ruiz Zorrilla told Sagasta, \"I am more than a progressive, I am a radical.\" Sagasta then allied with General Serrano's Unionists, who joined with one portfolio\u2014Admiral Topete as Minister of Overseas Territories. Most posts went to \"historical\" Progressives: Jos\u00e9 Malcampo (War and Navy), Bonifacio de Blas (Interior), and others like Santiago de Angulo, Francisco de Paula Angulo, and Alonso Colmenares.\nOn 22 January 1872, Sagasta presented his government to the Cortes, labeling it \"progressive-conservative.\" He aimed to balance the 1869 Constitution's rights with order, defending the monarchy as \"the essential foundation of public liberties.\" He proposed a two-party system of \"loyal and benevolent\" parties\u2014one more progressive, one less so, both liberal-conservative. The Cortes rejected it, but with more dynastic votes in favor, Amadeo granted Sagasta a dissolution decree for new elections to secure a majority. Radicals rallied with \"Radicals defend yourselves!\" and \"God save the country! God save the dynasty! God save freedom!\" while Republicans declared, \"The King has broken with Parliament, today the Savoy dynasty ends.\"\nRadicals blamed a palace camarilla\u2014Italian advisers like Dragonetti and Nicol\u00e1s Ronchi, conservatives, and Queen Maria Vittoria's neo-Catholic allies\u2014for blocking their power. On 23 January, Ruiz Zorrilla criticized the king in the Cortes, invoking a \"right to revolt\" against threatened freedoms. Radical newspapers turned on Amadeo, and leaders boycotted palace lunches (except Moret). At a 2 February rally, Jos\u00e9 Echegaray demanded the Palacio de Oriente \"open its windows\" to freedom, while El Imparcial (22 February) likened Amadeo's rule to Isabella II's, branding Sagasta's ministry \"reactionary.\" Radical Francisco Salmer\u00f3n wrote to his father in January 1872:\n\"The palace is not hostile, for the king delights in courtesans; and the queen in neo-politics. The infamous Sagasta is waging an implacable war against the Radicals... We go into the electoral struggle with the proof of defeat; then, in retreat, we shall witness the catastrophe.\"\nBirth of the Constitutional Party and the \"National Coalition\".\nSagasta's Progressives and Unionists formed an electoral committee on 22 January, issuing a manifesto summarizing the government's program. Unionists pushed for a single party, but Sagasta envisioned a \"third party\" blending both sides to reunite Progressives. Amadeo intervened, tasking Unionist Jos\u00e9 Luis Albareda with drafting a plan for a Conservative Party to alternate with Radicals. Facing royal pressure\u2014and after briefly resigning\u2014Sagasta relented. On 21 February 1872, the Constitutional Party emerged, aiming to defend \"Liberty, the Constitution of 1869, the dynasty of Amadeo I, and territorial integrity.\" The reshuffled cabinet balanced four Progressives and three Unionists under Sagasta.\nThe Radicals, seeking to topple the government, expanded their December 1871 \"National Coalition\" with Republicans to include Carlists and later Alfonsist Moderates. United by the goal of \"defeating the government, the fruit of immorality and lies,\" they used patriotic slogans like \"Spain for the Spaniards,\" championed by Republican Emilio Castelar. The coalition agreed to field one candidate per district\u2014favoring the strongest prior performer\u2014to maximize votes.\nElections of April 1872.\nThe April 2 elections delivered the Constitutionalists over 200 seats, with Unionists outnumbering Progressives, bolstering Serrano's influence. Victory came via \"moral influence\"\u2014electoral manipulation\u2014despite Amadeo's plea for fairness, to which Sagasta replied, \"as pure as they can be in Spain.\" A circular to governors outlined tactics: buying votes, crowding polling stations with loyalists, and using police to suppress dissent. The National Coalition secured nearly 150 seats\u2014Radicals 42, Republicans, Carlists, and Alfonsists combined\u2014amid high abstention and unrest in Carlist (Basque, Navarre) and Federalist (Mediterranean) regions. The Radicals' poor showing questioned Ruiz Zorrilla's leadership, pushing some toward abandoning legal means.\nThe elections finalized the Progressive Party's split: Sagasta's faction merged with Unionists into the Constitutional Party, while Ruiz Zorrilla led the Radical Party with Democrats (cimbrios), including Cristino Martos and Nicol\u00e1s Mar\u00eda Rivero.\nCarlist Uprising.\nIn the April 1872 elections, Carlists dropped from 51 to 38 seats, empowering their insurrectionist faction over C\u00e1ndido Nocedal's neo-Catholic legalists. Their 8 March manifesto hinted at war: \"now to the ballot box, then to wherever God calls us.\" On 14 April, Carlos VII ordered elected deputies to boycott the Cortes and launched the Third Carlist War, planned as a fallback if Nocedal's parliamentary strategy failed. Nocedal resigned immediately. In a manifesto, Carlos VII rallied Spaniards:\n\"The holy religion of our fathers is persecuted... anarchy triumphs, the treasury is plundered... If this continues, the poor will be left without bread and Spain without honour... For the sake of our God, our country, and your King, rise up, Spaniards!\"\nOn 2 May, Carlos VII entered Spain via Vera de Bidasoa, proclaiming \"Down with the foreigner and long live Spain!\" Defeated at the Battle of Oroquieta on 4 May, he fled to France. General Serrano, commanding the northern army, signed the Amorebieta Convention on 24 May with Biscay's Carlist deputies, ending Basque-Aragon fighting via amnesty and reinstating rebel officers\u2014a move criticized as overly lenient by the military, Radicals, and Republicans. Catalonia's Carlist activity persisted, with Carlos VII promising to restore Catalan fueros on 16 June, until a new Basque-Aragon uprising in December 1872; the war outlasted Amadeo's reign, ending in 1876.\nFall of the Sagasta Government and the \"Lightning\" Government of Serrano: The End of the Conservative Project.\nSagasta's government faltered in May 1872 after a scandal over two million reales diverted from the Overseas to the Interior Ministry, likely for electoral fraud via \"l\u00e1zaros\"\u2014votes cast by the dead. Rumours also tied it to a hushed-up affair involving Amadeo or Serrano's circle, though corruption was the probable cause. Sagasta's defence\u2014claiming reserved payments to thwart conspiracies\u2014relied on forged documents, exposing illegalities. Denied a confidence vote by his majority, including Unionists more irked by the breach than the funds, Sagasta resigned on 22 May.\nOn 26 May, Amadeo appointed Serrano, then fighting Carlists, as president, assuming his coalition's Cortes majority held. Serrano's cabinet mixed three ex-Progressives and five ex-Unionists, including an Alfonsist from Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo's faction. Admiral Topete presented it to Congress on 27 May, as Serrano was delayed. Unexpectedly, Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla pledged \"loyal, legal, and respectful opposition,\" accepting constitutional monarchy rules\u2014a shift contested by Radicals like Cristino Martos, who rejected waiting years for power or aiding \"reaction.\" Unsupported, Ruiz Zorrilla resigned his seat on 31 May after meeting Amadeo for his birthday, retiring to his Soria estate, \"La Tablada,\" unwilling to join an anti-dynastic or insurrectionary path. Radical press blamed the king and queen.\nThe Amorebieta Convention nearly toppled Serrano, with ministers opposing rebel officer reinstatement as a \"degradation\" of the army and government. Amadeo's backing and Cortes ratification (Republicans against, Radicals abstaining) saved it, and Serrano took office 4 June. Yet, Radicals under Martos and Republicans challenged Serrano's legitimacy, citing his Alfonsist inclusion, fueling pre-revolutionary rhetoric like \"The Revolution is dead! Long live the Revolution!\" El Imparcial's 10 June piece, \"The Madwoman of the Vatican,\" subtly attacked Queen Maria Vittoria.\nOn 6 June, Radicals mobilised Madrid's Volunteers of Liberty to protest in the Plaza Mayor. Serrano quartered troops and, on 11 June, sought a decree suspending constitutional guarantees\u2014approved by the Cortes\u2014to curb a looming Republican uprising, which Radicals seemed poised to join post-Ruiz Zorrilla. A planned 16 June rally under \"The September Revolution and the Freedom of the Motherland\" omitted the dynasty, alarming Amadeo. Refusing to sign and risk civil conflict, he forced Serrano's resignation on 12 June. The militia gathered that day dispersed upon hearing the news. Serrano, after less than 20 days, retired to Arjona, telling a French diplomat, \"We must get rid of that imbecile\", referring to Amadeo.\nJorge Vilches reflects:\n\"The king was almost completely isolated... with a strong anti-dynastic opposition, weak constitutional parties... political leaders unable to unite, and an unsupportive populace. By 12 June 1872, his situation was dire: Prim dead, Ruiz Zorrilla retired, Sagasta facing prosecution... two civil wars, and a Republican threat looming.\"\nConstitutionalists, learning Ruiz Zorrilla would replace Serrano with a Cortes dissolution, decried an \"unprecedented coup d'\u00e9tat\", citing its unconstitutionality (four months hadn't passed since the last election) and the regime's instability\u2014three elections, multiple crises in 18 months. They petitioned Amadeo to reject it, promising support instead.\nSecond Ruiz Zorrilla Government: Failure of the Radicals.\nPost-Serrano, Amadeo tapped General Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdova as interim president until Ruiz Zorrilla's return, calming radical press criticism. Up to 300 Radicals, led by Nicol\u00e1s Mar\u00eda Rivero, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ber\u00e1nger, and Francisco Salmer\u00f3n, visited \"La Tablada\" to recall Ruiz Zorrilla, greeted by thousands in Madrid. He demanded an unconstitutional Cortes dissolution and elections\u2014less than four months since April\u2014pressuring Amadeo, who yielded, appearing partisan to Radicals. Jorge Vilches calls this a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" by Radicals forcing power via threats and constitutional breaches.\nRuiz Zorrilla formed his 13 June government, taking the Interior Ministry, with ex-Democrats Martos (State) and Echegaray (Public Works), ex-Progressives Eduardo Gasset y Artime (Overseas), Servando Ruiz G\u00f3mez (Finance), Eugenio Montero R\u00edos (Justice), and Ber\u00e1nger (Navy), plus Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (War). Rivero was slated for the Congress Speaker. A purge dismissed 40,000 civil servants for loyalists.\nAssassination Attempt Against the King on 18 July and Insults to the Crown.\nOn 18 July, Amadeo and Queen Maria Vittoria survived an assassination attempt on Madrid's Calle del Arenal, intensifying his isolation as a Radical-dependent king. Warned by Martos and Governor Pedro Mata, Amadeo refused to alter his route; Mata's agents arrested Republican federalist attackers after they fired. Francesc Pi i Margall defended them in court. Public humiliations followed: carriage attacks on Calle de Alcal\u00e1, mud-throwing on Cedaceros, insults near El Retiro, and aristocratic snubs like the \"mantillas\" incident.\nAugust 1872 Elections and Their Consequences.\nThe August 24 elections saw Radicals propose jury trials, abolishing conscription and Matr\u00edcula de mar, church-state separation, public education, and militia strengthening to fulfill 1868 promises to the working classes. The Constitutional Party debated participation\u2014opting in on 5 July to block a Republic\u2014but fielded few candidates amid defeatism, with Serrano refusing to run, weakening the dynasty's conservative pillar. Topete, Sagasta, and Antonio de los R\u00edos Rosas led instead. Radicals won 274 seats, with 77 Republicans, 14 Constitutionalists, and 9 Moderates, aided by a Radical-Republican pact and over 50% abstention from boycotts and apathy.\nVilches notes the elections discredited the 1868 Revolution among conservatives, shifting the regime leftward via illegalities, sidelining Constitutionalists, and aligning Amadeo with Radicals, prompting Bourbon restoration talk for Alfonso XII. Montpensier's 20 June letter endorsed Alfonso as a progressive heir, gaining traction with C\u00e1novas's liberal Moderates.\nAbolition of Slavery Project in Puerto Rico.\nOn 15 September, Ruiz Zorrilla's reform program passed only the Criminal Procedure Law. The Abolition of slavery in Spain in Puerto Rico\u2014immediate abolition, provincial regime, and split civil-military authority\u2014split the cabinet. Overseas Minister Gasset y Artime and Finance Minister Ruiz G\u00f3mez resigned, replaced by Tom\u00e1s Mar\u00eda Mosquera, who presented himself on 24 December, backed by Republicans and the Sociedad Abolicionista Espa\u00f1ola. Cuba's abolition was deferred due to Centro Hispano Ultramarino pressure. Conservatives feared destabilising Puerto Rico and encouraging Cuban rebels, while Radicals saw it as a peace gesture. Opposition from the National League, including Serrano and C\u00e1novas, sought a conservative government to halt reforms without toppling the regime.\nHalted Reforms and Division Among the Radicals.\nUnder Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla's second government, ongoing conflicts\u2014the Third Carlist War and Cuban War\u2014blocked his pledge to abolish military drafts. Announcing a new recruitment in late 1872 sparked riots in several cities, emboldening \"intransigent\" federal Republicans to push their insurrectionary agenda. The most significant revolt erupted on 11 October in Ferrol, but it collapsed due to a lack of local support and no nationwide echo. \"Benevolent\" Republican leaders, like Francesc Pi i Margall, condemned it in the Cortes on 15 October as a \"true crime\" given \"fully guaranteed\" freedoms, deepening the party's split between legalists and insurrectionists\u2014a rift only the Republic's proclamation four months later averted from escalating further.\nThe Carlist War intensified in December 1872, again delaying draft abolition. Republicans rejected Ruiz Zorrilla's policies, with minor Andalusian rebel groups forming, though less threatening than Carlists. Amid this turmoil, Ruiz Zorrilla tried to mend ties with the Constitutional Party by proposing ordinary courts, not the Senate, to judge Sagasta for the \"two million reales scandal.\" This backfired as democratic deputies, led by Congress Speaker Nicol\u00e1s Mar\u00eda Rivero, and ministers Cristino Martos and Jos\u00e9 Echegaray, sided with Republicans to reject it. This internal rift bolstered \"benevolent\" Republicans' strategy to lure ex-Democrats (Cimbrios) into a parliamentary majority to topple the monarchy.\nAbdication of Amadeo I and proclamation of the Republic.\nConflict Between Radicals and the King.\nOn 29 January 1873, radical extremists seized on a perceived royal slight\u2014Amadeo delaying his newborn heir's baptism due to childbirth complications, leaving government officials waiting\u2014as a pretext to challenge him. Rumors swirled of Amadeo dismissing Ruiz Zorrilla for a Constitutionalist government, fueled by his meeting with General Serrano at the palace (Serrano declined after consulting his party). Radicals moved to declare the Cortes a permanent Convention, only halted by swift government action; the Chamber merely noted the prince's birth without fanfare. Amadeo told Ruiz Zorrilla he wouldn't \"suffer impositions\" and was \"prepared to act,\" writing his father in early February of abdication thoughts, suspecting Ruiz Zorrilla colluded with Republicans against the dynasty.\nA decisive clash emerged over artillery corps reorganisation. In January, officers threatened mass resignation if General Baltasar Hidalgo de Quintana\u2014linked to the 1866 Uprising at the San Gil barracks suppression\u2014remained Captain General of the Basque Country. The government and Cort\u00e9s upheld civilian supremacy, affirming Hidalgo and reorganising the corps, prompting officers to resign en masse. On 6 February, these officers urged Amadeo to intervene, offering coup support to dissolve the Cortes and suspend guarantees. He refused but opposed the reorganization.\nThat day, Ruiz Zorrilla denied press reports of Hidalgo's appointment as Captain General of Catalonia, but its confirmation the next day convinced Amadeo of deceit. He pressed Ruiz Zorrilla on 7 February to delay the artillery issue and retain officers amid the Carlist War, but the Cortes approved their resignations and replacements by sergeants that evening, ratified by the Senate on 8 February. Moderate Fernando Calder\u00f3n Collantes warned it undermined royal prerogatives, a view Amadeo shared as officers surrendered weapons before he signed the decree.\nAmadeo considered a Constitutionalist government and Cortes dissolution but feared civil war, lacking Radical-controlled Madrid garrison support despite backing from generals like Topete, Serrano, and Malcampo. Topete offered Constitutionalist aid on 7\u20138 February, but Amadeo refused bloodshed, signing the artillery decrees on 8 February after a Council of Ministers meeting. He proposed a reconciliation government with all 1870 supporters, warning of abdication otherwise. Ruiz Zorrilla's cabinet rejected it after three meetings. On 9 February, Constitutionalists telegrammed Serrano in Ja\u00e9n to return; he arrived 10 February, ready to defend the dynasty, but La Correspondencia de Espa\u00f1a announced Amadeo's abdication that day.\nAbdication.\nAmadeo signed the artillery decree on 9 February and abdicated on 10 February 1873, notifying the Cortes on 11 February:\n\"For over two years I have worn the Crown of Spain... Spain lives in constant struggle... all who aggravate the nation's suffering are Spaniards... Amid this clamour, it is impossible to find a remedy... I have sought it within the law, and not found it... No danger would compel me to lay down the crown if it were for Spain's good... I hold the firm conviction that my efforts would be futile... These are the reasons I return the crown... renouncing it for myself, my children, and my successors.\"\nOnly Topete, a key 1868 revolutionary turned loyalist, bid farewell to Amadeo and Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo. Jorge Vilches blames Ruiz Zorrilla's Radicals for distorting the Crown's role, undermining a loyal party system, and empowering anti-monarchists, though Sagasta's hesitation and Serrano's reluctance also contributed to the collapse.\nProclamation of the Republic.\nOn 10 February, Madrid federalists demanded the Republic as news of the abdication broke. Ruiz Zorrilla's cabinet split: Progressives favoured a provisional government and consultation, aligning with Constitutionalists, while Democrats, led by Martos and Rivero, pushed for a Cortes Convention to declare the Republic, leveraging their majority with federalists. Ruiz Zorrilla sought a 24-hour session suspension, but Martos overruled him, declaring the Cortes sovereign post-abdication, with \"no other possibility but the Republic.\" The Cortes voted itself permanent, despite crowd pressure quelled by the National Militia.\nOn 11 February, Republican threats of insurrection by 3 p.m. forced action. Martos, Rivero, and Senate President Figuerola convened both chambers as a National Assembly. After reading Amadeo's letter, Martos ceded government power to the Cortes, which, with 258 votes to 32, proclaimed the First Spanish Republic:\n\"The National Assembly assumes all powers and declares the Republic as the form of government...\"\nThat evening, Estanislao Figueras was elected President of the Executive Power, heading a Radical-Republican cabinet: Republicans Emilio Castelar (State), Francesc Pi i Margall (Interior), Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n (Justice); Radicals Jos\u00e9 Echegaray (Finance), Manuel Becerra (Public Works), Francisco Salmer\u00f3n (Overseas), General Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (War), and Admiral Ber\u00e1nger (Navy). Martos became Assembly president with 222 votes to Rivero's 20.\nLater life.\nCompletely disgusted, the ex-monarch left Spain and returned to Italy, where he resumed the title of Duke of Aosta. The First Spanish Republic lasted less than two years, and in November 1874 Alfonso XII, the son of Isabella II, was proclaimed king, with Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo, Spanish intermittent prime minister from 1873 until his assassination in 1897, briefly serving as regent.\nAmadeo married his first wife, Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo, on 30 May 1867, with whom he had three sons; Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta, Prince Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Turin, and Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi. She died on 8 November 1876. On 11 September 1888, he married his French niece, Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Duchess of Aosta (20 November 1866\u00a0\u2013 25 October 1926), daughter of his sister Maria Clotilde and of Prince Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, a nephew of Napoleon I. They had one child, Umberto (1889\u20131918), who died of the Spanish flu during the First World War, predeceasing all three of his stepbrothers.\nAmadeo remained in Turin until his death on 18 January 1890. His friend Puccini composed the famous elegy for string quartet \"Crisantemi\" in his memory.\nLegacy.\nThe municipality of Amadeo, in the province of Cavite, in the Philippines, which was a colony of Spain, was named after Amadeo I when it was established on 15 July 1872, during his reign.\nA large salt lake, Lake Amadeus, and the subsequently-named Amadeus Basin, where it lies in central Australia, is also named after Amadeo I by the explorer Ernest Giles, who was the first European to encounter the lake, in 1872.\nIssue.\nBy Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo:\nBy Maria Letizia Bonaparte:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film tells the story of surly oil rig worker Bobby Dupea (Nicholson), whose rootless blue-collar existence belies his privileged youth as a piano prodigy. When Bobby learns that his father is dying, he travels to his family home in Washington to visit him, taking along his uncouth girlfriend (Black).\nThe film was nominated for four Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards, and was inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2000, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nA man named Bobby Dupea works in an oil field in Kern County, California. He spends most of his time with his girlfriend Rayette, a waitress who has dreams of singing country music, or with fellow oil worker Elton, with whom he bowls, gets drunk, and philanders.\nWhen Bobby gets Rayette pregnant and Elton is arrested, Bobby quits his job and goes to Los Angeles, where his sister Partita is making a classical piano recording. She tells Bobby, who was once also a pianist, that their father has suffered two strokes, and urges him to reconcile with the family at their home in Washington.\nRayette threatens to kill herself if Bobby leaves her, so he reluctantly asks her along. Driving north, they pick up Terry and Palm, two stranded women headed for Alaska. The latter launches into a monologue about the evils of consumerism. The four are thrown out of a diner after Bobby argues with an obstinate waitress over his order. Bobby drops off Terry and Palm when they get to Washington.\nAshamed to introduce Rayette to his upper-class family, Bobby registers her in a motel before driving alone to the family home on an island in Puget Sound. He finds Partita giving their father a haircut; the old man seems completely oblivious to him. At dinner, Bobby meets Catherine Van Oost, a young pianist studying under and engaged to his amiable brother Carl, a violinist. Despite personality differences, Catherine and Bobby are immediately attracted to each other. Learning that Bobby was once a pianist, she asks him to play for her. She is moved by his rendition of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's Prelude, Op. 28, No. 4, but Bobby dismisses her, insisting that he played with \"no inner feeling\". Angered by Bobby's rejection, she leaves, but he follows after her and they have sex in her room.\nRayette runs out of money at the motel and comes to the Dupea estate unannounced. Her presence creates an awkward situation, but when intellectual family friend Samia Glavia ridicules her, Bobby comes to her defense. Storming out of the room in search of Catherine, he discovers his father's male nurse giving Partita a sensual massage. He picks a fight with the nurse, who easily subdues him.\nBobby tries to persuade Catherine to go away with him, but she declines, telling him he cannot ask for love when he does not love himself, or anything at all. After tearfully confessing his regrets to his unresponsive father, Bobby leaves for California with Rayette. Shortly into the trip, they stop for gas and coffee; while Rayette's view is obstructed, Bobby hitches a ride on a truck headed north.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jack Nicholson as Robert \"Bobby\" Eroica Dupea\nProduction.\nWhile the film's earlier scenes were shot in California, the majority was filmed in the Pacific Northwest.

It contains 50 accepted species. In addition to yucca, they are also known as Adam's needle or Spanish-bayonet. The genus is generally classified in the asparagus family in a subfamily with the \"Agave\", though historically it was part of the lily family. The species range from small shrubby plants to tree-like giants, such as the Joshua tree. All yuccas have rosettes of leaves that taper to points and inflorescences with many flowers that are mainly cream white with thick petals. Though adapted to a wide range of climates the plants are xerophytes, ones that specialize in dry living conditions.\nThe tight relationship between the yucca plants and their pollinators, the yucca moths from the genera \"Tegeticula\" and \"Parategeticula\", is a well known example of evolutionary mutualism. They are an important part of the ecology of North American deserts, providing shelter to small animals and creating habitats. The human uses of yuccas include garden plants, as food, and for extracts. The flower petals of various species are eaten as a part of local cuisine, particularly in Central America and Mexico. Historically, the yucca was extensively used for its fibers to make cords, baskets, mats, and sandals. It continues to be used by native peoples for traditional soaps.\nDescription.\nYuccas are perennial plants with long, pointed sword shaped leaves in one or more rosettes, circular arrangements of leaves. Usually the leaves are stiff and fibrous, but a few species have fleshy leaves. The leaves are numerous and arranged in spirals at the ends of stems or branches. Plants can be small shrubs or large resembling trees. The surface of the leaves are hairless, but some have a very rough surface. About half of all species have fibers that peel off the edges of the leaves. Their color can be bright green, gray-green, or pale blue. The leaves never have spines on their edges, but may be very finely toothed. Some yucca species reproduce by underground rhizomes and form colonies of plants, but this feature is rare in the fleshy-fruited yuccas, which will usually produce new sprouts at the base of the plant from nodule-like growths.\nPlants without stems or trunks grow from a thick underground caudex, a modified stem with growth at the end like in a palm tree. Species that do not have trunks tend to be found in colder areas such as the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and eastern United States. Species with trunks are more common in the subtropics, deserts, and tropics to the south. The largest of these tree yuccas is \"Yucca brevifolia\", commonly known as the Joshua tree in the American southwest. The Joshua tree can reach up to in height. Every species grows in soil, except for \"Yucca lacandonica\", which grows as an epiphyte.\nSome species have a scape, a long flowering stem without any leaves or bracts along its length. These are always less than in diameter. The inflorescence is usually upright, but in a few species bends over and hangs downward. The inflorescence can be a panicle, where the flowers are on branches off the main stem, or a raceme, where the flowers are attached directly by flower stalks to the main stem. Though the plants live for many years and flower multiple times, each inflorescence dies after setting seed.\nThe flowers are large and showy, ranging from bell shaped to round like a globe. The six tepals are white to cream or slightly green in color. They are thick and leathery in texture, and in many species the three outermost tepals will have red, pink, maroon, purple, or brown streaks.\nIn about half of the species the fruit is a dry capsule. In the other half, it is a fleshy fruit. Inside the fruit, the seeds are tightly packed, flat, and black in color. Dry capsules are held in an upright position while soft capsules hang downwards.\nDue to similar characteristics of many species it is difficult to identify them without flowers or fruits. Many characteristics taken together are needed to make identifications, often including the size and color of the pistil, style, and flowers while alive. Yuccas are distinct from \"Agave\" due to typically having less succulent leaves, thicker flower petals, and a lack of spines on leaf edges.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Yucca\" was first described and named by Carl Linnaeus in his book \"Species Plantarum\", published in 1753. The first work on the genus as a whole was published by George Engelmann in 1873. A lectotype for the genus, a specimen of \"Yucca aloifolia\", was designated by Nathaniel Lord Britton and John Adolph Shafer in 1908.\nIn 1902 William Trelease published a paper separating out \"Clistoyucca\" and \"Samuela\" from \"Yucca\", along with his 1893 separation of \"Hesperoyucca\" from the genus. Susan Delano McKelvey argued against this separation, though she recognized them as sections of \"Yucca\". McKelvey did allow that \"Hesperoyucca\" might be recognized as a genus writing, \"since a number of flower and fruit characters differ from those in all other sections\". DNA investigations in the 1990s found support for \"Hesperoyucca\". As of 2025, \"Hesperoyucca\" is listed as accepted.\nPrior to the 1950s \"Yucca\" was placed in Liliaceae, the lily family, due to having a superior ovary. Since that time, evidence of it being more closely related to the \"Agave\" genus has been accepted. In particular, the discovery that \"Yucca\", like plants in \"Agave\", has 5 large and 20 small chromosomes was a large factor in reconsidering their relationship. The APG III system, published in 2009, placed the genus into the family Asparagaceae in the Agavoideae subfamily. This classification continued in APG IV. However, some botanists prefer to classify this subfamily as a family named Agavaceae.\nSpecies.\nAs of 2025[ [update]] Plants of the World Online (POWO) and World Flora Online (WFO) both list 50 valid species. In addition, POWO lists three other species, \"Yucca jaegeriana\" (McKelvey) L.W.Lenz, \"Yucca muscipula\" Ayala-Hern., R\u00edos-G\u00f3mez, E.Solano &amp; Garc\u00eda-Mend., and \"Yucca pinicola\" Zamudio, that WFO lists as unchecked or as a synonym of another species. There are also two natural hybrids, \"Yucca\" \u00d7 \"schottii\", which was formerly listed as a species under various names, and \"Yucca\" \u00d7 \"quinnarjenii\".\nNames.\nIn 1737 Linnaeus, in setting out his rules for the names of genera, wrote, \"Generic names which have not a root derived from Greek or Latin are to be rejected\". However, in the case of \"Yucca\" and several other names, he violated his own rule by adopting names derived from other languages. The word was borrowed from the Carib language by Spanish as \"juca\", starting with Amerigo Vespucci in 1497 referring to cassava. It was first used to refer to the unrelated plants of the genus \"Yucca\" in a German travel account published in 1557. This was used as the genus name by Linnaeus in \"Species Plantarum\".\nThe name \"yucca\" is used as an English common name for plant species in the genus. It is pronounced (YUCK-uh) in both British English and American English, but may also be pronounced (YOO-kuh) in British English. It is also known as \"Adam's needle\" or as \"Spanish-bayonet\". Other common names for some species include \"Spanish dagger\", \"shin dagger\", \"soapweed\", or \"soaptree\". In the plant trade they are sometimes known as \"palm lilies\". The name yucca can be confused with cassava, though the spelling \"yuca\" is often used to distinguish the food from plants in \"Yucca\".\nThe Aztecs living in Mexico call the local yucca species in Nahuatl, which gave the Spanish .\nRange and habitat.\nThe natural range of the yuccas stretches across much of southern North America from Panama in the south as far north as Alberta in Canada. The exact extent is disputed as though \"Yucca gigantea\" is listed by Plants of the World Online (POWO) and World Flora Online (WFO) as native to Central America, other sources like World Plants list it as introduced to all the nations of Central America. Likewise, \"Yucca flaccida\" is listed as native to Ontario by POWO, WFO, and World Plants, but is listed by the Database of Vascular Plants of Canada as introduced.\nYuccas are generally accepted to be introduced to the islands Caribbean. Various species have also escaped from cultivation in Europe as far east as Poland and Romania. They grow as an introduced species in Turkey, Pakistan, and Bangladesh in Asia. In Africa they are reported in Tunisia and KwaZulu-Natal and Free State in South Africa. They have been introduced to South America in Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, and Argentina. In Australia Aloe yucca (\"Yucca aloifolia\") has naturalized in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is doubtfully naturalized on Lord Howe Island and naturalized on Norfolk Island. Two other species, \"Yucca gloriosa\" and \"Yucca whipplei\", may also be naturalized in Australia. They are listed as an environmental weed in New Zealand having been found 31 times outside of cultivation.\nThe yuccas are xerophytic, plants with adaptations to dry environments, with even those native to rainy habitats growing better when in drier areas. The smaller, freeze-tolerant species of yucca have two centers of diversity, one in Texas and the other on the Colorado Plateau. They are found generally to the north and east of the range in Chihuahuan Desert, the Trans-Pecos region, the Rocky Mountains, the Colorado Plateau, and the Great Plains. Tree-like yuccas with fleshy fruits have a center of diversity in the Sonoran Desert. They are found mainly in Mexico, while the tree like yuccas with spongy fruits are found only in the Mojave Desert.\nEcology.\nYuccas have a very specialized mutualistic system of pollination. Yucca moths in genus \"Tegeticula\" or \"Parategeticula\" pollinate the flowers and then lay their eggs in the seed capsules of yuccas. Some species of \"Tegeticula\" provide no benefit to the yuccas, laying eggs but not pollinating the flowers due to lacking the specialized parts for carrying pollen. Almost all species are pollinated by one or more species of these moths with one species, Aloe yucca (\"Yucca aloifolia\"), documented to revert away from mutualism to a generalist pollinator when the moths are absent. This mutualism was first documented by Charles Valentine Riley in 1873, and its discovery elicited much excitement in the scientific community. In a 1874 letter to his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, Darwin called it \"the most wonderful case of fertilisation ever published\".\nInstances of animal behavior that are exclusively aimed at pollination of plants, rather than just accompanying the animal gathering food, are quite rare. Female yucca moths have tentacle-like mouth parts that they use to gather pollen and then to deposit it on the reproductive parts. In the 150 years following the discovery of this relationship it became one of the most famous of the documented plant and animal mutualisms along with the fig wasps and fig trees. The association between the yuccas and the yucca moths is quite ancient, with a molecular clock estimate that it began between 51.3 and 31.7 million years ago with them becoming pollinators 35.6 million years ago \u00b19 million years.\nAbout two-thirds of the moth species are limited to just one species of yucca. There is some evidence that the moths that visit a single species are guided to the flowers by distinct scents. All yucca moths species gather together inside of blooms to mate. The females of \"Tegeticula\" gather pollen and then pierce the yucca ovaries or styles to lay their eggs. After this, they deposit their load of pollen to ensure the development of seeds. The female \"Parategeticula\" moths cut grooves into flower stems, petals, or other parts to lay their eggs, but also use their mouthparts to deposit pollen on stigmas and into styles. In order to limit the numbers of seeds eaten by moth larvae, yucca plants abort fruits with large numbers of eggs deposited within them, but also drop fruits without sufficient pollination produce minimal number of seeds.\nThough the reduction or local extinction of yucca moths can reduce the fertility of seeds or the numbers produced, there is not yet evidence that it reduces the populations of yuccas as they are relatively long lived. The scientist Robert William Cruden and his collaborators speculated in 1976 that yucca species are limited to lower elevations by the inability of their moth pollinators to tolerate colder temperatures at high elevations. Yuccas continue to be an important subject of study because of the simple coevolutionary competition and their relatively exclusive relationship.\nBesides the yucca moths, a number of other insect species depend upon yuccas for food. The bogus yucca moths (\"Prodoxus\") lay their eggs on yucca species, but do not pollinate the flowers. They also do not eat the seeds, instead feeding on fruits, stems, or leaves, frequently forming gall-like structures. Yucca species are the host plants for the caterpillars of the widespread but uncommon yucca giant-skipper butterfly (\"Megathymus yuccae\"), which is found across the southern United States and northern Mexico. The ursine giant skipper butterfly (\"Megathymus ursus\"), from southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, western Texas, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, feeds on yuccas such as Schott's yucca (\"Yucca\" \u00d7 \"schottii\") and datil yucca (\"Yucca baccata\"), as does the more northerly Strecker's giant skipper (\"Megathymus streckeri\"), though it prefers smaller species of yucca. The giant skippers (Megathymini) are species that feed in the roots of yuccas and inside the leaves of agaves. Beetle herbivores include yucca weevils in the family Curculionidae. Some species of darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) also feed on parts related to the stigma or the parts connecting them to the ovary as well as mating inside the flowers.\nIn desert environments, yuccas are an important part of the ecology, improving the environment by enriching the soil with organic material and reducing erosion. The shelter the yuccas provide attracts small animals, and their waste and remains concentrate nutrients in the immediately surrounding areas, creating a microhabitat alongside small plants. Tree-like species of yucca, such as the Joshua tree, provide nesting sites for birds and materials for small rodents. Their fallen trunks provide shelter for lizards. In the plains biome, species like \"Yucca glauca\" provide perches for birds as well as cover for small birds, small reptiles, and small mammals. In the plains, yuccas are not a significant source of food for either native grazers or for livestock, but in desert environments cattle will learn to avoid the sharp ends of the leaves and eat the base instead. Similarly, goats will eat the whole head of leaves when there is no other forage available. Under heavy grazing pressure grasses in the southwest are replaced by resistant native shrubs.\nYucca seeds remain viable for many years in the environment due to being well protected and having plenty of energy reserves. To start germination they require a large amount of moisture. Due to the scarcity of water in much of their habitat the reproduction of yuccas by seed is limited and the majority of new plants sprout from rhizomes.\nConservation.\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, only five species are endangered: plains yucca (\"Yucca campestris\"), nodding yucca (\"Yucca cernua\"), quim (\"Yucca lacandonica\"), pitilla (\"Yucca endlichiana\"), and \"Yucca queretaroensis\".\nUses.\nYuccas are widely grown as ornamental plants in gardens and landscaping. Yucca plants have provided food and fibers to humans. Several yucca species have fleshy fruits that are edible, although the seeds they contain are not. Additionally, the flowers are edible both cooked and raw. The young flowering stems of some species are edible when cooked. The leaves, roots, stems, and hearts of the plants are all inedible due to high levels of saponins.\nYucca rhizomes have been extensively used to produce soaps, shampoos, detergents and are still used to a lesser extent for this today. The leaves are still used to make trays and baskets in the southwestern US. Research efforts have been made into making use of the fibers as a substitute for sisal or abac\u00e1. Efforts to cultivate existing North American yucca plants for their fibers were abandoned after conclusion of the Second World War. While the strength of yucca fibers is good, their harvest is uneconomical unless alternatives are unavailable.\nYucca extract, specifically from the rhizomes of Mojave yucca (\"Yucca schidigera\"), is used as a foaming agent in some beverages such as root beer and soda. Yucca powder is produced from yucca plants. Harvested logs are squeezed and the sap produced is then evaporated to produce the powder, which is used in food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and as animal feed additives. The extract is also used to reduce surface tension in water to allow it to more easily penetrate into heavy soils during irrigation.\nCultivation.\nVery soon after the start of the Columbian exchange of plants across the Atlantic Ocean, yuccas were planted in European gardens as ornamental plants with the first recorded bloom in England in 1604. Though they were planted for productive uses in Mexico prior to the Spanish Conquest, it is not recorded if they used them for ornamental purposes. The use of yucca as an ornamental was not well documented in the early early history of the United States, though Thomas Jefferson did grow \"Yucca filamentosa\", which he called bear grass.\nThe spineless yucca (\"Yucca gigantea\") is used as a common houseplant, though sometimes under the mistaken name of \"Yucca elephantipes\". When tropical yuccas are grown indoors they do not reach the large sizes they can achieve outdoors.\nYuccas are widely grown as architectural plants in landscape design due to the distinctive silhouette of their leaves. They are also particularly valued for their resistance to high temperatures and drought conditions. They tolerate a range of conditions but are best grown in full sun in subtropical or mild temperate areas. Some of the larger species of yucca are used as living barriers and fences. All yuccas require good drainage, but are tolerant of difficult conditions such as dry and poor soils. In cold climates when there is enough precipitation to collect in the crown of the yucca plant, the freeze-thaw cycle can damage the plant and provide an entry for damaging fungi or bacteria.\nSeveral species of yucca can be grown outdoors in temperate climates, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGastronomy.\nThe flower petals are commonly eaten in Central America and Mexico, but the plant's reproductive organs (the anthers and ovaries) are first removed because of their bitterness. Petals have a flavor reminiscent of lettuce.\nIn addition to being called in Mexico, yucca flowers are also called (palm flowers) in Hidalgo and San Luis Potos\u00ed, , , or in Veracruz, and in Tamaulipas. In rural central Mexico, they are eaten as food, as they were in pre-Hispanic times. Bunches are sold in public markets and eaten while very fresh and tender, before they become bitter. They are also cooked with scrambled eggs or in green chili salsa in this area.\nAnother way that yucca flowers are served is in a sauce after roasting where they are called in . It is served this way as a snack or with salads in the Los Tuxtlas region of Veracruz. In the northern Mexican state of Coahuila, yucca flowers are considered a traditional food for Lent.\nIn Guatemala, they are boiled and eaten with lemon juice. In El Salvador, the tender tips of stems are eaten and known locally as .\nThese Central American and Mexican culinary traditions have been imported to the United States to areas such as Los Angeles where the flowers of the giant yucca are eaten in season in scrambled eggs, pupusas, and tacos. Before being used as an ingredient, the petals are often blanched for five minutes, though they are also eaten raw in small amounts.\nIn Mexico, the fleshy fruits of some yucca species are called , the same word as for the fruit of the date palm, though they are unrelated. These fruits are used to produce alcoholic drinks. The edible fruit of the banana yucca becomes significantly sweeter when cooked. If pur\u00e9ed it is similar to applesauce. Raw fruits have a flavor similar to straightneck squash.\nTraditional uses.\nYuccas were and are one of the most important plants outside of cultivation for both ancient and contemporary native peoples in the Southwestern US. They have a wide range of uses, from fibers to food. Some of these uses are in fishing nets, in making paintbrushes, in combs, sandals, mats, blankets, and sewing. The dried and split trunks of yuccas are soft and work well for a hearth in starting fires via friction. The use of items woven from yucca leaves dates from the archaic period, 8000 to 1000BCE.\nThe young stalks of the soaptree yucca (\"Yucca elata\") have been consumed by the Mescalero Apache. They are roasted over an open fire and then peeled to eat the soft interior. The flower stalks of Great Plains yucca (\"Yucca glauca\") have been prepared similarly as recorded in the 1930s. The flowers of the same species were frequently boiled to remove their bitter flavor or the flower pistil, the most bitter part, was removed. The cooking of banana yucca fruits has continued to the present day among the Hopi. The use of yucca shampoo for hair and to wash traditional rugs continues with the Navajo. The Jicarilla Apaches will similarly use it to clean woven baskets.\nSymbolism.\nThe yucca flower is the state flower of New Mexico in the southwestern United States. No species name is given in the law; however, the Secretary of State of New Mexico website notes that the soaptree yucca (\"Yucca elata\") is one of the more widespread species in New Mexico. It was officially designated as the state flower in 1927 by the state legislature after a survey of state students with the support of the New Mexico Federation of Women's Clubs.\nThe yucca, specifically \"Yucca gigantea\", is the national flower of El Salvador, where it is known as . It was officially designated the floral emblem in 1995. Salvadorans often compare their ability to recover from periods of repression to the ability of the flor de izote to grow back after being cut.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNews sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReports.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Presented in 13 chapters, it is the first screen adventure for Flash Gordon, the comic-strip character created by Alex Raymond in 1934. It presents the story of Gordon's visit to the planet Mongo and his encounters with the evil Emperor Ming the Merciless. Buster Crabbe, Jean Rogers, Charles Middleton, Priscilla Lawson and Frank Shannon portray the film's central characters. In 1996, \"Flash Gordon\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nCast.\nCast notes:\nRelease and reception.\nUniversal hoped to regain an adult audience for serials with the release of \"Flash Gordon\" and by presenting it in many of the top or \"A-level\" theaters in large cities across the United States. Multiple newspapers in 1936, including some not even carrying the Flash Gordon comic strip, featured half- and three-quarter-page stories about the film as well as copies of Raymond's drawings and publicity stills that highlighted characters and chapter settings.\nThe film was the first outright science-fiction serial, although earlier serials had contained science-fiction elements such as gadgets. Six of the fourteen serials released within five years of \"Flash Gordon\" were science fiction.\nFor syndication to television in the 1950s, the serial was renamed \"Space Soldiers\", so as not to be confused with the newly made, also syndicated television series, \"Flash Gordon\".\nThe serial film was also edited into a 72-minute feature version in 1936, which was only exhibited abroad, until being released in the US in 1949 as Rocket Ship by Sherman S. Krellberg's Filmcraft Pictures.\nA different feature version of the serial, at 90 minutes, was sold directly to television in 1966 under the title \"Spaceship to the Unknown\".\n\"Flash Gordon\" was Universal's second-highest-grossing film of 1936, after \"Three Smart Girls\", a musical starring Deanna Durbin. The Hays Office, however, objected to the revealing costumes worn by Dale, Aura and the other female characters. In response to those objections, Universal designed more modest outfits for the female performers in the film's two sequels.\nIn his review of the film in the 2015 reference \"Radio Times Guide to Films\", Alan Jones describes \"Flash Gordon\" as \"non-stop thrill-a-minute stuff as Flash battles one adversary after another\", and he states that it is \"the best of the Crabbe trilogy of \"Flash Gordon\" films\".\nSequels.\nTwo sequels to \"Flash Gordon\", also in serial form and starring Buster Crabbe, followed the popular 1936 production: \"Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars\" (15 chapters) in 1938 and \"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\" (12 chapters) in 1940. Between the releases of those two later productions, Crabbe starred in an entirely separate but similarly structured Universal science-fiction serial portraying Buck Rogers, another popular character also featured in magazines, comic strips, and on radio in the late 1920s and 1930s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film's numbers were staged and choreographed by Busby Berkeley.\nThe film starred James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, with featured appearances by Frank McHugh, Guy Kibbee, Hugh Herbert, and Ruth Donnelly.\nThe film's screenplay was written by Manuel Seff and James Seymour, based on a story by Robert Lord and Peter Milne.\n\"Footlight Parade\" was one of the top-grossing motion pictures released in 1933, earning roughly over $1.6 million at the box office.\nIn 1992, \"Footlight Parade\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nChester Kent (James Cagney) replaces his failing career as a director of Broadway musicals with a new one as the creator of musical numbers called \"prologues\", short live stage productions presented in movie theaters before the main feature is shown. He faces pressure from his business partners to continuously create a large number of marketable prologues to service theaters throughout the country, but his job is made harder by a rival who is stealing his ideas, probably with assistance from someone working inside his own company. Kent is so overwhelmed with work that he doesn't realize that his secretary Nan (Joan Blondell) has fallen in love with him and is doing her best to protect him as well as his interests.\nKent's business partners announce that they have a big deal pending with the Apolinaris theater circuit, but getting the contract depends on Kent impressing Mr. Apolinaris (Paul Porcasi) with three spectacular prologues, presented on the same night, one after another at three different theaters. Kent locks himself and his staff in the offices to prevent espionage leaks while they choreograph and rehearse the three production numbers. Kent then stages \"Honeymoon Hotel\", \"By a Waterfall\" (featuring the famous \"Human Waterfall\") and \"Shanghai Lil\", featuring Cagney and Ruby Keeler dancing together.\nCast.\nCast notes:\nProduction.\nLooking for a role different from the gangster films such as \"The Public Enemy\" that catapulted him to fame, Cagney actively campaigned for the lead role of Chester Kent, based on well-known impresario Chester Hale of the prologue production company Fanchon and Marco. Cagney had gotten his start in vaudeville and Broadway before going into film work; the film became his first on-screen appearance as a dancer. Cagney had only fallen into his gangster persona when he and Edward Woods switched roles three days into the shooting of 1931's \"The Public Enemy\". That role catapulted Cagney into stardom and a series of gangster films. Throughout his career, Cagney found being typecast as a gangster to be as limiting as it was a benefit.\nWhile Powell's role was written specifically for him, he was replaced by Stanley Smith when he fell ill. When he recovered, Smith's scenes were reshot with Powell. The film became the third pairing of Powell and Ruby Keeler after \"42nd Street\" (1933) and \"Gold Diggers of 1933\", the first two Warner Bros. Busby Berkeley musicals. Similarly, Dorothy Tennant was initially cast as Harriet Gould, but replaced by Ruth Donnelly. Other actors considered for various roles included Eugene Pallette, George Dobbs and Patricia Ellis.\nWarner Bros. initially signed for Larry Ceballos to choreograph the film when Berkely was unavailable. However, when Berkeley was able to make changes to his schedule, the studio let Ceballos go. Ceballos subsequently sued Berkeley and the studio for $100,000 for breach of contract.\nProduction took place at the Warner Bros. studio in Burbank, California between June and September 1933, costing an estimated $703,000 to make (equivalent to approximately $ in 2024). It premiered on September 30, 1933, with a general release on October 21.\nPre-Code era scenes and promotion.\nThe film was made during the pre-Code era, and its humor is sometimes quite risqu\u00e9, with multiple references to prostitution and suggestions of profanity largely unseen again in studio films until the 1960s, when the Production Code collapsed. For example, Dick Powell's character is being \"kept\" by Mrs. Gould until he falls in love with another girl.\nJoan Blondell's character of Nan Prescott is the center of several lines and moments. She introduces her roommate, Vivian Rich, as \"Miss Bi... Rich\"; and later, when Vivian tries to take advantage of an intoxicated Chester, Nan kicks her out of their apartment, claiming Vivian will have a job \"as long as there are sidewalks\". In the Shanghai Lil number, it is clear that Lil and all the other girls are prostitutes working the waterfront bars along with scenes of an opium den. A character played by Hugh Herbert acts as the censor for Kent's productions, constantly telling Kent certain parts of his production numbers have to be changed. His character is portrayed as buffoonish and comical, saying disagreeable lines to Kent such as \"You must put brassieres on those dolls...\" (referring to actual toy dolls) \"...uh uh, you know Connecticut.\" There is also a scene in which, after seeing black children having fun in the water off a fire hydrant, Chester gets an idea for a prologue involving women dressed in black face and getting wet under a waterfall.\nAs with many other pre-Code films, including musicals, promotional materials featured scantily clad women on movie release posters, lobby cards and promotional photographs, as seen of Joan Blondell.https://\nReception.\nThe film made $1,601,000 in the United States, and an additional $815,000 internationally. Warner Bros. reported the film made a profit of $819,080, making it one of the most successful films of the year.\nIn 1992, \"Footlight Parade\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". \"Footlight Parade\" has a rating on the review-aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ficco is looking to get into the numbers game himself, and wants Bauer to set up a meeting with Leo to get information on Tucker\u2019s operation.\nJoe is warned by Tucker\u2019s wife Edna, who Joe is carrying on an affair with, that Tucker\u2019s telephone has been tapped by prosecutors. Joe later finds that his own phone is also tapped. He rejects Edna\u2019s advances, leaving his office with Doris and taking her back to his apartment, where the two kiss. The next day, Leo\u2019s bank is raided by police again. At the courthouse, Tucker tells Joe that the situation between him and Ficco could lead to violence. Joe demands Leo be allowed to leave the numbers business, agreeing to take over the bank himself. He also finds a furious Doris, who accuses him of forcing Leo to stay in the business. \nWhen Joe returns to work late that night, he finds his partner Joe Wheelock in his office, revealing him as a police informant and the one who had Joe\u2019s phone tapped. He retrieves a gun and money from his safe, planning to use it to skip town. Bauer is again approached by Wally to set up a meeting between Ficco and Joe; fearing for his life, he agrees. Leo and Bauer meet at a restaurant, where Leo is grabbed by Ficco\u2019s men. In the commotion, Bauer is killed.\nJoe goes out drinking with Doris who rejects his invitation to flee with him, encouraging him to turn himself in and telling him that she loves him. After the two receive the news about Leo and Bauer, Joe rushes to Tucker\u2019s house, where he is meeting with Ficco. Tucker agrees to cut Ficco in on the numbers racket to end the violence, on the condition that Ficco keeps the banks running and the employees from quitting by any means necessary. When Joe arrives, he demands to see Leo, and attacks Ficco when he finds out about the deal. Ficco reveals that he has had Leo killed, dumping his body by the lighthouse. While talking to them, Joe surreptitiously lifts the tapped telephone off of the receiver, allowing the prosecutor\u2019s office to listen in on Ficco confessing to the killings of Bauer and Leo. He then breaks the light in Tucker\u2019s office, plunging the room into darkness. Tucker accidentally kills Ficco, and is then killed himself by Joe. Joe goes with Doris to find Leo\u2019s body, before leaving to turn himself over to the police.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nWhen the film was released, the staff at \"Variety\" magazine gave the film a mixed review, praising its production values but panning its focus and \"intrusively\" flowery language:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Force of Evil\" fails to develop the excitement hinted at in the title. Makers apparently couldn't decide on the best way to present an expos\u00e9 of the numbers racket, winding up with neither fish nor fowl as far as hard-hitting racketeer meller is concerned. A poetic, almost allegorical, interpretation keeps intruding on the tougher elements of the plot. This factor adds no distinction and only makes the going tougher ... Garfield, as to be expected, comes through with a performance that gets everything out of the material furnished ... On the technical side, the production fares better than story-wise. The physical mounting is expertly valued; the New York locale shots give authenticity; and lensing by George Barnes, while a bit on the arty side, displays skilled craftsmanship.\nBosley Crowther, the film critic for \"The New York Times\", liked the film, and wrote, \"But for all its unpleasant nature, it must be said that this film is a dynamic crime-and-punishment drama, brilliantly and broadly realized. Out of material and ideas that have been worked over time after time, so that they've long since become stale and hackneyed, it gathers suspense and dread, a genuine feeling of the bleakness of crime and a terrible sense of doom. And it catches in eloquent tatters of on-the-wing dialogue moving intimations of the pathos of hopeful lives gone wrong.\"\nWrote film historian Andrew Sarris in 1968, \"\"Force of Evil\" stands up under repeated viewings as one of the great films of the modern American cinema and Garfield's taxicab scene with Beatrice Pearson takes away some of the luster Kazan's Brando-Steiger \"tour de force\" in \"On the Waterfront\".\" Eddie Muller, writing about Polonsky, pointed out that \"he was one of the first Hollywood filmmakers to attempt a form of cinematic poetry, using imagery, dialogue, and narration in three-part harmony. Revelatory speeches erupt almost unconsciously from the characters. Scenes are composed with the melancholy of Edward Hopper paintings. The editing is often daringly abrupt. Despite the bleakness at the film's core, the story-telling was fueled by creative adrenaline.\"\nIn the decades since its release \"Force of Evil\" has been recognized by some as a high point of the film noir genre, powerful in its poetic images and language, by such film critics and historians such as William S. Pechter and Andrew Dickos. Its influence has been acknowledged many times by Martin Scorsese in the making of his crime dramas.\nBox-office.\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $948,000 in the US and $217,000 overseas.\nAccolades.\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\nPreservation.\n\"Force of Evil\" was preserved and restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Restoration provided by The Packard Humanities Institute. The restoration premiered at the UCLA Festival of Preservation in 2022.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is adapted from the 1927 play \"Frankenstein: An Adventure in the Macabre\" by Peggy Webling, which in turn was based on Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\". The Webling play was adapted by John L. Balderston, while the screenplay was written by Garrett Fort and Francis Edward Faragoh, with uncredited contributions from Robert Florey and John Russell.\n\"Frankenstein\" stars Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein, an obsessed scientist who digs up corpses with his assistant to assemble a living being from body parts. The resulting creature, often known as Frankenstein's monster, is portrayed by Boris Karloff. The makeup for the monster was provided by Jack Pierce. Alongside Clive and Karloff, the film's cast also includes Mae Clarke, John Boles, Dwight Frye, and Edward Van Sloan.\nProduced and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film was a commercial success upon release, and was generally well received by both critics and audiences. It spawned a number of sequels and spin-offs, and has had a significant impact on popular culture: the imagery of a maniacal \"mad\" scientist with a hunchbacked assistant and the film's depiction of Frankenstein's monster have since become iconic. In 1991, the United States Library of Congress selected \"Frankenstein\" for preservation in the National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nIn a village of the Bavarian Alps, Henry Frankenstein and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz piece together a human body. Some of the parts are from freshly buried bodies, others from recently hanged criminals. Henry desires to create a human, giving this body life through electrical devices. He still needs a brain for his creation. Henry's former teacher Dr. Waldman shows his class the brain of an average human being and the corrupted brain of a criminal for comparison. Henry sends Fritz to steal the healthy brain from Waldman's class. Fritz accidentally damages it, and so brings Henry the criminal brain.\nHenry's fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth Lavenza speaks with their friend Victor about the scientist's peculiar actions and his seclusion. Elizabeth and Victor ask Waldman for help understanding Henry's behavior, and Waldman reveals he is aware Henry wishes to create life. Concerned for Henry, they arrive at his lab just as he makes his final preparations, the lifeless body on an operating table. As a storm rages, Henry invites Elizabeth and the others to watch. Henry and Fritz raise the operating table toward an opening at the top of the tower. The creature and Henry's equipment are exposed to the lightning storm and empowered, bringing the creature to life. Henry is ecstatic at the sight of the creature moving and has to be restrained by Victor and Waldman. Henry proclaims he now knows what it feels like to be God.\nFrankenstein's Monster, despite its grotesque form, seems to be an innocent, childlike creation. Henry welcomes it into his laboratory and asks it to sit. He opens up the roof, causing the Monster to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the Monster. Its fright is mistaken by Henry and Waldman for an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. Hearing Fritz screaming in the dungeon, Henry and Waldman find that the Monster has hanged Fritz. The Monster lunges at the two but they lock it inside. Realizing the Monster must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and Waldman injects the drug into the Monster's back, rendering it unconscious.\nHenry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry's father take him home. There, he eventually recovers and prepares for his wedding, while Waldman examines the Monster. As he prepares to vivisect it, the Monster revives and strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape, encountering a farmer's child, Maria. She asks him to play a game with her in which they toss flowers onto a lake. The Monster enjoys the game, but when he runs out of flowers, he throws Maria into the lake, inadvertently drowning her.\nWith preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. Victor rushes in, saying that Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the Monster. The Monster enters Elizabeth's room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth in shock, then unconscious. The Monster has escaped.\nMaria's father arrives, carrying his drowned daughter's body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form a lynch mob to capture the Monster. During the search, Henry is attacked by the Monster. The Monster knocks Henry unconscious and carries him to an old windmill. The peasants hear the creature carrying Henry and find it climbing to the top, dragging Henry with it. The Monster hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the wooden blades of the windmill, saving his life. Some of the villagers bring him home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, with the Monster trapped inside.\nAt Castle Frankenstein, Henry's father celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.\nProduction.\nIn 1930, Universal Studios had lost $2.2\u00a0million in revenues. Within 48 hours of its opening at New York's Roxy Theatre on February 12, 1931, \"Dracula\" starring Bela Lugosi had sold 50,000 tickets, building a momentum that culminated in a $700,000 profit, the largest of Universal's 1931 releases. As a result, the head of production, Carl Laemmle Jr., announced immediate plans for more horror films. It purchased the film rights to John L. Balderston's planned stage adaptation of Peggy Webling's British stage adaptation of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's original novel.\nImmediately following his success in \"Dracula\", Lugosi had hoped to play Henry Frankenstein in Universal's original film concept. However, the actor was expected by producer Carl Laemmle Jr. to play the Monster (a common move for a contract player in a film studio at the time) to keep his famous name on the bill.\n\"Frankenstein\" was also inspired by \"The Golem\", a surreal novel based on Jewish folklore, and its film adaptation, \"\" a silent horror film where the Golem is a literal being rather than the ambiguous existence it was in the novel.\nAlthough Lugosi's departure from the production is often regarded as one of the worst decisions in any actor's career, in actuality, the part that Lugosi was offered was not the same character that Karloff eventually played. The initial director was Robert Florey, who had re-characterized the Monster as a simple killing machine, without a touch of human interest or pathos, unlike in the original Shelley novel. This reportedly caused Lugosi to complain, \"I was a star in my country and I will not be a scarecrow over here!\" Florey later wrote that \"the Hungarian actor didn't show himself very enthusiastic for the role and didn't want to play it\". However, the decision may not have been Lugosi's in any case, since recent evidence suggests that he was kicked off the project, along with director Robert Florey, when the newly arrived James Whale asked for the property and later cast Karloff, who resembled Whale.\nActors who worked on the project either were, or shortly became familiar to the fans of the Universal horror films. These included Frederick Kerr as the old Baron Frankenstein, Henry's father; Lionel Belmore as Herr Vogel, the B\u00fcrgermeister; Marilyn Harris as Little Maria, the girl the Monster accidentally kills; Dwight Frye as Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant, Fritz; and Michael Mark as Ludwig, Maria's father.\nKenneth Strickfaden designed the electrical effects that were used in the \"creation scene\". They were so successful that such effects came to be considered an essential part of every subsequent Universal film involving Frankenstein's Monster. Accordingly, the equipment used to produce them has come to be referred to in fan circles as \"Strickfadens\". It appears that Strickfaden managed to secure the use of at least one Tesla Coil built by the inventor Nikola Tesla himself.\nThe film opened in New York City at the Mayfair Theatre on December 4, 1931, and grossed $53,000 in one week.\nFlorey and Lugosi were given the \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1932) project as a consolation. Lugosi would later go on to play Frankenstein's Monster in \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" a decade later, when his career was in decline (in the original shooting script the Monster spoke, cancelling Lugosi's initial objection to the part, but his filmed dialogue sequences were cut prior to release, along with the premise that the Monster was blind, which was the way Lugosi had played it).\nPre-Code era scenes and censorship history.\nThe scene in which the Monster throws Maria, the little girl, into the lake and accidentally drowns her has long been controversial. Upon its original 1931 release, the second part of this scene was cut by state censorship boards in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York. Those states also objected to a line they considered blasphemous that occurred during Frankenstein's exuberance when he first learns that his creature is alive. The original relevant passage was:\nVICTOR: \"Henry, in the name of God!\"&lt;br&gt;\nHENRY: \"In the name of God? Now I know what it feels like to BE God!\"\nKansas requested the cutting of 32 scenes which, if they had been removed, would have cut half of the film. Jason Joy of the Studio Relations Committee sent censor representative Joseph Breen to urge them to reconsider. Eventually, an edited version was released in Kansas.\nAs with many pre-Code films that were reissued after strict enforcement of the Production Code in 1934, Universal made cuts from the original camera negative, and thus most of the excised footage is often lost. However, the scene of the girl being thrown into the lake was rediscovered during the early 1980s in the collection of the British National Film Archive, and it has been restored to modern prints of the film.\nIn the Irish Free State, the film was banned on February 5, 1932, for being demoralizing and unsuitable for children or \"nervous people\" \u2013 age-restricted certificates were not introduced in the country until 1965. The decision was overturned by the Appeal Board on March 8, and the film was passed uncut on March 9. The film was successfully banned in Northern Ireland, Quebec, Sweden, Italy, and Czechoslovakia.\nReception.\n\"The New York Times\" film critic Mordaunt Hall gave \"Frankenstein\" a very positive review. He said that the film \"aroused so much excitement at the Mayfair yesterday that many in the audience laughed to cover their true feelings. [T]here is no denying that it is far and away the most effective thing of its kind. Beside it \"Dracula\" is tame and, incidentally, \"Dracula\" was produced by the same firm\".\n\"Film Daily\" also lauded the picture, calling it a \"gruesome, chill-producing and exciting drama\" that was \"produced intelligently and lavishly and with a grade of photography that is superb\".\n\"Variety\" reported that it \"looks like a \"Dracula\" plus, touching a new peak in horror plays\", and described Karloff's performance as \"a fascinating acting bit of mesmerism\". Its review also singled out the look of the film as uniquely praiseworthy, calling the photography \"splendid\" and the lighting \"the last word in ingenuity, since much of the footage calls for dim or night effect and the manipulation of shadows to intensify the ghostly atmosphere\".\nJohn Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" was less enthused, calling the film only a \"moderate success\" and writing that \"the makeup department has a triumph to its credit in the monster and there lie the thrills of the picture, but the general fantasy lacks the vitality which that little Mrs. P.B. Shelley was able to give her book\".\nThe film was banned in China due to falling under the category of \"superstitious films\" as a result of its \"strangeness\" and unscientific elements.\n\"Frankenstein\" has continued to receive acclaim from critics and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1931, as well as one of the greatest movies of all time. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 95 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Still unnerving to this day, \"Frankenstein\" adroitly explores the fine line between genius and madness, and features Boris Karloff's legendary, frightening performance as the monster.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 91 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating .\nIn 1991, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". In 2004, \"The New York Times\" placed the film on its \"Best 1000 Movies Ever\" list.\n\"Frankenstein\" also received recognition from the American Film Institute. It was named the 87th greatest movie of all time on \"100 Years... 100 Movies\". The line \"It's alive! It's alive!\" was ranked as the 49th greatest movie quote in American cinema. The film was on the ballot for several of AFI's \"100 series\" lists, including AFI's \"10 Top 10\" for the sci-fi category, \"100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)\", and twice on \"100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains\" for both Henry Frankenstein and the Monster in the villains category.\nThe film was ranked number 56 on AFI's \"100 Years... 100 Thrills\", a list of America's most heart-pounding movies. It was also ranked number 27 on Bravo's \"100 Scariest Movie Moments\". Additionally, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 14th scariest film ever made.\nBox office.\nThe film was a commercial success. In June 1932, the film had earned reported rentals of $1.4\u00a0million. In 1943, Universal reported it had earned a profit of $708,871. By 1953, all the Frankenstein re-releases earned an estimated profit of $12\u00a0million.\nHome media.\nIn 1986, MCA Home Video released \"Frankenstein\" on LaserDisc. This release restored all the cut footage, as well as most of Frankenstein's \"In the name of God!\" line. In the 1990s, MCA/Universal Home Video released the film on VHS as part of the \"Universal Monsters Classic Collection\", a series of releases of Universal Classic Monsters films.\nIn 1999, Universal released \"Frankenstein\" on VHS and DVD as part of the \"Classic Monster Collection\"; this release restored the rest of the censored material. In April 2004, Universal released \"Frankenstein: The Legacy Collection\" on DVD as part of the \"Universal Legacy Collection\". This two-disc release includes \"Frankenstein\", \"Bride of Frankenstein\", \"Son of Frankenstein\", \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" and \"The House of Frankenstein\". In September 2006, Universal released \"Frankenstein\" on DVD as a two-disc \"75th Anniversary Edition\", as part of the \"Universal Legacy Series\".\nIn 2012, \"Frankenstein\" was released on Blu-ray as part of the \"Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection\" box set, which also includes a total of nine films from the Universal Classic Monsters series. In September 2013, \"Frankenstein\" received a standalone Blu-ray release. That same year, \"Frankenstein\" was included as part of the six-film Blu-ray set \"Universal Classic Monsters Collection\", which also includes \"Dracula\", \"The Mummy\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"Bride of Frankenstein\", and \"The Wolf Man\". The next year, Universal released \"Frankenstein: Complete Legacy Collection\" on DVD. This set contains eight films: \"Frankenstein\", \"Bride of Frankenstein\", \"Son of Frankenstein\", \"Ghost of Frankenstein\", \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\", \"The House of Frankenstein\", \"House of Dracula\", and \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\". In 2015, the six-film \"Universal Classic Monsters Collection\" was released on DVD. In 2016, \"Frankenstein\" received a Walmart-exclusive Blu-ray release featuring a glow-in-the-dark cover. That same year, the \"Complete Legacy Collection\" was released on Blu-ray. In September 2017, the film received a Best Buy-exclusive SteelBook Blu-ray release with cover artwork by Alex Ross.\n\"Frankenstein\" and its sequels were included in the \"Universal Classic Monsters: Complete 30-Film Collection\" Blu-ray box set in August 2018. This box set also received a DVD release. Later in October, \"Frankenstein\" was included as part of a limited edition Best Buy-exclusive Blu-ray set titled \"Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection\", which features artwork by Alex Ross. Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 5, 2021.\nSequels.\n\"Frankenstein\" was followed by a string of sequels, beginning with \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), in which Elsa Lanchester plays the Monster's bride.\nThe next sequel, \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939), was made, like all those that followed, without Whale or Clive (the latter of whom had died in 1937). This film featured Karloff's last full film performance as the Monster. \"Son of Frankenstein\" presented Basil Rathbone as Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, Bela Lugosi as bearded hunchback Ygor, and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh.\n\"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" was released in 1942. The film features Lon Chaney Jr. as the Monster, taking over from Boris Karloff, who played the role in the first three films of the series, and Bela Lugosi in his second appearance as the demented Ygor.\nThe fifth installment, \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,\" was released in 1943, directed by Roy William Neill and starring Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein's monster. This is also the sequel to \"The Wolf Man\", with Lon Chaney Jr. returning as the Wolf Man.\nIn the follow-up, \"House of Frankenstein\" (1944), Karloff returned to the series, but not to reprise his role as the monster but as the Mad Doctor; the monster was this time portrayed by Glenn Strange. Chaney Jr. returned as the Wolf Man. Dracula was also featured in the film, played by John Carradine.\nIts sequel, \"House of Dracula\" (1945), featured the same three monsters\u2014Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man\u2014with the same cast in their portrayals.\nMany of the subsequent films which featured Frankenstein's monster demote the creature to a robotic henchman in someone else's plots, such as in its final Universal film appearance in the deliberately farcical \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948) as well as the aforementioned \"House of Frankenstein\" and \"House of Dracula\".\nOther adaptations.\nFrankenstein's assistant.\nAlthough Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant is often referred to as \"Igor\" in descriptions of the films, he is not so called in the earliest films. In both \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\", Frankenstein has an assistant, who is played both times by Dwight Frye, who is disabled. In the original 1931 film the character is named \"Fritz\"; he is hunchbacked and walks with the aid of a small cane. Fritz did not originate from the \"Frankenstein\" novel, and instead originated from the earliest recorded play adaptation, \"Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein\", where he was played by Robert Keeley.\nIn \"Bride of Frankenstein\", Frye plays \"Karl\", a murderer who stands upright but has a lumbering metal brace on both legs that can be heard clicking loudly with every step. Both characters would be killed by Karloff's monster in their respective films. Frye also appears in later films in the series, such as in \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" (1943).\nThe genesis of the scene in which Frankenstein's assistant Fritz drops a jar labeled \"normal brain\" and replaces it with a brain in a jar labeled \"abnormal brain\" is believed to be based on the fate of Walt Whitman's brain at the American Anthropometric Society. Whitman had donated his brain after his death to the society for analysis to correlate intelligence with brain size. A 1907 paper by Edward Anthony Spitzka on the society's brain collection caused a minor sensation when it revealed that Whitman's brain had been accidentally destroyed when a \"careless assistant\" dropped the jar it was stored in. This story element was not present in the original 1818 Mary Shelley novel.\nIt was not until \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939) that a character called \"Ygor\" first appears, here played by Bela Lugosi and revived by Lugosi in \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" (1942) after his apparent murder in the earlier film. This character \u2013 a deranged blacksmith whose neck was broken and twisted due to a botched hanging \u2013 befriends the monster and later helps Dr. Wolf Frankenstein, leading to the \"hunchbacked assistant\" called \"Igor\" commonly associated with \"Frankenstein\" in popular culture. Regarding \"Son of Frankenstein\", the film's director Rowland V. Lee said his crew let Lugosi \"work on the characterization; the interpretation he gave us was imaginative and totally unexpected ... when we finished shooting, there was no doubt in anyone's mind that he stole the show. Karloff's monster was weak by comparison\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Forms that avoid this confusion include: \nConfusion between the numeral 0 and the letter O can also be resolved by using a script letter O (with a loop at the top).\nThe numeral 1: This numeral is sometimes written with a serif at the top extending downward and to the left. People in some parts of Europe extend this stroke nearly the whole distance to the baseline. It is sometimes written with a horizontal serif at the base; without the serif it can resemble the shape of the numeral \"7\", which has a near-vertical stroke without a crossbar, and a shorter horizontal top stroke. This numeral is often written as a plain vertical line without an ear at the top; this form is easily confused with a capital I, a lower-case L, a Roman 50 and a vertical bar |.\nThe numeral 2: In the U.S., Germany and Austria, a curly version used to be taught and is still used by many in handwriting. This too can be confused with a capital script Q, or the letter Z. It appears as \u0a68.\nThe numeral 3: This numeral is sometimes written with a flat top, similar to the character \u01b7 (ezh). This form is sometimes used to prevent people from fraudulently changing a three into an eight (but introduces the potential for confusion with ezh or with cursive Z).\nThe numeral 4: Some people leave the top \"open\": all the lines are either vertical or horizontal, as in a seven-segment display. This makes it easier to distinguish from the numeral \"9\". Whether the horizontal bar terminates at or crosses the right vertical bar is insignificant in the West, but to be distinguished from certain Chinese characters (particularly \u4e29), it must cross.\nThe numeral 5: In Taiwan, the left vertical bar is extended upwards as a long stem. If this is slanted, the overall figure may more closely resemble an uppercase \"Y\". If casually written it can be confused with the letter S.\nThe numeral 6: Can be confused with a letter capital \"G\", or the lowercase \"b\", or the nine if inverted. In situations where the number 6 may appear at various angles (such as on billiard balls, some styles of playing cards and dice), it can be underlined (appearing as \"6\") or followed by a full stop (appearing as \"6.\") to indicate the proper viewing angle to disambiguate between \"6\" and \"9\"; a \"9\" may or may not appear with similar underlining or full stop (as \"9\" or \"9.\"). It can also be written with a straight line rather than a right-curling ascender on top, appearing as \"b\".\nThe numeral 7: The traditional form found in copperplate penmanship begins with a serif at the upper left and has a wavy horizontal stroke (like a swash). In East Asian countries (Korea, China and Japan), this numeral is commonly written with such a serif, but no swash and no crossbar through the middle. It is usually written with just two strokes, the top horizontal and the (usually angled) vertical. A short horizontal bar is sometimes used to cross the vertical in the middle, to distinguish the seven from a numeral one, especially in cultures (such as French) that write \"1\" with a very long upstroke. This form is used commonly throughout continental Europe, parts of the United States and frequently in Australia. In Taiwan two horizontal bars are sometimes used, although an extra-long serif is the feature which most clearly distinguishes \"7\" from \"1\". When the cross is added in the center it can cause confusion with a script capital \"F\".\nThe numeral 8: Some people write this numeral like two circles. Other people write this numeral in one continuous motion, which makes it look like two tear drops or a sideways lemniscate.\nThe numeral 9: In parts of Europe, this numeral is written with the vertical ending in a hook at the bottom. This version resembles how the lowercase codice_1 is commonly written (). Elsewhere the usual shape is to draw the vertical straight to the baseline. A nine may or may not appear with underlining or full stop (as \"9\" or \"9.\") in order to avoid confusion with \"6\". In China, southern Taiwan, and South Korea, the nine is sometimes written with the loop to the right of the stick, resembling a capital \"P\" or Greek lowercase letter \u03c1.\nThe Latin writing system.\nThe lowercase letter a: This letter is often handwritten as the single-storey \"\u0251\" (a circle and a vertical line adjacent to the right of the circle) instead of the double-storey \"a\" found in many fonts. (See: )\nThe lowercase letter g: In Polish, this letter is often rendered with a straight descender without a hook or loop. This effectively means that a handwritten g looks much like a q in other writing traditions. The letter q, which is only used in foreign words and is extremely rare, is then disambiguated from g by adding a serif (often undulated) extending to the right from the bottom tip of the descender.\nThe lowercase letter k: Some people write this letter with a loop ().\nThe lowercase letter p: The French way of writing this character has a half-way ascender as the vertical extension of the descender, which also does not complete the bowl at the bottom. In early Finnish writing, the curve to the bottom was omitted, thus the resulting letter resembled an \"n\" with a descender (like \ua783).\nThe lowercase letter q: In block letters, some Europeans like to cross the descender to prevent confusion with the numeral \"9\", which also can be written with a straight stem. In North America the descender often ends with a hook curving up to the right (). In Polish, the lowercase q is disambiguated from \"g\" by a serif extending from the bottom tip of the descender to the right.\nThe lowercase letter s: See long s.\nThe lowercase letters u and v: These letters have a common origin and were once written according to the location in the word rather than the sound. The v came first; the u originally had a loop extending to the left and was only used to start words. All other locations for either u or v were written with the latter.\nThe uppercase letter I: This letter is often written with one stroke on the top of the letter and one on the bottom. This distinguishes it from the lowercase letter l, and the numeral 1, which is often written as a straight line without the ear.\nThe uppercase letter J: In Germany, this letter is often written with a long stroke to the left at the top. This is to distinguish it from the capital letter \"I\".\nThe uppercase letter S: In Japan, this letter is often written with a single serif added to the end of the stroke.\nThe uppercase letter Z: This letter is usually written with three strokes. In parts of Europe such as Italy, Germany and Spain, it is commonly written with a short horizontal crossbar added through the middle. This version is sometimes preferred in mathematics to help distinguish it from the numeral \"2\". In Polish, the character \u01b5 is used as an allographic variant of the letter \u017b. In Japan it is often written with a short diagonal crossbar through the middle (). In France, it is often written with a loop at the bottom.\nThe lowercase letter z: In the cursive style used in the United States and most Australian states (excluding South Australia), this letter is written as an ezh (\u0292).\nThe parts of Europe that add a crossbar to the uppercase \u27e8Z\u27e9 may also use it the lowercase version.\nand script.\nGerman and its modernized 20th-century school version , the form of handwriting taught in schools and generally used in Germany and Austria until it was banned by the Nazis in 1941, was very different from that used in other European countries. However, it was generally only used for German words. Any foreign words included in the text would usually be written in the \"normal\" script, which was called the (Latin script) in German.\nSlant.\nSlant is the predominant angle of the downward stroke in handwriting based on Latin script. The slant of a sample of writing is a feature of many regional handwriting variations, and also a reflection of the copybook that is taught.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73494", "revid": "50941504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73494", "title": "Freaks (1932 film)", "text": "1932 American horror film by Tod Browning\nFreaks (also re-released as The Monster Story, Forbidden Love, and Nature's Mistakes) is a 1932 American drama and horror film from the pre-Code era produced and directed by Tod Browning, starring Wallace Ford, Leila Hyams, Olga Baclanova, and Roscoe Ates.\n\"Freaks\", originally intended as a vehicle for Lon Chaney, is set amongst the backdrop of a travelling French circus and follows a conniving trapeze artist who joins a group of carnival sideshow performers with a plan to seduce and murder a dwarf in the troupe to gain his inheritance. However, her plot proves to have dangerous consequences. The film is based on elements from the short story \"Spurs\" by Tod Robbins, first published in \"Munsey's Magazine\" in February 1923, with the rights being purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Cedric Gibbons, a childhood friend of Robbins and MGM art department chief, was responsible for the purchase.\nFilmed in Los Angeles in the fall of 1931, some employees at MGM were discomforted by the presence of the actors portraying the \"freaks\" on set, and, other than the so-called more normal looking \"freaks\", the conjoined twins and the Earles, the performers were not allowed to be on the studio lot, relegated instead to a specially-built tent. The film had test screenings in January 1932, with many members of the audience reacting negatively, finding the film too grotesque. In response to this, MGM executive Irving Thalberg, without consent of director Browning, edited the original 90-minute feature, which was significantly cut, with additional alternate footage incorporated to help increase the running time. The final abridged cut of the film, released in February 1932, was 64 minutes; the original version no longer exists.\n\"Freaks\" made its world premiere at the Fox Theatre in San Diego, shown in full, without the subsequent cuts from January 28 and had a successful run. The theatre advertised the fact that it was the only place where the movie could be seen in the \"original uncensored version\".\nDespite the cuts made to the film, \"Freaks\" still garnered notice for the portrayal of its eponymous characters by people who worked as sideshow performers and had real disabilities. These cast members included dwarf siblings Harry and Daisy Earles; Johnny Eck, who had sacral agenesis; the conjoined twin sisters Daisy and Violet Hilton; and Schlitzie, a man with microcephaly. Because of its controversial content, the film was banned in the United Kingdom for over 30 years, and was labelled as \"brutal and grotesque\" in Canada.\nThough it received critical backlash and was a box-office failure upon initial release, \"Freaks\" was subject to public and critical reappraisal in the 1960s, as a long forgotten Hollywood classic, particularly in Europe, and was screened at the 1962 Venice Film Festival. In retrospect, numerous film critics have suggested that the film presents a starkly sympathetic portrait of its sideshow characters rather than an exploitative one, with Andrew Sarris declaring \"Freaks\" one of the \"most compassionate\" films ever made. Nonetheless, critics have continued to take note of the film's horror elements; in 2009, Joe Morgenstern proclaimed that \"Freaks\" contains some of the most terrifying scenes in film history. Film scholars have interpreted the film as a metaphor for class conflict, reflecting the Great Depression, and it has been studied for its portrayal of people with disabilities, with theorists arguing that it presents an anti-eugenics message. The film has been highly influential, has become a cult classic, and, in 1994, was selected for preservation by the United States National Film Registry, which seeks to preserve films that are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nA beautiful and conniving trapeze artist named Cleopatra seduces a carnival sideshow dwarf named Hans after learning of his large inheritance. This is much to the chagrin of Frieda, his fianc\u00e9e, also a dwarf. Cleopatra also conspires with circus strongman Hercules to kill Hans so she will inherit his wealth. Meanwhile, other romances flourish among the sideshow performers: the Bearded Lady, who is in love with the Human Skeleton, gives birth to their daughter. The news is spread among the friends by the Stork Woman. Additionally, Violet, a conjoined twin whose sister Daisy is married to Roscoe, the stuttering circus clown, becomes engaged to the circus's owner.\nHans, enamored with Cleopatra, ultimately marries her. At their wedding, Cleopatra begins poisoning Hans's wine but drunkenly kisses Hercules in front of Hans, revealing her affair. Oblivious, the other \"freaks\" announce that they accept Cleopatra in spite of her being a \"normal\" outsider; they hold an initiation ceremony in which they pass a loving cup around the table while chanting, \"We accept her, one of us. We accept her, one of us. Gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble.\" However, Cleopatra's mean-spirited amusement at this ceremony soon turns into fear and anger after Hercules jokes that the rest of the entertainers plan to turn her into one of them. She mocks them, tosses the wine in their faces and drives them away before berating Hans and drunkenly parading him around on her shoulders like a child. The humiliated Hans realizes that he has been played for a fool and rejects Cleopatra's attempts to apologize, but then he falls ill from the poison. While bedridden, Hans \"apologizes\" to Cleopatra and also \"takes\" the poisoned medicine that she is giving him, but he secretly plots with the other entertainers to strike back at Cleopatra and Hercules.\nIn the film's climax, Hans confronts Cleopatra with three of the entertainers as backup thugs. However, Hans's circus wagon is overturned in a storm, giving Cleopatra the chance to escape into the forest, closely pursued by them. At the same time, Hercules goes to kill sea lion trainer Venus for knowing about the plot. Venus's boyfriend, Phroso the clown, attempts to stop Hercules but is nearly killed before the rest of them intervene and injure Hercules, saving Phroso. They all pursue an injured Hercules.\nThe freaks then capture Cleopatra and sometime later, she is shown to be a grotesque, squawking \"human duck\" on display for carnival patrons; her tongue has been removed, one eye has been gouged out, the flesh of her hands has been melted and deformed to look like duck feet, her legs have been cut off, and what is left of her torso has been permanently tarred and feathered. In the original version of the film, it is revealed that after the freaks caught Hercules, they made him into a castrato singer.\nWhile some versions end on Cleopatra as the human duck, another ending shows Hans, now living in a mansion from his inheritance and still humiliated, visited by Phroso, Venus and Frieda. Frieda tells Hans she knows he just wanted to demand the bottle of poison from Cleopatra, not to mutilate her, and not to blame himself for what happened; and that she still loves him. The two then share a heartwarming hug.\nAnalysis and themes.\nClass conflict.\nFilm critic Melvin Matthews has interpreted \"Freaks\" within the context of the Great Depression, writing that it \"is essentially a story of the little people (average Americans) versus the big people (the rich and businessmen). The film makes it clear that the big people, personified by Cleopatra and Hercules, scorn the Freaks. Such a disdainful attitude was reflected in the real-life social outlook of some business tycoons during the Depression.\" Film studies academic Jennifer Peterson similarly identifies \"Freaks\" as an example of an \"outsider film\". Historian Jane Nicholas suggests that the film's conclusion, in which the circus performers mutilate Cleopatra whilst chanting \"one of us\", is reinforcing the freaks' social currency: \"It is interesting that a statement that reads as one of inclusion is often cited as one that embodies horror in the film. What does it mean to be 'one of us'? The chilling horror of the chant 'one of us' reveals why the freak show persists.\"\nIn the book \"Midnight Movies\" (1991), critics J. Hoberman and Jonathan Rosenbaum compare \"Freaks\" to \"Gold Diggers of 1933\", writing that the former is \"almost literally dealing with the same thing [class disparity]...but more directly\u2014because the end product isn't just putting on a show, but slaves breaking their chains and triumphing over their masters. \"Freaks\" is asking a Depression audience to identify not with the Beautiful People, but with sideshow mutations, a total underclass.\"\nJohn Stanley, longtime publisher of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", describes the film as \"A Classic of the Grotesque\" in \"Creature Features\".\nDisability and eugenics.\nThe film's depiction of people with disabilities has been a significant point of analysis amongst film critics and scholars. In his book \"Subversive Horror Cinema: Countercultural Messages of Films from Frankenstein to the Present\" (2014), critic Jon Towlson proposes that \"Freaks\" exemplifies an anti-eugenics sentiment. In presenting this idea, Towlson cites vignette sequences that make up the beginning of the film, largely consisting of the freaks in the context of their sideshow, before Browning \"begins to undercut the voyeuristic aspects of the traditional freakshow by showing the freaks engaged in the activities of everyday life, dispelling the initial shock and revulsion, and encouraging the viewer to see the freaks as individuals who have overcome their disabilities.\"\nTowlson also notes that the freaks' everyday interactions with the able-bodied sideshow performers, such as Phroso, Roscoe, and Venus, who treat the freaks as equals and friends, further blurs the distinction between the able-bodied and disabled members of the circus, and that the physically beautiful characters\u2014such as trapeze artist Cleopatra\u2014are the ones who are vindictive, supremacist, and immoral. He further argues that the implied sexuality in the film\u2014such as the implication that the conjoined twin sisters (played by Daisy and Violet Hilton) carry on their own separate sex lives\u2014is an affront to the eugenic stance against reproduction and sexual activity among the \"physically unfit.\" Towlson ultimately concludes that this subversion of character exemplifies a stark opposition to the core belief of eugenics, which is that physical appearance is equated with internal worth.\nAngela Smith, a scholar of film and disability, similarly notes that \"Freaks\" presents numerous scenes in which the freaks engage in routine and ordinary domestic behavior. Among them, Smith cites the freaks' celebration of the birth of the Bearded Lady's baby, and the film's key dinner party sequence in which Cleopatra grows enraged when the freaks sing \"We accept her, we accept her, one of us, one of us\" as a welcoming song. Film scholars Martin Norden and Madeleine Cahill, however, question Browning's intention of the film's final revenge sequence, in which the freaks mutilate the able-bodied, morally cruel Cleopatra. \"The implications of the violence against [Cleopatra] are far from clear,\" they write. \"Members of a traditionally disempowered minority use their collective force to disempower a majority member\u2014turn her into one of them, in effect\u2014leading us to wonder if she is truly disempowered or empowered in a new way. Browning's ambiguity on this point only enhances the film's unsettling properties.\"\nStatus as a horror film.\nSome critics, such as John Thomas and Raymond Durgnat, have noted that \"Freaks\" does not fully embody the genre. Thomas wrote in \"Film Quarterly\" that \"Freaks\" would \"disappoint no one but the mindless children who consume most horror films... Certainly it is macabre... But the point is that \"Freaks\" is not really a horror film at all, though it contains some horrifying sequences.\" Durgnat made a similar observation, writing that, like the films of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, its shock value \"mingles with moments which seem shallow, but by the end of the film one begins to catch their mood, a calm, cold combination of guignol and eerily matter-of-fact.\"\nFilm-studies scholar Joan Hawkins describes the evolution of how the film's genre was perceived, noting that it \"started as a mainstream horror film that migrated into the exploitation arena before finally being recuperated as an avant-garde or art project.\" Hawkins notes that Browning inverts the audience's expectations, demonstrating that it is \"the ordinary, the apparently normal, the beautiful which horrify\u2014the monstrous and distorted which compel our respect, our sympathy, ultimately our affection.\" Smith writes that the inclusion of \"Freaks\" within the horror genre \"forces our reconsideration of the genre's status [and] challenges readings in which all horror movies are seen to use monstrous bodies to the same effects.\" Film theorist Eugenie Brinkema suggests that \"Freaks\" functions as a horror film \"not because Cleo is mutilated and Hercules killed, all lightning and dark shadows\u2014no, \"Freaks\" is a horror film because the gaze itself is horrific, because locating the gaze is a work in terror.\"\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) had purchased the rights to Tod Robbins's short story \"Spurs\" in the mid-1920s at Tod Browning's urging for a reported $8,000. Harry Earles, a dwarf who had appeared in Browning's \"The Unholy Three\" (1925)\u2014and who would ultimately star as Hans in \"Freaks\"\u2014had originally proposed the idea of making a film version of \"Spurs\" to Browning. The studio agreed to hire Browning to direct the project based on his past success at Universal Pictures with \"Dracula\" (1931) and for his collaborations with Lon Chaney.\nIn June 1931, MGM production supervisor Irving Thalberg offered Browning the opportunity to direct \"Ars\u00e8ne Lupin\" with John Barrymore. Browning declined, preferring to develop \"Freaks\", a project he had started as early as 1927; Browning had worked with a traveling carnival prior to becoming a filmmaker. Screenwriters Willis Goldbeck and Elliott Clawson were assigned to the project at Browning's request. Leon Gordon, Edgar Allan Woolf, Al Boasberg and an uncredited Charles MacArthur would also contribute to the script. The script was shaped over five months. Little of the original story was retained beyond the marriage between a dwarf and an average-sized woman and their wedding feast, and the setting\u2014originally France\u2014was relocated to the United States. Both Thalberg and Harry Rapf served as uncredited co-producers on the film.\nCasting.\nVictor McLaglen was considered for the role of Hercules, while Myrna Loy was initially slated to star as Cleopatra, with Jean Harlow as Venus. Ultimately, Thalberg decided not to cast any major stars in the picture. Instead, Russian actress Olga Baclanova was cast as Cleopatra, based on her success in a Los Angeles-produced stage production of \"The Silent Witness\".\nHarry Earles was cast as Hans, the carnival sideshow performer whom Cleopatra attempts to murder for his estate. Earles' real-life sister, Daisy, portrayed his dwarf love interest, Frieda.\nAmong the supporting characters featured as \"freaks\", casting agent Ben Piazza scoured the East Coast for over a month and put out advertisements for photographs and screen tests, scouting carnivals and sideshows for Browning; amongst others, a girl with \"Elephant skin\", \"a boy with dog legs\", \"a giant\", \"a bunch of pygmies\" and the legendary dwarf performer \"Mega Mite\" didn't make the cut. The cast that would included Peter Robinson (\"The Human Skeleton\"); Olga Roderick (\"The Bearded Lady\"); Frances O'Connor and Martha Morris (\"armless wonders\"); and the conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton. Among the microcephalic characters who appear in the film (and are referred to as \"pinheads\" throughout) were Zip and Pip (Elvira and Jenny Lee Snow) and Schlitzie, a man named Simon Metz who wore a dress.\nAlso featured were the intersex Josephine Joseph, with her left-right divided gender; Johnny Eck, the legless man, who was scouted for the role while performing in Montreal; the completely limbless Prince Randian (also known as The Human Torso and miscredited as \"Rardion\"); Elizabeth Green the Stork Woman; and Koo-Koo the Bird Girl, who had Virchow\u2013Seckel syndrome or bird-headed dwarfism and is most remembered for the scene wherein she dances on the table.\nFilming.\n\"Freaks\" began principal photography in November 1931, with a 24-day shooting schedule. At the time of the production's beginning, the film had a budget of approximately $209,000, though it would eventually expand to more than $300,000. The film was shot on the MGM studio lot in Culver City, California. Baclanova recalled her time first meeting her co-stars on the set:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Tod Browning, I loved him. He say, \"I want to make a picture with you, Olga Baclanova... Now I show you with whom you are going to play. But don't faint.\" I say, \"Why should I faint?\" So he takes me and shows me all the freaks there. First I meet the midget and he adores me because we speak German and he's from Germany. Then he shows me the girl that's like an orangutan; then a man who has a head but no legs, no nothing, just a head and a body like an egg. Then he shows me a boy who walks on his hands because he was born without feet. He shows me little by little and I could not look. I wanted to cry when I saw them. They have such nice faces, but it is so terrible... Now, after we start the picture, I like them all so much.\nDuring the shoot, the film had already begun to draw disgusted reactions, resulting in MGM segregating the film's cast and crew to a separate cafeteria so that \"people could get to eat in the commissary without throwing up.\" Filming was completed on December 16, 1931, and Browning began retakes on December 23.\nRelease.\nIn January 1932, MGM held test screenings of the film, which proved disastrous: Art director Merrill Pye recalled that \"Halfway through the preview, a lot of people got up and ran out. They didn't walk out. They \"ran\" out.\" Others reportedly became ill, or fainted; one woman who attended the screening threatened to sue MGM, claiming the film had caused her to suffer a miscarriage. Due to the extremely unfavorable response, the studio cut the picture down from its original 90-minute running time to just over an hour. Much of the sequence of the circus entertainers attacking Cleopatra as she lies under a lightning-struck tree was removed, as well as a sequence showing Hercules being castrated and made into a castrato, a number of comedy sequences, and most of the film's original epilogue, which included Hercules singing in a falsetto (a reference to his castration) with Cleopatra quacking along. These excised sequences are considered lost. In order to pad the running time after these cuts, a new prologue featuring a carnival barker was added, as was the alternate epilogue featuring the reconciliation of the dwarf lovers.\nThe truncated version\u2014now only 64 minutes long\u2014had its premiere at the Fox Criterion in Los Angeles on February 12, 1932. Regionally, the film attracted controversy upon its theatrical release, and was pulled from screenings in Atlanta. MGM's policy at the time was to not release weak or doubtful films in New York until most of the high spots had been played out of town so did not open there until the summer, opening on July 8, 1932 at the Rialto. In the United Kingdom, the film was banned by the British censors, and remained as so for more than 30 years before being passed with an X rating in August 1963.\nBox office.\n\"Freaks\" was unsuccessful at the box office, grossing $289,000 in the United States, and $52,000 internationally, recording a total loss of $164,000. Though not a financial success, the film had astonishingly variable results with greater earnings in smaller cities such as Cincinnati, Boston, and Saint Paul than it did in larger metropolitan cities such as Los Angeles or Chicago.\nCritical response.\nContemporaneous.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhat about the Siamese twins\u2014have they no right to love? The pin-heads, the half-man, half-woman, the dwarfs! They have the same passions, joys, sorrows, laughter as normal human beings. Is such a subject untouchable?\n\u20131932 press release from MGM responding to accusations that the film exploited its subjects\nDespite the extensive cuts, the film was still negatively received by moviegoers, and remained an object of extreme controversy amongst the public upon initial release. Critics' responses were also divided. MGM attempted to address criticisms of exploitation by promoting the film as one compassionate toward its subjects, with tagline such as \"What about abnormal people? They have their lives, too!\" At the time of its release, the film was regarded by numerous critics as marking the end of Browning's career. \"Freaks\" became the only MGM film ever to be pulled from release before completing its domestic engagements, and it was pulled from distribution after its New York engagements concluded in the summer of 1932. Disillusioned by the backlash the film received, MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer sold the distribution rights to Dwain Esper for a 25-year period for $50,000.\nA number of reviews were not only highly critical of the film, but expressed outrage and revulsion. \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote that \"Any one who considers this entertainment should be placed in the pathological ward in some hospital.\" In \"The Kansas City Star\", John C. Moffitt wrote, \"There is no excuse for this picture. It took a weak mind to produce it and it takes a strong stomach to look at it.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the film an \"outrageous onslaught upon the feelings, the senses, the brains and the stomachs of an audience.\" \"Variety\" also published an unfavorable review, writing that the film was \"sumptuously produced, admirably directed, and no cost was spared, but Metro heads failed to realize that even with a different sort of offering the story is still important. Here the story is not sufficiently strong to get and hold the interest, partly because interest cannot easily be gained for too fantastic a romance.\" The review went on to state that the story \"does not thrill and at the same time does not please, since it is impossible for the normal man or woman to sympathize with the aspiring midget. And only in such a case will the story appeal.\"\nWhile a significant number of reviews were unfavorable, the film was well-received by some: \"The New York Times\" called it \"excellent at times and horrible, in the strict meaning of the word, at others\" as well as \"a picture not to be easily forgotten.\" The \"New York Herald Tribune\" wrote that it was \"obviously an unhealthy and generally disagreeable work,\" but that \"in some strange way, the picture is not only exciting, but even occasionally touching.\" Columnist Louella Parsons wrote an enthusiastic report on the film, noting that \"for pure sensationalism, \"Freaks\" tops any pictures yet produced... In \"Freaks\" there are monstrosities such as never before have been known. If you are normal go and see them for yourself, if not, well, use your own judgment.\"\nJohn Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote a favorable review, calling it \"a little gem\" that \"stands in a class by itself, and probably won't be forgotten in a hurry by those who see it.\" He found its \"perfectly plausible story\" a key to the effectiveness of its horror, writing that \"It's a chilling notion to imagine these weird beings, with their own lives and vanities and passions, all allied in a bitter enmity against us.\" Addressing the controversial subject matter, Mosher stated: \"if the poor things themselves can be displayed in the basement of Madison Square Garden, pictures of them might as well be shown in the Rialto. They may hereafter even be regarded in the flesh with a new dread bordering on respect.\"\nRetrospective.\nIn the mid/late 20th century, \"Freaks\" began to garner critical reassessment after developing a cult following in Europe, and was subject to renewed praise by critics and audiences. The film's growing popularity abroad led to a renewed interest in it among American audiences, and it was subject of a retrospective review in \"Film Quarterly\" by John Thomas in 1964, in which he deemed it \"a minor masterpiece.\"\nCritic Kim Newman suggests that the film's warmer reception amongst mid/late-20th-century audiences was partly due to the term \"freak\" having taken on a more positive connotation, as something to be celebrated rather than reviled; Newman also adds that the film \"shows obvious fondness for its carny cast.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\"'s Mark Chalon Smith declared in a 1995 retrospective review: \"\"Freaks\" is a wild ride, but it's not the monster-trip some say it is. It is macabre and disturbing, but Browning chose to humanize the deformed characters at the movie's shadowy center, not to demonize them.\" Nonetheless, the film has still been noted for its stark horror imagery in the 21st century, with Joe Morgenstern writing in 2009 that it boasts \"some of the most terrifying scenes ever consigned to film.\" Jamie Russell of the BBC similarly observed in 2002: \"It's easy to see why reactions to the film have been so strong\u2014it's a catalogue of the abnormal, the bizarre, and the grotesque that's still as unsettling today as it was 70 years ago.\"\nFilm critic Mark Kermode awarded the film four out of five stars in a 2015 review, noting that, \"today, Browning's sympathies are clear; if there are 'freaks' on display here, they are not the versatile performers to whom the title seems to allude.\" Film theorist and critic Andrew Sarris echoed this sentiment, proclaiming \"Freaks\" \"one of the most compassionate films ever made.\" Ed Gonzalez of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote in a 2003 retrospective that the film's moral significance has often been obscured by critical attention to its more shocking elements, noting that this \"seriously underplay[s] the film's blistering humanity and the audacious aesthetic and philosophical lengths to which Browning goes to challenge the way we define beauty and abnormality.\"\nAs of 2021[ [update]], \"Freaks\" holds an approval rating of 94% on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 53 reviews, and boasts an average rating of 8.48/10. Its consensus reads, \"Time has been kind to this horror legend: \"Freaks\" manages to frighten, shock, and even touch viewers in ways that contemporary viewers missed.\"\nHome media.\n\"Freaks\" was first issued on Beta, VHS, and LaserDisc by MGM/UA Home Video in 1986, and was rereleased on VHS by MGM/UA Home Video in 1990. MGM/UA then issued a remastered LaserDisc in 1993. David J. Skal, a documentary entitled Freaks: The Sideshow Cinema, and a shorter documentary on the film\u2019s various alternate endings. This disc went out of print in 2016. Interviews include film sideshow performers and film historians Todd Robbins and Johnny Meah, and sideshow performer Jennifer Miller and actors Mark Povinelli and Jerry Maren\nFilms Around The World (FAT-W) released \"Freaks\" on DVD in 2016, and Frolic Pictures released Freaks on a double feature DVD with Browning\u2019s 1931 film \"Dracula\" in 2018. However, neither of these discs were authorized releases of either film.\nIn 2023, The Criterion Collection announced the release of Tod Browning\u2019s \"Sideshow Shockers\", a set which contains new 2K restorations of \"Freaks\", \"The Unknown\" and \"The Mystic\". It was released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2023. David J. Skal recorded a new commentary for this release of \"Freaks\". The Criterion release features all of the extras included in the original Warner DVD Home Video release, in addition to an audio recording of David J. Skal reading Tod Robbins' \"Spurs,\" film stills, a segment called \"One of Us: Portraits From Freaks,\" an episode from critic Kristen Lopez's podcast on the film's disability representation, and a booklet containing photos, credits, and critical essays.\nLegacy.\n\"Freaks\" is now widely considered among director Browning's best films. The film's growing esteem among critics traces back to the early 1960s, when it was rediscovered as a counterculture cult film, particularly among European audiences. It was screened at the 1962 Venice Film Festival, and shortly after was shown for the first time in the United Kingdom, having been banned there since 1932. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the film was regularly shown at midnight movie screenings in the United States. It also enjoyed a critical reappraisal in France during this period, as, according to Hawkins, Browning had achieved a \"certain Poe-esque stature among French intellectuals.\" Critic Derek Malcolm noted in 1999 that the film is \"one of the masterpieces of baroque cinema,\" and a \"damning antidote to the cult of physical perfection and an extraordinary tribute to the community of so-called freaks who made up its cast.\"\nIn 1994, \"Freaks\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, which preserves \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" films. Film scholar Jennifer Peterson cites \"Freaks\" as one of the 50 most important American films ever made. In a 2018 retrospective on Browning's career, Martyn Conterio of the British Film Institute assesses the film as \"best approached with a fuller understanding of Browning's work, specifically, the director's emotionally complicated interest in human abnormality and the severely disabled,\" and considers it among Browning's films that \"are pioneering and boundary-pushing, amounting to repeat attacks on Hollywood's standardised images of beauty and glamour.\" It is also listed in the film reference book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\", which says \"No mere plot summary can do justice to this alarming yet profound movie, which truly must be seen to be believed. It is a supreme oddity (freak?) of world cinema considered by many to be the most remarkable film in the career of a director whose credits include the original version of \"Dracula\" (1931).\"\nSeveral sequences in the film have been noted for their lasting cultural impact, particularly the freaks' climactic revenge sequence, which was ranked 15th on Bravo TV's list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments. The banquet sequence in which the freaks chant \"We accept her, we accept her, one of us\" has also been noted, with Mike D'Angelo of \"The A.V. Club\" describing it as \"the film's greatest cultural legacy... \"One of us, one of us, one of us\" reliably gets trotted out in situations involving an individual being forced to conform by the masses\u2014I can recall seeing homages on both \"The Simpsons\" and \"South Park\", and there are probably dozens of others out there.\"\n\"Freaks\" has inspired two unofficial remakes: \"She Freak\" (1967) and \"Freakshow\" (2007). It also served as a major inspiration for the fourth season of the television series \"American Horror Story\", titled \"\" (2014\u20132015). \"Freaks\" was adapted into a 1992 comic book series, published by Fantagraphics, written by Jim Woodring and illustrated by Francisco Solano Lopez.\nIn popular culture.\nBrowning and the film are mentioned in the 1974 David Bowie song \"Diamond Dogs\".\nThe song \"Pinhead\" (1977) by the punk-rock band Ramones was inspired by \"Freaks\", which the band saw in Cleveland, Ohio, after their gig was cancelled. Joey Ramone's brother Mickey Leigh said that the line \"Gabba Gabba, we accept you, we accept you one of us\" was specifically taken from the scene in which \"the midget groom does a dance on the banquet table and sings 'Gooble gobble, we accept you, one of us' to his bride.\" The song is an audience participation song, and during live performances, Leigh used to run out on stage with a big sign that bore the text \"Gabba Gabba, Hey\" and pass it to Joey who'd hold it up urging the crowd to join in. The song was featured on their album \"Leave Home\".\nThe professional wrestling stable \"The Oddities\", active in the World Wrestling Federation from 1998-1999, were presented as freak show performers. Their entrance video featured clips from \"Freaks\", set to music performed by the Insane Clown Posse. The song and video celebrated the film's message, that these \"freaks\" were decent and earnest and that the so-called \"normal\" people were bad.\nThe song \"Separated Out\" (2001) from the album Anoraknophobia by the UK band Marillion features several samples from the movie.\nIn Final Destination 3, the characters Ian and Erin call each other Zip and Pip in reference to the film.\nThe film was parodied in the third segment of Treehouse of Horror XXIV (2013).\nIn \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", Jordan Belfort and associates chant 'Gooble gobble, we accept you, one of us' while making plans for a darts tournament that involves throwing little people at a target.\nThe film was mentioned in the third season episode of \"The Sopranos\", \"University,\" when the character Caitlin expresses disgust at her classmates' callous reaction to characters in the film.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Filmed on location in Egypt and in Palestine, it tells the story of Jesus's life, interspersed with verses from \"The Bible\".\nKalem released the film in October 1912 to critical acclaim. It saw a re-release in February 1919 following Vitagraph Studios' acquisition of Kalem.\nProduction background.\nHerbert Reynolds has shown how Olcott used James Tissot's illustrations for his \"The Life of our Saviour Jesus Christ\" (1896-1897) as the basis for numerous shots in the film. The head of Kalem, Frank J. Marion, presented a copy to the troupe as they departed for the Middle East.\nAccording to Turner Classic Movies, the film cost $35,000 to produce (roughly between $ and $ adjusted to 2024 dollars); another source says that Olcott spent $100,000 of his own money on the project. Although the film's profits eventually amounted to almost $1 million (roughly $ to $), the Kalem directors refused to increase Olcott's basic salary, and he resigned.\nIn later years, Louis B. Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, would say this was the premiere film for his movie theater in Haverhill, Massachusetts and a major boost for him in the movie business. However, most sources place the release date of this film as 1912, long after the opening of Mayer's theater.\nAt around 5,000 feet it was one of the longest films to be released to date, although the Kinemacolor documentary \"With Our King and Queen Through India\" released in February 1912 ran to 16,000 feet; and another religious film \"The Miracle\" (the first full-colour feature film) - was released in the UK at 7,000 feet in December 1912.\nReception in Britain.\nThe five-reel film showed at the Queen's Hall, London, for eight months (a relatively lengthy run for the time). A statement by Israel Zangwill (founder of the Jewish Territorialist Organization) hailing it as \"An artistic triumph \u2014 the kinema put to its true end\" appeared on advertising bills outside the Queen's Hall.\n\"From the Manger to the Cross\" gained considerable publicity from an outcry in the \"Daily Mail\": \"Is nothing sacred to the film maker?\" it demanded, and waxed indignant about the profits for its American investors. Although the clergy were invited and found little to be affronted by, the controversy resulted in the voluntary creation of the British Board of Film Censors, which began operating on 1 January 1913.\nRediscovery.\nThe film disappeared from cinema screens for a number of years until Reverend Brian Hession, vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Walton, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, went on a quest to the US to find a copy of the film for re-issue in Britain. Although initially disappointed, he eventually discovered a set of negatives after searching in the vaults and cellars of old film concerns. Hession added a musical sound track and spoken commentary, and \"From the Manger to the Cross\" was re-released in 1938.\nCritical reception.\nTCM host Robert Osborne and the National Film Preservation Foundation consider this film to be the most important silent film to deal with the life of Christ. In 1998, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nA history of cinemas and film-making published in 1947 had this to say: \"To-day it appears to be somewhat overacted, and the camera work is stilted, the camera being merely a recording instrument and not part of the pattern of the exposition of the story itself. Its pace is slow by modern standards, doubtless an attempt to obtain dignity, and Bland's performance is so sedately remote as to be not so much an acting performance at all but a series of dignified poses.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was Lang's first American film.\nReleased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the movie stars Sylvia Sidney and Tracy, with a supporting cast featuring Walter Abel, Bruce Cabot, Edward Ellis and Walter Brennan. Loosely based on the events surrounding the Brooke Hart murder in San Jose, California, the film was adapted by Bartlett Cormack and Lang from the story \"Mob Rule\" by Norman Krasna.\nIn 1995, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" \nPlot summary.\nEn route to meet his fianc\u00e9e Katherine Grant, gas-station owner Joe Wilson is arrested on flimsy circumstantial evidence for the kidnapping of a child. Gossip soon travels around the small town, growing more distorted through each retelling, until a mob gathers at the jail. When the resolute sheriff refuses to give up his prisoner, the enraged townspeople burn down the building, throwing dynamite into the flames as they flee the scene. Unknown to anyone else there, the blast frees Joe but kills his little dog Rainbow, who had run in to comfort him in the cell.\nThe district attorney brings the main perpetrators to trial for murder, but nobody is willing to identify the guilty, and several provide false alibis. The case seems hopeless, but then the prosecutor produces hard evidence: newsreel footage of 22 people caught in the act.\nKatherine discovers that Joe escaped the fire and that his brothers are helping him take revenge by concealing his survival and framing the defendants for his murder. She goes to see Joe and pleads with him to stop the charade, but he is determined to make his would-be killers pay. His conscience begins to weigh on him and, just as the verdicts are being read, he walks into the courtroom and sets things straight.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe part of Wilson's dog Rainbow was played by Terry, the same Cairn Terrier who played Toto in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\nDevelopment.\nNorman Krasna was inspired to write the story after reading about a lynching in \"The Nation\". He pitched the idea to Samuel Marx and Joseph L. Mankiewicz at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who were attracted to it. Krasna claimed that he did not write a script; he verbally pitched it to Mankiewicz, who then dictated it. Multiple changes were made from Krasna's story to the final script.\n\"Fury\" was Lang's first American film, and is considered by critics to have been compromised by the studio, which forced Lang to tack on a reconciliation between Tracy's character and his girlfriend at the end. The film was a departure for MGM, known for its lavish musicals and glitzy dramas; the expensive production features expansive and stylized sets to create its gritty world, and its style is in keeping with the social-issue films often associated with Warner Bros., such as \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\".\nLang originally wanted to make a film about a black victim of a lynching, but the idea was rejected by MGM. The kiss scene at the end, a typical Hollywood \"happy ending,\" was appended because the production manager insisted. Lang, who credited himself with changing the protagonist from a lawyer to a mechanic, also said that he wanted to reveal that the protagonist had committed the murder.\nReception.\nThe film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing, Original Story. Frank Nugent, in a review for \"The New York Times\", praised it as \"[a] mature, sober and penetrating investigation of a national blight.\" Writing for \"The Spectator\" in 1936, Graham Greene strongly praised the film, describing it as \"the only film I know to which I have wanted to attach the epithet of 'great'.\" Expressing his view that the film completely conveyed the \"sense of spiritual integrity ... by sound and image better than by any other medium,\" Greene drew particular attention to the contributions of Sylvia Sidney: \"[S]he has never more deeply conveyed the pain and inarticulacy of tenderness ... no other director has got so completely the measure of his medium, is so consistently awake to the counterpoint of sound and image.\"\nIn 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It was released on Blu-ray disc in the North American region by Warner Bros. in their Archive Collection in 2021.\nThe film earned domestic rentals of $685,000 and $617,000 overseas. According to MGM records, the final profit was $248,000.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73499", "revid": "125972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73499", "title": "Grand Admiral Thrawn", "text": "Star Wars character\nGrand Admiral Thrawn (full name: Mitth'raw'nuruodo; born: Kivu'raw'nuru) is a fictional character in the \"Star Wars\" franchise. He first appeared in what came to be known as the \"Thrawn\" trilogy of novels (1991\u20131993) by Timothy Zahn. An Imperial military leader and a member of the Chiss race, Thrawn leads remnants of the scattered Galactic Empire in the aftermath of its fall.\nIn the \"Thrawn\" trilogy, Thrawn returns from the unknown and leads Imperial remnants in a campaign against the New Republic, facing off against classic \"Star Wars\" characters Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian, before seemingly being resurrected in the \"Hand of Thrawn\" duology (1997\u20131998), with his backstory explored in various other novels, short stories, comics, and video games in the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe. In 2014, these stories were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" by Lucasfilm and rendered non-canon.\nThrawn reentered official canon in the 3D animated TV series \"Star Wars Rebels\" from 2016 to 2018, voiced by Lars Mikkelsen. Zahn published a new (2017\u20132019) and then the \"Thrawn Ascendancy\" trilogy (2020\u20132021), reinventing Thrawn as an anti-villain and double agent who infiltrates the Empire's ranks on behalf of his own people and the galactic government of the Unknown Regions, the Chiss Ascendancy. He intends to use Imperial resources to engage in open warfare with the extragalactic fanatics, the Grysk, before they can invade the galaxy, in the meantime opposing the Rebel Alliance on Palpatine's behalf before being forcibly sent to another galaxy by and alongside Ezra Bridger. Thrawn made his live-action debut in the Disney+ series \"Ahsoka\" (2023), with Mikkelsen reprising his role. Mikkelsen later reprised the voice role in the animated anthology series \"Tales of the Empire\" (2024).\nThrawn has been called one of the most significant and popular characters in the \"Legends\" continuity. Several \"Star Wars\" action figures and other merchandise have been produced of the character.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharacter.\nThrawn first appeared in the 1991 Timothy Zahn novel \"Heir to the Empire\", the first installment of what became known as the first \"Thrawn\" trilogy. He is a Grand Admiral in the Imperial Navy, and categorically \"the most brilliant of the Emperor's minions\". A member of the alien Chiss species, native language Cheunh, Thrawn is described as a tall, solidly built humanoid with blue skin and glowing red eyes who wears the white uniform befitting his rank. He has risen in power thanks to his \"tactical brilliance and cunning\", and has been described as \"one of the most threatening antagonists\" in the \"Star Wars\" universe. He is an unparalleled military strategist and tactical genius who has made extensive study of military intelligence and the artwork of other cultures, and the \"Thrawn\" trilogy finds him commanding the remnants of the Imperial Fleet in a series of stunning victories against the New Republic. His full name was given as Mitth'raw'nuruodo.\n\"IGN\" described the character as \"diabolical, brilliant and ruthless\". Zahn describes Thrawn's command style as considerably different from that of Darth Vader and other typical Imperial commanders; instead of punishing failure and dissent, Thrawn promotes creativity among his crew and accepts ideas from subordinates. Zahn said in 2017:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Most of the Imperial leaders we see in the movies rule through a combination of fear and manipulation. I wanted to create something different: a commander who could lead through loyalty. The result was Thrawn, a tactical genius whose troops follow him willingly, and who will fight for him whether or not he's watching over their shoulders.\nReferencing Zahn's annotations in the 20th Anniversary Edition of \"Heir to the Empire\", John Booth wrote in \"Wired\" that Zahn \"created and developed Thrawn as a character [by] deliberately establishing the Grand Admiral as a villain who leads not by coercion and fear but through valuing strategy and loyalty\". Zahn explained in 2008 that Thrawn's version of the Empire is different from that of Palpatine because Thrawn does not have Palpatine's megalomania and xenophobia. Calling Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created, Zahn noted in 2006 that writing the Grand Admiral \"provides the intellectual challenge of trying to come up with new, clever, and (hopefully) workable tactics and strategies.\" Zahn has also stated that Thrawn's entire motivation, both serving in the and the Ascendancy, is to protect the Chiss people and \"everything else flows from that.\"\nPortrayal.\nThrawn is voiced by Tris King in the 1994 computer game \"\", and by Tim Russell in the 1997 audio drama \"Dark Forces: Soldier for the Empire\". In seasons three and four of \"Star Wars Rebels\", Thrawn is voiced by Lars Mikkelsen. Mikkelsen reprised his role as Thrawn from \"Rebels\" in live-action in the 2023 Disney+ series \"Ahsoka\".\nAppearances.\n\"Legends\" works.\nAccording to Zahn, Lou Aronica of Bantam Spectra had negotiated a book deal with Lucasfilm in 1989, and the publisher put Zahn's name at the top of their list of possible authors. He said, \"My original instructions from LucasArts [\"sic\"] consisted of exactly two rules: the books were to start 3\u20135 years after \"Return of the Jedi,\" and I couldn't use anyone who'd been explicitly killed off in the movies.\" Zahn used information from the original film trilogy as his primary source, but supplemented that with details from the many sourcebooks created for West End Games' \"\", saying that they \"saved me from having to reinvent the wheel many times\". In turn, each novel in the trilogy had its role-playing game sourcebook created for it by West End Games.\nIntroduced in the \"Thrawn\" trilogy (1991\u201393), Thrawn became a fan favorite and subsequently appeared in multiple works in what became known as the \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe, including novels, comics and video games, through 2006. He is often cited as one of the most popular characters in the franchise. \"Star Wars Rebels\" executive producer Dave Filoni said of the character in 2016, \"You couldn't have grown up a \"Star Wars\" fan without encountering Thrawn in \"Heir to the Empire\". It was a dark time when there weren't any more movies, and it blew our minds that there could be more.\" The \"Thrawn\" trilogy itself is widely credited with reviving interest in the \"Star Wars\" franchise. In 2010, \"\" creator Filoni expressed interest in using Thrawn in that series. Some fans of Zahn's \"Thrawn\" series had long hoped the books would be adapted, and after the 2012 announcement that The Walt Disney Company had acquired Lucasfilm and planned to produce film sequels to \"Return of the Jedi\", Zahn commented that if material from the expanded universe were used in the films, \"we'd all be thrilled to death\".\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film \"Star Wars\" were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014. Though Lucasfilm made it clear that new media would \"not tell the same story told in the post-\"Return of the Jedi\" Expanded Universe\", it was also established that \"creators of new \"Star Wars\" entertainment have full access to the rich content of the Expanded Universe.\" Acknowledging that Thrawn had long been considered by Lucasfilm when developing projects, Filoni later said in 2016 that in particular the character had been on his list of potential villains when developing \"Star Wars Rebels\".\n\"Thrawn\" trilogy (1991\u20131993).\nThe Thrawn\" trilogy, also known as the Heir to the Empire\" trilogy, was written by Timothy Zahn between 1991 and 1993. Approximately five years after the events depicted in \"Return of the Jedi\", the Rebel Alliance, now known as the New Republic, has driven out the remnants of the old Imperial Starfleet to a distant corner of the galaxy and is attempting to set up a functional government. Princess Leia and Han Solo are married and expecting twins. Luke Skywalker has become the first in a long-awaited new line of Jedi Knights. Thousands of light years away, Grand Admiral Thrawn, the last and most brilliant of the 12 grand admirals, has taken command of the shattered Imperial Fleet and prepared it to attack the New Republic. Thrawn is searching for a Dark Jedi to join his side and is confident he can restore the Empire.\nIn Heir to the Empire (1991), Thrawn plots to destroy the New Republic despite their numerical advantage over the remaining Imperial forces. He sets his sights on the Wayland storehouse of the late Emperor Palpatine, which contains a massive array of Spaarti cloning cylinders and a practical cloaking shield. To this end, Thrawn and his subordinate Gilad Pellaeon, captain of the Star Destroyer \"Chimaera\", enlist the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and his second-in-command Mara Jade to obtain several salamander-like creatures called ysalamiri. Thrawn uses the ysalamiri, which possess the natural ability to disrupt the Force, to subdue the storehouse's guardian Joruus C'baoth, a twisted clone of a Jedi Master whom the Grand Admiral had killed years before. C'baoth offers his allegiance in exchange for two acolytes to bend to his will: Darth Vader's twin children, Luke and Leia. Thrawn sends some of his Noghri killers to capture Luke and a pregnant Leia, but their attempts repeatedly fail. Leia defends herself from one attack and is surprised when the Noghri suddenly surrenders. Thrawn launches his first offensive, a series of hit-and-run attacks into New Republic territory, and then steals a complement of mole miners from Lando Calrissian's mining operations on Nkllon. In need of warships, and with his previous tactics having forced over 100 lightly crewed ships to be stationed at the Sluis Van shipyards as he planned, Thrawn invades. His stormtroopers use the stolen miners to board and hijack the ships, but they are thwarted when Lando seizes control of the miners remotely. The Grand Admiral withdraws his forces, but thanks to Thrawn's plotting, his New Republic nemesis Admiral Ackbar is soon arrested for treason.\nDark Force Rising (1992) reveals that before the Clone Wars, the Old Republic had constructed a fleet of highly automated heavy cruisers, known as the \"Katana\" fleet. A virus infected the crews of the entire fleet and drove them insane. The fleet was not seen again until smuggler Talon Karrde discovered it (several years before the events of the first book). With access to Palpatine's private storehouse on the planet Wayland, Thrawn presses his advantage to marshal more forces for the battle against the New Republic. Mara Jade, in an attempt to exonerate the Empire's warrant for Karrde's arrest, goes to Thrawn and offers to reveal the location of the \"Katana\" fleet. Instead, he has her followed and Karrde is captured. Luke and Mara rescue Karrde from Thrawn's Star Destroyer as Thrawn attempts to capture another man who knows about the \"Katana\" fleet. Meanwhile, Leia learns that the Noghri serve the Empire because they revere her late father, Darth Vader, who they believe saved their planet Honoghr from ecological disaster. Leia convinces them that they have been deceived and effectively enslaved by the Empire, and they switch sides. With Ackbar temporarily neutralized as a tactical opponent, Thrawn leads an army of clones to claim the so-called \"\"Katana\" fleet\", outmaneuvering Luke, Lando, and Han Solo.\nIn The Last Command (1993), set about a month after the previous book, Thrawn uses the \"Katana\" fleet, crewed with clones, to mount a successful offensive against the New Republic. Seizing one planet after the other, the Grand Admiral soon immobilizes the galactic capital world, Coruscant. He has placed multiple cloaked asteroids around the planet, and through a ruse, he has led the New Republic leadership to believe that Coruscant is surrounded with them. Learning of the deception, the Republic fleet attacks the Imperial shipyards at Bilbringi to capture a device that can find the cloaked asteroids, but Thrawn's forces intercept and surround them. Meanwhile, Luke and Leia lead a group to destroy the cloning facility on Wayland, killing C'baoth and destroying the cloning cylinders. Just as Thrawn and Pellaeon learn that the Noghri aided in the attack on Wayland, Thrawn's Noghri bodyguard, Rukh, kills the Grand Admiral\u2014whose last words are, \"But\u00a0... it was so artistically done.\" The tide of battle at Bilbringi turns, and with the hope of victory dashed by Thrawn's death, Pellaeon orders the Imperial forces to retreat.\n\"The Hand of Thrawn\" duology (1997\u20131998).\nZahn's Specter of the Past (1997) finds Thrawn seemingly resurrected ten years after his death when he reappears to lead the decimated Imperial forces against the unstable New Republic. A record surfaces called the Caamasi Document, which indicates that a small group of Bothans were perpetrators in the tragic destruction of the planet Caamas and causes more than a hundred alien warships to gather in orbit over the Bothans' homeworld, which the Empire hopes to use to its benefit.\nIn Vision of the Future (1998), Admiral Gilad Pellaeon admits that the Empire, down to only a few sectors, is now fighting a losing battle, and initiates peace talks with Princess Leia. However, Moff Disra hires a con artist, Flim, to impersonate the deceased Grand Admiral Thrawn to motivate the Imperial forces. Major Grodin Tierce, the clone of a former stormtrooper imbued with Thrawn's tactical intellect by the grand admiral himself, strategizes that the false Thrawn could also rally support for the Empire and intimidate the New Republic. The tactic is successful until Pellaeon and Talon Karrde\u2014on opposing sides but both desiring peace\u2014expose Flim. Meanwhile, at a fortress called the Hand of Thrawn, Luke and Mara discover a gestating and near-complete clone of Thrawn, which is killed during their escape. An expedition by Thrawn to the galaxy's Unknown Regions is also mentioned. Finally, a peace treaty is signed by Pellaeon and the New Republic's president.\nOther works.\nNovels.\nThrawn appears as a captain in the 1997 William C. Dietz novella '. A younger Thrawn, ranked Captain, makes a cameo appearance in the 1998 young reader's book ' by John Whitman, set between \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\". In the novel, Tash and Zack Arranda and their uncle Hoole, natives of Alderaan who are fugitives from the Empire, have a chance encounter with Thrawn on the planet of the S'krrr species. Though suspicious, Thrawn is cordial and later reluctantly aids them in stopping the drog beetles from overrunning the planet.\nBefore the theatrical release of \"Attack of the Clones\", Lucasfilm suggested that Zahn write a prequel-era book. Zahn decided to have his 2004 novel \"Survivor's Quest\" (the sequel to \"The Hand of Thrawn\" duology) cover the end of the Outbound Flight story arc before exploring its beginning in his prequel novel. In \"Survivor's Quest\", Luke and Mara journey to investigate the wreckage of Outbound Flight, a Jedi expedition destroyed by Thrawn years before. Newly discovered by the Chiss, the remains turn out to be the lure in a trap laid by the bloodthirsty Vagaari to avenge themselves on the Chiss.\nZahn's 2006 novel Outbound Flight is set fifty years before \"Survivor's Quest\". It follows the story of the doomed titular expedition, led by Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth, that is attacked by a young Chiss commander named Mitth'raw'nuruodo\u2014informally known as Thrawn. In the story, a Republic fleet comes across the Chiss for the first time. The alien commander, Thrawn, can handily defeat the Republic ships despite inferior weapons and numbers. Darth Sidious, Palpatine's alter-ego, seeks to destroy the \"Outbound Flight\", and he and his agent Kinman Doriana convince Thrawn that the ship and its Jedi pose a threat to the peaceful future of the galaxy. Thrawn agrees, hoping to get C'baoth to turn back before taking more drastic action. The Jedi refuses and Thrawn fires on the ship, but Doriana launches an assault that kills every Jedi and sends the \"Outbound Flight\" careening to its destruction on a nearby planet. Thrawn's brother Thrass and Lorana, the sole surviving Jedi, sacrifice their lives to save what survivors they can. Thrawn is reprimanded by his Chiss superiors for his hostile behavior, and summoned back to his home planet Csilla. \"Publishers Weekly\" called Thrawn the \"true star\" of the novel, noting that his attack on the ship, secretly influenced by Palpatine's agents, \"insures his own eventual exile from his race and sets other sinister wheels in motion\". Zahn said of writing the novel, \"as always, it was immensely fun to play tactics with Thrawn\". Though StarWars.com suggests that in \"Outbound Flight\", Thrawn is \"too smart and basically decent to become the servant of Palpatine that he later becomes\", Zahn explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSet between \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Zahn's \"Choices of One\" (2011) pits Thrawn against the alien warlord Nuso Esva, his nemesis from the Unknown Regions.\nShort stories.\nThrawn, exiled by the Chiss to an inhospitable planet, is found by the Imperial Captain Voss Parck in \"Mist Encounter\" a short story by Zahn that was originally published in \"Star Wars Adventure Journal\" #7 (August 1995). Parck realizes Thrawn's value as a strategist and decides to bring him to the Emperor. An edited version of the story was published in the paperback edition of \"Outbound Flight\". In \"Command Decision\", a November 1996 short story by Zahn published in \"Star Wars Adventure Journal\" #11, Thrawn is an admiral in the Imperial Navy with Parck as his subordinate. Thrawn orchestrates a plan to locate a Rebel base in \"Side Trip\" by Zahn and Michael A. Stackpole, published in \"Star Wars Adventure Journal\" #12 (February 1997) and #13 (May 1997), and reprinted in the November 1997 anthology \"Tales from the Empire\". The success of this mission earns him the command of Darth Vader's Noghri commandos. Zahn's novella \"Crisis of Faith\", published with the 20th Anniversary Edition of \"Heir to the Empire\" on September 6, 2011, is set immediately before \"Heir to the Empire\" and finds Thrawn finally able to defeat Nuso Esva.\nComics.\nTrade paperbacks:\nIn the 1997 Dark Horse comic \" 25: The Making of Baron Fel\", set four years after \"A New Hope\", Imperial pilot Soontir Fel participates in an ambush on a Rebel convoy. He realizes that the operation was planned by the \"alien Admiral\" Thrawn, who is given no acknowledgement by Vader or the Emperor. Fel understands that such reliance on an alien undercuts the xenophobic foundation of the Empire, and Thrawn goes unrewarded after the successful mission.\nVideo games.\nIn the \"Tour of Duty III\" segment of the 1994 space flight simulator/combat computer game ', then-Vice Admiral Thrawn establishes order in a \"wild\" system at the frontiers of the Empire. The game expansion packs \"Defender of the Empire\" and \"Enemies of the Empire\" follow the story of how Thrawn thwarts the efforts of the traitorous Grand Admiral Zaarin to depose the Emperor, and Thrawn is promoted to Grand Admiral in his place. Thrawn is also a recruitable character for The Empire in the 1998 strategy computer game ', and later appears in ' expansion pack for the 2006 real-time strategy game '. Thrawn cameos in ' as a \"Leader\" character for the Galactic Empire in Galactic Conquest, earned by conquering all planets in the Northern Quadrant of the map and allows an army to move twice in one turn if the first move is begun within said quadrant. This power is shared with Admiral Ackbar for the Rebel Alliance. He is also a collectible character in the 2015 mobile collectible Role-playing video game, ', and a DLC character in \"\".\nCanon works.\n\"Star Wars Rebels\" (2016\u20132018).\nIn April 2014, with the sequel film \"\" in production, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced since the 1977 film \"Star Wars\" were declared non-canon to the franchise. However, \"Star Wars Rebels\" executive producer Dave Filoni announced at the London \"Star Wars\" Celebration in July 2016 that Thrawn would be reintroduced into the franchise in the third season of the \"Rebels\" series. The character debuted in the season 3 premiere, \"Steps Into Shadow\", which aired on September 24, 2016.\nThough in \"Legends\" works Thrawn was mostly used in post-\"Return of the Jedi\" storylines, \"Rebels\" takes place within the five years before the events of the original 1977 film. After seeing an advanced clip from the series, Zahn told StarWars.com, \"even that short bit was awesome, and just a bit surrealistic. Authors don't get to see our creations come to life very often, and it was a real treat to see a walking, talking Grand Admiral Thrawn\".\nAcknowledging that Thrawn had long been considered by Lucasfilm when developing projects, Filoni said that in particular, the character had been on his list of potential villains when developing \"Rebels\". He explained that unlike how the character Ahsoka Tano has been a foil for Darth Vader in previous seasons of \"Rebels\", \"There's no one to defend [the Rebels] against Thrawn. We want to treat him like a big-time villain, as much as Darth Vader, but on the strategic, military side of things.\"\nStorylines.\nIn \"Steps into Shadow\", Thrawn is the commander of the Seventh Fleet, recently promoted to Grand Admiral for crushing a rebel insurgency on Batonn without regard for civilian casualties. He is brought in by Imperial Governor Arihnda Pryce to help destroy the series' eponymous rebel cell. A patient tactician, Thrawn allows the rebels to escape, intending to manipulate them into orchestrating the complete downfall of their rebellion. In \"Hera's Heroes\", he takes command of the Imperial occupation of Ryloth, home planet of Hera Syndulla, and has his first face-to-face contact with the rebels. He reappears in \"Iron Squadron\", where he orders the incompetent Admiral Konstantine to deal with rebels and rebel sympathizers in the Mykapo system; after Konstantine's ship is disabled, Thrawn arrives in his personal Star Destroyer, the \"Chimaera\", and is revealed to have previously encountered rebel Commander Jun Sato. \"An Inside Man\" reveals Thrawn now in charge of the Imperial occupation of the planet Lothal, overseeing the factory where the new TIE Defender and various other pieces of equipment are manufactured. He puts an end to rebel acts of sabotage by enforcing a policy of the workers testing their creations and is also shown to be studying pieces of artwork that grant insight into each member of the \"Ghost\" crew. He also determines that there is a rebel spy within the Imperial ranks, but intends to use this to his advantage. In \"Warhead\", Thrawn uses probe droids to determine that Sato's hidden rebel base is located on one of less than a hundred planets. Thrawn is shown to be skilled in hand-to-hand combat in \"Through Imperial Eyes\", and learns that Agent Kallus is the rebel spy. In \"Secret Cargo\", Thrawn and Pryce pursue Senator Mon Mothma, who is being transported to safety by the rebels after speaking out publicly against Palpatine. In \"Zero Hour\", Thrawn confronts Kallus about being Fulcrum, and executes his carefully planned attack on the rebel base on Atollon. He is thwarted by the ingenuity of the rebels and the assistance of Bendu, who cryptically warns Thrawn of his impending defeat, \"like many arms surrounding you in a cold embrace\". In the series finale \"Family Reunion \u2013 and Farewell\", Thrawn's Star Destroyer is attacked by purrgil while hovering over Lothal. Ensnared in the creatures' tentacles while simultaneously being confronted by the Force-wielding Ezra Bridger, who brought the purrgil to defend Lothal, the Star Destroyer is dragged by them into hyperspace, leaving both Thrawn's and Bridger's fates unknown.\n\"Thrawn\" trilogy (2017\u20132019).\nIn a prerecorded video also presented at the July 2016 London \"Star Wars\" Celebration, Zahn announced that he was writing a new novel titled \"\", which was released by Del Rey Books in April 2017. According to Zahn, it was \"very exciting\" to write the character again, and he noted that \"with this book I'll be visiting a part of his life that I never before had a chance to explore\". Zahn later said, \"I get to show how he's treated by his fellow officers and shipmates on his way up the military ladder, particularly when he's not in a command position over them.\"\nAlthough in \"Legends\" works Thrawn was mostly placed in post-\"Return of the Jedi\" storylines, \"Thrawn\" is set before the events of the original 1977 film. It covers several years between Thrawn's \"first encounter\" with the Empire and the events of the third season of \"Rebels\", chronicling his rise to power. In the novel, seemingly exiled Chiss warrior Thrawn is rescued by Imperial soldiers, and soon proves a valuable asset to the Empire. His cunning and expertise as a tactician soon attract the attention of Emperor Palpatine, though Thrawn's renegade tactics ignite the ire of his superiors. As he rises in rank, Thrawn trains his \"aide-de-camp\" Ensign Eli Vanto in the ways of war, and finds himself in an uneasy alliance with ruthless administrator Arihnda Pryce while in search of rebel leader Nightswan. Ultimately, Thrawn reveals himself to Nightswan as a double agent for the Chiss Ascendancy, his exile having been faked in order to assist with his infiltration.\nA six issue comic book miniseries adaptation of the first novel by Marvel Comics began in early 2018, and ended in June of that year.\nA sequel to the novel, titled \"\", was released on July 24, 2018.

Comicbook.com called Thrawn \"arguably the most popular character in the \"Star Wars Legends\" universe\" in 2017, and Linda Hansen-Raj wrote that the character \"carries a lasting legacy as one of \"Star Wars\"' greatest and most complex antagonists.\" In 2014, \"GamesRadars Sam Ashurst called Thrawn \"hugely popular amongst fans, partly because of his tactical genius, partly because of his progressive attitude to his employees but mainly due to the fact he's got a blue face\" and \"easily the coolest villain in the \"Expanded Universe\"\", noting Thrawn's loss as one of the major consequences of Lucasfilm's abandonment of the old expanded universe for '. Emmet Asher-Perrin of \"Tor.com\" noted in 2016 that as \"one of the most popular Expanded Universe villains\" and \"one of the most threatening antagonists that the \"Star Wars\" universe had on hand\", the character's removal from canon continuity \"had many fans crying foul\".\nIn 2008, Jesse Schedeen of \"IGN\" credited Thrawn and the \"Thrawn\" trilogy with \"kickstarting\" the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe\", and in 2015 \"Empire\" suggested that Thrawn's character helped \"revitalize and legitimise\" the expanded universe when it was failing. Eric Goldman wrote for \"IGN\" in 2008, \"Diabolical, brilliant and ruthless, Thrawn was an excellent \"Star Wars\" villain, following in the footsteps of the likes of Grand Moff Tarkin,\" adding that \"his status as the highest ranking non-human in the Empire was a very interesting aspect\". In 2006, Zahn called Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created. Zahn said in July 2016, \"A writer never knows which characters are going to click with the readers, and it was highly gratifying to me that Thrawn captured the imaginations of so many people over the past quarter century.\"\nThe character has been on many \"top\" lists of \"Star Wars\" characters, praising his villainy and character. In a list of fifteen \"Star Wars\" villains, Schedeen placed Thrawn as second best, beaten by Darth Vader, focusing on his greatness as a commander and tactician. In 2008, \"IGN\" ranked him as the tenth best overall \"Star Wars\" character, noting his influence in the expanded universe, and UGO listed him as the third greatest expanded universe character the same year. \"Empire\" listed Thrawn fifth in their list of the 25 best of the more obscure \"Star Wars\" characters in 2015.\nIn November 2016, Lars Mikkelsen was nominated for a 2017 Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement, Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production for his portrayal of Thrawn on \"Star Wars Rebels\".

Its name comes from the Latin pronouns \"tu\" and \"vos\". The distinction takes a number of forms and indicates varying levels of politeness, familiarity, courtesy, age or even insult toward the addressee. The field that studies and describes this phenomenon is sociolinguistics.\nMany languages lack this type of distinction, instead relying on other morphological or discourse features to convey formality. English historically contained the distinction, using the pronouns \"thou\" and \"you\", but the familiar \"thou\" largely disappeared from the era of Early Modern English onward, with the exception of a few dialects. Additionally, British commoners historically spoke to nobility and royalty using the third person rather than the second person, a practice that has fallen out of favour. English speakers today often employ semantic analogues to convey the mentioned attitudes towards the addressee, such as whether to address someone by given name or surname or whether to use \"sir\" or \"madam\". Under a broader classification, \"T\" and \"V\" forms are examples of honorifics.\nThe T\u2013V distinction is expressed in a variety of forms; two particularly common means are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrigin and development.\nThe terms \"T\" and \"V\", based on the Latin pronouns and , were first used in a paper by the social psychologist Roger Brown and the Shakespearean scholar Albert Gilman. This was a historical and contemporary survey of the uses of pronouns of address, seen as semantic markers of social relationships between individuals. The study considered mainly French, Italian, Spanish and German. The paper was highly influential and, with few exceptions, the terms \"T\" and \"V\" have been used in subsequent studies.\nThe status of the single second-person pronoun \"you\" in English is controversial among linguistic scholars. For some, the English \"you\" keeps everybody at a distance, although not to the same extent as V pronouns in other languages. For others, \"you\" is a default neutral pronoun that fulfils the functions of both T and V without being\nthe equivalent of either, so an N-V-T framework is needed, where N indicates neutrality.\nHistory and usage in language.\nIn classical Latin, was originally the singular, and the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. According to Brown and Gilman, the Roman emperors began to be addressed as \"vos\" in the 4th century AD. They mention the possibility that this was because there were two emperors at that time (in Constantinople and in Rome), but also mention that \"plurality is a very old and ubiquitous metaphor for power.\" This usage was extended to other powerful figures, such as Pope Gregory I (590\u2013604). However, Brown and Gilman note that it was only between the 12th and 14th centuries that the norms for the use of T- and V-forms crystallized. Less commonly, the use of the plural may be extended to other grammatical persons, such as the \"royal \"we\"\" (majestic plural) in English.\nBrown and Gilman argued that the choice of form is governed by either relationships of \"power\" or \"solidarity\", depending on the culture of the speakers, showing that \"power\" had been the dominant predictor of form in Europe until the 20th century. Thus, it was quite normal for a powerful person to use a \"T\"-form but expect a \"V\"-form in return. However, in the 20th century the dynamic shifted in favour of solidarity, so that people would use \"T\"-forms with those they knew, and \"V\"-forms in service encounters, with reciprocal usage being the norm in both cases.\nEarly history: the power semantic.\nIn the Early Middle Ages (the 5th century to the 10th century), the pronoun was used to address the most exalted figures, emperors and popes, who would use the pronoun to address a subject. This use was progressively extended to other states and societies, and down the social hierarchy as a mark of respect to individuals of higher rank, religious authority, greater wealth, or seniority within a family. The development was slow and erratic, but a consistent pattern of use is estimated to have been reached in different European societies by the period 1100 to 1500. Use of \"V\" spread to upper-class individuals of equal rank, but not to lower class individuals. This may be represented in Brown and Gilman's notation:\nModification: the solidarity semantic.\nSpeakers developed greater flexibility of pronoun use by redefining relationships between individuals. Instead of defining the father\u2013son relationship as one of power, it could be seen as a shared family relationship. Brown and Gilman term this the semantics of solidarity. Thus a speaker might have a choice of pronoun, depending on how they perceived the relationship with the person addressed. Thus a speaker with superior power might choose \"V\" to express fellow feeling with a subordinate. For example, a restaurant customer might use \"V\" to their favourite waiter. Similarly, a subordinate with a friendly relationship of long standing might use \"T\". For example, a child might use \"T\" to express affection for their parent.\nThis may be represented as:\nThese choices were available not only to reflect permanent relationships, but to express momentary changes of attitude. This allowed playwrights such as Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare to express a character's inner changes of mood through outward changes of pronoun.\nFor centuries, it was the more powerful individual who chose to address a subordinate either with \"T\" or with \"V\", or to allow the subordinate to choose. For this reason, the pronouns were traditionally defined as the \"pronoun of either condescension or intimacy\" (\"T\") and \"the pronoun of reverence or formality\" (\"V\"). Brown and Gilman argue that modern usage no longer supports these definitions.\nModern history.\nDevelopments from the 19th century have seen the solidarity semantic applied more consistently. It has become less acceptable for a more powerful individual to exercise the choice of pronoun. Officers in most armies are not permitted to address a soldier as \"T\". Most European parents cannot oblige their children to use \"V\". The relationships illustrated above have changed in the direction of the following norms:\nThe tendency to promote the solidarity semantic may lead to the abolition of any choice of address pronoun. During the French Revolution, attempts were made to abolish \"V\". In 17th century England, the Society of Friends obliged its members to use only \"T\" to everyone, and some continue to use \"T\" (\"thee\") to one another. In most Modern English dialects, the use of \"T\" is archaic and no longer exists outside of poetry or dialect.\nChanges in progress.\nIt was reported in 2012 that use of the French and the Spanish are in decline in social media. An explanation offered was that such online communications favour the philosophy of social equality, regardless of usual formal distinctions. Similar tendencies were observed in German, Persian, Chinese, Italian and Estonian.\nHistory of use in individual languages.\nEnglish.\nThe Old English and Early Middle English second person pronouns and (with variants) were used for singular and plural reference respectively with no \"T\u2013V\" distinction. The earliest entry in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" for \"ye\" as a \"V\" pronoun in place of the singular \"thou\" exists in a Middle English text of 1225 composed in 1200. The usage may have started among the Norman French nobility in imitation of Old French. It made noticeable advances during the second half of the 13th century. During the 16th century, the distinction between the subject form \"ye\" and the object form \"you\" was largely lost, leaving \"you\" as the usual \"V\" pronoun (and plural pronoun). After 1600, the use of \"ye\" in standard English outside of regional dialects was confined to literary and religious contexts or as a consciously archaic usage.\nDavid Crystal summarises Early Modern English usage thus:\n\"V\" would normally be used\n\"T\" would normally be used\nThe \"T\u2013V\" distinction was still well preserved when Shakespeare began writing at the end of the 16th century. However, other playwrights of the time made less use of \"T\u2013V\" contrasts than Shakespeare. The infrequent use of \"T\" in popular writing earlier in the century such as the Paston Letters suggest that the distinction was already disappearing from gentle speech. In the first half of the 17th century, \"thou\" disappeared from Standard English, although the \"T\u2013V\" distinction was preserved in many regional dialects. When the Quakers began using \"thou\" again in the middle of the century, many people were still aware of the old \"T\u2013V\" distinction and responded with derision and physical violence.\nIn the 19th century, one aspect of the \"T\u2013V\" distinction was restored to some English dialects in the form of a pronoun that expressed friendly solidarity, written as \"y'all\". Unlike earlier \"thou\", it was used primarily for plural address, and in some dialects for singular address as well. The pronoun was first observed in the southern states of the US, although its precise origin is obscure. The pronoun spread rapidly throughout the southern states, and (to a lesser extent) other regions of the US and beyond. This pronoun is not universally accepted, and may be regarded as either nonstandard or a regionalism.\n\"Yous(e)\" (pron. , ) as a plural is found mainly in (Northern) England, Scotland, parts of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, northern Nova Scotia and parts of Ontario in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States (especially areas where there was historically Irish or Italian immigration), including in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and scattered throughout working-class communities in the American Rust Belt.\nFrench.\nIn Old French texts, the pronouns and are often used interchangeably to address an individual, sometimes in the same sentence. However, some emerging pattern of use has been detected by recent scholars. Between characters equal in age or rank, was more common than as a singular address. However, was sometimes used to put a young man in his place, or to express temporary anger. There may also have been variation between Parisian use and that of other regions.\nIn the Middle French period, a relatively stable \"T\u2013V\" distinction emerged. \"Vous\" was the \"V\" form used by upper-class speakers to address one another, while was the \"T\" form used among lower class speakers. Upper-class speakers could choose to use either \"T\" or \"V\" when addressing an inferior. Inferiors would normally use \"V\" to a superior. However, there was much variation; in 1596, \u00c9tienne Pasquier observed in his comprehensive survey that the French sometimes used to inferiors as well as to superiors \"\" (\"according to our natural tendencies\"). In poetry, was often used to address kings or to speak to God.\nGerman.\nIn German, \"Du\" is only used as an informal pronoun. It is only addressed to persons that one knows well, like family members and friends. It is also most commonly used among peers as a sign of equality, especially among young people. In formal situations with strangers and acquaintances, \"Sie\" is used instead. \"Ihr\" was also used in formal situations; this was once the abundant usage, but it has completely fallen out of use. In the plural form, \"ihr\" is used as the \"T\" pronoun and \"Sie\" is used as the \"V\" pronoun; \"Ihr\" and \"Sie\" are capitalized when they are used as the \"V\" pronoun.\nScandinavian languages.\nA \"T\u2013V\" distinction was once widespread in the North Germanic languages but its use began rapidly declining in the second half of the 20th century, coinciding with the 1960s youth rebellion. The \"V\" variant has in practice completely disappeared from regular speech in Swedish spoken in Sweden, Norwegian and Icelandic. In Faroese and Finland Swedish, however, it is still occasionally used.\nThe use of the \"V\" variant in Danish has declined dramatically, but as of 2023 not completely disappeared. In Danish the \"T\" variant is \"du\" and the \"V\" variant is a capitalized \"De\".\nSwedish both had a \"V\"-variant of \"you\" and an even more formal manner of addressing people, which was to address them in the third person (\"Could I ask Mr. Johnson to...\").\nHindi-Urdu.\nHindi-Urdu (Hindustani) have three levels of formality distinction. The pronoun \u0924\u0942 \u062a\u0648 (t\u016b) is the informal (intimate) pronoun, \u0924\u0941\u092e \u062a\u0645 (tum) is the familiar pronoun and \u0906\u092a \u0622\u067e (\u0101p) is the formal pronoun. T\u016b is only used in certain contexts in Urdu, as in normal conversation, the use of t\u016b is considered very rude. The pronoun \u0924\u0942 \u062a\u0648 (t\u016b) is grammatically singular while the pronouns \u0924\u0941\u092e \u062a\u0645 (tum) and \u0906\u092a \u0622\u067e (\u0101p) are grammatically plural. However, the plural pronouns are more commonly used as singular pronouns and to explicitly mark the plurality, words such as \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0644\u0648\u06af (log) [people], \u0938\u092c \u0633\u0628 (sab) [all], \u0926\u094b\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u062f\u0648\u0646\u0648\u06ba (don\u00f5) [both], \u0924\u0940\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0648\u06ba (t\u012bn\u00f5) [all three] etc. are added after the plural pronouns.\nIn the Western Hindi dialects, a fourth level of formality (semi-formal), which is intermediate between \u0906\u092a \u0622\u067e (\u0101p) and \u0924\u0941\u092e \u062a\u0645 (tum), is created when the pronoun \u0906\u092a \u0622\u067e (\u0101p) is used with the conjugations of \u0924\u0941\u092e \u062a\u0645 (tum). However, this form is strictly dialectal and is not used in standard versions of Urdu and Hindi.\nUse of names.\nThe boundaries between formal and informal language differ from language to language, as well as within social groups of the speakers of a given language. In some circumstances, it is not unusual to call other people by first name and the respectful form, or last name and familiar form. For example, German teachers used to use the former construct with upper-secondary students, while Italian teachers typically use the latter (switching to a full V-form with university students). This can lead to constructions denoting an intermediate level of formality in T\u2013V-distinct languages that sound awkward to English-speakers. In Italian, can be addressed with the (familiar) form or the (formal) one, but complete addresses range from (peer to peer or family) and (teacher to high-school student, as stated above) to (live-in servant to master or master's son) and (senior staff member to junior) and (among peers and to seniors).\nUsage in language.\nSingular, plural and other ways of distinction.\nIn many languages, the respectful singular pronoun derives from a plural form. Some Romance languages have familiar forms derived from the Latin singular and respectful forms derived from Latin plural , sometimes via a circuitous route. Sometimes, a singular V-form derives from a third-person pronoun; in German and some Nordic languages, it is the third-person plural. Some languages have separate \"T\" and \"V\" forms for both singular and plural, others have the same form and others have a \"T\u2013V\" distinction only in the singular.\nDifferent languages distinguish pronoun uses in different ways. Even within languages, there are differences between groups (older people and people of higher status tending both to use and to expect more respectful language) and between various aspects of one language. For example, in Dutch, the \"V\" form is slowly falling into disuse in the plural and so one could sometimes address a group as \"T\" form , which clearly expresses the plural when one would address each member individually as , which has the disadvantage of being ambiguous. In Latin American Spanish, the opposite change has occurred\u2014having lost the \"T\" form , Latin Americans address all groups as , even if the group is composed of friends whom they would call or (both \"T\" forms). In Standard Peninsular Spanish, however, (literally \"you others\") is still regularly used in informal conversation. In some cases, the \"V\"-form is likely to be capitalized when it is written.\nNominative case.\nThe following is a table of the nominative case of the singular and plural second person in many languages, including their respectful variants (if any):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRelated verbs, nouns and pronouns.\nSome languages have a verb to describe the fact of using either a \"T\" or a \"V\" form. Some also have a related noun or pronoun. The English words are used to refer only to English usage in the past, not to usage in other languages. The analogous distinction may be expressed as \"to use first names\" or \"to be on familiar terms (with someone)\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The guides, often referred to simply as \"Baedekers\" (a term sometimes used to refer to similar works from other publishers, or travel guides in general), contain, among other things, maps and introductions; information about routes and travel facilities; and descriptions of noteworthy buildings, sights, attractions and museums, written by specialists.\nHistory (1827\u22121948).\nKarl Baedeker.\n1827\u22121859: Karl Baedeker (1801\u20131859) descended from a long line of printers, booksellers and publishers from Essen, Germany. He was the eldest of ten children of Gottschalk Diederich B\u00e4deker (1778\u20131841), who had inherited the publishing house founded by his own father, Zacharias Gerhard B\u00e4deker (1750\u20131800). The company also published the local newspaper, the , and the family expected that Karl, too, would eventually join the firm. Karl worked with his father until 1827 when he left for Coblence (now Koblenz) to start his own bookselling and publishing business. Karl changed the spelling of the family name from B\u00e4deker, with the umlaut, to Baedeker around 1850.\nIn 1832 Baedeker's firm acquired the publishing house of Franz Friedrich R\u00f6hling in Koblenz, which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Oyvind Vorland entitled (\"A Rhine Journey from Mainz to Cologne; A Handbook for Travellers on the Move\"). This book provided the seeds for Baedeker's own travel guides. After Johann August Klein (1778\u20131831) died and the book went out of print, Baedeker decided to publish a new edition, incorporating some of Klein's material but also added many of his own ideas into what he thought a travel guide should offer the traveller or reader. Baedeker aimed to free the traveller from having to look for information anywhere outside the travel guide: about routes, transport, accommodation, restaurants, tipping, sights, walks and prices.\nWhile the concept of a travel guide-book already existed (Baedeker emulated the style of English guide-books published by John Murray), Baedeker innovated in including detailed information on routes, travel and accommodation.\nKarl Baedeker had three sons, Ernst, Karl and Fritz and after his death each, in turn, took over the running of the firm.\nErnst Baedeker.\n1859\u22121861: Following the death of Karl Baedeker, his eldest son Ernst Baedeker (1833\u22121861) became the head of the firm. After his training as a bookseller in Braunschweig, Leipzig and Stuttgart, he had spent some time at the English publishing house \"Williams &amp; Norgate\" in London. On New Year's Day, 1859, he joined his father's publishing firm as a partner and just ten months later he was running it on his own.\nHis tenure at the helm of the firm saw the publication of three new travel guides in 1861 viz the first Baedeker travel guide in English, the handbook on \"The Rhine\" (from Switzerland to Holland), a guide in German on Italy (), the first of a series on Italy, which his father had planned and one in French, also on Italy ().\nErnst Baedeker died unexpectedly on 23 July 1861 of sunstroke in Egypt and his younger brother, Karl, assumed charge of the publishing house.\nKarl Baedeker II.\n1861\u22121877: Karl Baedeker II (1837\u22121911) continued the work started by his brother Ernst. In addition to the ongoing revision of existing guides, he published 14 new guides: four in German, seven in English and three in French. viz.\nKarl Baedeker II worked with his younger brother Fritz, who joined the firm in 1869 as a partner and became the general manager. In 1877 (according to the source cited here) Karl, afflicted with an incurable mental condition, moved to a sanatorium near Esslingen am Neckar where he remained for the rest of his life.\nFritz Baedeker.\n1869\u22121925: Under Fritz Baedeker (1844\u22121925) the company grew rapidly. In 1870, the Baedeker bookselling business was sold. In 1872, he moved the company's headquarters from Koblenz to Leipzig, a major move forward, as most of the reputable major German publishing houses were located there.\nHe also persuaded Eduard Wagner, the Baedeker cartographer in Darmstadt, to move to Leipzig and establish a new company with Ernst Debes, a talented cartographer from \"Justus Perthes\" a leading cartography firm in Gotha. The new company was named \"Wagner and Debes\" with offices adjacent to the new Baedeker address. Herbert Warren Wind, the author of \"The House of Baedeker\"\nwrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wagner &amp; Debes made a very important contribution to the guidebooks, providing them not only with the best maps in the world, many in color, but also with superb ground plans of palaces, churches, gardens, museums and castles, and with some extraordinary panoramas of Alpine ranges and other such two-star vistas.\nHe added:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By and large, it was the sheer technical skill of the staff at Wagner &amp; Debes that kept the Baedeker guides well ahead of their rivals in this particular aspect of publishing.\nMichael Wild, the Baedeker chronicler, refers to the Baedeker maps as \"a feast for the eye.\"\nThe expansion was fast and furious. New editions were now printed by several Leipzig printers, but the bulk of the revised editions of pre-1872 guides continued to be printed where all Baedeker guides had been produced before\u2014the G.D. Baedeker printing works in Essen. Fritz ventured into territory none of his predecessors had covered before, inside and outside Europe e.g. Russia, Sweden, Norway, Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Greece, the Mediterranean, United States, Canada, India and South East Asia. Plans to publish guides on China and Japan had to be abandoned when war broke out in 1914. At home, the list of guides on German regions and cities continued to grow. His was the golden age of Baedeker travel guides.\nFritz also had the good fortune to have three of his four sons \u2212 Hans, Ernst and Dietrich \u2212 beside him in the firm, as editors and writers. Karl Baedeker III, the fourth son, entered academia and rose to become a professor of physics at the University of Jena. He was killed in action at the Battle of Li\u00e8ge in August 1914. It was his son Karl Friedrich who revived Verlag Karl Baedeker after the Second World War.\nDuring his reign, which lasted over 50 years, Fritz produced 73 new \"Baedekers\", as they came to be known universally. The Baedeker travel guides became so popular that \"baedekering\" became an English-language term for the purpose of traveling in a country to write a travel guide or travelogue about it.\nFritz Baedeker became the most successful travel guide publisher of all time and turned the publishing house into the most famous and reputable publisher of travel guides in the world. In 1909, Leipzig University conferred an honorary Ph.D. (a rare honour at the time) on him at its 500th anniversary convocation. This era in its history was brought to an end by the outbreak of World War I, after which the house of Baedeker went into decline, the victim of the post-war international geopolitical and economic conditions. Consequently, in 1920, Fritz broke with tradition and for some time thereafter, Baedeker guides to German cities and regions carried a limited amount of advertising.\nFritz Baedeker's released 39 guidebooks in German from 1872 to 1925, and 21 in English from 1872 to 1914. Twelve French titles were published between 1882 and 1910.\nHans Baedeker.\n1925\u22121943: Hans Baedeker (1874\u22121959), the eldest son of Fritz Baedeker, took charge of the company in difficult times. His two brothers, Ernst and Dietrich, were with him, running the company. The firm had lost heavily by investing in government bonds during the First World War. The war had not only wreaked havoc on tourism, it had also resulted in anti-German sentiments around the world, particularly in America and France, where the guidebooks had been very popular and from where tourists had come in droves. Rising inflation, too, played its part in affecting tourism and the balance sheet of the publishing house.\nThe Great Depression put paid to any hopes of an early recovery in its fortunes. The arrival of Nazism made things even worse for anything connected with tourism. For the Baedeker publishing house it culminated in the destruction of their headquarters in Leipzig, with total loss of the firm's archives, in the early hours of December 4, 1943 when Britain's Royal Air Force bombarded the city. See also Baedeker Blitz for Baedeker Raids.\nHans was extremely proud of what the Baedeker clan had achieved and not one to give up trying to revive the firm.\nHe received a loan from Allen &amp; Unwin, the London publishing house, which represented Baedeker in Britain, and continued to do whatever he could to rejuvenate the firm at home. On July 1, 1927, Hans celebrated the centenary of its foundation by holding a reception at the Leipzig \"Harmonie\", a popular venue for such events. The firm did make some progress and he managed to produce twelve new titles in German and five in English, though these included those commissioned by the Nazi regime. He also published the 1928 one-volume eighth and revised German edition of \"Egypt\" and in 1929 its eighth English edition, which many travel guidebooks connoisseurs and collectors consider to be the two finest Baedeker travel guides ever published.\nHans Baedeker's released 10 guidebooks in German between 1928 and 1942. Several were commissioned by the Nazis, who had been vetting Baedeker guides, proposing and effecting changes in the text, as they saw fit, and laying down to whom certain guides could be sold. Baedeker was asked to publish a guidebook for the German Army of Occupation in Poland, with history written as the Nazis wished it to be written, as the introduction to the 1943 book reveals.\nThe 1948 \"Leipzig\" was the first post-World War II Baedeker and the last one to be published in Leipzig, which was now in the Russian zone. The Russians had not granted Baedeker a publishing licence. Hans got round this by having 10,000 copies printed by the . However, after some 1000 copies had been sold, the Russians said the guidebook contained military secrets in the form of a map showing the site of their , and confiscated the remaining copies.\nNew English titles during this time were 1927's \"Tyrol and the Dolomites\", 1931's \"The Riviera\" (including South Eastern France and Corsica), an edition of \"Germany\" for the 1936 Olympic Games, and 1939's \"Madeira, Canary Islands, Azores, Western Morocco\".\nHistory (since 1948).\nKarl Friedrich Baedeker.\n1948\u22121979: Karl Friedrich Baedeker (1910\u22121979) was the son of Karl Baedeker III, who was killed in action at the Battle of Li\u00e8ge in 1914. He had worked as an editor at the firm before the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, he saw active service and rose to the rank of captain. Towards the closing stages of the war, he was taken prisoner in Austria by the Americans. After the war, he moved to Malente-Gremsm\u00fchlen in Schleswig-Holstein, where his wife and sister were living and which was in the British zone. Here, he worked in local government until 1948, latterly sorting out the Schleswig-Holstein archives when he decided to revive the family publishing business under the name of \"Karl Baedeker\". His uncle Hans had decided to stay on in Leipzig, which was now under the jurisdiction of the Russians who had not granted him a publishing licence. However, they were very close and Karl could draw on his uncle's experience to get things going. Even before the outbreak of war, Hans used to tell him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"You're the oldest Baedeker of the next generation. You will carry on.\"\nSome American, British and German publishers had tried hard to buy the 'Baedeker' name, which was still a world brand, thinking that Karl Friedrich would be only too pleased to sell. However, as he said to Herbert Warren Wind:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The war had been almost too much for us. But I never seriously considered any of the offers. I had been brought up to regard Baedeker as a family company. It was as simple as that.\"\nIn December 1949, he published his first offering\u201410,000 copies of \"Schleswig-Holstein\". This was printed in Gl\u00fcckstadt near Hamburg and contained some advertising to balance the books, as did some of his other contemporaneous titles. Allen &amp; Unwin, the London publisher, once again helped the Baedeker firm with another loan and he published more city and regional guides in the years that followed.\nIn 1951, Karl Friedrich and Oskar Steinheil, a pre-war Baedeker editor, signed an agreement with Shell AG, the subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, and Kurt Mair (1902\u20131957), the German printer and publisher based in Stuttgart, to produce a series of motoring guides. Baedeker would provide the text and Mair the finished product. The , Stuttgart was born. The slim guides called (Baedekers Shell Guides) were designed to fit into a man's jacket pocket or in the glove compartment of a car. The first ones covered Germany and were a huge success. Guides on other European countries followed in both German and English.\nKarl Friedrich was now operating on two fronts. He continued to produce city and regional guides from Malente and with the publication of his 1954 \"Berlin\" guide in German, English and French, the Baedeker brand had been well and truly re-established. Florian, his only son, was by his side and his cousin Hans, the son of his uncle Dietrich, was engaged in producing the motoring guides from Stuttgart. Dietrich's other son Otto also helped run the firm until 1971 when he left to join another publishing house.\nIn 1956, Karl Friedrich moved his field of operations from Malente to Freiburg im Breisgau. In 1972, the Stuttgart operation moved to Ostfildern/Kemnat in the district of Esslingen where Volkmar Mair, the son of Kurt Mair, was now in charge.\nWith the rise of air travel in the 1960s and 1970s, Baedeker entered a new era. In 1974, the first post-war international guidebook appeared, financed largely by the German airline Lufthansa\u2014the voluminous 872-page \"Baedekers USA\" in German, which had the look of traditional pre-war Baedekers.\nFlorian Baedeker.\nFlorian Baedeker (1943\u22121980), the only son of Karl Friedrich Baedeker, succeeded him when he died in 1979. After completing his studies in Munich in 1971, he had devoted himself to matters relating to book publishing under the guidance of his father, and had helped him with the preparation of the \"Munich\" guide, released for the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Florian also carried out most of the work involved in preparing the city guides titled Baden-Baden, Constance, Strasbourg and Wiesbaden, published in the mid-1970s.\nHe also produced several short city guides.\nBasel, the Swiss city which was first covered in a Baedeker guidebook by Karl Baedeker himself in his most celebrated guidebook \"Schweiz\", first published in 1844, was the title of Florian's own guide, published in 1978. It is considered by many to be one of his best city guides.\nFlorian Baedeker, a keen parachute jumper, was killed in a parachuting accident on October 26, 1980. He was 36.\nEva Baedeker.\nFollowing the death of Florian, his mother, Karl Friedrich's widow Eva Baedeker, n\u00e9e Konitz (1913\u22121984), piloted the firm until she died in 1984. She was the last Baedeker to play an active role in running the Baedeker publishing house founded in 1827, and negotiated the sale of the Freiburg branch to Langenscheidt before she died. However, the \"Karl Baedeker\" brand name has been retained by all subsequent owners of the company, in one form or another.\nAllianz.\nSince 1979 Baedeker travel guides have appeared as (travel guides), published in collaboration with the German insurance group Allianz. Multi-coloured with copious illustrations and in many languages, they now cover most of the popular tourist destinations in the world. Over 150 guides have been published already and the list keeps growing, as well as the number of languages in which they are published.\nIn Britain, the guides have been published in collaboration with the British Automobile Association and in the USA by Macmillan Travel, a Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan company.\nLangenscheidt.\nThe Freiburg Baedeker branch was acquired by the German publisher Langenscheidt following the death of Eva Baedeker. In 1987, both Baedeker branches, the Langenscheidt operation in Freiburg and the Baedeker Autof\u00fchrer Verlag in Stuttgart operated by the Mairs publishing group, were merged and housed together in Ostfildern/Kemnat as \"Karl Baedeker GmbH\" with a branch in Munich. The ownership of the new venture was split down the middle between Langenscheidt and Mairs.\nMairDumont.\nIn 1997, , now known as MairDumont, became the 100% owner of Verlag Karl Baedeker, along with all rights attached to Karl Baedeker's name and firm. The new English Baedekers produced by MairDumont dispensed with the \"Allianz\" logo in the title, with the German editions doing the same in 2013. This marked the beginning of a new era in the appearance and content of modern Baedekers under the catchphrase \"\" (\"Knowledge opens worlds\").\nThe previous German editions had four main sections: \"Background\", \"Tours\", \"Destinations from A to Z\" and \"Practical Information from A to Z\". MairDumont added a fifth section in each guidebook entitled \"\" (\"Experience and Enjoy\"). These new Baedeker guides were the first such guidebooks to incorporate infographics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73513", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73513", "title": "Mary, mother of Jesus", "text": "Mother of Jesus\nMary was a first-century Jewish woman of Nazareth, the wife of Joseph and the mother of Jesus. She is an important figure of Christianity, venerated under various titles such as virgin or queen, many of them mentioned in the Litany of Loreto. The Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Catholic, Evangelical Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, Methodist and Baptist churches believe that Mary, as mother of Jesus, is the Mother of God. The Church of the East historically regarded her as Christotokos, a term still used in Assyrian Church of the East liturgy. She has the highest position in Islam among all women and is mentioned numerous times in the Quran, including in a chapter named after her. She is also revered in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the Druze Faith.\nThe synoptic Gospels name Mary as the mother of Jesus. The gospels of Matthew and Luke describe Mary as a virgin who was chosen by God to conceive Jesus through the Holy Spirit. After giving birth to Jesus in Bethlehem, she and her husband Joseph raised him in the city of Nazareth in Galilee, and she was in Jerusalem at his crucifixion and with the apostles after his ascension. Although her later life is not accounted in the Bible; Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some Protestant traditions believe that her body was raised into heaven at the end of her earthly life, which is known in Western Christianity as the Assumption of Mary and in Eastern Christianity as the Dormition of the Mother of God.\nMary has been venerated since early Christianity, and is often considered to be the holiest and greatest saint. There is a certain diversity in the Mariology and devotional practices of major Christian traditions. The Catholic Church and some Oriental Orthodox Churches hold distinctive Marian dogmas, namely her Immaculate Conception and her bodily Assumption into heaven. Many Protestants hold various views of Mary's role that they perceive as being in accordance with the Scriptures. The Confessions of the Lutheran Churches have taught the three Marian dogmas of the virgin birth, Theotokos, and perpetual virginity.\nThe multiple forms of Marian devotions include various prayers and hymns, the celebration of several Marian feast days in liturgy, the veneration of images and relics, the construction of churches dedicated to her and pilgrimages to Marian shrines. Many Marian apparitions and miracles attributed to her intercession have been reported by believers over the centuries. She has been a traditional subject in arts, notably in Byzantine art, medieval art and Renaissance art.\nNames and titles.\nMary's name in the original manuscripts of the New Testament was based on her original Aramaic name , transliterated as or . The English name \"Mary\" comes from the Greek , a shortened form of the name . Both and appear in the New Testament.\nIn Christianity.\nIn Christianity, Mary is commonly referred to as the Virgin Mary, in accordance with the belief that the Holy Spirit impregnated her, thereby conceiving her first-born son Jesus miraculously, without sexual relations with her betrothed Joseph, \"until her son [Jesus] was born\". The word \"until\" has inspired considerable analysis on whether Joseph and Mary produced siblings after the birth of Jesus or not. Among her many other names and titles are the Blessed Virgin Mary (often abbreviated to \"BVM\" after the Latin ), Saint Mary (occasionally), the Mother of God (primarily in Western Christianity), the (primarily in Eastern Christianity), Our Lady (Medieval ), and Queen of Heaven (; see also here). The title \"queen of heaven\" had previously been used as an epithet for a number of goddesses, such as Isis, or Ishtar.\nTitles in use vary among Anglicans, Lutherans and other Protestants, as well as Mormons, Catholics, Orthodox and other Christians.\nThe three main titles for Mary used by the Orthodox are ( or \"God-bearer\"), () which means ever-virgin, as confirmed in the Second Council of Constantinople in 553, and () meaning \"all-holy\". Catholics use a wide variety of titles for Mary, and these titles have in turn given rise to many artistic depictions.\nThe title , which means \"God-bearer\", was recognized at the Council of Ephesus in 431. The direct equivalents of title in Latin are and , although the phrase is more often loosely translated into Latin as (\"Mother of God\"), with similar patterns for other languages used in the Latin Church. However, this same phrase in Greek (), in the abbreviated form , is an indication commonly attached to her image in Byzantine icons. The Council stated that the Church Fathers \"did not hesitate to speak of the holy Virgin as the Mother of God\".\nSome Marian titles have a direct scriptural basis. For instance, the title \"Queen Mother\" has been given to Mary, as she was the mother of Jesus, sometimes referred to as the \"King of Kings\" due to his ancestral descent from King David. This is also based on the Hebrew tradition of the \"Queen-Mother\", the Gebirah or \"Great Lady\". Other titles have arisen from reported miracles, special appeals, or occasions for calling on Mary.\nIn Islam.\nIn Islam, Mary is known as Maryam (), mother of Isa (, , lit.\u2009'Jesus, son of Mary'). She is often referred to by the honorific title , meaning \"Our Lady\"; this title is in parallel to (\"Our Lord\"), used for the prophets. A related term of endearment is , meaning \"she who confirms the truth\" and \"she who believes sincerely completely\". Another title for Mary is , which signifies both constant submission to God and absorption in prayer and invocation in Islam. She is also called , meaning \"one who has been purified\" and representing her status as one of two humans in creation to not be touched by Satan at any point, the other being Jesus. In the Quran, she is described both as \"the daughter of Imran\" and \"the sister of Aaron\" and Moses, alluding to Miriam from the Hebrew Bible. However, the title of \"the sister of Aaron\" is confirmed to be metaphorical (which is a common figure of speech in Arabic) as per a Hadith from the Islamic prophet Muhammad explaining Mary was indeed named after Miriam.\nLife in ancient sources.\nNew Testament.\nThe canonical Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are the primary sources of historical information about Mary. They are almost contemporary sources, as the synoptic Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are generally considered dating from around AD 66\u201390, while the gospel of John dates from AD 90\u2013110. They provide limited information about Mary, as they primarily focus on the teaching of Jesus and on his apostles. The historical reliability of the Gospels and historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles are subject to debate, as it was common practice in early Christian writings to mix historical facts with legendary stories.\nThe earliest New Testament account of Mary is in the epistle to the Galatians, which was written before the gospels. She is referred to as \"a woman\" and is not named: \"But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law\" (Galatians 4:4).\nMary is mentioned several times in the canonical Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles:\nIn the Book of Revelation, also part of the New Testament, the \"woman clothed with the sun\" (Revelation 12:1, 12:5\u20136) is sometimes identified as Mary.\nGenealogy.\nThe New Testament tells little of Mary's early history. The Gospel of Matthew gives a genealogy for Jesus by his father's paternal line, only identifying Mary as the wife of Joseph. John 19:25 states that Mary had a sister; semantically it is unclear if this sister is the same as Mary of Clopas, or if she is left unnamed. Jerome identifies Mary of Clopas as the sister of Mary, mother of Jesus. According to the early 2nd century historian Hegesippus, Mary of Clopas was likely Mary's sister-in-law, understanding Clopas (Cleophas) to have been Joseph's brother.\nAccording to the writer of Luke, Mary was a relative of Elizabeth, wife of the priest Zechariah of the priestly division of Abijah, who was herself part of the lineage of Aaron and so of the Tribe of Levi. Some of those who believe that the relationship with Elizabeth was on the maternal side, believe that Mary, like Joseph, was of the royal Davidic line and so of the Tribe of Judah, and that the genealogy of Jesus presented in Luke 3 from Nathan, is in fact the genealogy of Mary, while the genealogy from Solomon given in Matthew 1 is that of Joseph. (Aaron's wife Elisheba was of the tribe of Judah, so all their descendants are from both Levi and Judah.)\nAnnunciation.\nMary resided in \"her own house\" in Nazareth in Galilee, possibly with her parents, and during her betrothal\u2014the first stage of a Jewish marriage. Jewish girls were considered marriageable at the age of twelve years and six months, though the actual age of the bride varied with circumstances. The marriage was preceded by the betrothal, after which the bride legally belonged to the bridegroom, though she did not live with him till about a year later, when the marriage was celebrated.\nThe angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah by conceiving him through the Holy Spirit, and, after initially expressing incredulity at the announcement, she responded, \"I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be done unto me according to your word.\" Joseph planned to quietly divorce her, but was told her conception was by the Holy Spirit in a dream by \"an angel of the Lord\"; the angel told him to not hesitate to take her as his wife, which Joseph did, thereby formally completing the wedding rites.\nSince the angel Gabriel had told Mary that Elizabeth\u2014having previously been barren\u2014was then miraculously pregnant, Mary hurried to see Elizabeth, who was living with her husband Zechariah in \"the hill country..., [in] a city of Juda\". Mary arrived at the house and greeted Elizabeth who called Mary \"the mother of my Lord\", and Mary spoke the words of praise that later became known as the from her first word in the Latin version. After about three months, Mary returned to her own house.\nBirth of Jesus.\nAccording to the gospel of Luke, a decree of the Roman Emperor Augustus required that Joseph return to his hometown of Bethlehem to register for a Roman census. While he was there with Mary, she gave birth to Jesus; but because there was no place for them in the inn, she used a manger as a cradle. It is not told how old Mary was at the time of the Nativity, but attempts have been made to infer it from the age of a typical Jewish mother of that time. Mary Joan Winn Leith represents the view that Jewish girls typically married soon after the onset of puberty, while according to Amram Tropper, Jewish females generally married later in Palestine and the Western Diaspora than in Babylonia. Some scholars hold the view that among them it typically happened between their mid and late teen years or late teens and early twenties. After eight days, the boy was circumcised according to Jewish law and named \"Jesus\" (, ), which means \"Yahweh is salvation\".\nAfter Mary continued in the \"blood of her purifying\" another 33 days, for a total of 40 days, she brought her burnt offering and sin offering to the Temple in Jerusalem (Luke 2:22), so the priest could make atonement for her. They also presented Jesus\u00a0\u2013 \"As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord\" (Luke 2:23; Exodus 13:2; 23:12\u201315; 22:29; 34:19\u201320; Numbers 3:13; 18:15). After the prophecies of Simeon and the prophetess Anna in Luke 2:25\u201338, the family \"returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth\".\nAccording to the gospel of Matthew, magi coming from Eastern regions arrived at Bethlehem where Jesus and his family were living, and worshiped him. Joseph was then warned in a dream that King Herod wanted to murder the infant, and the family fled by night to Egypt and stayed there for some time. After Herod's death in 4\u00a0BC, they returned to Nazareth in Galilee, rather than Bethlehem, because Herod's son Archelaus was the ruler of Judaea.\nMary is involved in the only event in Jesus' adolescent life that is recorded in the New Testament. At the age of 12, Jesus, having become separated from his parents on their return journey from the Passover celebration in Jerusalem, was found in the Temple among the religious teachers.\nMinistry of Jesus.\nMary was present when, at her suggestion, Jesus worked his first miracle during a wedding at Cana by turning water into wine. Subsequently, there are events when Mary is mentioned along with the Jesus' brothers. According to Epiphanius, Origen and Eusebius, these \"brothers\" would be sons of Joseph from a previous marriage. This view is still the official position of the Eastern Orthodox churches. Following Jerome, those would be actually Jesus' cousins, children of Mary's sister. This remains the official Roman Catholic position. For Helvidius, those would be full siblings of Jesus, born to Mary and Joseph after the firstborn Jesus. This has been the most common Protestant position.\nThe hagiography of Mary and the Holy Family can be contrasted with other material in the Gospels. These references include an incident which can be interpreted as Jesus rejecting his family in the New Testament: \"And his mother and his brothers arrived, and standing outside, they sent in a message asking for him ... And looking at those who sat in a circle around him, Jesus said, 'These are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother'.\"\nMary is also depicted as being present in a group of women at the crucifixion standing near the disciple whom Jesus loved along with Mary of Clopas and Mary Magdalene, to which list Matthew 27:56 adds \"the mother of the sons of Zebedee\", presumably the Salome mentioned in Mark 15:40.\nAfter the Ascension of Jesus.\nIn Acts 1:12\u201326, especially verse 14, Mary is the only one other than the eleven apostles to be mentioned by name who abode in the upper room, when they returned from Mount Olivet. Her presence with the apostles during the Pentecost is not explicit, although it has been held as a fact by Christian tradition.\nFrom this time, she disappears from the biblical accounts, although it is held by Catholics that she is again portrayed as the heavenly woman in the Book of Revelation.\nHer death is not recorded in the scriptures, but Orthodox tradition, tolerated also by Catholics, has her first dying a natural death, known as the Dormition of Mary, and then, soon after, her body itself also being assumed (taken bodily) into Heaven. Belief in the corporeal assumption of Mary is a dogma of the Catholic Church, in the Latin and Eastern Catholic Churches alike, and is believed as well by the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, and parts of the Anglican Communion and Continuing Anglican movement.\nApocryphal accounts and later writings.\nSome apocryphal texts add further narrative elements to the story of Mary, although scholars generally consider such texts to be historically mainly unreliable. According to the Gospel of James, Mary was the daughter of Joachim and Anne. Before Mary's conception, Anne had been barren and was far advanced in years. Mary was given to service as a consecrated virgin in the Temple in Jerusalem when she was three years old. This event is commemorated by some Christian churches as a liturgical feast, the Presentation of Mary, even though its premise conflicts with common understandings of Jewish culture and temple customs. The Gospel of James also states that Mary was 12\u201314 years old at the time of her betrothal to Joseph and that she was 16\u201317 during her pregnancy, according to most manuscripts. According to ancient Jewish custom, Mary could have been betrothed at 12, but some scholars hold the view that in Judea betrothal typically happened later. The text underlines that the relationship between Mary and Joseph was a non-sexual social arrangement, and that Mary was dedicated to God. It emphasizes holiness of Mary and the virginal nature of her pregnancy.\nAlthough the canonical gospels contain no account of Mary's life after the resurrection, texts written centuries later provide some embellishment. The origin and authenticity of these details are unknown. The earliest extant biographical writing on Mary is \"Life of the Virgin\", attributed to the 7th-century saint Maximus the Confessor, which portrays her as a key element of the early Christian Church after the death of Jesus. Hyppolitus of Thebes, writing in the 7th or 8th century, says that Mary lived for 11 years after the death of her son, dying in 41 AD.\nReligious perspectives.\nChristian.\nChristian Marian perspectives include a great deal of diversity. While some Christians such as Catholics and Eastern Orthodox have well established Marian traditions, Protestants at large pay scant attention to Mariological themes. Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutherans and Anglicans venerate the Virgin Mary. This veneration especially takes the form of prayer for intercession with her Son, Jesus Christ. Additionally, it includes composing poems and songs in Mary's honor, painting icons or carving statues of her, and conferring titles on Mary that reflect her position among the saints.\nCatholic.\nIn the Catholic Church, Mary is accorded the title \"Blessed\" (, , ) in recognition of her assumption to Heaven and her capacity to intercede on behalf of those who pray to her. There is a difference between the usage of the term \"blessed\" as pertaining to Mary and its usage as pertaining to a beatified person. \"Blessed\" as a Marian title refers to her exalted state as being the greatest among the saints; for a person who has been declared beatified, on the other hand, \"blessed\" simply indicates that they may be venerated despite not being canonized. Catholic teachings make clear that Mary is not considered divine and prayers to her are not answered by her, but rather by God through her intercession. The four Catholic dogmas regarding Mary are: her status as , or Mother of God; her perpetual virginity; the Immaculate Conception; and her bodily Assumption into Heaven.\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus has a more central role in Roman Catholic teachings and beliefs than in any other major Christian group. Not only do Roman Catholics have more theological doctrines and teachings that relate to Mary, but they have more feasts, prayers, devotional and venerative practices than any other group. The \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" states: \"The Church's devotion to the Blessed Virgin is intrinsic to Christian worship.\"\nFor centuries, Catholics have performed acts of consecration and entrustment to Mary at personal, societal and regional levels. These acts may be directed to the Virgin herself, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and to the Immaculate Conception. In Catholic teachings, consecration to Mary does not diminish or substitute the love of God, but enhances it, for all consecration is ultimately made to God.\nFollowing the growth of Marian devotions in the 16th century, Catholic saints wrote books such as \"Glories of Mary\" and \"True Devotion to Mary\" that emphasized Marian veneration and taught that \"the path to Jesus is through Mary\". Marian devotions are at times linked to Christocentric devotions (such as the Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary).\nMajor Marian devotions include: Seven Sorrows of Mary, Rosary and scapular, Miraculous Medal and Reparations to Mary. The months of May and October are traditionally \"Marian months\" for Roman Catholics; the daily rosary is encouraged in October and in May Marian devotions take place in many regions. Popes have issued a number of Marian encyclicals and Apostolic Letters to encourage devotions to and the veneration of the Virgin Mary.\nCatholics place high emphasis on Mary's roles as protector and intercessor and the \"Catechism\" refers to Mary as \"honored with the title 'Mother of God', to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs\". Key Marian prayers include: , , , , , and the .\nMary's participation in the processes of salvation and redemption has also been emphasized in the Catholic tradition, but they are not doctrines. Pope John Paul II's 1987 encyclical began with the sentence: \"The Mother of the Redeemer has a precise place in the plan of salvation.\"\nIn the 20th century, both popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI emphasized the Marian focus of the Catholic Church. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) suggested a redirection of the whole church towards the program of Pope John Paul II in order to ensure an authentic approach to Christology via a return to the \"whole truth about Mary,\" writing:\n\"It is necessary to go back to Mary if we want to return to that 'truth about Jesus Christ,' 'truth about the Church' and 'truth about man.'\"\nThere is significant diversity in the Marian doctrines attributed to her primarily by the Catholic Church. The key Marian doctrines held primarily in Catholicism can be briefly outlined as follows:\nThe acceptance of these Marian doctrines by Roman Catholics and other Christians can be summarized as follows:\nThe title \"Mother of God\" () for Mary was confirmed by the First Council of Ephesus, held at the Church of Mary in 431. The Council decreed that Mary is the Mother of God because her son Jesus is one person who is both God and man, divine and human. This doctrine is widely accepted by Christians in general, and the term \"Mother of God\" had already been used within the oldest known prayer to Mary, the , which dates to around 250 AD.\nThe Virgin birth of Jesus was an almost universally held belief among Christians from the 2nd until the 19th century. It is included in the two most widely used Christian creeds, which state that Jesus \"was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary\" (the Nicene Creed, in what is now its familiar form) and the Apostles' Creed. The Gospel of Matthew describes Mary as a virgin who fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14, The authors of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke consider Jesus' conception not the result of intercourse, and assert that Mary had \"no relations with man\" before Jesus' birth. This alludes to the belief that Mary conceived Jesus through the action of God the Holy Spirit, and not through intercourse with Joseph or anyone else.\nThe doctrines of the Assumption or Dormition of Mary relate to her death and bodily assumption to heaven. Roman Catholic Church has dogmatically defined the doctrine of the Assumption, which was done in 1950 by Pope Pius XII in . Whether Mary died or not is not defined dogmatically, however, although a reference to the death of Mary is made in . In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary is believed, and celebrated with her Dormition, where they believe she died.\nCatholics believe in the Immaculate Conception of Mary, as proclaimed by Pope Pius IX in 1854, namely that she was filled with grace from the very moment of her conception in her mother's womb and preserved from the stain of original sin. The Latin Church has a liturgical feast by that name, kept on 8 December. Orthodox Christians reject the Immaculate Conception dogma principally because their understanding of ancestral sin (the Greek term corresponding to the Latin \"original sin\") differs from the Augustinian interpretation and that of the Catholic Church.\nThe Perpetual Virginity of Mary asserts Mary's real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving birth to the Son of God made Man. The term Ever-Virgin (Greek ) is applied in this case, stating that Mary remained a virgin for the remainder of her life, making Jesus her biological and only son, whose conception and birth are held to be miraculous. The Orthodox Churches hold the position articulated in the Protoevangelium of James that Jesus' brothers and sisters were Joseph's children from a marriage prior to that of Mary, which had left him widowed. Roman Catholic teaching follows the Latin father Jerome in considering them Jesus' cousins.\nEastern Orthodox.\nEastern Orthodox Christianity includes a large number of traditions regarding the Ever-Virgin Mary, the . The Orthodox believe that she was and remained a virgin before and after Christ's birth. The (hymns to the Theotokos) are an essential part of the Divine Services in the Eastern Church and their positioning within the liturgical sequence effectively places the in the most prominent place after Christ. Within the Orthodox tradition, the order of the saints begins with: the , Angels, Prophets, Apostles, Fathers and Martyrs, giving the Virgin Mary precedence over the angels. She is also proclaimed as the \"Lady of the Angels\".\nThe views of the Church Fathers still play an important role in the shaping of Orthodox Marian perspective. However, the Orthodox views on Mary are mostly doxological, rather than academic: they are expressed in hymns, praise, liturgical poetry, and the veneration of icons. One of the most loved Orthodox Akathists (standing hymns) is devoted to Mary and it is often simply called the \"Akathist Hymn\". Five of the twelve Great Feasts in Orthodoxy are dedicated to Mary. The Sunday of Orthodoxy directly links the Virgin Mary's identity as Mother of God with icon veneration.\nA number of Orthodox feasts are connected with the miraculous icons of the .\nThe Orthodox view Mary as \"superior to all created beings\", although not divine. As such, the designation of Saint to Mary as Saint Mary is not appropriate. The Orthodox does not venerate Mary as conceived immaculate. Gregory of Nazianzus, Archbishop of Constantinople in the 4th century AD, speaking on the Nativity of Jesus Christ argues that \"Conceived by the Virgin, who first in body and soul was purified by the Holy Ghost, He came forth as God with that which He had assumed, One Person in two Natures, Flesh and Spirit, of which the latter defined the former.\" The Orthodox celebrate the Dormition of the Theotokos, rather than Assumption.\nThe Protoevangelium of James, an extra-canonical book, has been the source of many Orthodox beliefs on Mary. The account of Mary's life presented includes her consecration as a virgin at the temple at age three. The high priest Zachariah blessed Mary and informed her that God had magnified her name among many generations. Zachariah placed Mary on the third step of the altar, whereby God gave her grace. While in the temple, Mary was miraculously fed by an angel, until she was 12 years old. At that point, an angel told Zachariah to betroth Mary to a widower in Israel, who would be indicated. This story provides the theme of many hymns for the Feast of Presentation of Mary, and icons of the feast depict the story. The Orthodox believe that Mary was instrumental in the growth of Christianity during the life of Jesus, and after his Crucifixion, and Orthodox theologian Sergei Bulgakov has written: \"The Virgin Mary is the centre, invisible, but real, of the Apostolic Church.\"\nTheologians from the Orthodox tradition have made prominent contributions to the development of Marian thought and devotion.\nJohn Damascene (c.\u2009650\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009750) was one of the greatest Orthodox theologians. Among other Marian writings, he proclaimed the essential nature of Mary's heavenly Assumption or Dormition and her meditative role.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was necessary that the body of the one who preserved her virginity intact in giving birth should also be kept incorrupt after death. It was necessary that she, who carried the Creator in her womb when he was a baby, should dwell among the tabernacles of heaven.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From her we have harvested the grape of life; from her we have cultivated the seed of immortality. For our sake she became Mediatrix of all blessings; in her God became man, and man became God.\nMore recently, Sergei Bulgakov expressed the Orthodox sentiments towards Mary as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mary is not merely the instrument, but the direct positive condition of the Incarnation, its human aspect. Christ could not have been incarnate by some mechanical process, violating human nature. It was necessary for that nature itself to say for itself, by the mouth of the most pure human being: \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to Thy word.\"\nProtestant.\nProtestants in general reject the veneration and invocation of the Saints. They share the belief that Mary is the mother of Jesus and \"blessed among women\" (Luke 1:42) but they generally do not agree that Mary is to be venerated. She is considered to be an outstanding example of a life dedicated to God. As such, they tend not to accept certain church doctrines such as her being preserved from sin. Theologian Karl Barth wrote that \"the heresy of the Catholic Church is its Mariology\".\nEarly Protestantism had high regard for Mary. Martin Luther wrote that: \"Mary is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin. God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil.\" John Calvin remarked, \"It cannot be denied that God in choosing and destining Mary to be the Mother of his Son, granted her the highest honor.\" However, Calvin firmly rejected the notion that Mary can intercede between Christ and man.\nAlthough Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli honored Mary as the Mother of Christ in the 16th century, they did so less than Martin Luther. Thus the idea of respect and high honor for Mary was not rejected by the first Protestants; however, they came to criticize the Roman Catholics for venerating Mary. Following the Council of Trent in the 16th century, as Marian veneration became associated with Catholics, Protestant interest in Mary decreased. During the Age of the Enlightenment, any residual interest in Mary within Protestant churches almost disappeared, although Anglicans and Lutherans continued to honor her.\nIn the 20th century, some Protestants reacted in opposition to the Catholic dogma of the Assumption of Mary. The tone of the Second Vatican Council began to mend the ecumenical differences, and Protestants began to show interest in Marian themes. In 1997 and 1998, ecumenical dialogues between Catholics and Protestants took place, but, to date, the majority of Protestants disagree with Marian veneration and some view it as a challenge to the authority of Scripture.\nLutheran.\nEvangelical-Lutheranism regards her as the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", with this codified in the Formula of Concord. The Evangelical-Lutheran Churches celebrate several Marian feast days, including the Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Formula of Concord and the Smalcald Articles, upheld by the Lutheran Churches, teach the three Marian dogmas of the virgin birth, \"Theotokos\" and the perpetual virginity of Mary. The Apology of the Augsburg Confession teaches that \"blessed Mary prays for the Church\".\nTheologians agree that Martin Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some 300 years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Therefore, when we preach faith, that we should worship nothing but God alone, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we say in the Creed: 'I believe in God the Father almighty and in Jesus Christ,' then we are remaining in the temple at Jerusalem. Again,'This is my beloved Son; listen to him.' 'You will find him in a manger'. He alone does it. But reason says the opposite:\nWhat, us? Are we to worship only Christ? Indeed, shouldn't we also honor the holy mother of Christ? She is the woman who bruised the head of the serpent. Hear us, Mary, for thy Son so honors thee that he can refuse thee nothing. Here Bernard went too far in his \"Homilies on the Gospel: Missus est Angelus\". God has commanded that we should honor the parents; therefore I will call upon Mary. She will intercede for me with the Son, and the Son with the Father, who will listen to the Son. So you have the picture of God as angry and Christ as judge; Mary shows to Christ her breast and Christ shows his wounds to the wrathful Father. That's the kind of thing this comely bride, the wisdom of reason cooks up: Mary is the mother of Christ, surely Christ will listen to her; Christ is a stern judge, therefore I will call upon St. George and St. Christopher. No, we have been by God's command baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, just as the Jews were circumcised.\nCertain Lutheran churches such as the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church venerate Mary and the saints in the same manner that Roman Catholics do, and hold all Marian dogmas as part of their faith.\nAnglican.\nThe various churches that form the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement have different views on Marian doctrines and venerative practices given that there is no single church with universal authority within the Communion and that the mother church (the Church of England) understands itself to be both \"Catholic\" and \"Reformed\". The Anglican Communion includes segments which still retain some veneration of Mary.\nMary's special position within God's purpose of salvation as \"God-bearer\" is recognized in a number of ways by some Anglican Christians. All the member churches of the Anglican Communion affirm in the historic creeds that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary, and celebrates the feast days of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. This feast is called in older prayer books the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary on 2 February. The Annunciation of our Lord to the Blessed Virgin on 25 March was from before the time of Bede until the 18th century New Year's Day in England. The Annunciation is called the \"Annunciation of our Lady\" in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. Anglicans also celebrate in the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin on 31 May, though in some provinces the traditional date of 2 July is kept. The feast of the St. Mary the Virgin is observed on the traditional day of the Assumption, 15 August. The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin is kept on 8 September.\nThe Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary is kept in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, on 8 December. In certain Anglican parishes of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, this feast is called the Immaculate Conception. Again, the Assumption of Mary is believed in by most Anglo-Catholics, but is considered a pious opinion by moderate Anglicans. Reformed Anglicans reject the celebration of these feasts.\nPrayers and venerative practices vary greatly. For instance, as of the 19th century, following the Oxford Movement, Anglo-Catholics frequently pray the Rosary, the , , and other litanies and anthems of Mary reminiscent of Catholic practices. Conversely, low church Anglicans rarely invoke the Blessed Virgin except in certain hymns, such as the second stanza of \"Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones\".\nThe Anglican Society of Mary was formed in 1931 and maintains chapters in many countries. The purpose of the society is to foster devotion to Mary among Anglicans. High church Anglicans espouse doctrines that are closer to Roman Catholics, and retain veneration for Mary, such as Anglican pilgrimages to Our Lady of Lourdes, which have taken place since 1963, and pilgrimages to Our Lady of Walsingham, which have taken place for hundreds of years.\nHistorically, there has been enough common ground between Roman Catholics and Anglicans on Marian issues that in 2005, a joint statement called \"Mary: grace and hope in Christ\" was produced through ecumenical meetings of Anglicans and Roman Catholic theologians. This document, informally known as the \"Seattle Statement\", is not formally endorsed by either the Catholic Church or the Anglican Communion, but is viewed by its authors as the beginning of a joint understanding of Mary.\nMethodist.\nMethodists do not have any additional teachings on the Virgin Mary except from what is mentioned in Scripture and the ecumenical Creeds. As such, Methodists generally accept the doctrine of the virgin birth, but reject the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. John Wesley, the principal founder of the Methodist movement within the Church of England, believed that Mary \"continued a pure and unspotted virgin\", thus upholding the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary. Contemporary Methodism holds that Mary was a virgin before, during, and immediately after the birth of Christ. In addition, some Methodists also hold the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary as a pious opinion.\nNontrinitarian.\nNontrinitarians, such as Unitarians, Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Latter Day Saints also acknowledge Mary as the biological mother of Jesus Christ, but most reject any immaculate conception and do not recognize Marian titles such as \"Mother of God\". The Latter Day Saint movement's view affirms the virgin birth of Jesus and Christ's divinity, but only as a separate being than God the Father. The Book of Mormon refers to Mary by name in prophecies and describes her as \"most beautiful and fair above all other virgins\" and as a \"precious and chosen vessel.\"\nIn nontrinitarian groups that are also Christian mortalists, Mary is not seen as an intercessor between humankind and Jesus, whom mortalists would consider \"asleep\", awaiting resurrection.\nJewish.\nThe issue of the parentage of Jesus in the Talmud also affects Jewish views of Mary. However, the Talmud does not mention Mary by name, and is considerate rather than only polemic. The story about Panthera is also found in the , the literary origins of which can not be traced with any certainty, and given that it is unlikely to go before the 4th century, the time is too late to include authentic remembrances of Jesus. \"The Blackwell Companion to Jesus\" states that the has no historical facts and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity. The tales from the did impart a negative picture of Mary to ordinary Jewish readers. The circulation of the was widespread among European and Middle Eastern Jewish communities since the 9th century. The name Panthera may be a distortion of the term (\"virgin\") and Raymond E. Brown considers the story of Panthera a fanciful explanation of the birth of Jesus that includes very little historical evidence. Robert Van Voorst states that because is a medieval document with its lack of a fixed form and orientation towards a popular audience, it is \"most unlikely\" to have reliable historical information. Stacks of the copies of the Talmud were burnt upon a court order after the 1240 Disputation for allegedly containing material defaming the character of Mary.\nIslamic.\nThe Virgin Mary holds a singularly exalted place in Islam, and she is considered by the Quran to have been the greatest woman in the history of humankind. The Islamic scripture recounts the Divine Promise given to Mary as being: \"\"O Mary! Surely Allah has selected you, purified you, and chosen you over all women of the world\" ( https://).\nMary is often referred to by Muslims by the honorific title (\"Our Lady\"). She is mentioned in the Quran as the daughter of Imran.\nMoreover, Mary is the only woman named in the Quran and she is mentioned or referred to in the scripture a total of 50 times. Mary holds a singularly distinguished and honored position among women in the Quran. A (chapter) in the Quran is titled \"Maryam\" (Mary), the only in the Quran named after a woman, in which the story of Mary (Maryam) and Jesus (Isa) is recounted according to the view of Jesus in Islam.\nBirth.\nIn a narration of hadith from Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, he mentions that Allah revealed to Imran, \"I will grant you a boy, blessed, one who will cure the blind and the leper and one who will raise the dead by My permission. And I will send him as an apostle to the Children of Israel.\" Then Imran related the story to his wife, Hannah, the mother of Mary. When she became pregnant, she conceived it was a boy, but when she gave birth to a girl, she stated \"Oh my Lord! Verily I have delivered a female, and the male is not like the female, for a girl will not be a prophet,\" to which Allah replies in the Quran, \"Allah knows better what has been delivered\" (3:36). When Allah bestowed Jesus to Mary, he fulfilled his promise to Imran.\nMotherhood.\nMary was declared (uniquely along with Jesus) to be a \"Sign of God\" to humanity; as one who \"guarded her chastity\"; an \"obedient one\"; and dedicated by her mother to Allah whilst still in the womb; uniquely (amongst women) \"Accepted into service by God\"; cared for by (one of the prophets according to Islam) Zakariya (Zacharias); that in her childhood she resided in the Temple and uniquely had access to Al-Mihrab (understood to be the Holy of Holies), and was provided with heavenly \"provisions\" by God.\nMary is also called a \"Chosen One\"; a \"Purified One\"; a \"Truthful one\"; her child conceived through \"a Word from God\"; and \"chosen you above the women of the worlds(the material and heavenly worlds)\".\nThe Quran relates detailed narrative accounts of Maryam (Mary) in two places, https:// and https://. These state beliefs in both the Immaculate Conception of Mary and the virgin birth of Jesus. The account given in Surah Maryam https:// is nearly identical with that in the Gospel according to Luke, and both of these (Luke, Sura 19) begin with an account of the visitation of an angel upon Zakariya (Zecharias) and \"Good News of the birth of Yahya (John)\", followed by the account of the annunciation. It mentions how Mary was informed by an angel that she would become the mother of Jesus through the actions of God alone.\nIn the Islamic tradition, Mary and Jesus were the only children who could not be touched by Satan at the moment of their birth, for God imposed a veil between them and Satan. According to the author Shabbir Akhtar, the Islamic perspective on Mary's Immaculate Conception is compatible with the Catholic doctrine of the same topic. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes regarding your faith; say nothing about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of Allah and the fulfilment of His Word through Mary and a spirit \u02f9created by a command\u02fa from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say, \"Trinity.\" Stop!\u2014for your own good. Allah is only One God. Glory be to Him! He is far above having a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.\nThe Quran says that Jesus was the result of a virgin birth. The most detailed account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus is provided in Suras 3 and 19 of the Quran, where it is written that God sent an angel to announce that she could shortly expect to bear a son, despite being a virgin.\nDruze Faith.\nThe Druze faith holds the Virgin Mary, known as \"Sayyida Maryam\", in high regard. Although the Druze religion is distinct from mainstream Islam and Christianity, it incorporates elements from both and honors many of their figures, including the Virgin Mary. The Druze revere Mary as a holy and pure figure, embodying virtue and piety. She is respected not only for her role as the mother of Messiah Jesus but also for her spiritual purity and dedication to God. In regions where Druze and Christians coexist, such as parts of Lebanon, Syria and Israel, the veneration of Mary often reflects a blend of traditions. Shared pilgrimage sites and mutual respect for places like the Church of Saidet et Tall\u00e9 in Deir el Qamar, the Our Lady of Lebanon shrine in Harrisa, the Our Lady of Saidnaya Monastery in Saidnaya, and the Stella Maris Monastery in Haifa exemplify this.\nHistorical records and writings by authors like Pierre-Marie Martin and Glenn Bowman show that Druze leaders and community members have historically shown deep reverence for Marian sites. They often sought her intercession before battles or during times of need, demonstrating a cultural and spiritual integration of Marian veneration into their religious practices.\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith venerates Mary as the mother of Jesus. The , the primary theological work of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion, describes Mary as \"that most beauteous countenance,\" and \"that veiled and immortal Countenance.\" The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings claim Jesus Christ was \"conceived of the Holy Ghost\" and assert that in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith \"the reality of the mystery of the Immaculacy of the Virgin Mary is confessed.\"\nBiblical scholars.\nThe statement found in that Joseph did not have sexual relations with Mary before she gave birth to Jesus has been debated among scholars, with some saying that she did not remain a virgin and some saying that she was a perpetual virgin. Other scholars contend that the Greek word (\"until\") denotes a state up to a point, but does not mean that the state ended after that point, and that Matthew 1:25 does not confirm or deny the virginity of Mary after the birth of Jesus. According to Biblical scholar Bart Ehrman, the Hebrew word , meaning young woman of childbearing age, was translated into Greek as , which often, though not always, refers to a young woman who has never had sex. In Isaiah 7:14, it is commonly believed by Christians to be the prophecy of the Virgin Mary referred to in Matthew 1:23. While Matthew and Luke give differing versions of the virgin birth, John quotes the uninitiated Philip and the disbelieving Jews gathered at Galilee referring to Joseph as Jesus' father.\nOther biblical verses have also been debated; for example, the reference made by Paul the Apostle that Jesus was made \"of the seed of David according to the flesh\" (Romans 1:3) meaning that he was a descendant of David through Joseph.\nPre-Christian Rome.\nFrom the early stages of Christianity, belief in the virginity of Mary and the virgin conception of Jesus, as stated in the gospels, holy and supernatural, was used by detractors, both political and religious, as a topic for discussions, debates, and writings, specifically aimed to challenge the divinity of Jesus and thus Christians and Christianity alike. In the 2nd century, as part of his anti-Christian polemic \"The True Word\", the pagan philosopher Celsus contended that Jesus was actually the illegitimate son of a Roman soldier named Panthera. The Church Father Origen dismissed this assertion as a complete fabrication in his apologetic treatise \"Against Celsus\". How far Celsus sourced his view from Jewish sources remains a subject of discussion.\nChristian devotions.\nHistory.\n2nd century.\nJustin Martyr was among the first to draw a parallel between Eve and Mary. This derives from his comparison of Adam and Jesus. In his \"Dialogue with Trypho\", written sometime between 155 and 167, he explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He became man by the Virgin, in order that the disobedience which proceeded from the serpent might receive its destruction in the same manner in which it derived its origin. For Eve, who was a virgin and undefiled, having conceived the word of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death. But the Virgin Mary received faith and joy, when the angel Gabriel announced the good tidings to her that the Spirit of the Lord would come upon her, and the power of the Highest would overshadow her: wherefore also the Holy Thing begotten of her is the Son of God; and she replied, 'Be it unto me according to thy word.\" And by her has He been born, to whom we have proved so many scriptures refer, and by whom God destroys both the serpent and those angels and men who are like him; but works deliverance from death to those who repent of their wickedness and believe upon Him.\nIt is possible that the teaching of Mary as the New Eve was part of the apostolic tradition rather than merely Justin Martyr's own creation, according to Serafim Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. Irenaeus, bishop of Lyon, also takes up this parallel, in \"Against Heresies\", written about the year 182:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In accordance with this design, Mary the Virgin is found obedient, saying, \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word.\" Luke 1:38 But Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin. ... having become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race; so also did Mary, having a man betrothed [to her], and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race. And on this account does the law term a woman betrothed to a man, the wife of him who had betrothed her, although she was as yet a virgin; thus indicating the back-reference from Mary to Eve...For the Lord, having been born \"the First-begotten of the dead,\" Revelation 1:5 and receiving into His bosom the ancient fathers, has regenerated them into the life of God, He having been made Himself the beginning of those that live, as Adam became the beginning of those who die. 1 Corinthians 15:20\u201322 Wherefore also Luke, commencing the genealogy with the Lord, carried it back to Adam, indicating that it was He who regenerated them into the Gospel of life, and not they Him. And thus also it was that the knot of Eve's disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith.\nDuring the second century, the Gospel of James was also written. According to Stephen J. Shoemaker, \"its interest in Mary as a figure in her own right and its reverence for her sacred purity mark the beginnings of Marian piety within early Christianity\".\n3rd to 5th centuries.\nDuring the Age of Martyrs and at the latest in the fourth century, the majority of the most essential ideas of Marian devotion already appeared in some form \u2013 in the writings of the Church Fathers, apocrypha and visual arts. The lack of sources makes it unclear whether the devotion to Mary played a role in liturgical use during the first centuries of Christianity. In the 4th century, Marian devotion in a liturgical context becomes evident.\nThe earliest known Marian prayer (the , or \"Beneath Thy Protection\") is from the 3rd century (perhaps 270), and its text was rediscovered in 1917 on a papyrus in Egypt. According to some sources, Theonas of Alexandria consecrated one of the first holy places dedicated to Mary during the late 3rd century. An even earlier place has been found in Nazareth, dated to the previous century by some scholars. Following the Edict of Milan in 313, by the 5th century artistic images of Mary began to appear in public and larger churches were being dedicated to Mary, such as the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. At the Council of Ephesus in 431, Mary was officially declared the \"Theotokos\", meaning \"God-bearer\" or \"Mother of God\". The term had possibly been used for centuries or at least since the early 300s, when it seems to have already been in established use.\nThe Council of Ephesus was long thought to have been held at a church in Ephesus which had been dedicated to Mary about a hundred years before. Though, recent archeological surveys indicate that St. Mary's Church in Ephesus did not exist at the time of the Council or, at least, the building was not dedicated to Mary before 500. The Church of the Seat of Mary in Judea was built shortly after the introduction of Marian liturgy at the council of Ephesus, in 456, by a widow named Ikelia.\nAccording to the 4th-century heresiologist Epiphanius of Salamis, the Virgin Mary was worshipped as a mother goddess in the Christian sect of Collyridianism, which was found throughout Arabia sometime during the 300s AD. Collyridianism had women performing priestly acts, and made bread offerings to the Virgin Mary. The group was condemned as heretical by the Roman Catholic Church and was preached against by Epiphanius of Salamis, who wrote about the group in his writings titled Panarion.\nByzantium.\nDuring the era of the Byzantine Empire, Mary was venerated as the virginal Mother of God and as an intercessor.\nEphesus is a cultic centre of Mary, the site of the first church dedicated to her and the rumoured place of her death. Ephesus was previously a centre for worship of Artemis, a virgin goddess; the Temple of Artemis there is regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The cult of Mary was furthered by Queen Theodora in the 6th century. According to William E. Phipps, in the book \"Survivals of Roman Religion\", \"Gordon Laing argues convincingly that the worship of Artemis as both virgin and mother at the grand Ephesian temple contributed to the veneration of Mary.\"\nMiddle Ages.\nThe Middle Ages saw many legends about Mary, her parents, and even her grandparents. Mary's popularity increased dramatically from the 12th century, linked to the Roman Catholic Church's designation of Mary as Mediatrix.\nPost-Reformation.\nOver the centuries, devotion and veneration to Mary has varied greatly among Christian traditions. For instance, while Protestants show scant attention to Marian prayers or devotions, of all the saints whom the Orthodox venerate, the most honored is Mary, who is considered \"more honorable than the Cherubim and more glorious than the Seraphim\".\nOrthodox theologian Sergei Bulgakov wrote: \"Love and veneration for the Virgin is the soul of Orthodox piety. A faith in Christ which does not include [...] His mother is another faith, another Christianity from that of the Orthodox Church.\"\nAlthough the Catholics and the Orthodox may honor and venerate Mary, they do not view her as divine, nor do they worship her. Roman Catholics view Mary as subordinate to Christ, but uniquely so, in that she is seen as above all other creatures. Similarly, Bulgakov wrote that the Orthodox view Mary as \"superior to all created beings\" and \"ceaselessly pray for her intercession\". However, she is not considered a \"substitute for the One Mediator\" who is Christ. \"Let Mary be in honor, but let worship be given to the Lord\", he wrote. Similarly, Catholics do not worship Mary as a divine being, but rather \"hyper-venerate\" her. In Roman Catholic theology, the term is reserved for Marian veneration, for the worship of God, and for the veneration of other saints and angels. The definition of the three level hierarchy of , and goes back to the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.\nDevotions to artistic depictions of Mary vary among Christian traditions. There is a long tradition of Catholic Marian art and no image permeates Catholic art as does the image of Madonna and Child. The icon of the Virgin with Christ is, without doubt, the most venerated icon in the Orthodox Church. Both Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians venerate images and icons of Mary, given that the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 permitted their veneration with the understanding that those who venerate the image are venerating the reality of the person it represents, and the 842 Synod of Constantinople confirming the same. According to Orthodox piety and traditional practice, however, believers ought to pray before and venerate only flat, two-dimensional icons, and not three-dimensional statues.\nThe Anglican position towards Mary is in general more conciliatory than that of Protestants at large and in a book he wrote about praying with the icons of Mary, Rowan Williams, former archbishop of Canterbury, said: \"It is not only that we cannot understand Mary without seeing her as pointing to Christ; we cannot understand Christ without seeing his attention to Mary.\"\nOn 4 September 1781, 11 families of arrived from the Gulf of California and established a city in the name of King Carlos III. The small town was named (after our Lady of the Angels), a city that today is known simply as Los Angeles. In an attempt to revive the custom of religious processions within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, in September 2011 the Queen of Angels Foundation, and founder Mark Anchor Albert, inaugurated an annual Grand Marian Procession in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles' historic core. This yearly procession, held on the last Saturday of August and intended to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of the City of Los Angeles, begins at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and concludes at the parish of La Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de los Angeles which is part of the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District, better known as \"La Placita\".\nFeasts.\nThe earliest feasts that relate to Mary grew out of the cycle of feasts that celebrated the Nativity of Jesus. Given that according to the Gospel of Luke (Luke 2:22\u201340), 40 days after the birth of Jesus, along with the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Mary was purified according to Jewish customs. The Feast of the Purification began to be celebrated by the 5th century, and became the \"Feast of Simeon\" in Byzantium.\nIn the 7th and 8th centuries, four more Marian feasts were established in Eastern Christianity. In the West, a feast dedicated to Mary, just before Christmas was celebrated in the Churches of Milan and Ravenna in Italy in the 7th century. The four Roman Marian feasts of Purification, Annunciation, Assumption and Nativity of Mary were gradually and sporadically introduced into England by the 11th century.\nOver time, the number and nature of feasts (and the associated Titles of Mary) and the venerative practices that accompany them have varied a great deal among diverse Christian traditions. Overall, there are significantly more titles, feasts and venerative Marian practices among Roman Catholics than any other Christians traditions. Some such feasts relate to specific events, such as the Feast of Our Lady of Victory, based on the 1571 victory of the Papal States in the Battle of Lepanto.\nDifferences in feasts may also originate from doctrinal issues\u2014the Feast of the Assumption is such an example. Given that there is no agreement among all Christians on the circumstances of the death, Dormition or Assumption of Mary, the feast of assumption is celebrated among some denominations and not others. While the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the Feast of the Assumption on 15 August, some Eastern Catholics celebrate it as Dormition of the, and may do so on 28 August, if they follow the Julian calendar. The Eastern Orthodox also celebrate it as the Dormition of the , one of their 12 Great Feasts. Protestants do not celebrate this, or any other Marian feasts.\nRelics.\nThe veneration of Marian relics used to be common practice before the Reformation. It was later largely surpassed by the veneration of Marian images.\nBodily relics.\nAs Mary's body is believed by most Christians to have been taken up into the glory of heaven, her bodily relics have been limited to hair, nails and breast milk.\nAccording to John Calvin's 1543 \"Treatise on Relics\", her hair was exposed for veneration in several churches, including in Rome, Saint-Flour, Cluny and Nevers.\nIn this book, Calvin criticized the veneration of the Holy Milk due to the lack of biblical references to it and the doubts about the veracity of such relics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;With regard to the milk, there is not perhaps a town, a convent, or nunnery, where it is not shown in large or small quantities. Indeed, had the Virgin been a wet-nurse her whole life, or a dairy, she could not have produced more than is shown as hers in various parts. How they obtained all this milk they do not say, and it is superfluous here to remark that there is no foundation in the Gospels for these foolish and blasphemous extravagances.\nAlthough the veneration of Marian bodily relics is no longer a common practice today, there are some remaining traces of it, such as the Chapel of the Milk Grotto in Bethlehem, named after Mary's milk.\nClothes.\nClothes which are believed to have belonged to Mary include the Cincture of the Theotokos kept in the Vatopedi monastery and her Holy Girdle kept in Holy Belt Church, Homs.\nOther relics are said to have been collected during later Marian apparitions, such as her robe, veil, and part of her belt which were kept in Blachernae church in Constantinople after she appeared there during the 10th century. These relics, now lost, are celebrated by the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic Churches as the Intercession of the Theotokos.\nFew other objects are said to have been touched or given by Mary during apparitions, notably a 1531 image printed on a \"tilma\", known as Our Lady of Guadalupe, belonging to Juan Diego.\nPlaces.\nPlaces where Mary is believed to have lived include the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto, Marche, and the House of the Virgin Mary in Ephesus.\nEastern Christians believe that she died and was put in the Tomb of the Virgin Mary near Jerusalem before the Assumption.\nThe belief that Mary's house was in Ephesus is recent, as it was claimed in the 19th century based on the visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich, an Augustinian nun in Germany. It has since been named as the House of the Virgin Mary by Roman Catholic pilgrims who consider it the place where Mary lived until her assumption. The Gospel of John states that Mary went to live with the Disciple whom Jesus loved, traditionally identified as John the Evangelist and John the Apostle. Irenaeus and Eusebius of Caesarea wrote in their histories that John later went to Ephesus, which may provide the basis for the early belief that Mary also lived in Ephesus with John.\nThe apparition of Our Lady of the Pillar in the first century was believed to be a bilocation, as it occurred in Spain while Mary was living in Ephesus or Jerusalem. The pillar on which she was standing during the apparition is believed to be kept in the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza and is therefore venerated as a relics, as it was in physical contact with Mary.\nIn arts.\nIconography.\nIn paintings, Mary is traditionally portrayed in blue. This tradition can trace its origin to the Byzantine Empire, from c.\u2009500 AD, where blue was \"the colour of an empress\". A more practical explanation for the use of this colour is that in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, the blue pigment was derived from the rock lapis lazuli, a stone of greater value than gold, which was imported from Afghanistan. Beyond a painter's retainer, patrons were expected to purchase any gold or lapis lazuli to be used in the painting. Hence, it was an expression of devotion and glorification to swathe the Virgin in gowns of blue. Transformations in visual depictions of Mary from the 13th to 15th centuries mirror her \"social\" standing within the Church and in society.\nTraditional representations of Mary include the crucifixion scene, called . While not recorded in the Gospel accounts, Mary cradling the dead body of her son is a common motif in art, called a \"piet\u00e0\" or \"pity\".\nIn the Egyptian, Eritrean, and Ethiopian tradition, Mary has been portrayed in story and paint for centuries. Beginning in the 1600s, however, highland Ethiopians began portraying Mary performing a variety of miracles for the faithful, including paintings of her giving water to a thirsty dog, healing monks with her breast milk, and saving a man eaten by a crocodile. Over 1,000 such https:// about her exist in this tradition, and about one hundred of those have hundreds of paintings each, in various manuscripts, adding up to thousands of https://.\nCinematic portrayals.\nMary has been portrayed in various films and on television, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73515", "revid": "37397471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73515", "title": "Sandro Botticelli", "text": "Italian Renaissance painter (1445\u20131510)\nAlessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi (c.\u20091445 \u2013 May 17, 1510), better known as Sandro Botticelli ( ; ) or simply Botticelli, was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who stimulated a reappraisal of his work. Since then, his paintings have been seen to represent the linear grace of late Italian Gothic and some Early Renaissance painting, even though they date from the latter half of the Italian Renaissance period.\nIn addition to the mythological subjects for which he is best known today, Botticelli painted a wide range of religious subjects (including dozens of renditions of the \"Madonna and Child\", many in the round tondo shape) and also some portraits. His best-known works are \"The Birth of Venus\" and \"Primavera\", both in the Uffizi in Florence, which holds many of Botticelli's works. Botticelli lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence; his only significant times elsewhere were the months he spent painting in Pisa in 1474 and the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1481\u201382.\nOnly one of Botticelli's paintings, the \"Mystic Nativity\" (National Gallery, London) is inscribed with a date (1501), but others can be dated with varying degrees of certainty on the basis of archival records, so the development of his style can be traced with some confidence. He was an independent master for all the 1470s, which saw his reputation soar. The 1480s were his most successful decade, the one in which his large mythological paintings were completed along with many of his most famous Madonnas. By the 1490s, his style became more personal and to some extent mannered. His last works show him moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and the new generation of painters creating the High Renaissance style, and instead returning to a style that many have described as more Gothic or \"archaic\".\nEarly life.\nBotticelli was born in the city of Florence in a house on the street still called Borgo Ognissanti. He lived in the same area all his life and was buried in his neighbourhood church called Ognissanti (\"All Saints\"). Sandro was one of several children to the tanner Mariano di Vanni d'Amedeo Filipepi and his wife Smeralda Filipepi, and the youngest of the four who survived into adulthood. The date of his birth is not known, but his father's tax returns in following years give his age as two in 1447 and thirteen in 1458, meaning he must have been born between 1444 and 1446.\nIn 1460 Botticelli's father ceased his business as a tanner and became a gold-beater with his other son, Antonio. This profession would have brought the family into contact with a range of artists. Giorgio Vasari, in his \"Life\" of Botticelli, reported that Botticelli was initially trained as a goldsmith.\nThe Ognissanti neighbourhood was \"a modest one, inhabited by weavers and other workmen,\" but there were some rich families, most notably the Rucellai, a wealthy clan of bankers and wool-merchants. The family's head, Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, commissioned the famous Palazzo Rucellai, a landmark in Italian Renaissance architecture, from Leon Battista Alberti, between 1446 and 1451, Botticelli's earliest years. By 1458, Botticelli's family was renting their house from the Rucellai, which was just one of many dealings that involved the two families.\nIn 1464, his father bought a house in the nearby Via Nuova (now called Via del Porcellana) in which Sandro lived from 1470 (if not earlier) until his death in 1510. Botticelli both lived and worked in the house (a rather unusual practice) despite his brothers Giovanni and Simone also being resident there. The family's most notable neighbours were the Vespucci, including Amerigo Vespucci, after whom the Americas were named. The Vespucci were Medici allies and eventually regular patrons of Botticelli.\nThe nickname Botticelli, meaning \"little barrel\", derives from the nickname of Sandro's brother, Giovanni, who was called Botticello apparently because of his round stature. A document of 1470 refers to Sandro as \"Sandro Mariano Botticelli\", meaning that he had fully adopted the name.\nCareer before Rome.\nFrom around 1461 or 1462 Botticelli was apprenticed to Fra Filippo Lippi, one of the leading Florentine painters and a favorite of the Medici. It was from Lippi that Botticelli learned how to create intimate compositions with beautiful, melancholic figures drawn with clear contours and only slight contrasts of light and shadow. For much of this period Lippi was based in Prato, a few miles west of Florence, frescoing the apse of what is now Prato Cathedral. Botticelli probably left Lippi's workshop by April 1467, when the latter went to work in Spoleto. There has been much speculation as to whether Botticelli spent a shorter period of time in another workshop, such as that of the Pollaiuolo brothers or Andrea del Verrocchio. However, although both artists had a strong impact on the young Botticelli's development, the young artist's presence in their workshops cannot be definitively proven.\nLippi died in 1469. Botticelli must have had his own workshop by then, and in June of that year he was commissioned a panel of \"Fortitude\" (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi) to accompany a set of all Seven Virtues commissioned one year earlier from Piero del Pollaiuolo. Botticelli's panel adopts the format and composition of Piero's, but features a more elegant and naturally posed figure and includes an array of \"fanciful enrichments so as to show up Piero's poverty of ornamental invention.\"\nIn 1472 Botticelli took on his first apprentice, the young Filippino Lippi, son of his master. Botticelli and Filippino's works from these years, including many \"Madonna and Child\" paintings, are often difficult to distinguish from one another. The two also routinely collaborated, as in the panels from a dismantled pair of \"cassoni\", now divided between the Louvre, the National Gallery of Canada, the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9 in Chantilly and the Galleria Pallavicini in Rome.\nKey early paintings.\nBotticelli's earliest surviving altarpiece is a large \"sacra conversazione\" of about 1470\u201372, now in the Uffizi. The painting shows Botticelli's early mastery of composition, with eight figures arranged with an \"easy naturalness in a closed architectural setting\".\nAnother work from this period is the \"Saint Sebastian\" in Berlin, painted in 1474 for a pier in Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence. This work was painted soon after the Pollaiuolo brothers' much larger altarpiece of the same saint (London, National Gallery). Though Botticelli's saint is very similar in pose to that by the Pollaiuolo, he is also calmer and more poised. The almost nude body is very carefully drawn and anatomically precise, reflecting the young artist's close study of the human body. The delicate winter landscape, referring to the saint's feast-day in January, is inspired by contemporary Early Netherlandish painting, widely appreciated in Florentine circles.\nAt the start of 1474 Botticelli was asked by the authorities in Pisa to join the work frescoing the Camposanto, a large prestigious project mostly being done by Benozzo Gozzoli, who spent nearly twenty years on it. Various payments up to September are recorded, but no work survives, and it seems that whatever Botticelli started was not finished. Nevertheless, that Botticelli was approached from outside Florence demonstrates a growing reputation. \nThe \"Adoration of the Magi\" for Santa Maria Novella (c.\u20091475\u201376, now in the Uffizi, and the first of 8 \"Adorations\"), was singled out for praise by Vasari, and was in a much-visited church, so spreading his reputation. It can be thought of as marking the climax of Botticelli's early style. Despite being commissioned by a money-changer, or perhaps money-lender, not otherwise known as an ally of the Medici, it contains the portraits of Cosimo de Medici, his sons Piero and Giovanni (all these by now dead), and his grandsons Lorenzo and Giuliano. There are also portraits of the donor and, in the view of most, Botticelli himself, standing at the front on the right. The painting was celebrated for the variety of the angles from which the faces are painted, and of their expressions.\nA large fresco for the customs house of Florence, that is now lost, depicted the execution by hanging of the leaders of the Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 against the Medici. It was a Florentine custom to humiliate traitors in this way, by the so-called \"pittura infamante\". This was Botticelli's first major fresco commission (apart from the abortive Pisa excursion), and may have led to his summons to Rome. The figure of Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa was removed in 1479, after protests from the Pope, and the rest were destroyed after the expulsion of the Medici and return of the Pazzi family in 1494. Another lost work was a tondo of the Madonna ordered by a Florentine banker in Rome to present to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga; this perhaps spread awareness of his work to Rome. A fresco in the Palazzo Vecchio, headquarters of the Florentine state, was lost in the next century when Vasari remodelled the building.\nIn 1480 the Vespucci family commissioned a fresco figure of \"Saint Augustine\" for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's. Someone else, probably the order running the church, commissioned Domenico Ghirlandaio to do a facing \"Saint Jerome\"; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects. As in other cases, such direct competition \"was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers\", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Ronald Lightbown. The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known. Most of the \"text\" is scribbles, but one line reads: \"Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato\", probably dialogue overheard from the Umiliati, the order who ran the church. Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought \"the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them\".\nSistine Chapel.\nIn 1481, Pope Sixtus IV summoned Botticelli and other prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists to fresco the walls of the newly completed Sistine Chapel. This large project was to be the main decoration of the chapel. Most of the frescos remain but are greatly overshadowed and disrupted by Michelangelo's work of the next century, as some of the earlier frescos were destroyed to make room for his paintings. The Florentine contribution is thought to be part of a peace deal between Lorenzo Medici and the papacy. After Sixtus was implicated in the Pazzi conspiracy hostilities had escalated into excommunication for Lorenzo and other Florentine officials and a small \"Pazzi War\".\nThe iconographic scheme was a pair of cycles, facing each other on the sides of the chapel, of the \"Life of Christ\" and the \"Life of Moses\", together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy. Botticelli's contribution included three of the original fourteen large scenes: the \"Temptations of Christ\", \"Youth of Moses\" and \"Punishment of the Sons of Corah\" (or various other titles), as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of unknown subjects in the lunettes above, where Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling now is. He may have also done a fourth scene on the end wall opposite the altar, now destroyed. Each painter brought a team of assistants from his workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work was done in a few months.\nVasari implies that Botticelli was given overall artistic charge of the project, but modern art historians think it more likely that Pietro Perugino, the first artist to be employed, was given this role, if anyone was. The subjects and many details to be stressed in their execution were no doubt handed to the artists by the Vatican authorities. The schemes present a complex and coherent programme asserting Papal supremacy, and are more unified in this than in their artistic style, although the artists follow a consistent scale and broad compositional layout, with crowds of figures in the foreground and mainly landscape in the top half of the scene. Allowing for the painted pilasters that separate each scene, the level of the horizon matches between scenes, and Moses wears the same yellow and green clothes in his scenes.\nBotticelli differs from his colleagues in imposing a more insistent triptych-like composition, dividing each of his scenes into a main central group with two flanking groups at the sides, showing different incidents. In each the principal figure of Christ or Moses appears several times, seven in the case of the \"Youth of Moses\". The thirty invented portraits of the earliest popes seem to have been mainly Botticelli's responsibility, at least as far as producing the cartoons went. Of those surviving, most scholars agree that ten were designed by Botticelli, and five probably at least partly by him, although all have been damaged and restored.\nThe \"Punishment of the Sons of Corah\" contains what was for Botticelli an unusually close, if not exact, copy of a classical work. This is the rendering in the centre of the north side of the \"Arch of Constantine\" in Rome, which he repeated in about 1500 in \"The Story of Lucretia\". If he was apparently not spending his spare time in Rome drawing antiquities, as many artists of his day were very keen to do, he does seem to have painted there an \"Adoration of the Magi\", now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. In 1482 he returned to Florence, and apart from his lost frescos for the Medici villa at Spedaletto a year or so later, no further trips away from home are recorded. He had perhaps been away from July 1481 to, at the latest, May 1482.\nMythological subjects of the 1480s.\nThe masterpieces \"Primavera\" (c. 1482) and \"The Birth of Venus\" (c. 1485) are not a pair, but are inevitably discussed together; both are in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity. Together with the smaller and less celebrated \"Venus and Mars\" and \"Pallas and the Centaur\", they have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations, the influence of Renaissance Neoplatonism, and the identity of the commissioners and possible models for the figures.\nThough all carry differing degrees of complexity in their meanings, they also have an immediate visual appeal that accounts for their enormous popularity. All show dominant and beautiful female figures in an idyllic world of feeling, with a sexual element. Continuing scholarly attention mainly focuses on the poetry and philosophy of contemporary Renaissance humanists. The works do not illustrate particular texts; rather, each relies upon several texts for its significance. Their beauty was characterized by Vasari as exemplifying \"grace\" and by John Ruskin as possessing linear rhythm. The pictures feature Botticelli's linear style at its most effective, emphasized by the soft continual contours and pastel colours.\nThe \"Primavera\" and the \"Birth\" were both seen by Vasari in the mid-16th century at the Villa di Castello, owned from 1477 by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and until the publication in 1975 of a Medici inventory of 1499, it was assumed that both works were painted specifically for the villa. In the second half of the last century scholarship suggested otherwise: the \"Primavera\" was painted for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's townhouse in Florence, with \"Pallas and the Centaur\" as its companion piece. \"The Birth of Venus\" was commissioned by someone else for a different site.\nBotticelli painted only a small number of mythological subjects, but these are now probably his best known works. A much smaller panel than those discussed before is his \"Venus and Mars\" in the National Gallery, London. This was of a size and shape to suggest that it was a \"spalliera\", a painting made to fit into either furniture, or more likely in this case, wall panelling. The wasps buzzing around Mars' head suggest that it may have been painted for a member of his neighbours the Vespucci family, whose name means \"little wasps\" in Italian, and who featured wasps in their coat of arms. Mars lies asleep, presumably after lovemaking, while Venus watches as infant satyrs play with his military gear, and one tries to rouse him by blowing a conch shell in his ear. The painting was no doubt given to celebrate a marriage, and decorate the bedchamber.\nThree of these four large mythologies feature Venus, a central figure in Renaissance Neoplatonism, which gave divine love as important a place in its philosophy as did Christianity. The fourth, \"Pallas and the Centaur\" is clearly connected with the Medici by the symbol on Pallas' dress. The two figures are roughly life-size, and a number of specific personal, political or philosophic interpretations have been proposed to expand on the basic meaning of the submission of passion to reason.\nA series of panels in the form of an \"spalliera\" or \"cassone\" were commissioned from Botticelli by Antonio Pucci in 1483 on the occasion of the marriage of his son Giannozzo with Lucrezia Bini. The subject was the story of \"Nastagio degli Onesti\" from the eighth novel of the fifth day of Boccaccio's \"Decameron\", in four panels. The coats of arms of the Medici and the bride and groom's families appear in the third panel.\nReligious paintings after Rome.\nBotticelli returned from Rome in 1482 with a reputation considerably enhanced by his work there. As with his secular paintings, many religious commissions are larger and no doubt more expensive than before. Altogether more datable works by Botticelli come from the 1480s than any other decade, and most of these are religious. By the mid-1480s, many leading Florentine artists had left the city, some never to return. The rising star Leonardo da Vinci, who scoffed at Botticelli's landscapes, left in 1481 for Milan, the Pollaiolo brothers in 1484 for Rome, and Andrea del Verrocchio in 1485 for Venice.\nThe remaining leaders of Florentine painting, Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Filippino Lippi, worked on a major fresco cycle with Perugino, for Lorenzo the Magnificent's villa at Spedalletto near Volterra. Botticelli painted many Madonnas, covered in a section below, and altarpieces and frescos in Florentine churches. In 1491 he served on a committee to decide upon a fa\u00e7ade for the Cathedral of Florence, receiving the next year three payments for a design for a scheme, eventually abortive, to put mosaics on some interior roof vaults in the cathedral.\n\"Bardi Altarpiece\".\nThe first major church commission after Rome was the Bardi Altarpiece, finished and framed by February 1485, and now in Berlin. The frame was by no less a figure than Giuliano da Sangallo, who was just becoming Lorenzo il Magnifico's favourite architect. An enthroned Madonna and (rather large) Child sit on an elaborately carved raised stone bench in a garden, with plants and flowers behind them closing off all but small patches of sky, to give a version of the \"hortus conclusus\" or closed garden, a very traditional setting for the Virgin Mary. Saints John the Baptist and an unusually elderly John the Evangelist stand in the foreground. Small and inconspicuous banderoles or ribbons carrying biblical verses elucidate the rather complex theological meaning of the work, for which Botticelli must have had a clerical advisor, but do not intrude on a simpler appreciation of the painting and its lovingly detailed rendering, which Vasari praised. It is somewhat typical of Botticelli's relaxed approach to strict perspective that the top ledge of the bench is seen from above, but the vases with lilies on it from below.\nThe donor, from the leading Bardi family, had returned to Florence from over twenty years as a banker and wool merchant in London, where he was known as \"John de Barde\", and aspects of the painting may reflect north European and even English art and popular devotional trends. There may have been other panels in the altarpiece, which are now missing.\n\"San Barnaba Altarpiece\".\nA larger and more crowded altarpiece is the San Barnaba Altarpiece of about 1487, now in the Uffizi, where elements of Botticelli's emotional late style begin to appear. Here the setting is a palatial heavenly interior in the latest style, showing Botticelli taking a new degree of interest in architecture, possibly influenced by Sangallo. The Virgin and Child are raised high on a throne, at the same level as four angels carrying the instruments of the Passion. Six saints stand in line below the throne. Several figures have rather large heads, and the infant Jesus is again very large. While the faces of the Virgin, child and angels have the linear beauty of his tondos, the saints are given varied and intense expressions. Four small and rather simple \"predella\" panels survive; there were probably originally seven.\nOther works.\nWith the phase of painting large secular works probably over by the late 1480s, Botticelli painted several altarpieces, and this appears to have been a peak period for his workshop's production of Madonnas. Botticelli's largest altarpiece, the \"San Marco Altarpiece\" (378\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0258\u00a0cm, Uffizi), is the only one to remain with its full \"predella\", of five panels. In the air above four saints, the \"Coronation of the Virgin\" is taking place in a heavenly zone of gold and bright colours that recall his earlier works, with encircling angels dancing and throwing flowers.\nIn contrast, the \"Cestello Annunciation\" (1489\u201390, Uffizi) forms a natural grouping with other late paintings, especially two of the Lamentation of Christ that share its sombre background colouring, and the rather exaggerated expressiveness of the bending poses of the figures. It does have an unusually detailed landscape, still in dark colours, seen through the window, which seems to draw on north European models, perhaps from prints. \nOf the two \"Lamentations\", one is in an unusual vertical format, because, like his 1474 \"Saint Sebastian\", it was painted for the side of a pillar in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence; it is now in Milan. The other, horizontal, one was painted for a chapel on the corner of Botticelli's street; it is now in Munich. In both the crowded, intertwined figures around the dead Christ take up nearly all the picture space, with only bare rock behind. The Virgin has swooned, and the other figures form a scrum to support her and Christ. The Munich painting has three less involved saints with attributes (somewhat oddly including Saint Peter, usually regarded as in Jerusalem on the day, but not present at this scene), and gives the figures (except Christ) flat halos shown in perspective, which from now on Botticelli often uses. Both probably date from 1490 to 1495.\nEarly records mentioned, without describing it, an altarpiece by Botticelli for the Convertite, an institution for ex-prostitutes, and various surviving unprovenanced works were proposed as candidates. It is now generally accepted that a painting in the Courtauld Gallery in London is the \"Pala delle Convertite\", dating to about 1491\u201393. Its subject, unusual for an altarpiece, is the Holy Trinity, with Christ on the cross, supported from behind by God the Father. Angels surround the Trinity, which is flanked by two saints, with Tobias and the Angel on a far smaller scale right in the foreground. This was probably a votive addition, perhaps requested by the original donor. The four predella scenes, showing the life of Mary Magdalen, then taken as a reformed prostitute herself, are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nAfter about 1493 or 1495 Botticelli seems to have painted no more large religious paintings, though production of Madonnas probably continued. The smaller narrative religious scenes of the last years are covered below.\nMadonnas, and tondos.\nPaintings of the Madonna and Child, that is, the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus, were enormously popular in 15th-century Italy in a range of sizes and formats, from large altarpieces of the \"sacra conversazione\" type to small paintings for the home. They also often hung in offices, public buildings, shops and clerical institutions. These smaller paintings were a steady source of income for painters at all levels of quality, and many were probably produced for stock, without a specific commission.\nBotticelli painted Madonnas from the start of his career until at least the 1490s. He was one of the first painters to use the round tondo format, with the painted area typically some 115 to 145\u00a0cm across (about four to five feet). This format was more associated with paintings for palaces than churches, though they were large enough to be hung in churches, and some were later donated to them. Several Madonnas use this format, usually with a seated Virgin shown down to the knees, and though rectangular pictures of the Madonna outnumber them, Madonnas in tondo form are especially associated with Botticelli. He used the tondo format for other subjects, such as an early \"Adoration of the Magi\" in London, and was apparently more likely to paint a tondo Madonna himself, usually leaving rectangular ones to his workshop.\nBotticelli's Virgins are always beautiful, in the same idealized way as his mythological figures, and often richly dressed in contemporary style. Although Savonarola's main strictures were against secular art, he also complained of the paintings in Florentine churches that \"You have made the Virgin appear dressed as a whore\", which may have had an effect on Botticelli's style. They are often accompanied by equally beautiful angels, or an infant Saint John the Baptist (the patron saint of Florence). Some feature flowers, and none the detailed landscape backgrounds that other artists were developing. Many exist in several versions of varying quality, often with the elements other than the Virgin and Child different. Many of these were produced by Botticelli or, especially, his workshop, and others apparently by unconnected artists. When interest in Botticelli revived in the 19th century, it was initially largely in his Madonnas, which then began to be forged on a considerable scale.\nIn the \"Magnificat Madonna\" in the Uffizi (118\u00a0cm or 46.5 inches across, c. 1483), Mary is writing down the \"Magnificat\", a speech from the Gospel of Luke () where it is spoken by Mary upon the occasion of her Visitation to her cousin Elizabeth, some months before the birth of Jesus. She holds the baby Jesus, and is surrounded by wingless angels impossible to distinguish from fashionably dressed Florentine youths.\nBotticelli's \"Madonna and Child with Angels Carrying Candlesticks\" (1485/1490) was destroyed during World War II. It was stored in the Friedrichshain flak tower in Berlin for safe keeping, but in May 1945, the tower was set on fire and most of the objects inside were destroyed. Also lost were Botticelli's \"Madonna and Child with Infant Saint John\" and an \"Annunciation\".\nPortraits.\nBotticelli painted a number of portraits, although not nearly as many as have been attributed to him. There are a number of idealized portrait-like paintings of women which probably do not represent a specific person (several closely resemble the Venus in his \"Venus and Mars\"). Traditional gossip links these to the famous beauty Simonetta Vespucci, who died aged twenty-two in 1476, but this seems unlikely. These figures represent a secular link to his \"Madonnas\".\nWith one or two exceptions his small independent panel portraits show the sitter no further down the torso than about the bottom of the rib-cage. Women are normally in profile, full or just a little turned, whereas men are normally a \"three-quarters\" pose, but never quite seen completely frontally. Even when the head is facing more or less straight ahead, the lighting is used to create a difference between the sides of the face. Backgrounds may be plain, or show an open window, usually with nothing but sky visible through it. A few have developed landscape backgrounds. These characteristics were typical of Florentine portraits at the beginning of his career, but old-fashioned by his last years.\nMany portraits exist in several versions, probably most mainly by the workshop; there is often uncertainty in their attribution. Often the background changes between versions while the figure remains the same. His male portraits have also often held dubious identifications, most often of various Medicis, for longer than the real evidence supports. Lightbown attributes him only with about eight portraits of individuals, all but three from before about 1475.\nBotticelli often slightly exaggerates aspects of the features to increase the likeness. He also painted portraits in other works, as when he inserted a self-portrait and the Medici into his early \"Adoration of the Magi\". Several figures in the Sistine Chapel frescos appear to be portraits, but the subjects are unknown, although fanciful guesses have been made. Large allegorical frescos from a villa show members of the Tornabuoni family together with gods and personifications; probably not all of these survive but ones with portraits of a young man with the Seven Liberal Arts and a young woman with Venus and the Three Graces are now in the Louvre.\nDante, printing and manuscripts.\nBotticelli had a lifelong interest in the great Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, which produced works in several media. He is attributed with an imagined portrait. According to Vasari, he \"wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante\", which is also referred to dismissively in another story in the \"Life\", but no such text has survived.\nBotticelli's attempt to design the illustrations for a printed book was unprecedented for a leading painter, and though it seems to have been something of a flop, this was a role for artists that had an important future. Vasari wrote disapprovingly of the first printed Dante in 1481 with engravings by the goldsmith Baccio Baldini, engraved from drawings by Botticelli: \"being of a sophistical turn of mind, he there wrote a commentary on a portion of Dante and illustrated the \"Inferno\" which he printed, spending much time over it, and this abstention from work led to serious disorders in his living.\" Vasari, who lived when printmaking had become far more important than in Botticelli's day, never takes it seriously, perhaps because his own paintings did not sell well in reproduction.\nThe \"Divine Comedy\" consists of 100 cantos and the printed text left space for one engraving for each canto. However, only 19 illustrations were engraved, and most copies of the book have only the first two or three. The first two, and sometimes three, are usually printed on the book page, while the later ones are printed on separate sheets that are pasted into place. This suggests that the production of the engravings lagged behind the printing, and the later illustrations were pasted into the stock of printed and bound books, and perhaps sold to those who had already bought the book. Unfortunately, Baldini was neither very experienced nor talented as an engraver, and was unable to express the delicacy of Botticelli's style in his plates. Two religious engravings are also generally accepted to be after designs by Botticelli.\nBotticelli later began a luxury manuscript illustrated Dante on parchment, most of which was taken only as far as the underdrawings, and only a few pages are fully illuminated. This manuscript has 93 surviving pages (32\u00a0\u00d7\u00a047\u00a0cm), now divided between the Vatican Library (8 sheets) and the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin (83), and represents the bulk of Botticelli's surviving drawings.\nOnce again, the project was never completed, even at the drawing stage, but some of the early cantos appear to have been at least drawn but are now missing. The pages that survive have always been greatly admired, and much discussed, as the project raises many questions. The general consensus is that most of the drawings are late; the main scribe can be identified as Niccol\u00f2 Mangona, who worked in Florence between 1482 and 1503, whose work presumably preceded that of Dante. Botticelli then appears to have worked on the drawings over a long period, as stylistic development can be seen, and matched to his paintings. Although other patrons have been proposed (inevitably including Medicis, in particular the younger Lorenzo, or il Magnifico), some scholars think that Botticelli made the manuscript for himself.\nThere are hints that Botticelli may have worked on illustrations for printed pamphlets by Savonarola, almost all destroyed after his fall.\nThe Medici.\nBotticelli became associated by historians with the Florentine School under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement historians would later characterize as a \"golden age\". The Medici family were effective rulers of Florence, which was nominally a republic, throughout Botticelli's lifetime up to 1494, when the main branch were expelled. Lorenzo il Magnifico became the head of the family in 1469, just around the time Botticelli started his own workshop. He was a great patron of both the visual and literary arts, and encouraged and financed the humanist and Neoplatonist circle from which much of the character of Botticelli's mythological painting seems to come. In general Lorenzo does not seem to have commissioned much from Botticelli, preferring Pollaiuolo and others, although views on this differ. A Botticello who was probably Sandro's brother Giovanni was close to Lorenzo.\nAlthough the patrons of many works not for churches remain unclear, Botticelli seems to have been used more by Lorenzo il Magnifico's two young cousins, his younger brother Giuliano, and other families allied to the Medici. Tommaso Soderini, a close ally of Lorenzo, obtained the commission for the figure of \"Fortitude\" of 1470 which is Botticelli's earliest securely dated painting, completing a series of the \"Seven Virtues\" left unfinished by Piero del Pollaiuolo. Possibly they had been introduced by a Vespucci who had tutored Soderini's son. Antonio Pucci, another Medici ally, probably commissioned the London \"Adoration of the Magi\", also around 1470.\nGiuliano de' Medici was assassinated in the Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 (Lorenzo narrowly escaped, saved by his bank manager), and a portrait said to be Giuliano which survives in several versions may be posthumous, or with at least one version from not long before his death. He is also a focus for theories that figures in the mythological paintings represent specific individuals from Florentine high society, usually paired with Simonetta Vespucci, who John Ruskin persuaded himself had posed nude for Botticelli.\nLast years.\nAccording to Vasari, Botticelli became a follower of the deeply moralistic Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, who preached in Florence from 1490 until his execution in 1498:\nBotticelli was a follower of Savonarola's, and this was why he gave up painting and then fell into considerable distress as he had no other source of income. None the less, he remained an obstinate member of the sect, becoming one of the \"piagnoni\", the snivellers, as they were called then, and abandoning his work; so finally, as an old man, he found himself so poor that if Lorenzo de' Medici ... and then his friends and ... [others] had not come to his assistance, he would have almost died of hunger.\nThe extent of Savonarola's influence on Botticelli remains uncertain; his brother Simone was more clearly a follower. The story, sometimes seen, that he had destroyed his own paintings on secular subjects in the 1497 bonfire of the vanities is not told by Vasari. Vasari's assertion that Botticelli produced nothing after coming under the influence of Savonarola is not accepted by modern art historians. \"The Mystical Nativity\", Botticelli's only painting to carry an actual date, if one cryptically expressed, comes from late 1500, eighteen months after Savonarola died, and the development of his style can be traced through a number of late works, as discussed below. \nIn late 1502, some four years after Savonarola's death, Isabella d'Este wanted a painting done in Florence. Her agent Francesco Malatesta wrote to inform her that her first choice, Perugino, was away, Filippino Lippi had a full schedule for six months, but Botticelli was free to start at once, and ready to oblige. She preferred to wait for Perugino's return. This again casts serious doubt on Vasari's assertion, but equally he does not seem to have been in great demand.\nMany datings of works have a range up to 1505, though he did live a further five years. But Botticelli apparently produced little work after 1501, or perhaps earlier, and his production had already reduced after about 1495. This may be partly because of the time he devoted to the drawings for the manuscript Dante. In 1504 he was a member of the committee appointed to decide where Michelangelo's \"David\" would be placed.\nBotticelli returned to subjects from antiquity in the 1490s, with a few smaller works on subjects from ancient history containing more figures and showing different scenes from each story, including moments of dramatic action. These are the \"Calumny of Apelles\" (c. 1494\u201395), a recreation of a lost allegory by the ancient Greek painter Apelles, which he may have intended for his personal use, and the pair of \"The Story of Virginia\" and \"The Story of Lucretia\", which are probably from around 1500.\n\"The Mystical Nativity\", a relatively small and very personal painting, perhaps for his own use, appears to be dated to the end of 1500. It takes to an extreme the abandonment of consistent scale among the figures that had been a feature of Botticelli's religious paintings for some years, with the Holy Family much larger than the other figures, even those well in front of them in the picture space. This may be seen as a partial reversion to Gothic conventions. The iconography of the familiar subject of the Nativity is unique, with features including devils hiding in the rock below the scene, and must be highly personal.\nAnother painting, known as the \"Mystic Crucifixion\" (now Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University), clearly relates to the state, and fate, of Florence, shown in the background behind Christ on the Cross, beside which an angel whips a marzocco, the heraldic lion that is a symbol of the city. This can be connected more directly to the convulsions of the expulsion of the Medici, Savonarola's brief supremacy, and the French invasion. Unfortunately it is very damaged, such that it may not be by Botticelli, while it is certainly in his style.\nHis later work, especially as seen in the four panels with \"Scenes from the Life of Saint Zenobius\", witnessed a diminution of scale, expressively distorted figures, and a non-naturalistic use of colour reminiscent of the work of Fra Angelico nearly a century earlier. Botticelli has been compared to the Venetian painter Carlo Crivelli, some ten years older, whose later work also veers away from the imminent High Renaissance style, instead choosing to \"move into a distinctly Gothic idiom\". Other scholars have seen premonitions of Mannerism in the simplified expressionist depiction of emotions in his works of the last years.\nErnst Steinmann (d. 1934) detected in the later Madonnas a \"deepening of insight and expression in the rendering of Mary's physiognomy\", which he attributed to Savonarola's influence (also pushing back the dating of some of these Madonnas.) More recent scholars are reluctant to assign direct influence, though there is certainly a replacement of elegance and sweetness with forceful austerity in the last period.\nBotticelli continued to pay his dues to the Compagnia di San Luca (a confraternity rather than the artist's guild) until at least October 1505; the tentative date ranges assigned to his late paintings run no further than this. By then he was aged sixty or more, in this period definitely into old age. Vasari, who lived in Florence from around 1527, says that Botticelli died \"ill and decrepit, at the age of seventy-eight\", after a period when he was \"unable to stand upright and moving around with the help of crutches\". He died in May 1510, but is now thought to have been something under seventy at the time. He was buried with his family outside the Ognissanti Church in a spot the church has now built over. This had been his parish church since he was baptized there, and contained his \"Saint Augustine in His Study\".\nOther media.\nVasari mentions that Botticelli produced very fine drawings, which were sought out by artists after his death. Apart from the Dante illustrations, only a small number of these survive, none of which can be connected with surviving paintings, or at least not their final compositions, although they appear to be preparatory drawings rather than independent works. Some may be connected with the work in other media that we know Botticelli did. Three vestments survive with embroidered designs by him, and he developed a new technique for decorating banners for religious and secular processions, apparently in some kind of appliqu\u00e9 technique (called \"commesso\").\nWorkshop.\nIn 1472, the records of the painter's guild record that Botticelli had only Filippino Lippi as an assistant, though another source records a twenty-eight-year old, who had trained with Neri di Bicci. By 1480 there were three, none of them subsequently of note. Other names occur in the record, but only Lippi became a well-known master. A considerable number of works, especially Madonnas, are attributed to Botticelli's workshop, or the master and his workshop, generally meaning that Botticelli did the underdrawing, while the assistants did the rest, or drawings by him were copied by the workshop.\nBotticelli's linear style was relatively easy to imitate, making different contributions within one work hard to identify, though the quality of the master's drawing makes works entirely by others mostly identifiable. The attribution of many works remains debated, especially in terms of distinguishing the share of work between master and workshop. Lightbown believed that \"the division between Botticelli's autograph works and the paintings from his workshop and circle is a fairly sharp one\", and that in only one major work on panel \"do we find important parts executed by assistants\"; but others might disagree.\nThe National Gallery have an \"Adoration of the Kings\" of about 1470, which they describe as begun by Filippino Lippi but finished by Botticelli, noting how unusual it was for a master to take over a work begun by a pupil.\nPersonal life.\nFinances.\nAccording to Vasari's perhaps unreliable account, Botticelli \"earned a great deal of money, but wasted it all through carelessness and lack of management\". He continued to live in the family house all his life, also having his studio there. On his father's death in 1482 it was inherited by his brother Giovanni, who had a large family. By the end of his life it was owned by his nephews. From the 1490s he had a modest country villa and farm at Bellosguardo (now swallowed up by the city), which was leased with his brother Simone.\nSexuality.\nBotticelli never married, and apparently expressed a strong dislike of the idea of marriage. An anecdote records that his patron Tommaso Soderini, who died in 1485, suggested he marry, to which Botticelli replied that a few days before he had dreamed that he had married, woke up \"struck with grief\", and for the rest of the night walked the streets to avoid the dream resuming if he slept again. The story concludes cryptically that Soderini understood \"that he was not fit ground for planting vines\".\nHe might have had a close relationship with Simonetta Vespucci (1453\u20131476), who has been claimed, especially by John Ruskin, to be portrayed in several of his works and to have served as the inspiration for many of the female figures in the artist's paintings. It is possible that he was at least platonically in love with Simonetta, given his request to have himself buried at the foot of her tomb in the Ognissanti\u00a0\u2013 the church of the Vespucci\u00a0\u2013 in Florence, although this was also Botticelli's church, where he had been baptized. When he died in 1510, his remains were placed as he requested.\nIn 1938, Jacques Mesnil discovered a summary of a charge in the Florentine Archives for November 16, 1502, which read simply \"Botticelli keeps a boy\", an accusation of sodomy (homosexuality). No prosecution was brought. The painter would then have been about fifty-eight. Mesnil dismissed it as a customary slander by which partisans and adversaries of Savonarola abused each other. Opinion remains divided on whether this is evidence of homosexuality. Many have backed Mesnil. Art historian Scott Nethersole has suggested that a quarter of Florentine men were the subject of similar accusations, which \"seems to have been a standard way of getting at people\" but others have cautioned against hasty dismissal of the charge. Mesnil nevertheless concluded \"woman was not the only object of his love\".\nThe Renaissance art historian, James Saslow, has noted that: \"His [Botticelli's] homo-erotic sensibility surfaces mainly in religious works where he imbued such nude young saints as Sebastian with the same androgynous grace and implicit physicality as Donatello's David\".\nLater reputation.\nAfter his death, Botticelli's reputation was eclipsed longer and more thoroughly than that of any other major European artist. His paintings remained in the churches and villas for which they had been created, and his frescos in the Sistine Chapel were upstaged by those of Michelangelo.\nThere are a few mentions of paintings and their location in sources from the decades after his death. Vasari's \"Life\" is relatively short and, especially in the first edition of 1550, rather disapproving. According to the Ettlingers \"he is clearly ill at ease with Sandro and did not know how to fit him into his evolutionary scheme of the history of art running from Cimabue to Michelangelo\". Nonetheless, this is the main source of information about his life, even though Vasari twice mixes him up with Francesco Botticini, another Florentine painter of the day. Vasari saw Botticelli as a firm partisan of the anti-Medici faction influenced by Savonarola, while Vasari himself relied heavily on the patronage of the returned Medicis of his own day. Vasari also saw him as an artist who had abandoned his talent in his last years, which offended his high idea of the artistic vocation. He devotes a good part of his text to rather alarming anecdotes of practical jokes by Botticelli. Vasari was born the year after Botticelli's death, but would have known many Florentines with memories of him.\nIn 1621 a picture-buying agent of Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua bought him a painting said to be a Botticelli out of historical interest \"as from the hand of an artist by whom Your Highness has nothing, and who was the master of Leonardo da Vinci\". That mistake is perhaps understandable, as although Leonardo was only some six years younger than Botticelli, his style could seem to a Baroque judge to be a generation more advanced.\nThe \"Birth of Venus\" was displayed in the Uffizi from 1815, but is little mentioned in travellers' accounts of the gallery over the next two decades. The Berlin gallery bought the \"Bardi Altarpiece\" in 1829, but the National Gallery, London only bought a Madonna (now regarded as by his workshop) in 1855.\nThe English collector William Young Ottley bought Botticelli's \"The Mystical Nativity\" in Italy, bringing it to London in 1799. But when he tried to sell it in 1811, no buyer could be found. After Ottley's death, its next purchaser, William Fuller Maitland of Stansted, allowed it to be exhibited in a major art exhibition held in Manchester in 1857, the Art Treasures Exhibition, where among many other art works it was viewed by more than a million people. His only large painting with a mythological subject ever to be sold on the open market is the \"Venus and Mars\", bought at Christie's by the National Gallery for a rather modest \u00a31,050 in 1874. The rare 21st-century auction results include in 2013 the \"Rockefeller Madonna\", sold at Christie's for US$10.4\u00a0million, and in 2021 the \"Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Roundel\", sold at Sotheby's for US$92.2\u00a0million.\nThe first nineteenth-century art historian to be enthusiastic about Botticelli's Sistine frescoes was Alexis-Fran\u00e7ois Rio; Anna Brownell Jameson and Charles Eastlake were alerted to Botticelli as well, and works by his hand began to appear in German collections. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood incorporated elements of his work into their own.\nWalter Pater created a literary picture of Botticelli, who was then taken up by the Aesthetic movement. The first monograph on the artist was published in 1893, the same year as Aby Warburg's seminal dissertation on the mythologies; then, between 1900 and 1920 more books were written on Botticelli than on any other painter. Herbert Horne's monograph in English from 1908 is still recognised as of exceptional quality and thoroughness, \"one of the most stupendous achievements in Renaissance studies\".\nBotticelli appears as a character, sometimes a main one, in numerous fictional depictions of 15th-century Florence in various media. He was portrayed by Sebastian de Souza in the second season of the TV series \"\".\nThe main belt asteroid \"29361 Botticelli\" discovered on 9 February 1996, is named after him.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is associated with the art nouveau and aesthetic art movements. He was affiliated with a prestigious collaborative of designers known as the Associated Artists, which included Lockwood de Forest, Candace Wheeler, and Samuel Colman. Tiffany designed stained glass windows and lamps, glass mosaics, blown glass, ceramics, jewelry, enamels, and metalwork. He was the first design director at his family company, Tiffany &amp; Co., founded by his father Charles Lewis Tiffany.\nEarly life and education.\nTiffany was born in New York City, the son of Charles Lewis Tiffany, founder of Tiffany and Company, and Harriet Olivia Avery Young. He attended school at Pennsylvania Military Academy in Chester, Pennsylvania, and Eagleswood Military Academy in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.\nEarly career.\nTiffany's first artistic training was as a painter, studying under George Inness in Eagleswood, New Jersey, and Samuel Colman in Irvington, New York. He also studied at the National Academy of Design in New York City in 1866 and 1867 and with salon painter Leon-Adolphe-Auguste Belly in 1868 and 1869. Belly's landscape paintings had a great influence on Tiffany. \nAlthough Tiffany started out as a painter, he became interested in glassmaking from about 1875 and worked at several glasshouses in Brooklyn until 1878. In 1879 he joined with Candace Wheeler, Samuel Colman, and Lockwood de Forest to form \"Louis Comfort Tiffany and Associated American Artists\". The business lasted only four years. The group made designs for wallpaper, furniture, and textiles. In 1881, Tiffany did the interior design of the Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut, which still remains.\nHistory of Tiffany Studios.\nAfter Tiffany had formed a partnership with Colman, Lockwood DeForest, and Candace Wheeler, and after having incorporated the interior decorating firm of L.C. Tiffany &amp; Associated Artists, a desire to concentrate on art in glass led Tiffany to choose to establish his own glassmaking firm. The first Tiffany Glass Company was incorporated on December 1, 1885. It became the Tiffany Glass &amp; Decorating Company in 1892, and the Tiffany Studios in 1900. He had used commercial glass houses for 19 years to supply his Manhattan showroom and clients, but wanted to be fully in charge of production and design security. Finally, in 1892 he founded his own glassworks, the Louis C. Tiffany Furnaces in Corona Queens. As a youth Tiffany had attended the Flushing Institute, on Roosevelt Avenue between Main and Union Streets, where Macy's department store now sits. Tiffany was keenly aware of the area's potential and for his furnaces to succeed, he needed to hire the town's pool of experienced immigrant workers, who were then mostly Italian, German, and Irish.\" Tiffany experimented with glass. Sand for glassmaking was abundantly available at nearby Oyster Bay. Tiffany would eventually oversee two hundred artisans. Among them, Clara Driscoll, whose dragonfly lamp won a prize in the 1900 Paris Exposition, was by 1904 one of the highest paid women in the world. Even some of Tiffany's artists were foreigners, such as Venetian-born Andrea Boldini, and both Englishmen Joseph Briggs and Arthur J. Nash.\nWith Tiffany later opening his own glass factory in Corona, New York, he was determined to provide designs that improved the quality of contemporary glass. The factory was the old Tiffany Studios in Corona, Queens, at the southwest corner of 43rd Avenue and 97th place, where it was used to cast art sculptures of bronze designs for sculptors, and bronze architectural elements such as floor registers, door jambs, window casings, lamps, and sconces, most notably for Tiffany. The building had undergone a metamorphosis of name changes, beginning with the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company, in 1892. In 1893, Tiffany built a new factory called the Stourbridge Glass Company, later called Tiffany Glass Furnaces, which was located in Corona, Queens, hiring the Englishman Arthur J. Nash to oversee it. In 1893, his company also introduced the term \"Favrile\" in conjunction with his first production of blown glass at his new glass factory. Some early examples of his lamps were exhibited in the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago.\nAt the beginning of his career, Tiffany used cheap jelly jars and bottles because they had the mineral impurities that finer glass lacked. When he was unable to convince fine glassmakers to leave the impurities in, he began making his own glass. Tiffany used opalescent glass in a variety of colors and textures to create a unique style of stained glass. Tiffany acquired Stanford Bray's patent for the \"copper foil\" technique, which, by edging each piece of cut glass in copper foil and soldering the whole together to create his windows and lamps, made possible a level of detail previously unknown. This can be contrasted with the method of painting in enamels or glass paint on colorless glass, and then setting the glass pieces in lead channels, which had been the dominant method of creating stained glass for hundreds of years in Europe.\nTiffany trademarked \"Favrile\" (from the old French word for handmade) on November 13, 1894. He later used this word to apply to all of his glass, enamel and pottery. \"Tiffany's favrile glass vases were based on Venetian glassmaking techniques mixed with ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern inspirations.\" Tiffany delved into glass-making with interest in Venetian glass-maker Antonio Salviati. Tiffany would study techniques from Salviati-trained glassmaker, Andrea Boldini. In 1902, Tiffany had been influenced by a \"Cypriote\" line of jewelry that his father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, had introduced earlier at the Turin World's Fair. He coined this particular line of favrile glass the \"Cypriote\" line.\nTiffany's first commercially produced lamps date from around 1895. Much of his company's production was in making stained glass windows and Tiffany lamps, but his company designed a complete range of interior decorations. At its peak, his factory employed more than 300 artisans. \"Within this complex, Tiffany carried out experiments in glass colors and pottery glazing, perfected techniques of assembling stained glass windows.\" \u201cBy 1901, Tiffany was at the peak of his profession. \"At his father's death in 1902, came into an inheritance equivalent today to more than $20 million. At age fifty-four, he was appointed the first design director and vice president of Tiffany &amp; Co., taking on leading roles in the famous jewelry firm as well as continuing in his own enterprises. Also in 1902 Tiffany formally adopted the trademark Tiffany Studios for all works made in Corona, though the imprint had apparently been used earlier.\"\nTiffany Artisans.\nBy 1902, Louis C. Tiffany had \"several highly-gifted assistants working under his direction: Arthur J. Nash in glass; Clara Driscoll in leaded-glass lamps, windows, and mosaic design; Frederick Wilson in ecclesiastical stained-glass windows; and Julia Halsey Munson in enamels and jewelry design.\nArthur J. Nash.\nArthur J. Nash had been manager of a major glassworks in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, England. Tiffany persuaded Nash to join him in founding and heading a new firm, first called the Stourbridge Glass Company, and later in 1902 became known as the Tiffany Glass &amp; Decorating Company in Corona, Queens. Arthur J. Nash became Tiffany's partner, as Nash applied the favrile the glass technique learned from his hometown of Stourbridge, England to the glassworks produced by Tiffany. Thereafter, its name evolved from being called the Stourbridge Glass Company in 1893 (in deference to the technique learned from Nash's hometown), to the Tiffany Glass Furnaces, and finally to the Tiffany Studios. \"Nash hired many more skilled English artisans. Tiffany's vision, Nash's management, and Charles Lewis Tiffany's financing resulted in a thriving operation. Stourbridge Glass Company was absorbed by Tiffany into the Tiffany Furnaces in 1902.\n\"In 1920, Tiffany's glass production was reorganized under Nash's son, A. Douglas Nash, as part of Louis C. Tiffany Furnaces, Inc.; and, as in the case of the metal shop under Arthur Nash's other son, Leslie Nash, the production turned to more commercial table and other wares.\" In 1922, Leslie Nash, a creative artist and designer in his own right, had a major influence on Tiffany's production. \"In 1922, in the waning period of Tiffany Furnaces, Tiffany and Leslie Nash\u2014inspired by motifs from King Tutankhamen's recently discovered tomb\u2014designed an elaborate special order,\" for the wife of Chicago millionaire Cyrus McCormick. Tiffany sold his interests to the Nashes in 1928. Arthur Nash retired after 1918, and \"with him retired the secrets of making the finest and most technically complicated types of Tiffany glass, which remain to this day one of the crowning achievements of the decorative arts in America.\"\nClara Driscoll.\n\"A gifted unsung artist,\"&lt;ref name=\"Tiffany Girls - Eidelberg/Gray/Hofer\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Clara Driscoll was one of the many gifted artists employed by Tiffany. Driscoll was born in Tallmadge, Ohio. Driscoll was educated at the Western Reserve School of Design for Women, and in 1888 moved to New York City to study at the Metropolitan Museum of Art School. \"The turning point in her career came when she and her sister found employment at the Tiffany Glass Company in Manhattan.\" When Driscoll first began work at Tiffany's the firm was located at 333-35 Fourth Avenue, later renamed for its lush-green central median, Park Avenue. The names of the firm underwent a metamorphosis of name changes, as had Tiffany's glass operation with Nash: Louis C. Tiffany and Associated Artists, to Louis C. Tiffany &amp; Co., and finally the Tiffany Glass Company. \"As the name suggests, the company focused largely on leaded-glass windows but it also received commissions for interior decoration.\" From the late 1880s until about 1909, Driscoll supervised many of Tiffany's most celebrated leaded windows and mosaics. Since the common practice at the time was to limit female hires to unmarried status, Driscoll worked on and off on three separate occasions. During Driscoll's first term in 1892, a \"Women's Glass Cutting Department\" with six female employees under Driscoll's direction was created, and in two years, this had increased to thirty-five. Her third term at Tiffany's, \"undoubtedly the most creative\" tenure of her career, was the period many refer to as \"the most prestigious commissions for leaded-glass windows and mosaics by her \"Tiffany Girls.\" It was during this tenure that iconic pieces like the \"Dragonfly\", \"Wisteria\", and \"Poppy\" lamp shades were created. Undoubtedly, the magic in the artistic endeavors by Tiffany and his artisans can only be ascribed to the \"harmony that existed between Tiffany and his workers.\"\nFrederick Wilson.\nFrederick Wilson started at Tiffany Studios in 1893, became its chief window designer in 1897, and head of the Ecclesiastical Department in 1899. He was among the most prominent and prolific designers: \"e.g.\", \"The Righteous Shall Receive a Crown of Glory\" (1901); \"Angel of the Resurrection\" (1904); \"The Prayer of the Christian Soldier\" (1919). He worked in his studio at Briarcliff Manor, New York, as well as in the Tiffany Studios factory at Corona, Queens. After 30 years and more than 500 windows designed and executed, he left Tiffany Studios in 1923 and moved to Los Angeles to work for Judson Studios.\nJulia Halsey Munson.\nJulia Munson was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1875. Munson was trained at the Artist-Artisan Institute of New York. Munson's drawings, preserved in Tiffany &amp; Co. archives, exhibit abstract attention to nature's beauty, namely plants and flowers inspired by Tiffany's glassworks. \"The idea of Tiffany's enamels as the link between his stained-glass windows and his jewelry for Tiffany &amp; Co. is well founded. \"During the twelve years they collaborated on jewelry, they maintained the practice of taking themes from Tiffany's glass, mosaics, and metalwork, creating jewels that women sought around the world.\" Although Tiffany's lamps are his most well-known artistic creations, his unique jewelry, characterised by vibrant colors, unusual stones, and exotic motifs, has also become sought after by collectors of fine jewelry.\nIn 1903, Julia Munson became the head of Tiffany &amp; Co.'s jewelry department. She played a pivotal role in developing the enameling techniques used in Tiffany's jewelry, although her significant contributions remained largely unrecognized at the time, as none of the pieces she worked on were signed. One notable example of their collaboration is the \"Peacock Necklace\" (circa 1906), designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany and crafted by Munson. The necklace showcases opals, amethysts, sapphires, and demantoid garnets, all set in intricate cloisonn\u00e9 enamel on gold.\nAgnes Northrop.\nAgnes Northrop (1857 \u2013 1953) started as a \"Tiffany Girl\" and became a designer. In 2024 the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired her stained glass triptych entitled \"Garden Landscape\" \nFinality.\nTiffany\u2019s glass fell out of favor in the 1910s, and by the 1920s a foundry had been installed for a separate bronze company. Tiffany's leadership and talent, as well as his father's money and old firm, allowed Tiffany to relaunch Tiffany Studios as a marketing strategy for his business to thrive. In 1924 the firm underwent a name change, and was renamed the \"A. Douglas Nash Company.\" Leslie Nash states that they \"made glass for only one and a half years\" which would suggest that the firm stopped producing favrile glass by 1927 or the latest by 1929. Leslie Nash, son of Arthur Nash, describes the ultimate demise of the company in the context of the Great Depression:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"A Directors meeting was called\u2014the auditors read the statement\u2014which showed us in the red more than $400,000\u2014a very heavy loss. It was voted to go into voluntary bankruptcy. Mr. Tiffany bought in all the stock at par, paid all outstanding indebtedness\u2014and the famous Glass business was closed forever. Shortly following, the Tiffany Studios with all its departments did the same thing.\"\nLeslie Nash, \"Behind the Scenes of Tiffany Glassmaking,\" p. 13\n In 1932, Tiffany Studios filed for bankruptcy. Ownership of the complex passed back to the original owners of the factory \u2014 the Roman Bronze Works \u2014 which had served as a subcontractor to Tiffany for many years.\u201d John Polachek, founder of the General Bronze Corporation \u2014who had worked at the Tiffany Studios earlier\u2014 purchased the Roman Bronze Works (the old Tiffany Studios). General Bronze then became the largest bronze fabricator in New York City formed through the merger of his own companies and Tiffany's Corona factory. Today, the \"Louis Tiffany School\" or New York City's https://, is now built on that site.\nControversy.\nThe relations between Louis C. Tiffany and his highly-gifted artisans\u2014such as between Arthur Nash and his family business relationships with Tiffany; or Clara Driscoll, his head designer for lamps and stained-glass windows\u2014-will probably never be known. Clara Driscoll's work was never once publicly acknowledged. Arthur Nash, who served as the head of Tiffany's glassworks, was never once publicly acknowledged either. They have been under scrutiny ever since Tiffany retired after the stock market crash of 1929.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"When the firm was obliged to disclose the names of individual workers to juries, as at the Paris World's Fair of 1900, it complied and, in fact, both Clara Driscoll and Arthur Nash as well as others received prizes. Nonetheless, their individual awards were never publicized, but Tiffany's were.\"\nMartin Eidelberg, Nina Gray, Margaret Hofer, \"A New Light on Tiffany \u2014 Clara Driscoll and the Tiffany Girls,\" p. 12\n \"The exact nature of Arthur Nash's business relation to Tiffany remains problematic. That [one firm] was named the Stourbridge Glass Company in deference to Arthur Nash's previous work in England suggests Nash's eminence and influence.\" \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The documentary evidence shows that at two points in its early history, on June 26 and September 13, 1893, the Stourbridge Glass Company sought financing by issuing additional stock. It was then that Louis C. Tiffany's father became a stockholder and Louis himself was designated as president.\"\nMartin Eidelberg &amp; Nancy A. McClelland, \"Behind the Scenes of Tiffany Glassmaking,\" p. 7\n It would appear that contracts negotiated between Tiffany and Nash's Stourbridge Glass Co. limited Nash's artistic control, and that, \"there was a phrase that gave Louis C. Tiffany artistic control. Until then, Louis Tiffany's name had not appeared on the company's documents, but suddenly he was listed as president.\" \nOn January 6, 1920, the firm was incorporated as the \"Louis C. Tiffany Furnaces, Inc.\" At this time, Tiffany was still president, but most of his shares had been already transferred to the charitable foundations for artists that he had legally set up in his name. After this, the Nash family \u2014 Arthur J., and his two sons, A. Douglas and Leslie \u2014 owned a large block of the company. The closing of the factory has also been a matter of some debate. Overall, findings would suggest that the factory closed circa 1929-1930. Louis Tiffany subsequently died in 1933.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNash's work was done anonymously and under Tiffany's shadow. Yet, had there not been a Tiffany, there would have been no Nash.\nMartin Eidelberg, Nina Gray, Margaret Hofer, \"A New Light on Tiffany \u2014 Clara Driscoll and the Tiffany Girls,\" p. 24\nWhite House.\nThe new firm's most notable work came in 1882 when U.S. president Chester Alan Arthur refused to move into the White House until it had been redecorated. Arthur commissioned Tiffany, who began to make a name for himself in New York City society for the firm's interior design work, to redo the state rooms, which Arthur found charmless.\nTiffany worked on the East Room, the Blue Room, the Red Room, the State Dining Room, and the Entrance Hall, refurnishing, repainting in decorative patterns, installing newly designed mantelpieces, changing to wallpaper with dense patterns, and adding Tiffany glass to gaslight fixtures and windows and adding an opalescent floor-to-ceiling glass screen in the Entrance Hall.\nThe Tiffany screen and other Victorian additions were all removed in the Roosevelt renovations of 1902, which restored the White House interiors to Federal style in keeping with its architecture.\nFirst Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh.\nThe First Presbyterian Church building of 1905 in Pittsburgh, uses Tiffany windows that partially make use of painted glass. Use of the colored glass itself to create stained glass pictures was motivated by the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement and its leader William Morris in England. Fellow artists and glassmakers Oliver Kimberly and Frank Duffner, founders of the Duffner and Kimberly Company and John La Farge were Tiffany's chief competitors in this new American style of stained glass. Tiffany, Duffner and Kimberly, along with La Farge, had learned their craft at the same glasshouses in Brooklyn in the late 1870s.\nIn 1889, at the Paris Exposition, Tiffany was said to have been \"overwhelmed\" by the glass work of \u00c9mile Gall\u00e9, French Art Nouveau artisan. He also met artist Alphonse Mucha. In 1900, at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, he won a gold medal with his stained glass windows \"The Four Seasons\"\nRecent research by Rutgers University professor Martin Eidelberg suggests that a team of talented single women designers, sometimes referred to as the \"Tiffany Girls\", led by Clara Driscoll played a big role in designing many of the floral patterns on the famous Tiffany lamp and other creations. Tiffany interiors also made considerable use of mosaics. The mosaics workshop, largely staffed by women, was overseen until 1898 by the Swiss-born sculptor and designer Jacob Adolphus Holzer.\nTiffany &amp; Co..\nIn 1902, Tiffany became the first design director for Tiffany &amp; Co., the jewelry company founded by his father. 1911 saw the installation of an enormous glass curtain fabricated for the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. It is considered by some to be a masterpiece. Tiffany used all his skills in the design of his own house, the 84-room Laurelton Hall, in the village of Laurel Hollow, on Long Island, New York, completed in 1905. Later this estate was donated to his foundation for art students along with 60 acres (243,000 m2) of land, sold in 1949, and destroyed by a fire in 1957. Aside from his fame for glass and jewelry design, Tiffany also designed what we know today as the New York Yankees logo, originally used in 1877 as part of the NYPD's Medal of Valor.\nPersonal life.\nTiffany married Mary Woodbridge Goddard on May 15, 1872, in Norwich, Connecticut, and had four children:\nAfter the death of his wife, he married Louise Wakeman Knox (1851\u20131904) on November 9, 1886. They had four children:\nLaurelton Hall.\nTiffany had designed and built Laurelton Hall but has long since been demolished. It was situated in the village of Laurel Hollow in the town of Oyster Bay on Long Island, New York. It was built as an 84-room mansion on 600 acres of land, designed in classic Art Nouveau style. \"Laurelton was ever-evolving,\" according to Alice Frelinghuysen. The house, as well as the gardens, both manifested and embodied Tiffany's artistic expression. \"He filled museum-style cases with hundreds of the best examples of his own glass vases. pottery, enamelware, juxtaposed with Roman and Syrian glass, Egyptian jewelry, and Near Eastern ceramics and tiles.\" Tiffany hung a selection of paintings in Laurelton Hall. In the main house he displayed a range of paintings, including only two European artists. For the dining room he purchased a painting of ducks by Alexander Koester. He also purchased four paintings by Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla, who he commissioned for a portrait.\nDeath.\nTiffany died on January 17, 1933, and is interred in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York City. Tiffany is the great-grandfather of investor George Gilder.\nCollections.\nThe Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida, houses the world's most comprehensive collection of the works of Louis Comfort Tiffany, including Tiffany jewelry, pottery, paintings, art glass, leaded-glass windows, lamps, and the Tiffany Chapel he designed for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. After the close of the exposition, a benefactor purchased the entire chapel for installation in the crypt of the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York in New York City. As construction on the cathedral continued, the chapel fell into disuse, and in 1916, Tiffany removed the bulk of it to Laurelton Hall. After a 1957 fire, Hugh McKean, a former art student in 1930 at Laurelton Hall, and his wife Jeannette Genius McKean rescued the chapel, which now occupies an entire wing of the Morse Museum which they founded. Many glass panels from Laurelton Hall are also there; for many years some were on display in local restaurants and businesses in Central Florida. Some were replaced by full-scale color transparencies after the museum opened.\nIn November 2006, a major exhibit about Laurelton Hall, \"Louis Comfort Tiffany and Laurelton Hall: An Artist's Country Estate\", opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In 2007, an exhibit at the New-York Historical Society featured new information about the women who worked for Tiffany and their contribution to designs credited to Tiffany; the Society holds and exhibits a major collection of Tiffany's work. Since 1995, the Queens Museum of Art has featured a permanent collection of Tiffany objects, which continues Tiffany's presence in Corona, Queens where the company's studios were once located. Reid Memorial Presbyterian Church in Richmond, Indiana, has a collection of 62 Tiffany windows which are still their original placements, but the church is deteriorating and in jeopardy.\nIn 1906, Tiffany created stained glass windows for the Stanford White-designed Madison Square Presbyterian Church located on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The church was Tiffany's place of worship, and was torn down in 1919 after the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company bought the land to build their new headquarters. Tiffany had inserted a clause in his contract stipulating that if the church were ever to be demolished, then ownership of the windows would revert to him.\nTiffany enjoyed staying at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California, and had become friends with the founder of the Mission Inn, Frank Augustus Miller, so, after meeting with Miller in New York, Tiffany shipped the windows to the Mission Inn; they arrived there in 1924, and were stored until the inn's St. Francis Chapel was completed in 1931. There are six rectangular windows and a 104\u201d diameter window in the rear of the chapel, as well as another 104\u201d diameter window is in the Galeria next to the chapel. A smaller window entitled \u201cMonk At The Organ\u201d featuring a Franciscan friar, is in St Cecelia's Chapel, a wedding chapel, and is engraved with Tiffany's signature. The St Francis Chapel was designed with the intent of prominently displaying Tiffany's windows.\nThe Arlington Street Church in Boston has 16 Tiffany windows of a set of 20, designed by Frederick Wilson (1858\u20131932), Tiffany's chief designer for ecclesiastical windows. They were gradually installed between 1889 and 1929. The church archives include designs for 4 additional windows which were never commissioned due to financial constraints caused by the Great Depression. When funds again became available, Tiffany Studios had gone out of business and its stockpile of glass had been dispersed and lost, ending the prospect of completing the set. Also in the Back Bay district of Boston is Frederick Ayer Mansion, one of three surviving examples of Tiffany interiors, and the only surviving building also possessing exterior mosaics designed by Tiffany.\nThe Pine Street Baptist Church in Providence, Rhode Island, was opened in 1917 at Lloyd and Wayland Street as Central Baptist and in 2003, became known as Community Church of Providence. Between 1917 and 2018 the church featured a large Tiffany stained glass memorial to Frederick W. Hartwell that was created by Agnes F. Northrop and entitled \"Light in Heaven and Earth\". The complex work, considered \"one of the largest and finest landscape windows ever produced by Tiffany Studios\", largely was overlooked in the community. In 2018, the church sold the window to the Art Institute of Chicago. After conservation and preparation, it will be displayed prominently as the Hartwell Memorial Window.\nSignificant collections of Tiffany windows outside the United States are the 17 windows in the former Erskine and American United Church, now part of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Montreal, Canada, and the two windows in the American Church in Paris, on the Quai d'Orsay, which have been classified as National Monuments by the French government; these were commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker in 1901 for the original American Church building on the right bank of the Seine.\nThe Haworth Art Gallery in Accrington, England, contains a collection of more than 140 examples of the work of Louis Comfort Tiffany, including vases, tiles, lamps, and mosaics. The collection, which claims to be the largest collection of publicly owned Tiffany glass outside of the United States, contains a fine example of an Aquamarine vase and the noted Sulphur Crested Cockatoos mosaic.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\nFurther reading"}

The book gives a critical view of society at the end of the Victorian era through the eyes of a na\u00efve schoolboy outsider.\nSynopsis.\nIn the book's prologue, Leo Colston chances upon a diary from 1900, the year of his thirteenth birthday, and gradually pieces together a memory that he has suppressed. Under its influence, and from the viewpoint of what he has become by the midpoint of \"this hideous century\", Leo relives the events of what had once seemed to him its hopeful beginning. The importance of his boarding school's social rules is another theme running through the book and complicates Leo's interaction with the adult world.\n\"Curses\" of his devising had routed boys who were bullying Leo at school and had given him the reputation of a magician, something that he came to half-believe himself. As a result, he is invited as a guest to spend the summer at Brandham Hall, the country home of his school friend Marcus Maudsley, who comes from a wealthy family. The Maudsleys are renting Brandham Hall from the aristocratic Hugh, Viscount Trimingham, the descendant of the area's nobility; Mrs Maudsley intends her daughter Marian to marry Trimingham in order to consolidate the family's social position. The socially clumsy Leo, with his regional accent, is a middle-class boy among the wealthy upper class. Although he does not fit into this society, his hosts do their best to make him feel welcome, treating him with kindness and indulgence, especially Marian.\nWhen Marcus falls ill, Leo is left largely to his own devices and becomes a secret \"postman\" for Marian and nearby tenant farmer Ted Burgess, with whom she is having a clandestine relationship. Leo is happy to help Marian because he has a crush on her and likes Ted. Besides, Leo is initially ignorant of the significance or content of the messages that he is asked to carry between them, and the well-meaning, innocent boy is easily manipulated by the lovers. Although Marian and Ted are fully aware of the social taboo that must make their relationship a matter of the utmost secrecy, Leo is too na\u00efve to understand why they never can marry.\nAs he begins to comprehend that the relationship between Marian and Ted is not to do with \"business\" as they have claimed, Leo naively believes that Marian's engagement to Trimingham ought to bring the correspondence between her and Ted to an end. Feeling increasingly uncomfortable about the general atmosphere of deception and risk, Leo tries to end his role as go-between but comes under great psychological pressure, and he is forced to continue. Ultimately, his unwilling involvement has disastrous consequences when Marian's mother makes him accompany her as she tracks the lovers to their hiding place and discovers them having sex. The trauma that results leads directly to Ted's suicide and Leo's nervous collapse.\nIn the epilogue, the older Leo summarises how profoundly the experience has affected him. Forbidding himself to think about the scandal, he had shut down his emotions and imaginative nature, leaving room only for facts. As a result, he never has been able to establish intimate relationships. Now, looking back on the events through the eyes of a mature adult, he feels it is important to return to Brandham some 50 years later in order to tie up loose ends. There he meets Marian's grandson and finds Marian living in her former nanny's cottage. He also learns that Trimingham had married Marian and acknowledged Ted's son by her as his own. Trimingham had died in 1910; Marcus and his elder brother had died in World War I, and Marian's son died in World War II. In the end, the elderly Marian persuades Leo, the only other survivor from her past, to act once more as go-between and assure her estranged grandson that there was nothing to be ashamed of in her affair with Ted Burgess.\nReception.\n\"The Go-Between\" was first published in Britain by Hamish Hamilton in 1953. In the U.S., its publisher was Alfred A. Knopf in the summer of 1954, and the book was slow to sell at first. However, it was greeted with favourable reviews. \"The New York Times\" called it \"a triumph of literary architecture\", while two articles were devoted to it in the \"Los Angeles Times\". Joseph Henry Jackson commented on its skilful presentation as \"a many-leveled affair; perhaps only the author knows how much there is in it of symbol and reference.\" A month later Milton Merlin described it as \"a superbly composed and an irresistibly haunting novel\" characterised by \"the author's beautiful and ingenious style, his whimsy, irony and humor, and, most of all, the powerful wallop of a deceptively simple, almost gentle story of a boy lost in a strange world of emotions.\"\nThere have been regular editions from Penguin Books and other sources since 1958. By 1954, translations were being prepared in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Japanese, French and Italian. Others followed later in Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Romanian and German. The novel has also been set as an exam text with a study guide dedicated to it and there have been interdisciplinary studies on psychological and philosophical themes there.\nInterpretations.\nLater literary interpretations looked beyond the book's immediately noticeable themes. For Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn in his introduction to a 2002 reprint, the book is not really \"a drama about class or about England, or a lost world mourned by Hartley; instead it is a drama about Leo's deeply sensuous nature moving blindly, in a world of rich detail and beautiful sentences, toward a destruction that is impelled by his own intensity of feeling and, despite everything, his own innocence.\" Kevin Gardner cites the narrative technique among other complex treatments of time: \"Hartley's haunting tale of lost innocence underscores the modern experience of broken time, a paradox in which humanity is alienated from the past, yet not free from it, a past that continues to exist in and to control the subconscious ... This doubling of consciousness and of narrative voice\u2014the innocent twelve-year-old's emerging from beneath the self-protective sixty-five-year-old's\u2014is one of Hartley's most effective techniques.\"\nAnother preoccupation in T\u00f3ib\u00edn's introduction was how far the story of \"The Go-Between\" is based on fact, in the wake of Adrian Wright's biographical study \"Foreign Country: The Life of L. P. Hartley\". Although Leo is 12 at the time of the novel \u2013 the long, hot summer of 1900 \u2013 the five-year-old Hartley remembered that time afterwards as \"a Golden Age\". When he was about Leo's age in 1909, Hartley spent a summer with a school friend called Moxley at Bradenham Hall in Norfolk and took part in a cricket match. The names are sufficiently close to Maudsley and Brandham to give rise to such speculation. However, T\u00f3ib\u00edn counsels a cautious approach to the question, quoting Hartley's study of fiction-writing \"The Novelist's Responsibility\". The novelist's world, he wrote \"must, in some degree, be an extension of his own life\", and while it is \"unsafe to assume that a novelist's work is autobiographical in any direct sense,\" this idea does not prevent it from reflecting his experience.\nAmong other writers commenting on the book's contemporary context, Paul Binding has pointed out that its famous opening phrase \"The past is a foreign country\" can be traced to one used by Hartley's friend Lord David Cecil in his inaugural lecture as Goldsmith's Professor of English Literature at Oxford in 1949. Ian McEwan has described his acclaimed novel \"Atonement\" (2001) as \"an act of homage in some ways\" to \"The Go-Between\" in an interview, recalling that while reading the novel for the first time at 14 he was \"electrified\" by \"the way you can wrap a fictional story around real events and real things and give it a vivid quality it would not otherwise have\". Ali Smith revisited the observed parallel drawn between the treatment of class and sexuality in \"The Go-Between\" and in \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" (1928). D.H. Lawrence's novel was not allowed unexpurgated circulation in Britain until after \"The Go-Between\"'s appearance, but perhaps, she speculated, Hartley's novel helped prepare the climate for the overturning of the British ban on Lawrence's work seven years later.\nAdaptations.\nPlay.\nIn 1960, an adaptation for stage by Louise F. Tanner was produced in Morgantown, West Virginia. Tanner travelled to the United Kingdom to consult Hartley in person about the work.\nFilm.\nPlaywright Harold Pinter adapted the novel into a screenplay of a film of the same name (1971), directed by Joseph Losey.\nTelevision.\nA television adaptation starring Jim Broadbent was broadcast on BBC One on 20 September 2015.\nRadio.\nOn 2 January 1961, a radio adaptation by Archie Campbell and narrated by Denys Blakelock was broadcast on BBC Home Service. The production was re-broadcast on 10 July 1961. The production was re-broadcast in July 2024 on Radio 4 Extra as part of the Hidden Treasures series.\nOn 25 May 2002, a new dramatisation by Laurie Graham for The Saturday Play, BBC Radio 4.\nOn 8 July 2012, an adaptation by Frances Byrnes and directed by Matt Thompson was broadcast on BBC Radio 3.

{"id": "73518", "revid": "5957417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73518", "title": "Rosa Bonheur", "text": "French painter and sculptor (1822\u20131899)\nRosa Bonheur (born Marie-Rosalie Bonheur; 16 March 1822 \u2013 25 May 1899) was a French artist known best as a painter of animals (animali\u00e8re). She also made sculptures in a realist style. Her paintings include \"Ploughing in the Nivernais\", first exhibited at the Salon of 1849, and now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris, and \"The Horse Fair\" (in French: \"Le march\u00e9 aux chevaux\"), which was exhibited at the Salon of 1853 (finished in 1855) and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Bonheur was widely considered to be the most famous female painter of the nineteenth century.\nIt has been claimed that Bonheur was openly lesbian, as she lived with her partner Nathalie Micas for over 40 years until Micas's death. After that she lived with American painter Anna Elizabeth Klumpke. However, others assert that nothing supports this claim.\nEarly development and artistic training.\nBonheur was born on 16 March 1822 in Bordeaux, Gironde, the oldest child in a family of artists. Her mother was Sophie Bonheur (n\u00e9e Marquis), a piano teacher; she died when Rosa was eleven. Her father was Oscar-Raymond Bonheur, a landscape and portrait painter who encouraged his daughter's artistic talents. Though of Jewish origin, the Bonheur family adhered to Saint-Simonianism, a Christian socialist sect that promoted the education of women alongside men. Bonheur's siblings included the animal painters Auguste Bonheur and Juliette Bonheur, as well as the animal sculptor Isidore Jules Bonheur. Francis Galton used the Bonheurs as an example of the eponymous \"Hereditary Genius\" in his 1869 essay.\nBonheur moved to Paris in 1828 at the age of six with her mother and siblings, after her father had gone ahead of them to establish a residence and income there. By family accounts, she had been an unruly child and had a difficult time learning to read, though she would sketch for hours at a time with pencil and paper before she learned to talk. Her mother taught her to read and write by asking her to choose and draw a different animal for each letter of the alphabet. The artist credited her love of drawing animals to these reading lessons with her mother.\nAt school, she was often disruptive and was expelled numerous times. After a failed apprenticeship with a seamstress at the age of twelve, her father undertook her training as a painter. Her father allowed her to pursue her interest in painting animals by bringing live animals to the family's studio for studying.\nFollowing the traditional art school curriculum of the period, Bonheur began her training by copying images from drawing books and by sketching plaster models. As her training progressed, she made studies of domesticated animals, including horses, sheep, cows, goats, rabbits, and other animals in the pastures around the perimeter of Paris, the open fields of Villiers near Levallois-Perret, and the still-wild Bois de Boulogne. At fourteen, she began to copy paintings at the Louvre. Among her favorite painters were Nicolas Poussin and Peter Paul Rubens, though she also copied the paintings of Paulus Potter, Frans Pourbus the Younger, Louis L\u00e9opold Robert, Salvatore Rosa, and Karel Dujardin.\nShe studied animal anatomy and osteology in the abattoirs of Paris and dissected animals at the \u00c9cole nationale v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire d'Alfort, the National Veterinary Institute in Paris. There, she prepared detailed studies that she later used as references for her paintings and sculptures. During this period, she befriended the father-and-son comparative anatomists and zoologists, \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.\nEarly success and development of career.\nBonheur's first major success can be attributed to \"The Horse Fair\", which was first displayed at the Paris Salon in 1853. The painting was started in 1851 and completed in 1855. It measures eight by sixteen feet (2.4 by 4.9 m) and depicts the horse market held in Paris, on the tree-lined boulevard de l'H\u00f4pital, near the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, which is visible in the painting's background. There is a reduced version that can be found in the National Gallery located in London. Bonheur had been displaying her work at the Paris Salon for several years before displaying \"The Horse Fair\", earning medals and smaller praise. This even resulted in the commissioning of \"Ploughing in the Nivernais\" from the state, which was exhibited in 1849 and is now on display in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay located in Paris. Due to \"The Horse Fair\" sparking debate and controversy among critics and collectors when it was first displayed at the Paris Salon, it allowed Bonheur to create a public image and insert herself into the international art world. One such debate was that Comte de Nieuwerkerke (1811 - 1892) implied that Bonheur had been commissioned by the state to create the work, though there is no known documentation to back said implication, and Bonheur herself went through the effort of discrediting it. In 1856, Bonheur traveled to England and Scotland with Micas, where she met Queen Victoria, John Ruskin, and other major British artists\".\" In Scotland, she completed sketches and studies for later works such as \"https://,\" completed in 1859, \"https://,\" completed in 1860, and other paintings. These pieces depicted a way of life in the Scottish Highlands that had disappeared a century earlier, and had an enormous appeal to Victorian sensibilities.\nBonheur exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In 1889 and 1890 she developed a friendship with American sculptor Cyrus Dallin who was studying in Paris. Together they traveled to Neuilly outside of Paris to sketch the animals and cast of Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show at their encampment. In 1890 Bonheur painted Cody on horseback. Dallin's work from this period \"A Signal of Peace\" would also be displayed in Chicago in 1893 and be the first major step in his career.\nThough she was more popular in England than in her native France, she was decorated with the French Legion of Honour by Empress Eug\u00e9nie in 1865, and was promoted to Officer of the Order in 1894. She was the first female artist to be given this award.\nPatronage and the market for her work.\nBonheur was represented by the art dealer Ernest Gambart (1814\u20131902). It's unknown when the two of them first met, but by 1854, the two were on close terms. Gambart served as a friend, sponsor, and promoter for Bonheur's work and went to great lengths to ensure her work would be pushed to wider audiences. By 1855, Gambart had bought \"The Horse Fair\" for forty thousand francs so that he could display the painting in an exhibition of French art located in England. Through this exhibition, Bonheur's work was recognized by several English critics, such as William Rossetti, who commented on it positively. Regardless of the positive attention that Bonheur's work gained, she still received backlash for the fact that she was a woman artist. But through \"The Horse Fair\" being displayed in England, even at one point being moved to Buckingham Palace for a brief time to be studied by Queen Victoria, it erased all doubts that Bonheur's work was made by herself and paved the way for her success.\nMany engravings of Bonheur's work were created from reproductions by Charles George Lewis (1808\u20131880), one of the finest engravers of the day.\nIn 1859 her success enabled her to move to the Ch\u00e2teau de By near Fontainebleau, not far from Paris, where she lived for the rest of her life. The house is now a museum dedicated to her.\nPersonal life and legacy.\nWomen were often only reluctantly educated as artists in Bonheur's day, and by becoming such a successful artist she helped to open doors to the women artists who followed her.\nBonheur was known for wearing men's clothing; she attributed her choice of trousers to their practicality for working with animals (see Rational dress).\nShe lived with her first partner, Nathalie Micas, for over 40 years until Micas' death, and later began a relationship with the American painter Anna Elizabeth Klumpke. At a time when lesbianism was regarded as animalistic and deranged by most French officials, Bonheur's outspokenness about her personal life was groundbreaking.\nIn a world where gender expression was policed, Bonheur broke boundaries by deciding to wear trousers, shirts, and ties, although not in her painted portraits or posed photographs. She did not do this because she wanted to be a man, though she occasionally referred to herself as a grandson or brother when talking about her family; rather, she identified with the power and freedom reserved for men. It also broadcast her sexuality at a time when the lesbian stereotype consisted of women who cut their hair short, wore trousers, and chain-smoked. Rosa Bonheur did all three. Bonheur never explicitly said she was a lesbian, but her lifestyle and the way she talked about her female partners suggest this. Bonheur, while taking pleasure in activities usually reserved for men (such as hunting and smoking), viewed her womanhood as something far superior to anything a man could offer or experience. She viewed men as stupid and mentioned that the only males she had time or attention for were the bulls she painted.\nFrom 1800 until 2013, women in Paris, France, were technically forbidden from wearing trousers without permission from the police, with only a few exceptions. Enforcement of this largely stopped during World War I and afterward, but in Bonheur's time, it was still an issue. In the 1850s, Bonheur had to ask permission from the police to wear trousers, as this was her preferred attire to go to the sheep and cattle markets to study the animals she painted.\nHaving chosen to never become an adjunct or appendage to a man in terms of painting, she decided she would be her own boss and that she would lean on herself and her female partners instead. She had her partners focus on the home life while she took on the role of breadwinner by concentrating on her painting. Bonheur's legacy paved the way for other lesbian artists who didn't favour the life society had laid out for them.\nBonheur died on 25 May 1899, at the age of 77, at Thomery (By), France. She was buried together with Nathalie Micas (1824 \u2013 24 June 1889), her lifelong companion and lover, at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. Klumpke was Bonheur's sole heir after her death, and later joined Micas and Bonheur in the same cemetery upon her death. Bonheur, Micas, and Klumpke's collective tombstone reads, \"Friendship is divine affection\". Many of her paintings, which had not previously been shown publicly, were sold at auction in Paris in 1900.\nAlong with other realist painters of the 19th century, for much of the 20th century Bonheur fell from fashion, and in 1978 a critic described \"Ploughing in the Nivernais\" as \"entirely forgotten and rarely dragged out from oblivion\"; however, that same year it was part of a series of paintings sent to China by the French government for an exhibition titled \"The French Landscape and Peasant, 1820\u20131905\". Since then, her reputation has been somewhat revived.\nRosa Bonheur Memorial Park is a pet cemetery located in Elkridge, Maryland, established in 1935, and actively operated until 2002.\nArt historian Linda Nochlin\u2019s 1971 essay \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\", considered a pioneering essay for both feminist art history and feminist art theory, contains a section about and titled \"Rosa Bonheur.\"\nOne of Bonheur's works, \"Monarchs of the Forest\", sold at auction in 2008 for just over $200,000.\nIn homage to the painter, four Parisian guinguettes bear the name Rosa Bonheur. The first opened in 2008 in the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. It is mentioned at length by Virginie Despentes in her series of novels, Vernon Subutex. The second in 2014 on the banks of the Seine at the Port des Invalides, the third in 2017 in Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine, and the fourth in 2021 in the Bois de Vincennes, home of the Rosa Bonheur Modern Team (RBMT) of various sports teams and a pep band. Each of the four locations of Rosa Bonheur is home to a multilingual pop choir, collectively known as \"Viens Chanter Bonheur,\" which is led by musician and ceramic artist Damien Bousquet.\nOn 16 March 2022, Google honoured Bonheur with a Doodle to mark the bicentennial of her birth. The Doodle reached five countries: the United States, Ireland, France, Iceland and India.\nBiographical works.\nThe first biography of Bonheur was published during her lifetime: a pamphlet written by Eug\u00e8ne de Mirecourt, \"Les Contemporains: Rosa Bonheur,\" which appeared just after her Salon success with \"The Horse Fair\" in 1856. Bonheur later corrected and annotated this document.\nThe 1905 book \"Women Painters of the World\" (assembled and edited by Walter Shaw Sparrow) was subtitled \"from the time of Caterina Vigri, 1413\u20131463, to Rosa Bonheur and the present day\".\nThe second account was written by Anna Klumpke, Bonheur's companion in the last year of her life. Klumpke's biography, published in 1909 as \"Rosa Bonheur: sa vie, son oeuvre,\" was translated in 1997 by Gretchen Van Slyke and published as \"Rosa Bonheur: The Artist's (Auto)biography,\" so-named because Klumpke had used Bonheur's first-person voice.\n\"Reminiscences of Rosa Bonheur\", edited by Theodore Stanton (the son of Elizabeth Cady Stanton), was published in London and New York in 1910. It includes numerous correspondences between Bonheur and her family and friends, in which she describes her art-making practices.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nResources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A child prodigy, he was born in Bristol and began drawing in Devizes, where his father was an innkeeper at the Bear Hotel in the Market Square. At age ten, having moved to Bath, he was supporting his family with his pastel portraits. \nAt 18, he went to London and soon established his reputation as a portrait painter in oils, receiving his first royal commission, a portrait of Queen Charlotte, in 1789. He stayed at the top of his profession until his death, aged 60, in 1830. Self-taught, he was a brilliant draughtsman and known for his gift of capturing a likeness, as well as his virtuoso handling of paint. He became an associate of the Royal Academy in 1791, a full member in 1794, and president in 1820. \nIn 1810, he acquired the generous patronage of the Prince Regent, was sent abroad to paint portraits of allied leaders for the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle, and is particularly remembered as the Romantic portraitist of the Regency. Lawrence's love affairs were not happy (his tortuous relationships with Sally and Maria Siddons were the subjects of several books) and, in spite of his success, he spent most of life deep in debt and never married. At his death, he was the most fashionable portrait painter in Europe. His reputation waned during Victorian times, but has since been partially restored.\nBiography.\nChildhood and early career.\nLawrence was born at 6 Redcross Street, Bristol, the youngest surviving child of Thomas Lawrence, a supervisor of excise, and Lucy Read, a clergyman's daughter from Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire. They had 16 children, but only five survived infancy: Lawrence's brother Andrew became a clergyman; William had a career in the army; and sisters Lucy and Anne married a solicitor and a clergyman (Lawrence's nephews included Andrew Bloxam). Soon after Thomas was born, his father decided to become an innkeeper and took over the White Lion Inn and next-door American Coffee House in Broad Street, Bristol. But the venture did not prosper, and in 1773 Lawrence senior removed his family from Bristol and took over the tenancy of the Black Bear Inn in Devizes, a favourite stopping place for the London gentry making their annual trip to take the waters at Bath.\nIt was during the family's six-year stay at the Black Bear Inn that Lawrence senior began to make use of his son's precocious talents for drawing and reciting poetry. Visitors would be greeted with the words \"Gentlemen, here's my son\u2014will you have him recite from the poets, or take your portraits?\" Among those who listened to a recitation from Tom, or Tommy as he was called, was actor David Garrick. \nLawrence's formal schooling was limited to two years at The Fort, a school in Bristol, when he was six to eight; and a little tuition in French and Latin from a dissenting minister. He also became accomplished in dancing, fencing, boxing and billiards. By age ten his fame had spread sufficiently for him to receive a mention in Daines Barrington's \"Miscellanies\" as \"without the most distant instruction from anyone, capable of copying historical pictures in a masterly style\". But once again Lawrence senior failed as a landlord; in 1779, he was declared bankrupt and the family moved to Bath. From this point on, Lawrence supported his parents with his portrait work.\nThe family settled at 2 Alfred Street in Bath, and the young Lawrence established himself as a portraitist in pastels. His oval portraits, for which he was soon charging three guineas, were about 12\u00a0inches by 10\u00a0inches (30 by 25 centimetres), and usually portrayed a half-length. His sitters included the Duchess of Devonshire, Sarah Siddons, Sir Henry Harpur (of Calke Abbey, Derbyshire, who offered to send Lawrence to Italy, but Lawrence senior refused to part with his son), Warren Hastings, and Sir Elijah Impey. Talented, charming and attractive (and surprisingly modest) Lawrence was popular with Bath residents and visitors. Artists William Hoare and Mary Hartley gave him encouragement. Wealthy people allowed him to study their collections of paintings, and Lawrence's drawing of a copy of Raphael's \"Transfiguration\" was awarded a silver-gilt palette and a prize of 5 guineas by the Society of Arts in London.\n\"Always in love and always in debt\".\nSometime before his eighteenth birthday in 1787 Lawrence arrived in London, taking lodgings in Leicester Square, near to Joshua Reynolds' studio. He was introduced to Reynolds, who advised him to study nature rather than the Old Masters. Lawrence set up a studio at 41 Jermyn Street and installed his parents in a house in Greek Street. He exhibited several works in the 1787 Royal Academy exhibition at Somerset House, and enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy but did not stay long, abandoning the drawing of classical statues to concentrate on his portraiture. \nAt the Royal Academy exhibition of 1788 he was represented by five portraits in pastels and one in oils, a medium he quickly mastered. Between 1787 and his death in 1830 he missed only two of the annual exhibitions: in 1809, protesting how his paintings had been displayed; and in 1819, because he was abroad. In 1789 he exhibited 13 portraits, mostly in oil, including one of William Linley and one of Lady Cremorne, his first attempt at a full-length portrait. They received favourable comments in the press, with one critic referring to him as \"the Sir Joshua of futurity not far off\". Aged just 20, Lawrence received his first royal commission, a summons arriving from Windsor Palace to paint the portraits of Queen Charlotte and Princess Amelia. \nThe queen found Lawrence presumptuous (although he made a good impression on the princesses and ladies-in-waiting) and she did not like the finished portrait, which remained in Lawrence's studio until his death. When it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1790, however, it received critical acclaim. Also shown that year was another of Lawrence's most famous portraits, that of actress Elizabeth Farren, soon to be the Countess of Derby, \"completely Elizabeth Farren: arch, spirited, elegant and engaging\", according to one newspaper.\nIn 1791 Lawrence was elected an associate of the Royal Academy and the following year, on the death of Sir Joshua Reynolds, King George III appointed him \"painter-in-ordinary to his majesty\". His reputation was established, and he moved to a studio in Old Bond Street. In 1794 he became a full member of the Royal Academy.\nAlthough commissions were pouring in, Lawrence was in financial difficulties. His debts stayed with him for the rest of life. He narrowly avoided bankruptcy, had to be bailed out by wealthy sitters and friends, and died insolvent. Biographers have never been able to discover the source of his debts; he was a prodigiously hard worker (once referring in a letter to his portrait painting as \"mill-horse business\") and did not appear to have lived extravagantly. Lawrence himself said: \"I have never been extravagant nor profligate in the use of money. Neither gaming, horses, curricles, expensive entertainments, nor secret sources of ruin from vulgar licentiousness have swept it from me\". \nAnother source of unhappiness in Lawrence's life was his romantic entanglement with two of Sarah Siddons' daughters. He fell in love first with Sally, then transferred his affections to her sister Maria, then broke up with Maria and turned to Sally again. Both sisters had fragile health; Maria died in 1798, on her deathbed extracting a promise from her sister never to marry Lawrence. Sally kept her promise and refused to see Lawrence again; she died in 1803. Lawrence continued on friendly terms with their mother and painted several portraits of her. He never married. In later years, two women provided him with companionship \u2014 friends Elizabeth Croft, and Isabella Wolff, who met Lawrence when she sat for her portrait in 1803. Isabella was married to Danish consul Jens Wolff, but she separated from him in 1810. Sir Michael Levey suggests that people may have wondered if Lawrence was the father of her son Herman.\nLawrence's departures from portraiture were very rare. In the early 1790s he completed two history pictures: \"Homer Reciting his Poems\", a small picture of the poet in a pastoral setting; and \"Satan summoning his legions\", a giant canvas illustrating lines from John Milton's Paradise Lost. Boxer John Jackson posed for the naked body of Satan; the face is that of Sarah Siddons' brother, John Philip Kemble.\nLawrence's parents died within a few months of each other in 1797. He gave up his house in Piccadilly, where he had moved from Old Bond Street, to set up his studio in the family home in Greek Street. By now, to keep up with the demand for replicas of his portraits, he was using studio assistants, most notable of whom were William Etty and George Henry Harlow.\nThe early years of the 19th century saw Lawrence's portrait practice continue to flourish. Amongst his sitters were major political figures such as Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, whose wife Lady Caroline Lamb he also painted. The king commissioned portraits of his daughter-in-law Caroline, the estranged wife of the Prince of Wales; and his granddaughter Charlotte. Lawrence stayed at Montague House, the princess's residence in Blackheath, while he was painting the portraits and thus became implicated in the \"delicate investigation\" into Caroline's morals. He swore an affidavit that although he had on occasion been alone with her, the door had never been locked or bolted and he had \"not the least objection for all the world to have heard or seen what took place\". Expertly defended by Spencer Perceval, he was exonerated.\n\"Pictorial chronicler of the Regency\".\nBy the time the Prince of Wales was made regent in 1811, Lawrence was acknowledged as the country's foremost portrait painter. Through one of his sitters, Lord Charles Stewart who he painted in Hussar uniform, he met the Prince Regent who became his most important patron. As well as portraits of himself, the prince commissioned portraits of allied leaders the Duke of Wellington, Field-Marshal von Bl\u00fccher and Count Platov, who sat for Lawrence at his new house at 65 Russell Square. (The house was demolished in the early 20th century to make way for the Imperial Hotel.) \"The private sitting-room of Sir Thomas Lawrence\" shows Lawrence at 65 Russell Square, surrounded by casts of classical sculpture. The prince also had plans for Lawrence to travel abroad and paint foreign royalty and leaders, and as a preliminary he was given a knighthood on 22 April 1815. Napoleon's return from Elba put these plans on hold, although Lawrence did make a visit to Paris, where his friend Lord Charles Stewart was ambassador, and saw the art that Napoleon had looted from Italy, including Raphael's \"Transfiguration\", the painting he had reproduced for his silver-gilt palette as a boy.\nIn 1817 the prince commissioned Lawrence to paint a portrait of his daughter Princess Charlotte, who was pregnant with her first child. Charlotte died in childbirth; Lawrence completed the portrait and presented it to her husband Prince Leopold at Claremont on his birthday, as agreed. The princess's obstetrician, Sir Richard Croft, who later shot himself, was the half-brother of Lawrence's friend Elizabeth Croft, and for her Lawrence drew a sketch of Croft in his coffin.\nEventually, in September 1818, Lawrence was able to make his postponed trip to the continent to paint the allied leaders, first at Aachen and then at the conference of Vienna, for what would become the Waterloo Chamber series, housed in Windsor Castle. His sitters included Tsar Alexander, Emperor Francis I of Austria, the King of Prussia, Field-Marshal Prince Schwarzenberg, Archduke Charles of Austria and Henriette his wife, Lady Selina Caroline, wife of the Count of Clam-Martinic and a young Napoleon II, as well as various French and Prussian ministers. In May 1819, still under orders from the Prince Regent, he left Vienna for Rome to paint Pope Pius VII and Cardinal Consalvi.\nPresident of the Royal Academy.\nLawrence arrived back in London 30 March 1820 to find that the president of the Royal Academy, Benjamin West, had died. That very evening Lawrence was voted the new president, a position he would hold until his death 10 years later. George III had died in January; Lawrence was granted a place in the procession for the coronation of George IV. On 28 February 1822 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society \"for his eminence in art\". \nThe royal commissions continued during the 1820s, including one for a portrait of the king's sister Sophia, and one of Sir Walter Scott (along with Jane Austen, one of Lawrence's favourite authors), as well as one to paint the newly-crowned Charles X of France for the Waterloo series, for which Lawrence made a trip to Paris, taking Herman Wolff with him. Lawrence acquired another important patron in Robert Peel, who commissioned the painter to do portraits of his family as well a portrait of George Canning. Two of Lawrence's most famous portraits of children were painted during the 1820s: that of Emily and Laura Calmady, daughters of Charles Calmady, and that of Master Charles William Lambton, painted for his father Lord Durham for 600 guineas and known as \"The Red Boy\". The latter portrait attracted much praise when it was exhibited in Paris in 1827. One of the artist's last commissions was of future prime-minister the Earl of Aberdeen. Fanny Kemble, a niece of Sarah Siddons, was one of his last sitters (for a drawing).\nLawrence died suddenly on 7 January 1830, just months after his friend Isabella Wolff. A few days previously he had experienced chest pains but had continued working and was eagerly anticipating a stay with his sister at Rugby, when he collapsed and died during a visit from his friends Elizabeth Croft and Archibald Keightley. After a post-mortem examination, doctors concluded that the artist's death had been caused by ossification of the aorta and vessels of the heart. Lawrence's first biographer, D. E. Williams suggested that this in itself was not enough to cause death and it was his doctors' over-zealous bleeding and leeching that killed him. Lawrence was buried on 21 January in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral. Amongst the mourners was J. M. W. Turner who painted a sketch of the funeral from memory.\nLawrence was famed for the length of time he took to finish some of his paintings (Isabella Wolff waited twelve years for her portrait to be completed) and, at his death, his studio contained a large number of unfinished works. Some were completed by his assistants and other artists, some were sold as they were. In his will Lawrence left instructions to offer, at a price much below their worth, his collection of Old Master drawings to first George IV, then the trustees of the British Museum, then Robert Peel and the Earl of Dudley. None of them accepted the offer and the collection was split up and auctioned; many of the drawings later found their way into the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum. After Lawrence's creditors had been paid, there was no money left, although a memorial exhibition at the British Institution raised \u00a33,000 which was given to his nieces.\nLegacy.\nLawrence's friends asked Scottish poet Thomas Campbell to write the artist's biography, but he passed on the task to D.E. Williams, whose two rather inaccurate volumes were published in 1831. It was nearly 70 years later, in 1900, before another biography of Lawrence appeared by Lord Ronald Gower. In 1913, Sir Walter Armstrong, who was not a great admirer of Lawrence, published a monograph. The 1950s saw the publication of two further works: Douglas Goldring's \"Regency portrait painter\", and Kenneth Garlick's catalogue of Lawrence's paintings (a further edition was published in 1989). Sir Michael Levey, curator of the National Portrait Gallery's 1979\u201380 Lawrence exhibition, produced books on the artist in 1979 and 2005. Lawrence's entanglements with the Siddons family has been the subject of three books (by Oswald Knapp, Andr\u00e9 Maurois, and Naomi Royde-Smith) and a recent radio play.\nLawrence's reputation as an artist fell during the Victorian era. Critic and artist Roger Fry did something to restore it in the 1930s, when he described Lawrence as having a \"consummate mastery over the means of artistic expression\" with an \"unerring hand and eye\". At one time Lawrence was more popular in the United States and France than in Britain; and some of his best known portraits, including those of Elizabeth Farren, Sarah Barrett Moulton (known to her family as Pinkie) and Charles Lambton (the \"Red Boy\") found their way to the United States during the early-20th-century enthusiasm there for English portraits. Sir Michael Levey acknowledges that Lawrence is still dismissed by some art historians: \"He was a highly original artist, quite unexpected on the English scene: self-taught, self-absorbed in perfecting his own personal style, and in effect self-destructing, since he left behind no significant followers or creative influence. Leaving aside Sargent, his sole successor has been not in painting, but in fashionable, virtuoso photography.\"\nThe most extensive collections of Lawrence's work can be found in the Royal Collection, and the National Portrait Gallery in London. The Tate Britain, the National Gallery and the Dulwich Picture Gallery house smaller collections of his work in London. There are a few examples of his work in the Holburne Museum of Art and the Victoria Art Gallery in Bath, and in Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. In the United States, The Huntington Library houses \"Pinkie\", and Lawrence's portraits of Elizabeth Farren, Lady Harriet Maria Conyngham, and the Calmady children are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In Europe, the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre has a few examples of Lawrence's work, and the Vatican Pinacoteca has a swagger portrait of George IV (presented by the king himself) as almost its only British work.\nIn 2010 the National Portrait Gallery held a retrospective exhibition of Lawrence's work. The director of the National Portrait Gallery, Sandy Nairne, was quoted in \"The Guardian\" describing Lawrence as \"\u2026a huge figure. But a huge figure who we believe deserves a great deal more attention. He is one of the great painters of the last 250 years and one of the great stars of portraiture on a European stage.\" In December 2018, a portrait of Lady Selina Meade (1797\u20131872), who married the Count of Clam-Martinic, painted by Lawrence in Vienna in 1819, sold for \u00a32.29 million at auction, a record for the artist.\nIn literature.\nIn the 1848 novel \"Vanity Fair\", William Makepeace Thackeray refers to \"...the Lawrence portraits, tawdry and beautiful, and, thirty years ago, deemed as precious as works of real genius...\".\nA description of Mr Tite Barnacle of the Circumlocution Office as someone who \"seemed to have been sitting for his portrait to Sir Thomas Lawrence all the days of his life\" is one of 25 references to art in Charles Dickens' 1857 novel \"Little Dorrit\".\nIn the play \"An Ideal Husband\" by Oscar Wilde, Lord Caversham is introduced with a stage direction that describes him as \"[r]ather like a portrait by Lawrence\".\nIn the 1943 film \"The Man in Grey\", Lawrence appears in one scene and is played by the actor Stuart Lindsell.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "73522", "revid": "49574236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73522", "title": "Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)", "text": "Sculpture by Michelangelo\nThe Piet\u00e0 (\"Madonna della Piet\u00e0\", ; '[Our Lady of] Pity'; 1498\u20131499) is a Carrara marble sculpture of Jesus and Mary at Mount Golgotha representing the \"Sixth Sorrow\" of the Virgin Mary by Michelangelo Buonarroti, in Saint Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, for which it was made. It is a key work of Italian Renaissance sculpture and often taken as the start of the High Renaissance.\nThe sculpture captures the moment when Jesus, taken down from the cross, is given to his mother Mary. Mary looks younger than Jesus; art historians believe Michelangelo was inspired by a passage in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy: \"O virgin mother, daughter of your Son [...] your merit so ennobled human nature that its divine Creator did not hesitate to become its creature\" (\"Paradiso\", Canto XXXIII). Michelangelo's aesthetic interpretation of the \"Piet\u00e0\" is unprecedented in Italian sculpture because it balances early forms of naturalism with the Renaissance ideals of classical beauty.\nThe statue was originally commissioned by a French cardinal, Jean Bilh\u00e8res de Lagraulas, then French ambassador in Rome. The sculpture was made, probably as an altarpiece, for the cardinal's funeral chapel in Old St Peter's. When this was demolished it was preserved, and later took its current location, the first chapel on the north side after the entrance of the new basilica, in the 18th century. It is the only piece Michelangelo ever signed.\nThe statue had to be restored after the figure of Mary was vandalized on Pentecost Sunday of 1972; after the incident, the statue was protected by a bulletproof glass screen that was replaced and modernized in November 2024 in preparation for the 2025 Jubilee.\nHistory.\nThe statue was originally commissioned by the former Bishop of Condom, Cardinal Jean de Villiers du Lagraulas. The sculpture was intended to be an altarpiece for his funeral chapel within Old Saint Peter's Basilica. The chapel of Saint Petronilla was later demolished and the sculpture was later moved to its current location, the first chapel on the north side after the entrance of the new basilica, in the 18th century. It is the only piece Michelangelo ever signed.\nThe structure is pyramidal, and the vertex coincides with Mary's head. The statue widens progressively down the drapery of Mary's dress, to the base, the rock of Golgotha. The figures are quite out of proportion, owing to the difficulty of depicting a fully-grown man cradled full-length in a woman's lap. Much of Mary's body is concealed by her monumental drapery, and the relationship of the figures appears quite natural. Michelangelo's interpretation of the \"Piet\u00e0\" was far different from those previously created by other artists, as he sculpted a young and beautiful Mary rather than a naturally older woman (aged 45+) that should be commensurate with the natural age of her son, Jesus (aged 33).\nThe marks of the Crucifixion are limited to very small nail marks and an indication of the wound in Jesus' side. Accordingly, Christ's face does not reveal signs of the Passion. According to another interpretation, when Michelangelo set out to create his \"Piet\u00e0\", he wanted to create a work he described as \"the heart's image\".\nTwo drilled holes are located at the top head of the Virgin Mary, which once supported the bar holding two levitating angels, while another hole is located at the tophead of the Christ image.\nAge of Mary.\nMary is represented as being very young for the mother of an approximately 33-year-old son, which is not uncommon in depictions of the Passion of Christ at the time. Various explanations have been suggested for this. One is that her youth symbolizes her incorruptible purity, as Michelangelo himself said to his biographer, the compatriot and Roman sculptor Ascanio Condivi:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Do you not know that chaste women stay fresh much more than those who are not chaste? How much more in the case of the Virgin, who had never experienced the least lascivious desire that might change her body?\"\nAnother theory suggests that Michelangelo's treatment of the subject was influenced by his passion for Dante's \"Divine Comedy\": so well-acquainted was he with the work that when he went to Bologna, he paid for hospitality by reciting verses from it. In \"Paradiso\" (Canto XXXIII of the poem), Saint Bernard of Clairvaux in a prayer for the Virgin Mary, says: (\"Virgin mother, daughter of your son\").\nCanonical coronation.\nUrban VIII granted the venerated Marian image a decree of canonical coronation via his Papal bull \"Domina Coronatum Est\" signed and notarized on 14 August 1637 and granted to its patronal donor, Lord Ascanio Sforza y Pallavicini and Canon priest of the Vatican chapter, Monsignor Ugo Ubaldini.\nThe levitating diadem was manufactured by the Italian artisan, Fantino Taglietti, who charged 564 Italian scudo coins at the time. The official rite of coronation was executed on 31 August 1637. The cherubic angels were added in 1713 by his descendant, later relocated to the Chapel of the Holy Choir within the basilica in 1749.\nAfter completion.\nFollowing completion, the \"Piet\u00e0\"'s first home was the Chapel of Saint Petronilla, a circular Roman mausoleum attached to the south transept of Saint Peter's, with several sub-chapels radiating from the central space. The Cardinal chose one of these as his funerary chapel. While there is now no certainty, it is estimated that each of these niches measured about 4.5 metres wide by 2 metres deep. The chapel was later demolished by Donato Bramante during his rebuilding of the basilica.\nAccording to Giorgio Vasari, shortly after the installation of his \"Piet\u00e0\", Michelangelo overheard someone remark (or asked visitors about the sculptor) that it was the work of another sculptor, Cristoforo Solari, whereupon Michelangelo signed the sculpture. Michelangelo carved the words on the sash running across Mary's chest.\n&lt;br&gt; (English: \"Michelangelo Buonarroti, the Florentine made this\")\nThe signature echoes one used by the ancient Greek artists Apelles and Polykleitos. It was the only work he ever signed. Vasari also reports the anecdote that Michelangelo later regretted his outburst of pride and swore never to sign another work of his hands.\nFifty years later, Vasari declared the following regarding the Piet\u00e0:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Never think, a rare sculptor or craftsman, to be able to add design or grace, nor with difficulty never being able to finesse, cleanliness and to pierce the marble as much with art, as Michelangelo did there, because you can see in it all the value and power of art.\"\nOther Michelangelo Piet\u00e0s.\nSeveral decades later, Michelangelo returned twice to the subject of the Piet\u00e0, but neither work was completed. The Florentine Piet\u00e0 of c. 1547 \u2013 1553 was apparently intended for his own tomb, but abandoned after several years work. It is often called a \"Deposition\", representing a moment slightly earlier in the story. The Rondanini Piet\u00e0 was begun in 1552, and still very unfinished at his death in 1564; he had been working on it six days before.\nRestoration.\nSubsequent to its carving the \"Piet\u00e0\" sustained much damage. Four fingers on Mary's left hand, broken during a move, were professionally restored in 1736 by the Roman sculptor Giuseppe Lirioni (1690\u20131746). Modern scholars today are divided as to whether the restorer took artistic liberties to make the hand gestures more \"rhetorical\".\n1964 World Fair.\nIn 1964, the \"Piet\u00e0\" was lent by the Vatican to the 1964\u20131965 New York World's Fair to be installed in the Vatican pavilion. The former Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Francis Spellman formally requested the statue from Pope John XXIII, appointed Edward M. Kinney, Director of Purchasing and Shipping of Catholic Relief Services \u2013 USCC, to head up the Vatican Transport Teams. The statue was shipped in a wooden crate thick with an base, secured to the deck of the liner \"Cristoforo Colombo\"; in case of an accident, the crate contained cushioning so thick that it would float in water, and had an emergency locator beacon as well as a marker buoy attached.\nAt the fair, people stood in line for hours to catch a glimpse from a conveyor belt moving past the sculpture. It was returned to the Vatican afterwards.\nIt was returned to St. Peter's Basilica in November 1965. During its replacement, the weight of the marble statue broke a metal ventilation cover in the floor, tilting the crate. Despite fears that this jostling might have damaged the statue, the \"Piet\u00e0\" was returned to its place unharmed. \"The New York Times\" article reporting on the statue's return stated: \"By order of Pope Paul VI it will never travel again.\"\nVandalism.\nThe most substantial damage occurred on 21 May 1972 (Pentecost Sunday), when a mentally disturbed geologist, the Hungarian-born Australian Laszlo Toth, walked into the chapel and attacked the sculpture with a geologist's hammer while shouting, \"I am Jesus Christ; I have risen from the dead!\" With 15 blows he removed Mary's arm at the elbow, knocked off a chunk of her nose, and chipped one of her eyelids.\nAn American national, Bob Cassilly from St. Louis, Missouri was one of the first people to remove Toth from the \"Piet\u00e0\". He recalled the following events:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I leaped up and grabbed the guy by the beard. We both fell into the crowd of screaming Italians. It was something of a scene.\"\nOnlookers took many of the pieces of marble that flew off. Later, some pieces were returned, but many were not, including Mary's nose, which had to be reconstructed from a block cut out of her back.\nAfter the attack, the work was painstakingly restored and returned to its place within the basilica, just to the right of the entrance, between the holy door and the altar of Saint Sebastian, and is now protected by a bulletproof acrylic glass panel. During the restoration, an initial M was found carved on Mary's palm, making the \"Piet\u00e0\" the only work Michelangelo signed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73523", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73523", "title": "Astorga, Spain", "text": "Astorga (, \"Estorga\" in the Leonese dialect of Maragater\u00eda) is a municipality and city in Spain, located in the Province of Le\u00f3n, within the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n. Situated at the transition between the P\u00e1ramo Leon\u00e9s and the Montes de Le\u00f3n, it serves as a central hub for the regions of Maragater\u00eda, La Cepeda, and the Ribera del \u00d3rbigo. The city is the seat of one of Spain's oldest and most extensive dioceses, with jurisdiction over half of the province of Le\u00f3n and parts of the provinces of Ourense and Zamora. It is also the head of the judicial district number 5 of the province of Le\u00f3n.\nFounded as a Roman military camp for the Legio X Gemina in the late 1st century BC, it soon transitioned into a civilian settlement known as Asturica Augusta and became the capital of the Conventus Asturum. It developed as a key communication hub in northwestern Iberia and enjoyed prosperity during the first two centuries of the Common Era due to gold mining, earning the description \"vrbs magnifica\" from Pliny the Elder. By the mid-3rd century, it likely became an episcopal see, with Bas\u00edlides as its first bishop. Following the barbarian invasions, it was part of the Kingdom of the Suebi and was captured by Muslim forces under Tariq in 714, though it was reconquered by the Asturian monarchy later that century. In the late 10th century, it faced repeated Muslim assaults led by Almanzor.\nFrom the 11th century, bolstered by the Way of St. James, the city experienced gradual development, with the Church playing a prominent role. In 1465, Henry IV of Castile granted \u00c1lvaro P\u00e9rez Osorio, Count of Trast\u00e1mara, Lord of Villalobos, and Castroverde, the title of Marquis of Astorga, transitioning the city from a free status to a feudal condition. In the early 19th century, Astorga suffered the consequences of the French occupation and was among the first cities to rise against the French, with a revolt of peasants and laborers on May 2, 1808. French forces entered the city on December 31 of that year, and the city changed hands multiple times until the French surrendered on August 17, 1812.\nBetween the mid-19th century and early 20th century, significant industrial growth occurred, driven by the arrival of the railway and the rise of the chocolate industry. This industry, alongside other food sectors such as confectionery and meat processing, remains active, though the local economy primarily relies on the service sector, with administration, commerce, and cultural tourism as key pillars. The latter is supported by the city's rich historical-artistic heritage, including the cathedral, the Episcopal Palace, the town hall, and the Roman ergastula, all designated as Cultural Heritage Sites. Astorga is also a stop on the Way of St. James and a starting point for the V\u00eda de la Plata.\nThe most notable celebrations include the carnivals\u2014held the first weekend after Ash Wednesday\u2014the Holy Week, declared a Fiesta of National Tourist Interest, the Astures and Romans festival, recognized as a Festival of Regional Tourist Interest, and, intermittently, the Zuiza procession honoring the Clavijo banner and the procession of the Virgin of Castrotierra, brought from its sanctuary 17 kilometers away during drought years.\nIn 2015, during the UNESCO approval of the extension of the Camino de Santiago in Spain to \",\" Spain submitted a \"Retrospective Inventory - Associated Components,\" listing Astorga with associated elements under numbers 1708 to 1772.\nEtymology.\nThe name Astorga is a natural and popular evolution of the ancient toponym Asturica. Several theories exist regarding the origin and meaning of Asturica: according to some, such as chronicler Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila, it derives from Astyr or Astur, a squire of Memnon who arrived from the East, while others suggest it comes from Astiria, Astirica, or Asturia, a name used during the conquests of Munuza.\nPedro Junco, drawing on texts such as the \"Dictionary of Covarrubias\", wrote in 1635 that the name stemmed from Astu and Orgia, forming Astorgia, meaning \"city for celebrating the worship of the gods,\" specifically Bacchus, which Latinized became Asturica. He also claimed that before Asturica, it was called Rhoma, a Greek synonym for strength.\nThe city is referenced as Astorica in documents from 878, as Osturga and Austurga in the \"Codex Calixtinus\", and as Astur, Asturius, and Asturia throughout the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, V\u00edctor Gebhardt wrote in his \"General History of Spain\" that Astorga was previously called Asturica Amak. In Antonio de Nebrija's dictionary, from the 1734 edition, it is referred to as Asturia and Asturica: \"Asturia, a region and city near Portugal\" and \"Asturica Augusta, a city in Tarraconensis Spain, commonly called Rome.\"\nIn any case, Asturica was the ancient capital of the 22 Astures tribes, later receiving the honorific Augusta from Emperor Augustus, who elevated it to the capital of the Asturian Conventus.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe municipality of Astorga, covering an area of 46.78\u00a0km\u00b2, is located in the southwestern part of the central zone of the province of Le\u00f3n, at the transition between the P\u00e1ramo Leon\u00e9s plain and the Montes de Le\u00f3n. This position establishes Astorga as a strategic communication hub, a role evidenced since ancient times as a crossroads of the Camino de Santiago and the V\u00eda de la Plata, and a natural gateway to Galicia. Its territory is divided between the traditional regions of Tierra de Astorga and Maragater\u00eda and is represented on sheets MTN50 (scale 1:50,000) 192 and 193 of the National Topographic Map.\nTopography.\nAstorga lies in the northwestern part of the Duero Basin and generally features gentle terrain, though it is divided into two distinct zones: one area consists of a series of ridges oriented ESE-WNW, composed of materials from the Lower Paleozoic, and the other is the plain of the Tuerto River, with Tertiary materials later covered during the Quaternary. The western zone exhibits a valley morphology with the same ESE-WNW orientation as the Hercynian structures, characterized by flat-bottomed valleys filled with Miocene sediments, while the eastern zone is dominated by alluvial plains and various levels of terraces.\nThe municipality's average elevation ranges from above sea level in the floodplains surrounding the city to over 1,000 meters in the westernmost parts. This variation reflects a transition from flat landscapes to elevated terrain with gentle slopes, culminating in peaks such as El Sierro (969 m above sea level), La Cuesta (996 m above sea level), and notably Alto del Cuerno, a geodesic vertex at 1,114 m above sea level. The city itself is situated on a promontory at 870 m above sea level, with its historic core resembling a spur, becoming gentler toward its western end.\nHydrography.\nThe entire municipality falls within the Duero River Basin; as in much of the province, its waterways are characterized by irregular flow, with low levels in summer and surges in autumn and winter due to rainfall and snowmelt.\nThe Tuerto River floodplain, a tributary of the \u00d3rbigo River, is the most significant in the municipality and extends across its eastern part. However, the Jerga River, originating at Pe\u00f1a del Gato near the Foncebad\u00f3n Pass, has the longest course within the municipality. It flows through Castrillo de los Polvazares, Murias de Rechivaldo, Astorga, and Celada de la Vega before joining the Tuerto River a few kilometers from Astorga. Other minor waterways include streams such as La Moldera, Val Seco, and Fontanal, which feed into both rivers.\nClimate.\nThe climate in the municipality is classified as continental Mediterranean, with cold winters featuring frequent frosts and warm, dry summers. The annual temperature range is approximately 15\u00a0\u00b0C, while the daily range can exceed 20\u00a0\u00b0C. Precipitation is unevenly distributed throughout the year, scarce in summer and concentrated in late autumn, winter, and early spring. The city's elevation, its position above the surrounding area, and exposure to winds contribute to a generally cool climate for much of the year, particularly harsh in winter and spring.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Astorga falls under the Csb variant, a Mediterranean climate with mild summers, where the warmest month's average temperature does not exceed 22\u00a0\u00b0C but remains above 10\u00a0\u00b0C for five or more months. This climate is transitional between Mediterranean (Csa) and oceanic (Cfb). The city has a weather station located at El Sierro, managed by the State Meteorological Agency.\nNature.\nGeology.\nGeologically, Astorga is situated in the West Asturian-Leonese Zone, southwest of the Navia-Alto Sil Domain. The most prominent lithological materials in the municipality include Quaternary natural aggregates and Miocene clays\u2014traditionally used for both industrial and artisanal ceramics\u2014and Paleozoic quartzites, sandstones, and slates. Over the Miocene alluvial deposits, secondary gold concentrations with low yields are found in both ancient and modern river terraces. Stratigraphically, the western part of the municipality features layers from the Los Cabos Series of the Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician, and the Luarca Slates from the Middle Ordovician. Paleozoic outcrops are flanked by Miocene layers, extensively covered by Quaternary sediments that fully overlay the river basins of the Jerga and Tuerto rivers.\nFlora.\nThe municipality of Astorga lies within the supramediterranean bioclimatic zone, with its climax vegetation comprising marcescent species and conifers. These include oak trees, which grow in the cooler, wetter western areas on Quaternary deposits and predominantly siliceous soils, and reforested pine forests, mainly around Alto del Cuerno, featuring species such as Scots pine. Holm oaks are present, often scattered but forming a homogeneous, though degraded, stand between Castrillo de los Polvazares and Murias de Rechivaldo, with stunted trees due to historical use for charcoal and firewood, a practice common across the province. Lower strata include species such as genistas, lavenders, and hare's-foot clover. In areas lacking tree cover, primarily on sunny slopes with poor soil and water scarcity, shrubs such as rosemary, \"adenocarpus hispanicus\", and rockrose dominate. In the Tuerto River floodplain, aside from poplar plantations, aspens, willows, and alders are found. The rest of the municipal territory consists of wastelands and agricultural fields.\nFauna.\nThe municipality is home to a rich and varied fauna due to its transitional position between Mediterranean and Eurosiberian ecosystems. Regarding fish, Astorga's waters support only two species: the common barbel and the northern straight-mouth nase, accompanied by mammals such as the otter. Among amphibians and reptiles, species include the common toad, marbled newt, ocellated lizard, Seoane's viper, and Montpellier snake. In the municipality's flat areas, birds such as the kestrel and sparrowhawk, and small mammals such as rabbits and Iberian hares, are found. Near population centers, white storks, swallows, common swifts, wood pigeons, various tits, rooks, and raptors such as the red kite are common. In pastures or wooded areas, species such as the red partridge, roe deer, weasel, fox, wild boar, and occasionally wolves are present.\nHistory.\nAncient era.\nThe history of Astorga theoretically dates back to the pre-Roman period, as the Greco-Egyptian geographer Ptolemy referred to Asturica as a city of the Astures and capital of the Amachians. This has led researchers such as Manuel G\u00f3mez-Moreno Mart\u00ednez and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luengo Mart\u00ednez to suggest an indigenous origin. However, archaeological excavations in the urban area have not yielded materials to confirm such origins. Thus, a pre-Roman settlement cannot be scientifically affirmed, despite the presence of several Iron Age \"castra\" in the surrounding area, such as La Mesa in Castrillo de los Polvazares.\nBased on archaeological evidence, the city's foundation is linked to a detachment of the Legio X Gemina during the Cantabrian Wars. This is evidenced by the discovery of two defensive trenches and several foundation ditches for possible wooden structures. After the campaigns of Augustus against the Astures and Cantabri, between c.\u200929 BC and c.\u200919 BC, the camp was established, and following pacification, it transitioned into a civilian settlement within the Tarraconensis province. This shift likely occurred in the early 1st century, as evidenced by the hospitality pact with the Zoelae in 27 AD, indicating stabilized Roman-indigenous relations.\nAround the transition between the reigns of Claudius and Vespasian, the city became the capital of the \"Conventus Iuridicus Asturum\" and a major recipient of gold from mines such as Las M\u00e9dulas. This prosperity led Pliny the Elder, then procurator of Hispania Citerior, to describe the city in his \"Naturalis Historia\" as \"vrbs magnifica\". With the territorial reorganization in the 3rd century, the city became part of the Gallaecia province, with Bracara Augusta (Braga) as its capital. The decline of mining under Diocletian marked the beginning of the city's decline.\nBy the mid-3rd century, Astorga likely became an episcopal see, with Bas\u00edlides as its first bishop around 249. The spread of Christianity faced challenges from barbarian invasions and the rise of Priscillianist and Manichean doctrines, which were later opposed by Hydatius and Saint Turibius.\nMiddle Ages.\nFollowing the barbarian invasions, the Suebi established themselves in the former Gallaecia around 410, and Astorga became part of their kingdom. Conflicts with the Visigoths led to sacks by Theodoric II in 456 and Leovigild in 569. This resulted in the loss of its status as the capital of the \"conventus\", with the Roman political and administrative system collapsing, and prominence shifting to Le\u00f3n. In 714, during the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Astorga was attacked and destroyed by Tariq en route north. After the emergence of the Kingdom of Asturias in the mid-8th century, King Alfonso I of Asturias reconquered Astorga among other cities for the Christians. Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias, who ascended the throne in 850, tasked Count Gat\u00f3n with the city's repopulation and reconstruction.\nYears later, the five sons of Alfonso III of Asturias rebelled against him, leading to the division of the crown upon his abdication. Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n, who received Le\u00f3n, established his court in Astorga for four years until his death in 914. After this, Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n moved the capital to Le\u00f3n, marking the birth of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. In 988, Le\u00f3n was sacked by Almanzor, prompting, according to V\u00edctor Gebhardt, a temporary relocation of the court to Astorga. Astorga itself suffered sieges and plunder by Almanzor's forces in 988, 994, and 996.\nIn 1034, Sancho III of Pamplona captured Astorga and the rest of Le\u00f3n amid disputes with Bermudo III of Le\u00f3n. In 1073, the tenure system was established as a form of governance. In the early 12th century, it was occupied by Theresa, Countess of Portugal, who took advantage of the disputes between her sister Urraca I of Le\u00f3n and Alfonso I of Aragon. In 1143, it became the domain of her son, Afonso I of Portugal.\nDuring the reign of Ferdinand III of Castile, territorial administration shifted from \"tenencias\" to lordships. For Astorga, this occurred around 1277, but in 1345, Alfonso XI of Castile decided the city would be governed by a magistrate and several councilmen.\nFrom 1367 to the end of the century, Astorga faced a crisis due to the plague, conflicts between Peter I of Castile and Henry II of Castile, and economic hardship. During this period, Astorgan merchants maintained trade with various Galician towns, possibly laying the foundation for future muleteering.\nOn July 16, 1465, through a privilege granted in Toro, Henry IV of Castile awarded \u00c1lvar P\u00e9rez Osorio, Count of Trast\u00e1mara, Lord of Villalobos, and Castroverde, the title of Marquis of Astorga, shifting the city to a feudal status. The marquisate exerted significant influence over the city's governance, impacting areas controlled by the cathedral chapter.\nEarly modern period.\nThe 16th century was marked, in its early years, by the Comuneros War (1520\u20131521); Astorga sided with the royalists, as the marquis supported Charles I. This period saw the establishment of numerous confraternities that aided the poor and pilgrims through hospitals, a practice reinforced by the Camino de Santiago's passage through the city. This tradition of hospitality is preserved in institutions such as the San Juan Bautista and the Cinco Llagas hospitals. The Church's influence was pervasive, not only through moral authority but also because the cathedral chapter owned extensive rural and urban properties.\nThe arrival of the printing press in 1545, introduced by Agust\u00edn de Paz, boosted written production, initially focused on missals and ecclesiastical works such as Francisco de Evia's \"Thesaurus Angelorum\". This marked the start of a printing tradition with figures such as Antonio de la Calzada, peaking in the late 19th century and early 20th century, when Astorga had more printing presses than the provincial capital, including those of Antonio Gull\u00f3n, Juan Alonso, Porfirio L\u00f3pez, Nicesio Fidalgo, Gonz\u00e1lez Revillo, and Ortiz.\nDuring the 18th century, the city achieved some prosperity, with daily life featuring jousting with canes, bullfights in the Plaza Mayor, bowling\u2014regulated in 1601\u2014theatrical performances, and sacramental functions. Between the 18th century and 19th century, Astorga's territory was affected by the division of the province into cantons and jurisdictions, later modified during the Peninsular War.\nModern era.\nIn the early 19th century, the city's growth stalled due to epidemics and the French occupation. Astorga was among the first cities to revolt against the French, with a peasant and laborer uprising on May 2, 1808. In June, the Junta of Armament and Defense was formed. French forces entered on December 31, 1808, and the city changed hands multiple times, with heroic defenses led by General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Santocildes, until the French surrendered on August 17, 1812, following a strategy by Generals Casta\u00f1os and Wellesley. General Santocildes documented these events in his \"Historical Summary of the Attacks, Siege, and Surrender of Astorga\".\nAfter Ferdinand VII of Spain's restoration, he abolished the 1812 Constitution, reverting to absolutism, a move welcomed by Astorga's ecclesiastical, noble, and bourgeois sectors. The influence of the bishopric and cathedral chapter persisted through the 19th century and 20th century. During Joseph Bonaparte's brief rule, a new territorial organization was proposed, with Astorga heading the Esla Department. This plan failed, and in 1820, during the Trienio Liberal, a new division made Astorga one of the province's eleven districts, but this was annulled in 1823. In 1833, with the new territorial reorganization, Astorga and Maragater\u00eda were incorporated into the Province of Le\u00f3n.\nDuring Isabel II of Spain's reign and after the 1845 Constitution, Astorga was represented by the progressive Santiago Alonso Cordero. In subsequent decades, other representatives included P\u00edo Gull\u00f3n Iglesias, part of the political alternative to Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo, and Manuel Garc\u00eda Prieto, who served as prime minister several times, the last in 1922, before Miguel Primo de Rivera's coup.\nWith the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War on July 18, 1936, after miners' columns passed through toward Asturias, the Civil Guard and military took control of Astorga on July 20, keeping it\u2014along with most of the province\u2014in rebel territory. The Transition and democracy's arrival spurred further development, diversifying the economy through tourism, increased road transport, and revitalization as a regional hub.\nReligion.\nReligion has consistently shaped Astorga's historical development. No evidence of indigenous deities is recorded in Astorgan territory, likely due to its Roman military origin, but the presence of the god Caraedudi is noted in Cuevas\u2014near Celada de la Vega\u2014 and a plaque dedicated to Marti Tileno was found in Quintana del Marco.\nPaganism.\nWith the establishment of the Roman camp, both Roman and Greek gods were adopted in religious practice, with evidence of the following cults in the city:\nRepresentations of Asclepius and his son Telesphorus, linked to medicine and healing, have also been found.\nDue to its status as a \"conventus\" capital and home to senior imperial officials, dedications to Eastern gods appeared in the late 2nd century and early 3rd century, introduced by the Severan dynasty and high-ranking Eastern officials such as Ioul or Silvanos Melanion, sometimes inscribed in Greek.\nChristianity and the Episcopal See.\nUntil Christianity's arrival, religion in Astorga was polytheistic. With Christianity, monotheism emerged, along with churches dedicated to revered saints such as Saint Martin, Saint Acisclus, Saint Christopher, and Saint Martha.\nRecords confirm that Decencius, Bishop of Le\u00f3n, attended the Council of Elvira between 295 and 314, where 37 Iberian bishops gathered, indicating that Le\u00f3n and Astorga jointly formed one of the earliest Christian sees in Hispania. After the Edict of Milan in 313, Le\u00f3n's military character made it heavily influenced by Mithraism, popular among soldiers, and the episcopal see was relocated solely to Astorga. By then, Astorga had lost political influence due to Diocletian's provincial reorganization, which stripped it of its \"conventus\" capital status; the transfer of the diocese helped maintain its prominence, now in the religious sphere.\nDocuments provide evidence of Astorga's bishops from 380, when Simposius attended the first Council of Zaragoza. Astorgan bishops participated in the various Councils of Toledo, starting with Dictinius. Discussions included the maintenance and worship of rural churches, many of which survived as medieval hermitages and sanctuaries, such as the Virgin of Castrotierra hermitage, located at an ancient Iron Age site.\nBesides conciliar records, Hydatius's \"Chronicle\" documents Astorgan bishops throughout the 5th century. During Saint Turibius's episcopate (440\u2013480), invasions by Suebi, Vandals, and Alans, as well as Visigothic attacks led to the destruction of Astorgan churches. During Turibius's tenure, the Manichean heresy emerged, addressed at the Astorgan Council of 456, followed by Arianism around 585, until Reccared's conversion to Christianity in 589 at the Third Council of Toledo, under Bishop Talasius. Astorgan bishops attended all subsequent Councils of Toledo, up to the XVI Council in 693.\nIn the Middle Ages, the diocese was restructured. During the repopulation period, Christian life was revitalized, and several churches and monasteries emerged within the city, including those of Saint Christopher, Saint Julian and Saint Basilisa, Saint Acisclus, Saint Salvador, Saint Thomas, Saint Martin, Saint Isidore, and Saint Peter. Outside the city, the San Dictino monastery was founded. In the 11th century, the Santa Mar\u00eda Cathedral, several churches, and the San Juan Bautista hospital were built, along with additional churches, the Santa Clara monastery, and the Santo Tom\u00e1s Cantuariense hospital outside the city.\nBelow is a list of Astorga's bishops who attended various councils in Hispania, as documented by the councils' records:\nSubsequent records of the diocese and its bishops relate to the city's repopulation and the restoration of the bishopric during the Reconquista. The Diocese of Astorga has been under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Oviedo since 1954.\nDemographics.\nThe municipality has a population of 10,308 inhabitants (INE 2024). Unlike cities such as Le\u00f3n and Ponferrada, Astorga has not significantly attracted residents from surrounding regions and grew slowly during the 20th century, reaching its peak in 1981, though the 1940 figure was inflated by the presence of soldiers and prisoners from the Civil War.\nSince the 1980s, the city has experienced a slight but steady population decline due to aging demographics, fewer births, and emigration to more dynamic centers. In 2011, Astorga ranked 25th among Spain's 100 municipalities with the highest median age, at 46.63 years compared to the national average of 44.1.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2022, the registered foreign population totaled 484, with the most numerous nationalities being Moroccan (174), Bulgarian (51), Portuguese (34), Venezuelan (33), Romanian (25), Colombian (19), Chinese (17), Argentine (12), and Pakistani (12).\nThe populated areas within the municipality of Astorga are as follows:\nUrban planning.\nThe ancient city.\nThe urban planning of Astorga has historically been shaped by the terrain's topography, with the settlement established in ancient times atop a natural ridge. After the Cantabrian Wars ended and the military camp transitioned into an urban center, the city experienced a period of growth driven by the development of mining activities, which peaked between the 1st century and 3rd century. This led to Astorga becoming the seat of the \"concillium\" (a meeting of delegates from indigenous tribes), the imperial cult, and the \"Conventus Asturicensis\". The city spanned 26 hectares, enclosed by a city wall over two kilometers long. The enclosure's shape was not rectangular due to a narrowing of the ridge at its southern corner, resulting in a triangular layout where the forum was located. Public buildings were erected, streets\u2014some with porticos\u2014were paved, and a sewer network was constructed, alongside sophisticated domestic architecture. By the 3rd century, Astorga's role as an episcopal see further defined the city's life in subsequent centuries.\nWith the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Astorga, like many other urban centers, experienced a period of decline that lasted until the Early Middle Ages, when recovery began. By then, the urban core\u2014still enclosed within its walls\u2014consisted of houses with straw and tile roofs built over the original Roman layout.\nThe medieval city.\nIn the 9th century, the repopulation policies of Ordo\u00f1o I led to a population increase over several decades, resulting in the emergence of new neighborhoods and the clearing of nearby lands. During the 12th century and 13th century, new churches began replacing the earlier high-medieval monasteries, which were gradually disappearing. Two key factors shaped the city during the medieval period: the contributions of the Jewish population, which built a synagogue, a cistern, and a cemetery, and the development of the Camino de Santiago, which spurred the construction of hospitals. The urban landscape featured contiguous buildings along narrow streets, plots, orchards, and religious enclosures; by the 12th century, houses typically included a courtyard, wine press, cellar, granary, dovecote, and garden.\nThe construction of religious buildings continued in subsequent centuries; by the 15th century, there were up to eight churches, several of which later disappeared, such as those of San Dictino and San Feliz. A similar fate befell some monasteries, with older ones such as San Mart\u00edn and San Francisco vanishing. Meanwhile, various chapels funded by guilds were built, including San Esteban, San Adri\u00e1n, San Felipe Neri, and San Pedro, along with numerous hospitals due to the growth of the Camino de Santiago. Additionally, from 1471, the construction of the new cathedral began.\nThe modern city.\nIn the late 17th century, Manuel de la Lastra designed the layout of the Plaza Mayor and constructed the Town Hall, where the municipal council meetings, previously held in the atrium of the church of San Bartolom\u00e9 as was customary in Leonese open councils, were henceforth conducted. By the 18th century, the city was organized into four parishes\u2014San Bartolom\u00e9, San Miguel, San Juli\u00e1n, and Santa Marta\u2014with the suburbs of San Andr\u00e9s, Puerta de Rey, and Rectiv\u00eda located outside the walls. Connections to other parts of the peninsula were limited to cart roads in varying states of repair, and several authors, such as Antonio Ponz and Alexandre de Laborde, lamented between 1787 and 1807 the poor condition, irregularity, and lack of cleanliness of the city's streets.\nThe contemporary city.\nAfter the end of the War of Independence, which directly impacted Astorga, the city began its recovery through commercial and industrial activity, particularly with the development of the chocolate industry. In the final years of the century, the city, which had previously seen limited expansion, began to grow beyond the walled enclosure: on February 19, 1866, the railway arrived with the opening of the Le\u00f3n-Astorga section of the Le\u00f3n-La Coru\u00f1a railway line, and on July 1, 1898, the Plasencia-Astorga railway line was inaugurated. This dual rail connection spurred growth in the San Andr\u00e9s and Puerta de Rey neighborhoods, while the link between the Madrid-La Coru\u00f1a highway and the Le\u00f3n road benefited the rest of the city. This development was accompanied by the inauguration of the water supply system in 1889\u2014replacing an earlier project from 1782\u20131787 called \"Viaje de Aguas\"\u2014which eliminated the need to fetch water from the Fuente Encalada spring, and the installation of electric lighting in 1897.\nIn the 20th century, specifically in 1924, the Santocildes military barracks were inaugurated. During the second quarter of the century, the urban core expanded northward and westward, though the Civil War slowed this growth. Examples of expansion in subsequent decades include the areas of Santa Clara, Manjar\u00edn, Candelas, Cuatro Caminos, and the Pandorado road. In 1996, two green spaces, previously scarce in the urban core, were created with the transformation of La Eragudina into a garden and El Melgar into a recreational area.\nSince 1985, a Comprehensive Plan for the Protection of Buildings declared \"Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural\", another for the preservation of facades, and a third for the recovery of unique elements have been in place. These initiatives have led to the rehabilitation of spaces such as the Aljibe, Plaza de la Culebra, and Plaza Romana, as well as the pedestrianization of the so-called Monumental Axis, between Puerta Sol and Plaza Eduardo de Castro.\nParks and gardens.\nThe city features several green spaces, with the Synagogue Garden standing out for its historical significance. In the last decades of the 20th century, the parks of La Eragudina, El Melgar, and El Mayuelo were added.\nThe Synagogue Garden, previously known as San Francisco, Alfonso XIII, and General\u00edsimo, is the city's oldest park, established in 1835. The area it occupies was part of the Jewish quarter, where the synagogue was located, hence its name. Three years after the project's inception, the leveling of the significantly sloped terrain was completed. By early 1840, the works were finished, and the garden, one of Spain's first romantic-style gardens according to Roberto Alonso, featured a rockery fountain, hedges, and walkways, later complemented by a rose garden. From this garden begins what was once the \"chemin de ronde\" of the city wall, which over time became the city's main promenade.\nThe Mayuelo Park, located halfway between the urban core and the Sierro hill, occupies a meadow area with several springs, some of which were used for drinking water or laundry. In the mid-1970s, a fountain was built over one of the springs, playground equipment was installed, and trees were planted. In 1993, the Town Council developed a project for the park, which spans over 7,000 square meters. The project included a central tree-lined walkway, children's play areas, and recreational spaces. The fountain was also remodeled by the Workshop School.\nThe La Eragudina field, a former recreational area of the marquises of Astorga near the Jerga River, was transformed into a garden in 1996, featuring newly planted tree species such as willows, ashes, maples, and poplars, along with a fountain and recreational areas. In the same year, the area at the foot of the city wall, known as El Melgar, was also converted into a park, with the surroundings of the Roman Gate, behind the apse of the cathedral, being landscaped.\nOther recreational areas in the city include the Aljibe Park, near the cathedral and named after a medieval water cistern, and the surroundings of Fuente Encalada. This fountain, built in 1674 and remodeled in 1788 in a neoclassical style, now features a landscaped setting.\nEconomy.\nThe city's economic structure is characterized by weak industrial activity, with a strong reliance on the tertiary sector, public administration, and, to a lesser extent, construction. Agriculture remains significant in the municipality's rural areas.\nBusiness activity and employment.\nAs of March 2013, the municipality had 596 establishments employing 2,280 workers. In 2007, of the total employed population in the municipality, 1.3% worked in the primary sector, 14.6% in industry, 14.6% in construction, and the majority, 69.5%, were employed in the service sector, highlighting its importance to the municipal economy. Unemployment in the 21st century rose from 176 people in May 2005 to 778 in March 2020, with 341 men and 437 women.\nPrimary sector.\nIn 2011, the municipality had an agricultural area of 1,045.8 hectares, of which 1,021.5 hectares were arable land, divided between dry farming and irrigated crops located east of the municipality along the Tuerto River. Another 15 hectares were used for vegetable gardens, and 8.3 hectares for fruit trees. The wine sector was a cornerstone of the city's economy, particularly between the 13th century and 15th century, but by the 17th century, wine had to be imported from Rueda or Toro due to the gradual disappearance of vineyard land, leaving only one hectare. The remaining land is distributed among pastures (2,339.6 hectares), forest species (557.9 hectares), and other non-agricultural spaces (706.2 hectares). Overall, the primary sector employed 1.3% of workers and accounted for 0.5% of businesses, reflecting the tertiarization of the municipal economy. Agricultural activity remains present in the various hamlets, while it is nearly nonexistent in the municipal seat.\nSecondary sector.\nIn 2007, industry was the second most significant economic activity, employing 29.2% of workers and accounting for 24.5% of businesses. Most industries are light and generate minimal pollution. The most prominent belong to the food industry, with companies such as Cecinas Pablo, Dulces La Mallorquina, and Alonso, focusing on traditional products such as puff pastries, \"mantecadas\", and \"cecina\"; Astorga is the seat of the denomination of origin for the latter two. Although now minor, the chocolate industry was significant from the mid-19th century to the first third of the 20th century; in 1916, there were 41 manufacturers, four of which remain active. Their legacy, including wrappers, posters, lithographs, and old machinery, is preserved in the Chocolate Museum. The textile industry was also present, though only one factory survives, along with remnants such as a washhouse.\nMost industrial activity is concentrated in the industrial estate, promoted by the Town Council and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Its development has occurred in four phases: the first (1991) with 65,000 m\u00b2, the second with nearly 50,000 m\u00b2, the third (2007) with 79,000 m\u00b2, and the fourth (2011), still under development. In 2011, the city had 2 energy and water companies, 5 chemical companies, 24 metallurgical companies, and 66 manufacturing companies, totaling 97 industrial businesses. The construction sector recorded 100 businesses.\nTertiary sector.\nIn 2007, the service sector was prominent, employing 69.5% of workers and comprising 75% of businesses. The city serves as an economic hub for surrounding regions such as Maragater\u00eda and La Cepeda, resulting in intense commercial activity; in 2012, there were 60 wholesale businesses, and in 2011, 316 retail businesses, including 114 in food retail (16 supermarkets), 188 in non-food retail, and 14 in mixed retail. In 2012, there were 14 deposit institutions, including five banks and six savings banks.\nCultural tourism plays a significant role in the service sector due to the city's historical and monumental heritage, its festivals, and its position on the Camino de Santiago and the V\u00eda de la Plata. Nearby, notable villages such as Castrillo de los Polvazares and Santiago Millas, and iconic Camino de Santiago sites such as Foncebad\u00f3n, stand out. In March 2013, the municipality had 47 tourism establishments, including three travel agencies, nine rural tourism accommodations (115 beds), 16 hotels (549 beds), and 47 restaurants. In 2011, there were 115 caf\u00e9s and bars. Since 2004, the city has had a parking area for motorhomes.\nSymbols and titles.\nThe municipal coat of arms is described as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gules, an oak branch in its natural color. At the crest, a marquess's coronet.\nThe date of its initial use is unknown. A 1320 document features a seal of the Astorga Council depicting a castle with three towers and a tree. By 1635, the current shield was in use, as seen in Pedro Junco's work \"Fundaci\u00f3n, nombres y armas de la ciudad de Astorga\". Junco interpreted that the city's ancient name\u2014Roma\u2014led to the term \"robur\", hence the depiction of an oak, with \"Quercus robur\" being one of the most common species, symbolizing strength, firmness, and fortitude, akin to the attributes of solidity and longevity in classical mythology. The red field mirrors that of Rome, symbolizing the blood of enemies attempting to conquer the city. The flag, rectangular, is described as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Red flag with the shield in the center.\nRegarding its titles, the city is known as \"Very Noble, Loyal, Meritorious, Magnificent, and Augustan.\" The first three were granted for its role during the War of Independence; centuries earlier, it had been called \"Augustan\" by Emperor Caesar Augustus and \"Magnificent\" by Pliny the Elder.\nAdministration and politics.\nPublic administration.\nThe Regional Government of Castile and Le\u00f3n holds responsibilities for education, managed by the Department of Education, which oversees teachers and educational centers, and healthcare, through Sacyl, which manages the municipality's healthcare services.\nLocal administration is handled by a democratically managed town council, whose members are elected every four years by universal suffrage. The electoral roll includes all residents registered in Astorga over 18 years old, who are nationals of Spain or other member states of the European Union. According to the General Electoral Law, which determines the number of eligible councilors based on the municipality's population, the municipal corporation consists of 17 councilors.\nAstorga is the head of the judicial district of the same name, the fifth in the province, with two courts of first instance. The city also has a notary office.\nMunicipal government.\nIn the first democratic elections of 1979, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) came to power under Luis Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez, followed in the next term by Recaredo Bautista of the Agrupaci\u00f3n Electoral Popular Independiente (AEPI). In the 1987 elections, Juan Jos\u00e9 Alonso Perandones (PSOE) fell just short of an absolute majority, but the four opposition groups united to give the mayoralty to the minority candidacy of Adolfo Alonso Ares. However, two years later, with the support of the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) representative Rosa Fern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez, a motion of censure enabled Perandones to become mayor on March 29, 1989, a position he held until 2011, when he announced his retirement from politics.\nIn the 2011 elections, with no coalition agreements reached among the political groups, the mayoralty went to the most-voted list, led by Victorina Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez, Perandones' successor in the PSOE. In 2015, Arsenio Garc\u00eda of the PP was elected mayor in a minority government. On July 5, 2019, following a judicial dispute in which the PP contested the validity of a vote initially deemed null, which the High Court of Justice of Castile and Le\u00f3n confirmed as invalid, the PSOE and IU municipal groups formed a coalition government, returning the mayoral staff to Perandones after an eight-year absence from frontline politics.\nThe municipal executive is organized into various departments, each led by a councilor from the governing body. The management departments of the Town Council during the 2019-2023 term are as follows:\nServices.\nCommunications.\nVehicle fleet.\nIn 2011, the municipality had a vehicle fleet of 465.3 cars per 1,000 inhabitants. According to data from the \"Economic Yearbook of Spain 2012\" published by La Caixa, there were 5,491 cars in total. The same data indicates a fleet of 1,250 trucks and vans, with other vehicles totaling 1,150, bringing the total number of motor vehicles to 7,926. The city has a Vehicle Inspection Station located in the industrial estate.\nPublic transportation.\nFor passenger transport, the company ALSA provides road services between the city and multiple national destinations, such as Le\u00f3n, Ponferrada, La Coru\u00f1a, Valladolid, Madrid, Gij\u00f3n, or Barcelona. Locally, several companies offer services between Astorga and surrounding regional localities.\nSince the railway arrived in 1866, the city has had a railway station, located in the Puerta del Rey neighborhood, northeast of the city. Managed by Adif, the station is part of the Palencia-La Coru\u00f1a line. Astorga's railway connections, operated by Renfe, include:\nUntil 1983, Astorga was also the starting point of the V\u00eda de la Plata railway, inaugurated on July 21, 1896, connecting Astorga to Plasencia. For several years, various organizations and companies have demanded its reopening to effectively connect the western peninsula and restore freight transport by rail.\nThe Le\u00f3n Airport, operational since 1999, is the only airport in the province and the closest to the municipality, located between Valverde de la Virgen and San Andr\u00e9s del Rabanedo, 44 kilometers from Astorga. Other nearby options for air transport are the Valladolid and Asturias airports, located 157 and 193 kilometers away, respectively.\nEducation.\nThe city's educational infrastructure includes three early childhood and primary education centers, one secondary education institute, and one special education center in the public sector, as well as three private centers offering education from early childhood to secondary school.\nThe secondary institute offers Compulsory Secondary Education, Baccalaureate, and vocational training programs such as Electricity and Electronics and Cooking and Catering at the basic level, Bakery, Pastry and Confectionery, Administrative Management, Telecommunications Installations, Electrical and Automatic Installations at the intermediate level, and Administration and Finance and Industrial Automation and Robotics at the advanced level.\nFor specialized education, Astorga has an Official Language School offering French, English, and German, a professional music conservatory, a municipal music school, and an adult education center.\nHealthcare.\nThe city's healthcare system is divided between public health services and private medicine. For the former, Astorga has a health center that serves as the hub for the basic health zones of Astorga I\u2014covering the municipalities of San Justo de la Vega and Villaobispo de Otero, in addition to Astorga itself\u2014and Astorga II, which includes Brazuelo, Val de San Lorenzo, Valderrey, Quintana del Castillo, Santa Colomba de Somoza, Magaz de Cepeda, Luyego, Lucillo, Villamejil, Villagat\u00f3n, and Santiago Millas. It also has a heliport for the 112 emergency service.\nThe Town Council manages the responsibilities outlined in Article 42 of the General Healthcare Law, which stipulates that municipalities, without prejudice to other public administrations, have the following minimum responsibilities in health-related matters:\nThe city also has a Spanish Red Cross post and seven pharmacies.\nPublic safety.\nAstorga has units of the Civil Guard, local police, and National Police ensuring public safety. As in the rest of Castile and Le\u00f3n, the 112 emergency service system is operational. Additionally, the Santocildes Barracks is home to the Command of the El Teleno Maneuver and Firing Range and the 63rd Field Rocket Artillery Regiment, under the Ministry of Defence.\nSocial services.\nThe city has several private care facilities, including the San Juan Bautista Residence, San Francisco de As\u00eds Residence, El Chapin Home Residence, and Virgen de los Desamparados Residence, and the Las Cinco Llagas social center, dedicated to physically disabled individuals and managed by Caritas Internationalis. Since 1986, the Pensioners' Home has served as a place for elderly people to socialize and engage in activities.\nSupply and cleaning.\nThe supply of petroleum-derived fuels (gasoline and diesel) is sourced from the storage facilities of Exolum in Vega de Infanzones, near Le\u00f3n, and distributed to vehicles through two service stations, one operated by Repsol YPF and another by Cepsa.\nWater is sourced from the Tuerto River\u2014stored in the Villameca Reservoir\u2014at the La Forti site, from where it is pumped to the treatment plant at El Sierro. Once treated, the water is stored in reservoirs for distribution to the city. Since 2008, Astorga has had a wastewater treatment plant receiving water from the sewer system.\nUrban waste management is handled by the municipal company Ecoast\u00farica, which performs tasks such as garbage collection, street cleaning, and managing the recycling center. The recycling center is located next to the municipal cemetery in the Puerta de Rey neighborhood. The municipality once had a landfill, but under the Castile and Le\u00f3n Urban Waste Plan, it was sealed, and the degraded area was restored. In the nearby town of San Rom\u00e1n de la Vega, there is a Waste Treatment Center (CTR) with a packaging sorting plant and a recycling and composting plant for municipal solid waste.\nFor perishable food supplies such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish, the city has several supermarkets and traditional small food shops. Additionally, every Tuesday, a weekly market is held, occupying several streets in the city center, offering clothing, footwear, jewelry, salted food, fruits, and vegetables.\nCulture.\nHistorical-artistic heritage.\nAstorga's architecture reflects the legacy of its inhabitants over centuries, boasting significant monumental wealth in both religious and civil buildings, spanning Roman, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Modernist styles. The municipality has seven \"Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural\" designations: the Historic Site of Astorga itself and that of Castrillo de los Polvazares, and, in the Monument category, the Surroundings of the Episcopal Palace, the Santa Mar\u00eda Cathedral\u2014designated a National Monument since 1931\u2014the Roman Ergastula, the Episcopal Palace, and the Town Hall.\nRoman Route.\nThe first excavations took place in 1835, but it was not until the 1940s, under Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luengo, that they gained prominence. Work continued from the late 20th century, leading to a route showcasing various preserved Roman remains beneath the city. The most notable findings relate to public spaces, including two bath complexes\u2014the Major and Minor Baths\u2014and the sewer system, still in use. In the forum, the Aedes Augusti, a temple dedicated to the imperial cult, and the Roman Ergastula, a cryptoporticus gallery housing the Roman Museum, are preserved. In the private sphere, the Domus of the Bear and Birds Mosaic, a residence following the traditional Roman domus layout, is one of the city's most characteristic Roman structures.\nAlso part of the Roman legacy is the city wall. The initial defense of the Roman settlement was the vallum of the camp where the Legio X Gemina was based, dating to before the turn of the era. It consisted of two V-shaped trenches accompanied by an embankment and a wooden palisade. Later, in the 1st century, a first walled enclosure with circular towers was built, and in the 3rd century, a new wall fully encircled the hill on which the old town sits. This wall, slightly over two kilometers long and nearly rectangular, featured 27 semicircular towers spaced approximately 16 meters apart and was reused in the medieval period. The War of Independence caused significant damage to the wall during the 19th century, and the northern and southern sections, along with many western towers, were almost entirely demolished. No traces of the ancient gates remain, though their names persist in street nomenclature: Puerta Obispo, Puerta del Rey, El Postigo, Puerta del Sol, and Puerta de San Miguel.\nCathedral.\nThe origin of the cathedral, dedicated to Saint Mary, dates to 1069, when a first temple was consecrated by Bishop Pedro N\u00fa\u00f1ez. It was rebuilt in 1087 under Bishop Osmundo and in the 13th century under Bishop Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez. This last reconstruction served as the basis for the definitive expansion, which began in 1471. The works continued until the 18th century, resulting in a blend of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque elements. The cathedral has a rectangular plan, a three-apse chancel, three naves, and a false crossing; two towers flank the main facade. The initial Gothic section was built in the late 15th century and early 16th century. During the latter, the works were directed by Francisco de Colonia, Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n, and Rodrigo Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n, who introduced Renaissance elements, particularly in the transept and southeast door. In the late 17th century, the main facade was begun: the ensemble, in Churrigueresque Baroque style, features three arched doorways flanked by two towers and is organized like a stone altarpiece with abundant decoration. The left tower, started in 1678, was affected by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and the War of Independence, not being completed until 1965; the right tower, begun in 1692, was finished in 1704. On the exterior, atop one of the turrets crowning the chancel, stands the statue of Pedro Mato, a legendary figure linked to the Battle of Clavijo.\nInside, in addition to the 16th century choir with its seating and 17th century grille, various chapels are distributed: seven along the sides of the three naves, three in the chancel, one in each arm of the false crossing, and two at the base of each tower. Notable among them are the Chapel of Our Lady of Majesty, housing the 12th century Virgin of Majesty altarpiece; the Main Chapel, with a Renaissance-style altarpiece by Gaspar Becerra; and the Chapel of the San Miguel altarpiece, an example of 16th century Hispano-Flemish art. The cathedral complex also includes the crypt, built in 1521 beneath the presbytery as a pantheon for the marquises of Astorga; the neoclassical cloister from 1755, with five arches per wing joined by Ionic pilasters; the sacristy from 1772, featuring a Rococo altar-reliquary; and the facilities of the Diocesan Museum and Diocesan Archive.\nEpiscopal Palace.\nAfter the 1886 fire that destroyed the previous episcopal palace, Bishop Joan Baptista Grau i Vallespin\u00f3s commissioned a new palace from the modernist architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, with whom he had a longstanding friendship. Construction began in 1889, but after the bishop's death in 1893, Gaud\u00ed resigned from the project due to disagreements with the Chapter, when the second floor and attic were still incomplete. Architects Francisco Blanch y Pons and Manuel Hern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez-Reyero took over without success, until Bishop Juli\u00e1n de Diego y Alcolea appointed Ricardo Garc\u00eda Guereta, who completed the building in 1913. During the Spanish Civil War, it served as a barracks and headquarters for the Falange. Repairs were made in 1943 and 1956 to convert it into the bishop's residence, a purpose never fulfilled. Under the pontificates of Marcelo Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00edn and Antonio Briva Miravent, it was promoted as the Museum of the Ways, inaugurated in 1963.\nThe palace, constructed from grey granite sourced from El Bierzo, adheres to the historicist principles of late 19th and early 20th-century architecture\u2014in this case, in the Neo-Gothic style\u2014and features a Latin cross plan with four facades and four towers at each corner. The initial aim was to combine the characteristics of a castle and a palace, as evidenced by elements such as a moat. The entrance is a portico with three flared arches, separated by slanted buttresses, topped with a pediment; Gaud\u00ed had planned to crown the facade with a five-meter-tall angel, but this idea was ultimately not realized. The rear section features an apse, corresponding to the chapel, surrounded by three smaller apsidioles. The ground floor houses a large vestibule, from which the grand staircase rises, its height allowing for triangular windows that provide ample light, a design previously used by Gaud\u00ed in the Palau G\u00fcell and repeated in other rooms of the episcopal palace, such as the office, throne room, dining room, and bedroom. The building's structure is supported by pillars with decorated capitals and ribbed vaults over glazed ceramic pointed arches. On the exterior, three angel figures, bearing episcopal attributes (mitre, pectoral cross, and crosier), designed by Gaud\u00ed as roof finials, remain but were never placed in their intended position.\nTown Hall.\nConstruction of the town hall began in 1683, based on a design by Francisco de La Lastra, and was completed in 1703. Later additions included balconies (1730, Francisco Garc\u00eda Casella), finials on the side towers (1739, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez de la Vi\u00f1a), and the central bell-gable (1748, Domingo Mart\u00ednez), which houses the clock and bells, the largest of which is accompanied by two figures dressed as \"maragatos\", named Juan Zancuda and Colasa, who mark the hours by striking it with a mallet. The facade consists of three stories, with a symmetrical axis formed by the semicircular arch at the entrance, the bell-gable, and the royal coat of arms. The sculptural ensemble includes elements functioning as gargoyles and the coats of arms of the city and the marquises of Astorga on the right and left towers, respectively. Inside, the plenary hall stands out, presided over by several commemorative plaques honoring notable figures such as Manuel Garc\u00eda Prieto, P\u00edo Gull\u00f3n Iglesias, Lope Mar\u00eda Blanco de Cela, Manuel Gull\u00f3n y Garc\u00eda Prieto, and Marcelo Mac\u00edas, as well as marking significant dates in the city's history. The building was renovated in 1987 by Andr\u00e9s Lozano.\nOther monuments.\nThe city is home to other culturally and architecturally significant buildings, primarily located in the historic center. Among them are the Sanctuary of Fatima, formerly known as the Church of San Juli\u00e1n, which retains four Romanesque capitals in its portal; the Church of San Bartolom\u00e9, also originating in the Romanesque style but later modified with Baroque interior decoration, where council meetings were held in its atrium until the town hall was built; the Church of Santa Marta, dedicated to the city's patron saint, constructed in 1741 on the site of an earlier church with a Neoclassical facade and Baroque interior; the Convent of Santa Clara, which faced hardship in 1810 during the Siege of Astorga, when General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Santocildes fortified its walls against French troops, but resumed housing its community in 1816, unaffected by the confiscations due to its educational activities; the church and convent of San Francisco, from the 13th century, over which the Redemptorist Fathers built a new structure, causing the original convent to be listed among the city's lost heritage; and the Convent of Sancti Spiritus, which dates from the 16th century and features Baroque decorations inside.\nAlso of religious significance are the Major Seminary, a 1756 structure with a three-story facade in the Herrerian style, featuring three enclosed cloisters and a Neoclassical chapel; the Church of Santa Colomba de Puerta de Rey, established since the 17th century\u2014though the current building results from multiple renovations\u2014near the site of the vanished Convent of San Dictino; the Chapel of Vera Cruz, from the 15th century but rebuilt in 1816; the Church of San Pedro de Rectiv\u00eda, located along the Camino de Santiago, with a modern design and a facade covered in mosaics installed in the 1990s; and the Church of San Andr\u00e9s, built in brick in the early 20th century by Hern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez-Reyero\u2014influenced by Gaud\u00ed\u2014following historicist architecture principles with Gothic aesthetics, housing a Baroque altarpiece from the vanished Church of San Miguel. Another building influenced by Modernism is Casa Granell, constructed between 1910 and 1915 by Antonio Palacios Ramilo\u2014known for works such as the Palace of Communications in Madrid\u2014commissioned by a chocolate entrepreneur.\nOther notable structures include the Hospital of the Five Wounds, one of the city's most important pilgrim hospitals, with origins in the 11th century, though only its 18th-century portal remains; and the Cell of the Walled-in Women, a small space between the Chapel of San Esteban and the Church of Santa Marta, used in the Middle Ages by women who enclosed themselves for life as penance, featuring a barred window for receiving charity, above which is the inscription \"remember my condition, for it will be yours. me yesterday, you today\".\nProperty registrations.\nBetween 1998 and 2015, the Catholic Church in Spain registered various properties, a process that sparked controversy according to some authors, including the Secretary of State for Relations with the Cortes and Constitutional Affairs, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Montilla Martos, who stated that \"Articles 206 of the Mortgage Law and 304 of the Mortgage Regulation, which allowed registrations in the name of the Catholic Church, are clearly unconstitutional as they violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Spanish Constitution.\"\nAmong the registered properties are several located within the municipal boundaries of Astorga, as listed in \"Listado Bienes Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica - Definitivo, Page 244 of 931 (Pg. 926)\" of the \"Study on the Property Registration of Catholic Church Real Estate\" published by the Ministry of the Presidency of the Government of Spain on 16 February 2021.\nThe summary of properties registered in the municipality of Astorga, according to this study, is as follows:\nLost heritage.\nAstorga, both within the city and its outskirts, once had numerous convents, hospitals, and pilgrim hostels due to its significance as a stopover on the way to Santiago de Compostela and as a crossroads. Most of these buildings have vanished, leaving no physical trace, with their existence known only through historical descriptions and documents. In 1872, the castle\u2014residence of the marquises of Astorga\u2014also disappeared, leaving only the name of a street: Calle del Castillo.\nHistorical documentation of this lost heritage comes from chronicles written by travelers and historians from the 16th to the 20th centuries, who recorded events and curiosities about the city. Reliable sources also include archives of confraternities, some convents (including those in other towns), and the archive of the Le\u00f3n Cathedral, which holds numerous informative records. However, information is limited by the loss or destruction of municipal and cathedral archives during the Spanish War of Independence, confiscations, and the Spanish Civil War, which also form part of the city's lost heritage.\nMuseums, archives, and libraries.\nThe visual arts are represented in the Cathedral Museum, the Museum of Roads, and the Holy Week Museum. The Cathedral Museum, planned since 1889 by Bishop Grau, was inaugurated in April 1954 with two rooms under Bishop Jes\u00fas M\u00e9rida P\u00e9rez. Among its early visitors was the future Pope John XXIII, and in 1989, Pope John Paul II visited while on the Camino de Santiago. A 1982 renovation tripled the exhibition space by incorporating the former Cathedral School and Chapter House. It now occupies ten exhibition rooms across two floors, covering 1,400 square meters, housing liturgical and religious works from the cathedral. The Museum of Roads is housed in the Episcopal Palace, reorganized as such in 1962 by Bishop M\u00e9rida P\u00e9rez, preserving the interior spatial layout. It displays artifacts from the diocese, related to the Camino de Santiago, which required proper storage due to abandonment or conservation needs. Across Gaud\u00ed's designed spaces\u2014such as the dining room, official office, throne room, bedroom, chapel, and grand vestibule\u2014are valuable artistic pieces, including Romanesque carvings and medieval goldsmithing. The basement showcases a collection of Roman and medieval archaeology and numismatics, while the upper floor, designed by Garc\u00eda Guereta, was adapted in 1975 to exhibit works by contemporary Leonese artists.\nWhile Holy Week imagery is stored independently in the city's parishes and the Episcopal Palace, the Confraternity of the Holy Vera Cruz and Confal\u00f3n organizes a summer exhibition of its heritage, featuring notable pieces such as the Recumbent Christ, from the early 17th century by Gregorio Espa\u00f1ol; the Golden Cross, bearing the \"Lignum Crucis\"; Jesus Tied to the Column and the Crucified, from the 16th century; and carvings from Levantine workshops. The Roman Museum, a historical museum, is located over the Roman structure known as the Ergastula. After the municipality fully acquired the building in 1996, it was renovated, adding two floors, and opened as a museum in 1999. It exhibits artifacts from city excavations, illustrating the lifestyle of ancient Asturica Augusta from its origins to the late Roman period, forming a significant collection both quantitatively and qualitatively.\nDedicated to its chocolate industry, the city is home to the Chocolate Museum, founded in 1994 by Jos\u00e9 Luis L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda and municipally owned since 2005. It displays objects from the city's 19th-century industrial phase, when the rise of muleteering spurred a nascent chocolate industry in the region. Its unique collection in Spain includes antique machinery, lithographic stones, engraving plates, and collections of chocolate trading cards. Since 2015, it has been housed in a new modernist mansion built by chocolatier Mag\u00edn Rubio and designed by architect Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Eznarriaga. Lastly, dedicated to the so-called \"Astorga School\", the Casa Panero was inaugurated in August 2011 as the home of the Panero family and a gathering place for Generation of '27 members such as Gerardo Diego and Luis Rosales, housing the works of the School's writers and the legacy of archaeologist Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luengo.\nAstorga also has a municipal library, established in 1931 and reorganized in 1944, located in the former Hospice, a 19th-century building renovated in 1983 for cultural use. Additionally, the city is home to the municipal historical archive, with its oldest document dating to 1253, including one of Spain's two oldest council minutes, dated 27 December 1427, and the Diocesan Archive, established in 1973, housing records from the diocese since 898.\nPerforming arts and bullfighting.\nAstorga is home to the Gull\u00f3n Theatre, inaugurated in 1923. After its closure, it fell into disuse until the 1990s when it was converted into a nightclub. In 2006, the municipality purchased the building, and its restoration began in 2011; after several years of work, it reopened in 2017. The city also has a cinema, originating as a theatre in 1911 and operating as a movie theatre since the 1930s.\nSeveral events related to performance and the arts take place in the city. During Carnival, a magic festival, held since 2004, brings together Spanish and international magicians. In August, during the Santa Marta patronal festivities, the \"Ars Via\" street theatre festival features performances by various companies across the city over several days. In September, since 1998, the Astorga Film Festival has been held, featuring a national short film competition alongside activities such as film cycles, exhibitions, and conferences. During Christmas, since 2002, a story adapted for street theatre is performed across the historic center's streets.\nBullfighting is not deeply rooted in Astorga, and the number of enthusiasts is relatively low, but it is common to schedule a bullfight during the Santa Marta festivities. The city has a bullring constructed in the early 20th century, partly using materials from the demolition of the Marquises' castle; prior to its construction, bullfighting events were held in the Plaza Mayor. The most prominent figure in this field from the city is the bullfighter Julio Norte, who made his debut in the \u00cdscar bullring in 1989.\nMusic.\nMusic is a prominent element in the cultural life of the city, which has been home to musicians such as Juan de Oliver, composer of \"Sonatas de Palacio\", Evaristo Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco, a pioneer of serialism and composer of \"Obertura Dram\u00e1tica\", Venancio Blanco, who compiled \"Las mil y una canciones populares de la regi\u00f3n leonesa\", Antonio Celada, and composers of sacred music such as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez, Manuel Ansola, and Gonz\u00e1lez Barr\u00f3n. Since the late 20th century, the organist Roberto Fresco has stood out.\nThe city is home to various musical groups, among which the municipal band, founded in 1894, stands out, though its origins date back at least to 1841. Other ensembles represent a wide variety of musical styles, including choral, instrumental, Celtic, and rock, as well as the various bands that perform during Holy Week.\nIn July, the International Music Course, held annually since 1993, takes place and is considered a benchmark for music education in Castile and Le\u00f3n, as it is the only one offering all orchestral and band specialties. Also in the summer, the Music in the Cathedral series is held, featuring various sacred music concerts. Another musical event is the band competition, which offers a varied repertoire of processional marches each year in the days leading up to Holy Week.\nFestivals and events.\nThroughout the year, several cultural and festive events take place in the city. Chronologically, in mid-January, the Puerta de Rey parish celebrates the feast of Saint Anthony with the traditional procession and blessing of pets. In February, the San Pedro de Rectiv\u00eda parish honors Our Lady of Candelaria with a procession through the neighborhood. In the same month, on a movable date, Carnival festivities begin on Pi\u00f1ata Saturday, the first Saturday after Ash Wednesday, with a parade featuring over a hundred groups, bands, and floats; the weekend concludes with the burning of the Pi\u00f1ata on Sunday night. In mid-April, the feast of the patron saint Turibius is celebrated, complemented since the early 21st century with a trade fair and a tapas competition among the city's restaurants. On a movable date, in years of drought, it is traditional to hold nine days of prayers in the cathedral to the Virgin of Castrotierra, brought from her sanctuary seventeen kilometers away in a procession involving residents of nearby regions along with the pennons of each locality, with the transfer decided by the vote of the Procurators of the Land.\nOn a movable date, the Corpus Christi procession is held. In June, every three years, the Zuiza festival is celebrated, an ancient commemoration of the Christian victory at the Battle of Clavijo, revived in 1994, during which the Clavijo Pennon\u2014kept in the Town Hall\u2014is processed, receiving honors as a captain general and escorted by fifty \"zuizones\". At the end of the same month, the San Andr\u00e9s and San Pedro de Rectiv\u00eda neighborhoods celebrate their festivals with traditional games and evening parties, among other events.\nAt the end of July, the Astures and Romans Festival is celebrated, originating in 1986 and declared a Festival of Regional Tourist Interest in 2011; it commemorates the city's ancient past with events such as the Roman circus, Roman market, and the establishment of a Roman camp and Astur settlement in Melgar Park. At the end of August, the city's patronal festivals in honor of Santa Marta take place, featuring evening parties, concerts, street theater, parades of giants and big heads, sports competitions, an artisan fair, and the traditional \"Long Night\", the highlight of the festivities with uninterrupted music until dawn.\nFinally, on movable dates\u2014the first edition was in 2004\u2014the Napoleonic Days are held, commemorating the events of the War of Independence, when the city endured two sieges by French troops. The 2012 edition marked the bicentennial of the city's reconquest by General Santocildes.\nHoly Week.\nHoly Week in Astorga is declared a Festival of National Tourist Interest and a Festival of Regional Tourist Interest, during which eight brotherhoods and confraternities, along with the Holy Week Promotion Board, process a total of forty floats. These eight include the Brotherhood of the Holy True Cross and Confal\u00f3n, one of the oldest in the country, with its earliest document dating to 1475, the Royal Brotherhood of Our Father Jesus Nazarene and Most Holy Mary of Solitude, from 1674, the Archconfraternity of Our Lady of Sorrows, from 1911, the Brotherhood of the Knights of Silence of Our Father Jesus Nazarene, from 1926, the Brotherhood of the Blessed Christ of the Afflicted, from 1943, the Brotherhood of the Entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, from 1953, the Brotherhood of the Last Supper, from 1969, and the Brotherhood of the Ladies of the Virgin of Piety, from 1992.\nAmong the most notable events are the Way of the Cross, organized by the Holy Week Promotion Board and involving all brotherhoods; some of the events on Good Friday, such as the Encounter procession\u2014with the traditional San Juan\u00edn race\u2014, the Descent from the Cross in the Plaza Mayor, or the Solitude procession; and the Resurrection procession on Easter Sunday. Among the religious imagery, standout pieces include the Crucified Christ, from 1560, the Blessed Christ of the Afflicted, from the late 17th century, the Virgin of Solitude, also from the late 17th century, the Virgin of Sorrows, a 1706 work by Jos\u00e9 de Rozas, the Jesus Nazarene, from 1783, and the Golden Cross, from 1789. Alongside the religious aspects, various customs accompany the celebration during Holy Week, such as \"killing Jews\" or eating \"bolla\"\u2014a pastry made of flour, honey, and milk\u2014paired with muscat wine.\nCultural life.\nSince the 19th century, Astorga has been a significant cultural center. Among its earliest notable authors are Bishop Sampiro, who between the 10th and 11th centuries wrote the \"Chronicle\" bearing his name, and Juan Lorenzo de Astorga, author, between the 13th and 14th centuries, of manuscript O of the \"Libro de Alexandre\".\nThe Church and its members played a prominent role in literary production; thus, figures emerged such as Alfonso de la Madre de Dios, with his 1618 work \"Chronica de la reforma de su religi\u00f3n\", Pedro Aingo de Ezpeleta, who published in 1634 \"Fundaci\u00f3n de la Santa, Cathedral Iglesia de la ciudad de Astorga\", and Pedro Junco, who in 1639 published \"Fundaci\u00f3n, armas y nombres de Astorga\". To these should be added the extensive documentary production generated by the diocese. In the 19th century, a range of authors gained prominence, including, among others, Marcelo Mac\u00edas and Francisco Blanco Garc\u00eda, author of \"Spanish Literature in the 19th Century\", both from the ecclesiastical sphere, jurists such as Alfonso de Villadiego, Mateo Mart\u00ednez Moreda, Manuel Garc\u00eda Prieto, and Manuel Prieto de Castro, and the bibliographer Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez Salazar.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the wealth generated by the chocolate industry fostered the emergence of a prosperous bourgeoisie, among whose descendants a true \"cultural Parnassus\" was born, with poets such as Juan Panero and Leopoldo Panero, literary critics such as Ricardo Gull\u00f3n, and writers such as Luis Alonso Luengo, all part of the so-called \"Astorga School\". In the following years, this cultural splendor was enriched by other poets such as Eugenio de Nora and Esteban Carro Celada, novelists such as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Goy, intellectuals such as Julio Carro, and scholars such as Augusto Quintana Prieto, Eduardo Arag\u00f3n, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luengo, as well as literary gatherings and debates held in various city venues such as the Caf\u00e9 Moderno, Caf\u00e9 Iris, and Gran Caf\u00e9 Universal. Additionally, several theatrical societies were established, affiliated with the Casino, the Catholic Circle, the Segura cultural center, La Uni\u00f3n, and the Friendship Society.\nSince the last decades of the 20th century, the city's cultural life has been driven not only by the various events held but, especially, by the more than fifty associations that exist, which organize numerous cultural activities and events throughout the year. These include social, cultural, sports, parents', and neighborhood associations.\nLanguage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Pastorcicus semus, d'Uriente venimus, bulsillus trayemus, di\u00f1eiro pidimus. Que Dios vus lo dea para nus lu dar. L'astrella nus guia a este santu hogar.\"&lt;br&gt;\"Shepherds' song for Epiphany.\"\nThe language spoken in the municipality is Spanish or Castilian, but until the 20th century, numerous forms derived from Leonese, belonging to the western variant of Asturleonese, persisted in everyday speech in Astorga and its surroundings, as well as in Maragater\u00eda. Phonetically, some of the main features included the diphthongization of /o/ and /e/, the preservation of falling diphthongs, the inflection of the tonic vowel, the substitution of final /o/ with /u/, and the retention of the initial Latin /f-/. In terms of morphology, notable features included a scarcity of prefixes and, conversely, an abundance of suffixes, especially diminutives, and regarding its verbal system, the absence of compound tenses and the placement of personal pronouns after the verb.\nIn recent years, various groups such as La Caleya and Faceira have undertaken efforts to defend and promote the Leonese linguistic heritage through activities such as organizing Leonese language courses, informative talks, and literary competitions. In collaboration with the Culture Department of the Junta of Castile and Le\u00f3n, the Provincial Council of Le\u00f3n\u2014through the Leonese Institute of Culture\u2014and the Astorga City Council, several traditional Leonese story competitions were held, involving schoolchildren up to 14 years old from the province of Le\u00f3n; the stories, written in the linguistic variants of Le\u00f3n\u2014Leonese, Galician, and Castilian\u2014were compiled in the book \"Cuentos populares leoneses (escritos por ni\u00f1os)\". Likewise, as a result of the collaboration between the cultural associations Facendera pola Llengua and La Caleya, in 2009, \"El Prencipicu\" was published, a version in the Cabreir\u00e9s dialect of the work by French writer Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, \"The Little Prince\". The book emerged from pedagogical work with seven Cabreira students at the Astorga IES student residence within the so-called Cabreira Culture Classroom.\nTraditional clothing.\nAn important part of \"Maragato\" folklore is its traditional clothing. The typical muleteer outfit, used during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, is notable among traditional attire for its continued daily use until a relatively late date; it is categorized as an occupational outfit, worn during travel, and is characterized by its functionality, with materials and shapes that protected against the elements and facilitated muleteer activities, evolving little over time, making it distinctly different from the clothing of other Leonese \"comarcas\", unlike women's clothing, which progressively lost variety and distinctiveness.\nThe men's outfit consisted of a shirt, vest, waistcoat, breeches or trousers, a belt\u2014embroidered for festive days and dancing, according to social status\u2014gaiters, shoes, a hat, and a cape. Some of these garments, such as the waistcoat or breeches, appear to date back to the 16th or 17th centuries, according to various authors; the latter are somewhat unique compared to those used in other Spanish \"comarcas\", being wide or baggy breeches, finding similarity only in the traditional attire of Mallorca.\nThe women's outfit is an evolution of the ancient attire, influenced by the clothing of neighboring areas and lacking the originality of the men's attire, but it retains great richness in terms of garments and accessories. It consists of a white skirt, a \"zagalejo\" (in cloth of various colors, depending on the wearer's social status), a \"faltriquera\"\u2014an inner pocket\u2014a \"manteo\", an apron\u2014embroidered in silk or felt, depending on social status\u2014a doublet, a neck scarf, a headscarf\u2014different for single and married women\u2014a mantle for religious ceremonies, ribbons and white lace, shoes, and jewelry\u2014earrings or chokers, pendants, and rings. An exception to this typology is the outfit of the May Queens, young dancers, which is more vibrant and colorful than the traditional \"Maragato\" attire, featuring red, green, and white prominently.\nCrossroads of paths.\nDue to its location and historical development, Astorga has been a meeting and departure point for paths, peoples, and cultures since ancient times. During the Roman period, it was connected to the main cities of the time through several communication routes. In the so-called \"Astorga Tablets\" from the 3rd century, various routes mentioning Asturica are cited. Also in the 3rd century, the \"Antonine Itinerary\" indicates the network of communications linking the city with Bracara Augusta (Braga) via route XVIII, or through Lucus Augusti (Lugo) on route XIX, to Augusta Emerita (M\u00e9rida), to Tarragona via Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza) on route XXXII or Ab Asturica Terracone, or with Bordeaux, via route XXXIV or Ab Asturica Burdigalam: practically to the four cardinal points of Hispania Tarraconensis, through which troops, travelers, and products, mainly gold from Las M\u00e9dulas, were transported.\nFrom the south, the so-called Silver Route connected M\u00e9rida with Astorga (\"Iter ab Emeritam Asturica\") and centuries later coincided in parts with the Ca\u00f1ada Real de la Vizana, along which transhumant herds traveled from Extremadura to the Leonese mountains. In modern times, it forms part of one of the main communication routes structuring western Spain, from Gij\u00f3n to Seville, via the N-630 and the Silver Route motorway/highway; various institutions promote this axis as a tourist route called the Silver Route, which has generated controversy, as historical evidence defines its route exclusively between M\u00e9rida and Astorga, and the Association of Silver Route Towns, chaired by the Astorga mayor's office, has carried out protest actions since 2006 against the artificial extension of the Route.\nTo the east, the road connecting Asturica with Legio, which then continued to Caesaraugusta, was used as the Camino de Santiago and became the basis for the current N-120. To the west, the road to Lucus Augusti and Gallaecia also became, centuries later, a section of the Camino de Santiago, which, leaving Astorga, passes through Foncebad\u00f3n, Ponferrada, and Villafranca del Bierzo, among other places. Around these main routes, other paths were woven, such as those used by muleteers or for razzias, utilized by Tariq, Musa, or Almanzor, as well as by French troops during the Spanish War of Independence. All these routes were always active, contributing to the exchange of people and cultures and the introduction of various artistic styles. Currently, Astorga preserves the history of some of these communication routes in the Museum of the Paths, established in 1962.\nOf the various pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela, the most widely used and well-known since the Middle Ages is the French Way, which originated from the Roman road Ab Asturica Burdigalam. Its route reaches Astorga from the town of San Justo de la Vega, entering the city through the former Sun Gate, which no longer exists. The pilgrim continues through San Francisco (formerly Calle de las Tiendas), Plaza Mayor, P\u00edo Gull\u00f3n (previously R\u00faa Nueva), Santiago Crespo, Santiago (formerly Caleya Yerma), and arrives in front of the Episcopal Palace, the Church of Santa Marta, and the cathedral. From there, the pilgrim proceeds through Leopoldo Panero, San Pedro, reaching the modern San Pedro Church in the Rectiv\u00eda suburb. Crossing the N-6, the path continues toward the Foncebad\u00f3n Pass.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the city had numerous hostels or hospitals for pilgrims. Some, such as the Hospital of San Juan Bautista, where according to tradition Saint Francis spent a few days recovering, gave rise to modern charitable institutions, but most disappeared over the centuries, leaving only their memory and some descriptions in preserved documentation. Until the late 1980s, pilgrims found shelter and lodging through the congregation of the Brothers of Our Lady of Lourdes, but since then, these services have been provided, on one hand, by the Association of Friends of the Camino de Santiago in Astorga, which, after operating in various locations, has managed the Siervas de Mar\u00eda hostel since 2006, with a total of 164 beds, and on the other hand, by the San Javier hostel, opened in 2003 and managed by the V\u00eda de la Plata Cultural Association, offering 110 beds, and the S\u00f3 Por Hoje hostel, opened in 2019, offering 10 beds. The Association of Friends received the El\u00edas Vali\u00f1a Award in 2007 from the Government of Galicia, recognizing its efforts in promoting the Jacobean routes.\nGastronomy.\nAstorga's gastronomy is tied to the region's agriculture and livestock. The most famous dish is the Maragato stew, characterized by being served in reverse order, starting with the meats\u2014which can include up to twelve types\u2014followed by chickpeas, potatoes, and vegetables, then the soup, and ending with dessert, typically custard. The reason for this reversed order is not definitively known, but the custom seems to originate with the muleteers, who preferred to eat cold meat first and then heat the soup upon arriving in a town.\nOther notable dishes include garlic soup, muleteer-style conger eel, sweetbreads in sauce, cabbage with cod, and \"cecina de Le\u00f3n\", a cured beef product that has held a Protected Geographical Indication since 1994, with its Regulatory Council based in Astorga. These culinary options, fundamental to the region's people, are preserved and promoted by the Gastronomic and Cultural Association \"El Borrallo\", whose cooking days culminate in the pig slaughter, yielding various products.\nIn terms of confectionery, sweets hold a prominent place in Astorga's cuisine. The most famous are the \"Mantecadas de Astorga\", which have a Protected Geographical Indication. The first written mention of them dates to 1805, and their commercialization began in 1850; their origin is uncertain, though it is believed the recipe came from a nun at the Sancti Spiritus convent who left the order to marry and popularized it. Another sweet, also widespread in the province, is the \"Hojaldres de Astorga\", puff pastries soaked in syrup, originating in the mid-20th century. Also notable are the \"merles\", a puff pastry filled with cream and topped with caramelized sugar, and chocolate, present in Astorga since the mid-19th century, when the city had 41 chocolate factories in 1916, of which only four remain.\nMedia.\nAstorga's journalistic tradition dates back to 1852, when the first periodical, the \"Bolet\u00edn Eclesi\u00e1stico del Obispado\", was published. By the end of the century, in 1885, the weekly \"Pedro Mato\" appeared, in 1892, the Catholic weekly \"La Luz de Astorga\", and in 1899, \"El Heraldo Astorgano\". In 1903, \"La Lid\" was published three times a week under the motto \"freedom, progress, morality, and work\", and \"El Faro Astorgano\", a Catholic newspaper, was founded. The following year, \"El Pensamiento Astorgano\" began publication, in 1906, \"El Evangelio en Astorga\", and in 1907, \"El Adalid\". Later, in 1917, the weekly \"El Fresco\" was born, and in 1928, the weekly \"Humo\" began under the guidance of Ricardo Gull\u00f3n, Leopoldo Panero, and Luis Alonso Luengo.\nOf these, \"El Faro Astorgano\" is the most prominent, with regional, provincial, and autonomous reach, available in both print and digital editions. It is joined by the \"Cuadernos Municipales\", dedicated to historical and artistic heritage, the magazine \"Catedral\", by the Friends of the Cathedral association, the magazine \"Argutorio\", by the Monte Irago cultural association, and publications by several Holy Week brotherhoods. Major national newspapers, as well as the provincial \"Diario de Le\u00f3n\" and \"La Nueva Cr\u00f3nica\", are also available.\nIn Astorga, listeners can tune in to national and regional radio stations, as well as local stations that broadcast programs dedicated to local news at different times of the day. Examples include COPE Astorga and Castilla y Le\u00f3n Radio.\nRegarding digital media, at the local and regional level, notable are the two websites of the City Council, offering significant institutional and tourist information, the digital version of \"El Faro Astorgano\", the digital newspaper \"Astorga Redacci\u00f3n\", founded in 2013, the digital newspaper \"Diario de Astorga\", founded in 2014, and the portal Astorga.com.\nSports.\nThe most important sports entity in the city is the Atl\u00e9tico Astorga Club de F\u00fatbol, which competes in the Spanish Third Division. Futsal has a strong tradition in the city, which until 2001 was home to the Astorga F\u00fatbol Sala team, which played in the First Division of the Spanish Futsal League from its founding in 1989 until 2001, when the club dissolved due to financial difficulties.\nOther sports or activities practiced in Astorga include cycling, with the Astorga Cycling Club, slot car racing, with the Slot Club Astorga, motor sports with the Moto-Quad Senderos Maragatos sports club or the Astorga Motorcycle Sports Club, hiking with the La Salle sports club, and kung fu, at the school run by the Jim\u00e9nez family, known for their displays of strength and endurance. Additionally, the City Council operates various municipal sports schools for athletics, basketball, futsal, Leonese wrestling, and swimming.\nAmong the main sports events organized in the city are, on one hand, the Cycling Tour Against Drugs, which annually gathers several hundred participants for a route around Astorga, and on the other hand, local tournaments in various disciplines such as football, billiards, or tennis during the patronal festivals of Santa Marta at the end of August.\nIn 1947, 1967, and 2011, Astorga was a stage start or finish for the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, and it has also been a passage point several times for the Vuelta a Castilla y Le\u00f3n and the Vuelta Ciclista a Le\u00f3n.\nFor sports practice, there are various facilities located mainly in the La Eragudina area: the football field \"La Eragudina\", where Atl\u00e9tico Astorga plays its matches, the Felipe Mi\u00f1ambres Municipal Sports Pavilion, municipal swimming pools, a gymnasium, several tennis courts, and two padel courts. Additionally, Astorga has a motocross circuit located in the El Sierro area.\nTwin towns.\nThe city of Astorga participates in the city twinning initiative promoted, among other institutions, by the European Union. Through this initiative, ties have been established with the following cities:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was located in the municipality of Westerbork, current-day Midden-Drenthe. Camp Westerbork was used as a staging location for sending Jews, Sinti and Roma to concentration camps elsewhere.\nPurpose of Camp Westerbork.\nThe camp location was established by the Government of the Netherlands in the summer of 1939 to serve as a refugee camp for Germans and Austrians (German and Austrian Jews in particular), who had fled to the Netherlands to escape Nazi persecution.\nHowever, after the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940, that original purpose no longer existed. By 1942, Camp Westerbork was repurposed as a staging ground for the deportation of Jews. Only in area, the camp was not built for the purpose of industrial murder as were Nazi extermination camps. Westerbork was considered by Nazi standards as \"humane\". Jewish, Sinti and Roma inmates with families were housed in 200 interconnected cottages that contained two rooms, a toilet, a hot plate for cooking, as well as a small yard. Single inmates were placed in oblong barracks which contained a bathroom for each sex.\nTransport trains arrived at Westerbork every Tuesday from July 1942 to September 1944; an estimated 97,776 Jews, Sinti and Roma were deported during the period. Jewish, Sinti and Roma inmates were deported in waves to Auschwitz concentration camp (65 train-loads totaling 60,330 people), Sobib\u00f3r (19 train-loads; 34,313 people), Theresienstadt ghetto and Bergen-Belsen concentration camp (9 train-loads; 4,894 people). Almost all of the 94,643 persons deported to Auschwitz and Sobib\u00f3r in German-occupied Poland were killed upon arrival.\nCamp Westerbork also had a school, orchestra, hairdresser and even restaurants designed by SS officials to give inmates a false sense of hope for survival and to aid in avoiding problems during transportation. Cultural activities provided by the Nazis for designated deportees included metalwork, jobs in health services and other cultural activities.\nA special, separate work cadre of 2,000 \"permanent\" Jewish, Sinti and Roma inmates were used as a camp labour force. Within this group was a subgroup constituting a camp police force which was required to assist with transports and keep order. The SS had little involvement with selecting transferees; this job fell to another class of inmates. Most of these 2,000 \"permanent\" inmates were eventually sent to concentration or death camps themselves.\nNotable prisoners.\nNotable prisoners in Westerbork included Anne Frank, who was transported to Camp Westerbork on 8 August 1944, as well as Etty Hillesum, each of whom wrote of their experiences in diaries discovered after the war. Frank remained at the camp in a small hut until 3 September, when she was deported to Auschwitz.\nHillesum was able to avoid the Nazi dragnet that identified Jews until April 1942. Even after being labeled a Jew, she began to report on antisemitic policies. She took a job with Judenrat for two weeks and then volunteered to accompany the first group of Jews sent to Westerbork. Hillesum stayed at Westerbork until 7 September 1943, when she was deported to Auschwitz, where she was killed three months later.\nCamp Westerbork also housed German film actress and cabaret singer Dora Gerson who was interned there with her family before being sent to Auschwitz and Professor Sir William Asscher who survived the camp when his mother secured his family's release by fabricating English ancestry. Jona Oberski wrote of his experience as a small child at Westerbork in his book, \"Kinderjaren\" (\"Childhood\"), published in the Netherlands in 1978 and later made into the film, \"Jonah Who Lived in the Whale\".\nMaurice Frankenhuis chronicled his family's experiences while interned in Westerbork and in 1948 conducted an interview with its Commander Albert Konrad Gemmeker while Gemmeker awaited trial. The published interview in Dutch and English became the basis for a docudrama created in September 2019. The film features colorization of original video of transports from Westerbork by photographer Rudolf Breslauer.\nAnother prisoner at Camp Westerbork from 9 March 1944 to 23 March 1944 was Hans Mossel (1905\u20131944), a Jewish-Dutch clarinetist and saxophonist, before he was sent to the Auschwitz III camp.\nOn 16 May 2024, a memorial was erected to remember the famous Sinti families (Tata Mirando) and Meinhardt, who lost some 200 members of their families to the Holocaust, transported from Westerbork camp to Auschwitz-Birkenau.\nLeadership within the Camp.\nJacques Schol, a Dutchman, was commander of the camp from 16 July 1940 and until January 1943. Certain accounts report he was known for his brutality against Jewish inmates, allegedly kicking inmates to death. Other accounts state on the contrary that \"although strict and organised, Schol was never cruel or violent\". Furthermore, \"Schol, who was anti-German, understood that a strict organisation of the camp was the best way to keep the Germans from taking over the camp\". In 1941, German authorities understood that \"Schol was too lenient and because of this attitude, the Jews felt too comfortable in the camp\".\nGerman authorities took control of Westerbork from the Government of the Netherlands on 1 July 1942 when Schol was replaced by a German commander. Deportations began under the orders of Gestapo sub-Department IV-B4, which was headed by Adolf Eichmann. Gestapo officer Albert Konrad Gemmeker had overall command of the camp and was responsible for sending up to 100,000 Jews to the death camps. After the war, Gemmeker was sentenced to just ten years in prison. His light sentence was apparently due to his defense claim that he had no idea what would happen to the Jews after they were transported out of Westerbork. Within the confines of the camp, German SS members were in charge of inmates, but squads of Jewish police and security under Kurt Schlesinger were used to keep order and aid in transport.\nLiberation.\nTransports came to a halt at Camp Westerbork in September 1944. Allied troops neared Westerbork in early April 1945 after German officials abandoned the camp. Westerbork was liberated by Canadian forces on 12 April 1945. A total of 876 inmates were found. The War Diary of the South Saskatchewan Regiment referenced the camp in its entry for 12 April 1945:\nAt 0930 hrs Lt-Col V Stott, DSO, accompanied by the I(ntelligence)O(fficer), Lt JD Cade, visited the Jewish Concentration Camp at (map reference) 2480. It was a rather startling sight as you approached the camp to see what is normally the appearance of a penitentiary. It was completely surrounded with barbed wire and had four lookout towers. Approximately 900 people were being held in this camp. The CO visited the officers kitchens and medical room and found the food and medical supplies to be in fairly good condition. While in the kitchen a number of A Co(mpan)y boys were observed helping the girls peel potatoes. It's surprising the influence girls, especially pretty ones, have with soldiers. It's a pity our cooks are unable to apply the same methods. Visiting a camp like this brings home to us the reality of what we are fighting for. It makes the average Canadian indignant and he asks \"Who do the Germans think they are that they enclose other humans behind barbed wire simply because they are born Jews!\"\nPost World War II.\nFollowing the war, Westerbork was first used as a remand prison for alleged and accused Nazi collaborators. It housed later Dutch nationals who fled the former Dutch East Indies (Indonesia).\nWesterbork was completely disassembled in the 1960s by the Government of the Netherlands. Later, the Dutch built the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, a large radio telescope, on the site. Only the former camp commander\u2019s house has been preserved, in a glass container.\nHistoriography.\nIn 1950, the government appointed Jewish historian Jacques Presser to investigate the events connected with the mass deportation of Dutch Jewry and the extent of the collaboration by the non-Jewish Dutch population. The results were published fifteen years later in \"The Catastrophe\" (\"De Ondergang\"). Presser also published a novel, \"The Night of the Girondins\", which was set in Westerbork.\nHolding place for Moluccan soldiers.\nIn 1949, when the Dutch left their over 300 year occupation of Indonesia, native Indonesians were left in political unrest. Some people who had worked with French, Algerian and Dutch militaries were evacuated, because they were the subject of anger by the other indigenous people who had resisted colonisation and felt betrayed at the Moluccan peoples siding with their colonisers. The peoples were promised a quick return to their homeland. However, from 1951 to 1971, former indigenous Moluccan KNIL soldiers and their families were made to stay in the camp. During this time, the camp was renamed \"Kamp Schattenberg\" (Camp Schattenberg).\nMemorials.\nA museum was created two miles from Westerbork to keep the memories of those imprisoned in the camp alive. As a tribute to those inmates who were killed after deportation, a memorial was commissioned; it consists of 102,000 stones, representing each person who was deported from Westerbork and never returned.\nThe National Westerbork Memorial was unveiled at the site by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands on 4 May 1970. Also, a monument of a broken railroad track torn from the ground is displayed near the camp to symbolize the destruction the camp, as well as others, wrought on the European Jewish population, and the determination that the tracks would never again carry people to their deaths.\nIn 2017, films commissioned by the German camp commander Albert Gemmeker from a Jewish prisoner, Rudolf Breslauer, to document everyday life in the Westerbork transit camp, were submitted by the Netherlands and included in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register."}
{"id": "73525", "revid": "45389969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73525", "title": "Totila", "text": "King of the Ostrogoths from 541 to 552\nTotila, original name Baduila (died 1 July 552), was the penultimate King of the Ostrogoths, reigning from 541 to 552. A skilled military and political leader, Totila reversed the tide of the Gothic War, recovering by 543 almost all the territories in Italy that the Eastern Roman Empire had captured from his Kingdom in 540.\nA grandnephew of Theudis, sword-bearer of Theodoric the Great and king of the Visigoths, Totila was elected king by Ostrogothic nobles in the autumn of 541 after the deaths of Kings\u2019 Ildibad &amp; Eraric. Both had been killed by the Gothic nobility for attempting to surrender to the Romans. Totila proved himself both as a military and political leader, winning the support of the lower classes by liberating slaves and distributing land to the peasants. After a successful defence at Verona, Totila pursued and defeated a numerically superior army at the Battle of Faventia in 542. Totila followed these victories by defeating the Romans outside Florence and capturing Naples. By 543, fighting on land and sea, he had reconquered the bulk of the lost territory. Rome held out, and Totila appealed unsuccessfully to the Senate in a letter reminding them of the loyalty of the Romans to his predecessor Theodoric the Great. In the spring of 544, the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I sent his general Belisarius to Italy to counterattack, but Totila captured Rome in 546 from Belisarius and depopulated the city after a yearlong siege. When Totila left to fight the Byzantines in Lucania, south of Naples, Belisarius retook Rome and rebuilt its fortifications.\nAfter Belisarius retreated to Constantinople in 549, Totila recaptured Rome, went on to complete the reconquest of Italy and Sicily. By the end of 550, Totila had recaptured all but Ravenna and four coastal towns. The following year Justinian sent his general Narses with a force of 35,000 Lombards, Gepids and Heruli to Italy in a march around the Adriatic Sea to approach Ravenna from the north. In the Battle of Taginae, a decisive engagement during the summer of 552, in the Apennines near present-day Fabriano, the Gothic army was defeated, and Totila was mortally wounded. Totila was succeeded by his relative Teia, who later died at the Battle of Mons Lactarius. Pockets of resistance, reinforced by Franks and Alemanni who had invaded Italy in 553, continued until 562, when the Byzantines were in control of the whole of the country following Justinian's conquests.\nEarly life.\n\"Totila\" was the \"nom de guerre\" of a man whose real name was Baduila, as can be seen from the coinage he issued. \"Totila\" is the name used by the Byzantine historian Procopius, who accompanied the Byzantine general Belisarius during the Gothic War, and whose chronicles are the main source of information for Totila. According to Henry Bradley, 'Totila' and 'Baduila' are diminutives of \"Totabadws\". Historian Marco Cristini has proposed that the consistent use of the name \"Totila\" by Procopius and other Eastern Roman authors, rather than the Gothic king's actual name \"Baduila\" (as attested on contemporary coinage), may have served a propagandistic purpose. Cristini argues that this naming choice was likely encouraged by Emperor Justinian as a means of delegitimising the Gothic leader. The name \"Totila,\" potentially perceived as diminutive or less dignified, could have been employed to reinforce the narrative of Baduila as a mere usurper or rebel, rather than a legitimate monarch. Given the numismatic evidence, Cristini contends that the true name was certainly known to Byzantine authors, suggesting that its omission was a deliberate rhetorical strategy. Born in Treviso, Totila was a grandnephew of Theudis, king of the Visigoths, and a sword-bearer; a role that made for a good career among his kin.\nTotila was elected king of the Ostrogoths in 541 after the assassination of his uncle Ildibad and having surreptitiously engineered the assassination of Ildibad's short-lived successor Eraric, in 541. Like Alaric I, Totila was quite young when he became king and was declared such by the Goths to recover dominion over the Italians. The official Byzantine position, adopted by Procopius and even by the Romanized Goth, Jordanes\u2014writing just before the conclusion of the Gothic Wars\u2014was that Totila was a usurper. According to historian Peter Heather, as Ildebadus's nephew, Totila nonetheless hailed from a prominent Gothic family, one that surrounded and \"even occasionally challenged Theodoric's Amal dynasty\".\nInitial victories.\nEraric's murder and replacement with Totila suggested to the Byzantines\u2014since Eraric favoured negotiation with Imperial power\u2014that this Gothic successor likely preferred war and so a Byzantine expeditionary force of twelve thousand men was sent north from Ravenna to Verona to stave off any possible impending attack.\nAt Verona, a local sympathizer allowed a contingent of Roman soldiers into the city and while the Goths panicked at first, they soon realized that the main army was stopped some distance from the city. They promptly shut the gates and the Roman soldiers who had made it into the city escaped by leaping from the walls. Meanwhile, the Roman forces retreated back to Faenza (Battle of Faventia), where Totila met them with 5,000 men to give battle, while another 300 Gothic archers surprised them from the rear, resulting in a rout, whereby the Goths acquired both prisoners and battle standards. Correspondingly, historian Thomas Burns claims that Totila was a gifted warrior and governor, and as an Ostrogoth ranks only second to Theodoric the Great himself.\nAfter securing victory in 542 at Faenza, Totila's Goths besieged the stoutly-defended Florence in an effort to open the Via Cassia to Rome but when Imperial forces arrived to relieve the city, Totila withdrew to the Mugello valley, where historian Herwig Wolfram states, they \"inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy\", at the Battle of Mucellium. Since this region was relatively spared of any previous conflicts, Totila's Goths were able to secure significant provisions and booty. In the meantime, instead of pursuing the conquest of central Italy, where the Imperial forces were too formidable for his small army, he decided to transfer his operations to the south of the peninsula. He captured Beneventum as well as Cumae, which remained a Gothic stronghold even after Gothic kingship no longer existed.\nDuring a period of crisis amid the Eastern Roman military leadership, which placed strains on its civilian population across its domains, historian Victor Davis Hanson asserts that Totila posed as a \"national liberator who would throw off the renewed chains of Roman oppression.\" Hanson further contends that this squabbling among Byzantine generals from \"different factions and ethnicities\" caused the forfeiture of what Belisarius had previously won in 540. In the aftermath of the Battle of Faenza, Totila not only achieved a tactical victory over the Roman forces but also succeeded in attracting Roman deserters to his own ranks. Historian Marco Cristini argues that undermining the cohesion of the Roman army was a deliberate and strategic component of Totila\u2019s military approach. Equally important, according to Cristini, was the reinforcement of his own forces through the integration of disaffected Roman soldiers. These individuals, often disgruntled due to unpaid wages, disputes with commanding officers, or personal ambitions, were exploited by Totila to gain intelligence and logistical advantages. Cristini further notes, citing Procopius (Wars 3.36.26), that in a similar episode in 548, following Totila\u2019s capture of the fortress of Roscianum, approximately 300 Roman soldiers defected to his side, choosing to oppose Belisarius.\nTotila's strategy was to move fast and take control of the countryside, leaving the Byzantine forces in control of well-defended cities, and especially the ports. When Belisarius eventually returned to Italy, Procopius relates that \"during a space of five years he did not succeed once in setting foot on any part of the land... except where some fortress was, but during this whole period he kept sailing about visiting one port after another.\" Totila circumvented those cities where a drawn-out siege would have been required, razing the walls of cities that capitulated to him, such as Beneventum. Totila's conquest of Italy was marked not only by celerity but also by mercy, and Gibbon says \"none were deceived, either friends or enemies, who depended on his faith or his clemency.\" However, Totila could be merciless, as Procopius recounts. For instance, after a successful siege of a resisting city like Perugia, Totila had its bishop, St. Herculanus of Perugia, beheaded by a soldier (though originally planned to be flayed). Procopius left a written portrayal of Totila before his troops were drawn up for battle:\nThe armour in which he was clad was abundantly plated with gold and the ample adornments which hung from his cheek plates as well as his helmet and spear were not only purple, but in other respects befitting a king \u2026 And he himself, sitting upon a very large horse, began to dance under arms skillfully between the two armies. And as he rode he hurled his javelin into the air and caught it again as it quivered above him, then passed it rapidly from hand to hand, shifting it with consummate skill.\nWhere Totila learned this \"dance\" is never made clear by Procopius, but these actions likely meant something to the Goths and despite his firm conviction of coexistence with the Romans and their culture, Burns relates, much like Theodoric, he \"remained a Goth.\" Despite his ethnic status as a Germanic warrior, Totila did not plunder the countryside for supplies like other barbarians had done; instead, he collected rent and taxes to provide the income he needed without ruining the cities and towns he captured. He also recruited slaves into the ranks of his army. While some sources, including Procopius, claim that Totila recruited slaves into his army, historian Marco Cristini suggests this may be an exaggeration intended to portray the Gothic forces as desperate or illegitimate. Although it is plausible that slaves were present within the Gothic military context, Cristini argues that their roles were likely limited to auxiliary functions such as cooking, maintaining equipment, laundering, and tending to the wounded, rather than participating directly in combat. He emphasises that Totila\u2019s core military force primarily consisted of trained cavalrymen, skilled in the use of spears and accustomed to warfare from a young age. While it is not impossible that a small number of slaves may have taken up arms, Cristini contends that their lack of military training and the logistical challenges of equipping and preparing them for battle make widespread slave participation in combat unlikely, contrary to Procopius\u2019s portrayal.\nTaking Naples.\nProcopius reported (\"Wars\", 7.9\u201312) that during the next two campaigning seasons, Totila was able to take several strategically important centres, including the fortress at Auximum, which allowed him to cut off land communications between Rome and Ravenna. Additional strongholds at Caesena, Urbinus, Mons Feretris, Petra Pertusa, Campania, Lucania, Apulia, Bruttium, and Calabria also fell to Totila's forces, placing the Goths in command of nearly all of southern Italy. Following these successes, Totila now led his army to Naples, laying siege to the city, which alarmed Justinian. The emperor responded by sending the civilian Maximin to meet the crisis. When Maximin attempted a ploy and sent ample food supplies via ships to give the appearance of a much larger army, it failed as Totila was fully informed of all the facts. The crews were slain and a second effort was made to resupply Conon in Naples. Despite the ships arriving safely, the vessels were blown ashore by a gale and these crews were slain and General Demetrius\u2014sent at Maximin's behest\u2014was taken captive by Totila. The Gothic king had Demetrius's hands cut off and his tongue removed before turning him loose. Nonetheless, Totila offered generous terms to Conon's starving garrison at Naples and they opened their gates in the spring of 543 to the Goths. Historian J.B. Bury writes: \nOn this occasion Totila exhibited a considerable humanity which was not to be expected, as the historian Procopius remarks, from an enemy or a barbarian. He knew that if an abundance of food were at once supplied, the famished inhabitants would gorge themselves to death. He posted sentinels at the gates and in the harbor and allowed no one to leave the city. Then he dealt out small rations, gradually increasing the quantity every day until the people had recovered their strength. The terms of the capitulation were more than faithfully observed. Conon and his followers were embarked in ships with which the Goths provided them, and when, deciding to sail for Rome, they were hindered by contrary winds, Totila furnished horses, provisions, and guides so that they could make the journey by land.\nThe fortifications at Naples were partly razed. Totila spent the following season establishing himself in the south and reducing pockets of resistance, besieging the Roman garrisons that remained at Hydruntum, all the while building pressure on Rome itself. Unpaid Imperial troops in central Italy made such poor reputations pillaging the countryside that when Totila turned his attention to taking Rome, he was able proudly to contrast Goth and Greek behaviour in his initial negotiations with the senate. Hearkening back to the rule of Theodoric and Amalasuintha as a reminder of more peaceful times between the two peoples, Totila tried to convince them to throw in their lot with the Goths. His olive branch was rejected, however, and all the Arian priests were expelled from Constantinople, on suspicion of possible collaboration as a Gothic fifth column.\nSiege of Rome.\nRealizing the gravity of the situation in 544, Justinian issued an edict known as the Pragmatic Sanction, designed to rebuild a working government at Ravenna, and that year he also sent Belisarius back to Italy to counter the growing Gothic threat. Unlike in the past, Belisarius was not graciously financed and so the general used some of his own funds to pay for his journey to Italy. By May 544, both Belisarius and General Vitalius\u2014and a contingent of a mere 4,000 troops\u2014had passed through Thrace and were encamped at Salonia along the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Totila was preparing to capture Rome.\nThroughout the occupation of Italy, Totila never really wavered from the aim to recover the kingdom and sovereignty for the Goths (Procopius, \"Wars\", 7.1.26), but not solely under those auspices, as historian Walter Goffart suggests; he avows it was also to become \"subcontractors in upholding the \"nomen Romanum\" in Italy.\"\nTowards the end of 545, the Gothic king took up his station at Tivoli and prepared to starve Rome into surrender, making at the same time elaborate preparations for checking the progress of Belisarius who was advancing to its relief, and whose fleet almost managed to relieve the city. In December 545, Totila besieged Rome and a year later entered and plundered the city, where he prayed at St. Peter's Basilica, suggesting continuity with Theodoric, but the act was near meaningless since the city was practically empty.\nOnce the siege of the city was complete, Totila planned to raze the city, but Belisarius sent a message and convinced him otherwise, claiming that judgments into posterity would follow Totila if he did, so the latter refrained. Instead, Totila abandoned the city and took some of the Senate members hostage with him; meanwhile the great metropolis sat abandoned for some forty days.\nBy April 546, Belisarius had retaken the city and Totila's initial effort to wrest it from the Roman general failed. However, as masters of Italy, the Goths controlled much of the peninsula and in 549, an Ostrogothic fleet \"ravaged the coast of Campoania\" and Rome too fell to Totila in January 550. More determined than ever to regain Italy, Justinian sent his nephew Germanus, whose marriage to a Gothic princess attracted German recruits, but he died on the eve of the expedition. Justinian replaced him with his son-in-law, John, and his son Justinian. John's forces to relieve a Roman garrison at Ancona were successful as were his warships at a battle along the anchorage of Sena Gallica, providing the Roman navy with control of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean. According to historian Archibald Ross Lewis, the Byzantine victory at Sena Gallica was completely decisive, with some 36 of 47 Gothic ships destroyed. Meanwhile, one of Totila's Gothic admirals, Gibal, was captured. These developments proved important for subsequent campaigns, as it was necessary to end Totila's sea dominance before any land invasions could be properly conducted.\nDeath.\nTotila's next exploit was the conquest and plunder of Sicily, after which he subdued Corsica and Sardinia and sent a Gothic fleet against the coasts of Greece. By this time the emperor Justinian I was taking energetic measures to check the Goths, assembling a large army and sending his navy against Totila's fleet, which it defeated in 551. The conduct of a new campaign on land was entrusted to the eunuch Narses, who took advantage of the lessening intensity of the Persian War and added contingents of Lombards, Gepid, and Heruls to his allied forces.\nLeading troops into Ravenna, Narses was able to challenge Totila at the Battle of Taginae (also known as the Battle of Busta Gallorum) near Sentinum. Totila was killed in the fighting. A similar battle followed a few months later under his successor and relative Teia, who died in combat as well during the Battle of Mons Lactarius. This additional defeat at the hands of the Eastern Roman Empire signalled the veritable end of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and no further king emerged. Another army supposedly 75,000 strong of Franks and Alemanni still existed as did the threat to Italy and despite the entry of these forces into the Po Valley and their ravaging of Italy for a time, Narses eventually brought them to heel. Meanwhile, the land held by the Gothic church was transferred to the Roman church in Italy and land owned by the Gothic kings went to the emperor.\nAftermath.\nFor the Byzantines, the war officially ended in 554, which was followed by the broad promulgation of Justinian's Pragmatic Sanction. One of the stipulations Justinian made clear in this document was the validation of all edicts made by \"legitimate\" kings and those from the Roman people or Senate, while those from Totila\u2014deemed a \"most abominable tyrant\"\u2014were rendered void. The \"Justinian Code\" was also retroactively made applicable throughout Italy. Socially, the country was disrupted by the actions of the Goths Witigis, Totila, and Teia, who had collectively fractured the Senate's social standing and the servant-based economy by liberating slaves and \"coloni\". Over the longer term, this also meant that western senators were seen as inferior to their eastern counterparts, which in some ways further contributed to the Byzantine's ascendancy.\nNevertheless, the country was so ravaged by the war that any return to normal life proved impossible and Rome, having suffered through seventeen-years' worth of bitter fighting during the Gothic wars, had been besieged and captured multiple times. French historian Bertrand Lan\u00e7on described this period of late antiquity as Rome's \"darkest hours.\" In 568, only three years after Justinian's death, most of the country was conquered by Alboin of the Lombards, who absorbed the remaining Ostrogothic population, becoming the heirs of the Ostrogoths in Italy itself.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It received city rights in 1809. Assen is known for TT Circuit Assen, the motorcycle racing circuit, where on the last Sunday in June the Dutch TT is run; and also for the annual Assen Dance Festival.\nAssen won the European Green Leaf Award for 2027.\nPopulation centres.\nAnreep, Assen, De Haar, Graswijk, Loon, Rhee, Schieven, Ter Aard, Ubbena, Witten, Zeijerveen, and Zeijerveld.\nHistory.\nThe history of the capital of Drenthe can be traced back to at least 1258, when a new location had to be found for Marienkamp Abbey, which had originally been built near Coevorden as a penalty for the slaughter in 1227 of the army of the Bishop of Utrecht at the hands of Drenthe's peasants, in what has come to be known as the Battle of Ane \u2013 a battle, incidentally, in which the bishop was killed. His successor ordered the nunnery to be built as a penalty. As it was located in a barren peat area, which also happened to flood from time to time, a better location had to be found. A better and especially drier spot for the Cistercian abbey was found in an area known as Witten, where at the time only a few farms were located. Around it was village communities like Deurze, Witten and Peelo. The latter has a history which goes back to the times when Dolmens were built, but it is now situated between two new districts of Assen. The \"relocated\" abbey probably was erected in the 1260s, and over the centuries Assen developed around it.\nAbbey.\nThe abbey was built at what now is the Brink (i.e., the grassy area which serves as a symbolic municipal centre) of Assen. On the abbey site now stands the Drents Museum, which was built in 1882 as \"provinciehuis\" (i.e., the residence of the provincial government). Only the \"abdijkerk\" (abbey church), the grounds, and bits and pieces of walls remind us of the religious beginnings of the city.\nCoat of arms.\nThe coat of arms is directly borrowed from the seal of the abbey. It is just like the coat of arms of the province of Drenthe - in both cases Mary with child - but Jesus switches to the other knee. The history of the city is connected with the provincial governing board: around 1600, the abbey property was secularised. Marienkamp no longer existed, but the buildings did. Because of the central position of Assen and the fact that the government from what was then called \"de Landschap Drenthe\" (the Landscape Drenthe) was searching for a location for the government and civil servants, Assen became the seat for, and thus practically also the capital of Drenthe.\n\"Drents Haagje\".\nAssen was not a municipality yet, not even in ecclesiastical sense. Even though there was an abbey church, Assen fell ecclesiastically and administratively under Rolde. In 1615 Assen got its preacher. In 1807 Assen administratively freed itself from the control of Rolde when the village got to establish its own municipal authorities. A municipal authority which, moreover, in most cases, operated in the shadow of the provincial government, which always manifested itself prominently in the \"Drentse Haagje\". The municipal authority mainly got there because of provincial governors like Governor Petrus Hofstede, to which the city also thanks its uniquely located park (in the center of the city). From that time, Assen also obtained its nickname \"het Herenbolwerk\".\nCity rights.\nAssen has been an official city since 1809. After Coevorden, then a village of about sixteen hundred people, Assen became the second place in Drenthe with city rights, granted by King Louis Napoleon, who had big plans for the village. A plan to make it a city was set up at the time, but the Kingdom of the Netherlands was incorporated into Napoleon Bonaparte's French Empire, and the plans were abandoned.\nAs an administrative centre, Assen attracted well-to-do inhabitants and new enterprises and initiatives. These contributed to a slow but steady increase of commerce, wealth and new establishments; such a newspaper in 1823, a Latin school in 1825, a postal service on Groningen in 1830, a court in 1840, a first beginning for a garrison in 1852 and a railway station in 1870. Another major achievement was the canal Drentse Hoofdvaart, which was used to transport peat and other goods; the Noord-Willemskanaal was opened in 1861. The most important monuments of the city are from the nineteenth century.\nIndustry.\nAround 1900 Assen began to play a more prominent industrial role. It was originally a centre of civil servants, but the establishment of a slaughterhouse, dairy factory and iron foundry created more diverse expansion opportunities and encouraged growth. Around 1930, by establishing various psychiatric hospitals and healthcare centres, Assen became a central point for health care in the province.\nGrowth.\nAfter the Second World War, Assen did not have more than 20,000 inhabitants. The Assen TT made the city more widely known, but it was not until the 1950s, with the development of an industrial core, did Assen begin to grow more quickly. The Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (Dutch Oil Company) established itself in the city, and with that, a trend was set. Now, Assen is known not only because of its TT, Bartje and the \"Drentse Rijwielvierdaagse\". It also is the fastest-growing city in the northern part of the Netherlands, with ample employment opportunities, particularly in the service industry.The city's unprecedented growth in houses and inhabitants is taking place, with environmental issues becoming more urgent.\nThe Assen railway station connects the city to the rest of the country. Assen's city centre is closed to through motor traffic (except emergency vehicles), it has an extensive network of off-road cycle paths, and 41% of all journeys in Assen are by bicycle. The city has progressively become more cycle friendly since the 1960s.\nTourism, culture and sport.\nTourist Trophy.\nThe TT Circuit Assen is one of the most famous motorcycle racing circuits in the world and is the only circuit that has been in the MotoGP calendar since its beginnings in 1949. It is also regarded as the \"Cathedral of Motorcycle Racing.\"\nDrents Museum.\nThe Drents Museum provides a view of the world and of Drenthe, with stories about archaeology, art and history.\nThe Yde Girl.\nBefore her execution, one half of this girl's head was shaved. She was only sixteen, about 140\u00a0cm tall and she had blond hair. Around the beginning of the Common Era, this adolescent was strangled with a woolen band which the executioner had wrapped around her neck three times. Possibly, she was also stabbed in the neck near the left collarbone. She rested in the peat bog near the village of Yde for almost two thousand years, until two workers discovered her in May 1897 - and then ran away in fright. Days later most of her body parts and fragments of a cloak were dredged up from the peat. Unfortunately, the villagers had also heard about this find. They had secretly removed nearly all her teeth and tore off most of her hair.\nDance.\nIn November of each year Assen becomes the centre of international attention for the world of Ballroom and Latin American dancers when the city hosts the Assen Dance Festival which includes the Dutch Open Championships. This is an open event for dancers from all countries.\nCycling.\nAssen is also the capital of the \"cycling province\" of the Netherlands, Drenthe. There are many high quality cycle paths in the city and surroundings and it is host to regular cycling events such as the Drentse fietsvierdaagse and the Jeugdtour. In 2009 the prologue and opening stage of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a took place in Assen.\nThe city has twice hosted the International Six Days Enduro.\nAssociation football.\nAsser Christelijke Voetbalvereniging was founded in 1939 and is one of the most successful amateur clubs in Dutch football.\nEducation.\nThe city of Assen is home to the Dutch secondary vocational education (MBO) of Drenthe College. Some of the programmes offered by this vocational school are \"Car technician\", \"First Car Engineer\" and \"First motorcycle technician\", all due to the strong connections between DC and the TT Circuit Assen. About 8,000 students work across the three faculties in the city of Assen, as well as few others in Meppel and Emmen.\nAssen also hosts one faculty of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, more specifically the Hanze Institute of Technology. About 100 university students are located here, some from the Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and some from the Master Course of Smart Systems Engineering.\nThe difference between the two institutions is that the former is only given in Dutch and is more \"work in the field\" orientated. Meanwhile, the latter is an international university of AS that provides Bachelors's and Masters's studies in English (see education in the Netherlands).\nInternational relations.\nAssen is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In an 1185 revolt against the Emperor Andronikos Komnenos, Isaac seized power and rose to the Byzantine throne, establishing the Angelos family as the new imperial dynasty.\nHis father Andronikos Doukas Angelos was a military leader in Asia Minor (c. 1122\u00a0\u2013 aft. 1185) who married Euphrosyne Kastamonitissa (c. 1125\u00a0\u2013 aft. 1195). Andronikos Doukas Angelos was the son of Constantine Angelos and Theodora Komnene (b. 15 January 1096/1097), the youngest daughter of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and Irene Doukaina. Thus Isaac was a member of the extended imperial clan of the Komnenoi.\nRising by revolt.\nNiketas Choniates described Isaac's physical appearance: \"He had a ruddy complexion and red hair, was of average height and robust in body\".\nDuring the brief reign of Andronikos I Komnenos, Isaac was involved (alongside his father and brothers) in the revolt of Nicaea and Prousa. Atypically, the Emperor did not punish him for this disloyalty, and Isaac remained at Constantinople.\nOn 11 September 1185, while Andronikos was absent from the capital, his lieutenant Stephen Hagiochristophorites moved to arrest Isaac. Isaac killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of Hagia Sophia. Andronikos was a capable ruler in some ways but was hated for his cruelty and his efforts to keep the aristocracy obedient. Isaac appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city. When Andronikos returned he found that he had lost popular support, and that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor. Andronikos attempted to flee by boat but was apprehended. Isaac handed him over to the people of the city, and he was killed on 12 September 1185.\nFirst reign.\nIsaac II Angelos strengthened his position as emperor with dynastic marriages in 1185 and 1186. Isaac's sister Theodora was married to the Italian marquis Conrad of Montferrat. In January 1186, Isaac himself married Margaret of Hungary (renamed Maria), daughter of King B\u00e9la III. Hungary was one of the Empire's largest and most powerful neighbours, and Margaret also had the benefit of high aristocratic descent, being related to the royal families of Kiev, the Holy Roman Empire, Italy, Provence, and earlier Byzantine dynasties. Sometime after 1191, his niece Eudokia Angelina was married to Stefan, son of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja of Serbia.\nIsaac inaugurated his reign with a decisive victory over the Norman King of Sicily, William II, at the Battle of Demetritzes on 7 November 1185. William had invaded the Balkans with 80,000 men and 200 ships towards the end of Andronikos I's reign. Elsewhere Isaac's policy was less successful. In late 1185, he sent a fleet of 80 galleys to liberate his brother Alexius III from Acre, but the fleet was destroyed by the Normans of Sicily. He then sent a fleet of 70 ships, but it failed to recover Cyprus from the rebellious noble Isaac Komnenos, thanks to Norman interference. This fleet was misinterpreted by many in the Holy Land as naval support for the Muslim offensive in accordance with Isaac's alliance with Saladin. However the theory of a supposed alliance between Isaac and Saladin against the Third Crusade has been discredited by modern research.\nIsaac's administration was dominated by two figures: his maternal uncle Theodore Kastamonites, who became virtually a co-emperor and handled all civil government until his death in 1193; and his replacement, Constantine Mesopotamites, who acquired even more influence over the emperor.\nThe oppressiveness of his taxes, increased to pay his armies and finance his marriage, resulted in a Vlach-Bulgarian uprising late in 1185. The rebellion led to the establishment of the Vlach-Bulgarian Empire under the Asen dynasty. In 1187 Alexios Branas, the victor over the Normans, was sent against the Bulgarians but turned his arms against his master and attempted to seize Constantinople, only to be defeated and slain by Isaac's brother-in-law Conrad of Montferrat. Also in 1187 an agreement was made with Venice, in which the Venetian Republic would provide between 40 and 100 galleys at six months' notice in exchange for favorable trading concessions. Because each Venetian galley was manned by 140 oarsmen, there were about 18,000 Venetians still in the Empire even after Manuel I's arrests.\nThe Emperor's attention was next demanded in the east, where several claimants to the throne successively rose and fell. In 1189 the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa sought and obtained permission to lead his troops on the Third Crusade through the Byzantine Empire. But Isaac was suspicious that Barbarossa wished to conquer Byzantium: the reasons for this suspicious attitude were the diplomatic contact of Frederick with the Bulgarians and the Serbians, foes of the Byzantine Empire during this period, and also Barbarossa's previous feud with Manuel. The rumors of 1160s about a German invasion in the Byzantine Empire were still remembered in the Byzantine court during Isaac's reign. In retaliation Barbarossa's army occupied the city of Philippopolis and defeated a Byzantine army of 3,000 men that attempted to recapture the city. The Byzantine troops managed to constantly and successfully harass the Crusaders but a group of Armenians revealed to the Germans the strategic plan of the Byzantines. The Crusaders, who outnumbered the Byzantines, caught them unprepared and defeated them. Thus compelled by force of arms, Isaac II was forced to fulfill his engagements in 1190, when he released imprisoned German emissaries who were held in Constantinople, and exchanged hostages with Barbarossa, as a guarantee that the crusaders would not sack local settlements until they departed the Byzantine territory. In March 1190, Barbarossa left Adrianople to Gallipoli at the Hellespont to embark to Asia Minor.\nIn 1191, Isaac II launched a military expedition against Serbia. The Byzantine army was victorious in the battle at South Morava (autumn 1191), that led to the recovery of Ni\u0161 and the consequent peace treaty.\nBy 1196, Isaac II had allowed the once powerful Byzantine navy to decline to only 30 galleys.\nThe next five years were disturbed by continued warfare with Bulgaria, against which Isaac led several expeditions in person. In spite of their promising start these ventures had little effect, and on one occasion in 1190 Isaac barely escaped with his life. The Byzantines suffered yet another major defeat in the Battle of Arcadiopolis in 1194. Isaac organized yet another offensive against Bulgaria in 1195 in cooperation with the Kingdom of Hungary, but Alexios Angelos, the Emperor's older brother, taking advantage of Isaac's absence from camp on a hunting expedition, proclaimed himself emperor and was readily recognised by the soldiers as Emperor Alexios III on 8 (or 9) April. Alexios then canceled the expedition and ordered Isaac to be blinded and imprisoned in Constantinople.\nSecond reign.\nIn 1203, after eight years of captivity, Isaac II was raised from the dungeon to the throne once more after the arrival of the Fourth Crusade and the flight of Alexios III from the capital. Both his mind and body had been enfeebled by his blindness and confinement, and his son Alexios IV Angelos was associated on the throne as the effective monarch.\nHeavily beholden to the crusaders, Alexios IV was unable to meet his obligations and his vacillation caused him to lose the support of both his crusader allies and his subjects. At the end of January 1204 the influential court official Alexios Doukas \"Mourtzouphlos\" took advantage of riots in the capital to imprison Alexios IV and seize the throne as Alexios\u00a0V. At this point Isaac II died, allegedly of shock, while Alexios IV was strangled.\nUsurpers.\nSeveral pretenders rose up and attempted to wrest the throne from Isaac during his reign. These included:\nHistorical reputation.\nIsaac has the reputation as one of the most unsuccessful rulers to occupy the Byzantine throne. Surrounded by a crowd of slaves, mistresses, and flatterers, he permitted his empire to be administered by unworthy favourites, while he squandered the money wrung from his provinces on costly buildings and expensive gifts to the churches of his metropolis. In 1185, the Empire lost Lefkada, Kefallonia, and Zakynthos to the Normans. In the same year the Vlach\u2013Bulgarian Empire was restored after the rebellion of the brothers Asen and Peter, thus losing Moesia and parts of Thrace and Macedonia. After that Cilicia was retaken by the Armenians, and Cyprus wrested from the empire by the Crusaders.\nFamily.\nFirst marriage.\nIsaac II's first wife's name, Herina or Eirene (i.e., Irene), is found on the necrology of Speyer Cathedral, where their daughter Irene is interred. The first wife of Isaac II is usually considered to be a Byzantine noblewoman of unknown name. In an Italian edition of the chronicle of Nicetas Choniates \"Greatness and catastrophe of Byzantium\" can be found an interesting note to the XIV Book. The names of Isaac II's first wife and eldest daughter, unknown from Byzantine sources, are found in an obituary in the Cathedral of Speyer, the pantheon of German kings. Here, the wife of Philip of Swabia is said to be the daughter of Isaac and Irene (there is reference to the following article: R. Hiestand, Die erste Ehe Isaaks II. Angelos und seine Kinder, in Jahrbuch der Osterreichischen Byzantinisk, XLVII 1997 pp.\u00a0199\u2013208). This Irene could be identified with the daughter of George Palaiologos Doukas Komnenos and wife Aspae, Bagratid Princess of Ossetia, according to Leontii Voitovych and Aleksandr Mayorov.; the son of this ones, Andronikos Palaiologos Komnenodoukas, is known as gambrox (\"\u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2\") of Isaac II. In alternative, Isaac's wife was possibly daughter of Andronikos I Komnenos, Byzantine Emperor (died 1185). A potential foreign origin is also given to her due to having the same name as her daughter, contrary to long-standing Greek custom. A more recent examination (2011) of the extant documentation presents the case that Irene was very likely a Tornikina and daughter of Demetrios Tornikes, logothetes tou dromou and sebastos of Isaac II, and an unknown Mallakis.\nTheir third child was born in 1182 or 1183 and she was dead or divorced by 1185, when Isaac remarried.\nTheir children were: \nSecond marriage.\nBy his second wife, Margaret of Hungary (who took the baptismal name \"Maria\"), Isaac II had two sons: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It thus endangers and can even kill products and projects.\nCauses.\nFeature creep may arise from the desire to provide the consumer with a more useful or desirable product in order to increase sales or distribution. Once a product does everything that it is designed to do, the manufacturer may add functions some users might consider unneeded (sometimes at the cost of efficiency) or continue with the original version (at the cost of a perceived lack of improvement).\nFeature creep may also arise as a result of compromise from a committee implementing several different viewpoints or use cases in the same product, even for opportunistic reasons. As more features are added to support each approach, cross-conversion features between the multiple paradigms may further complicate the total features.\nControl.\nThere are several methods to control feature creep, including: strict limits for allowable features, multiple variations, and pruning excess features.\nSeparation.\nLater feature creep may be avoided by basing initial design on strong software fundamentals, such as logical separation of functionality and data access, e.g. using submenus that are optionally accessible by power users who desire more functionality and a higher verbosity of information. It can be actively controlled with rigorous change management and by delaying changes to later delivery phases of a project.\nBecause the ever-growing, ever-expanding addition of new features might exceed available resources, a minimal core \"basic\" version of a product can be maintained separately, to ensure operation in smaller operating environments. Using the \"80/20 rule\", the more basic product variations might fulfill the needs of the majority (e.g. ~80%) of the users, so they would not be subjected to the complexity (or extra expense) of features requested by the advanced 20% of users. The extra features are still available, but optional and ready to be utilized for those who solicit them, but they have not been implemented into the basic versions of the products.\nVariations and options.\nAnother method of controlling feature creep is maintaining multiple variations of products, where features are limited and reduced in the more basic variations, e.g. Microsoft Windows editions. For software user interfaces, viewing modes or operation modes can be used (e.g. basic mode or expert mode), between which the users can select to match their own needs.\nBoth in many graphical user interfaces and command-line interfaces, users are able to opt in for a higher verbosity manually. In the latter case, in many command-line programs, adding a codice_1 or codice_2 option manually, does show more detailed information that might be less relevant to minimal users, but useful to power users or for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.\nModularity.\nAnother solution for feature creep is modularity. Power users who require more functionality can retrofit needed features by downloading software modules, plug-ins, add-ons (also known as add-ins) and custom themes to match their personal requirements.\nPruning.\nAt some point, the cost of maintaining a particular subset of features might become prohibitive, and pruning can be used. A new product version can omit the extra features, or perhaps a transition period would be used, where old features were deprecated before eventual removal from the system. If there are multiple variations of products, then some of them might be phased out of use. One major example is the Samsung Galaxy S6, released March 2015, of which significantly many software/menu features and also some hardware features were pruned. A \u201cmore functional\u201d variation of it hasn't been released.\nConsequences.\nExpansion of scope.\nOccasionally, uncontrolled feature creep can lead to products that surpass the scope of what was originally intended; this is known as scope creep. A common consequence of feature creep is the delay or cancellation of a product, which may become more expensive than was originally intended.\nDelays.\nOften, a reasonably feature-complete software project, or one with moderate amounts of feature creep, can survive and even thrive through many iterations, but its successor release may suffer substantial delays once a decision is taken to rewrite the whole code base in addition to introducing new technologies. For example, Microsoft's Windows Vista was planned to be a minor release between Windows XP and its successor codenamed Windows \"Blackcomb\" (released as Windows 7), but after adapting more and more features from Blackcomb (many of which were eventually cancelled), Vista turned out to become a major release which took five years of development.\nA similar fate was suffered by Netscape 6, which was originally supposed to be Netscape 5. The 1998 decision by Netscape Communications to open-source its Netscape Navigator browser and Communicator Internet suite (both code-named Mozilla) soon made it obvious that the underlying code was too difficult, and required a complete rewrite of Mozilla, which fostered the creation of the Mozilla application framework. This caused significant delays, Netscape 5 was skipped, and the company was purchased by AOL. The subsequent release of Netscape 6.00 in 2000 was widely criticized as alpha-level code, and the project reached stability by Netscape 6.1 in 2001, three years after the decision to rework the Internet suite. By that time, Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser had long-eclipsed Netscape in usage share, which had diminished to single digits.\nEven after reaching stability and attaining some necessary new features, the open-source Mozilla Application Suite (then named just Mozilla), on which AOL built Netscape, was viewed as \"bloated\". Just a year later, a group of Mozilla developers decided to separate the browser component, which eventually became Firefox.\nDouble Fine Adventures' Kickstarter project \"Broken Age\" is another example of a project being delayed by feature creep. Originally supposed to have a release date of October 2012, the first half of the game was released in January 2014 while the second half followed late April 2015, and required two separate funding rounds to complete.\nFeeping creaturism.\nFeature creep combined with short deadlines will often lead to a \"hacky solution\". The desired change may be large enough to warrant a redesign of the existing project foundation, but deadline pressure instead requires developers to rush and put out a less-refined product. The spoonerism \"feeping creaturism\" was coined to emphasize a developer's dislike of this situation, personifying the scope-crept product as \"a misshapen creature of hacks ... prowling about in the dark\", and the harbinger of more creep to come. (\"Feeping\" is a jargon synonym of \"beeping\".)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He made his name as a successful military commander, serving as commander-in-chief of the eastern armies between c.\u20091042 and 1054. In 1057 he became the head of a conspiracy of the dissatisfied eastern generals against the newly crowned Michael VI Bringas. Proclaimed emperor by his followers on 8 June 1057, he rallied sufficient military forces to defeat the loyalist army at the Battle of Hades. While Isaac was willing to accept a compromise solution by being appointed Michael's heir, a powerful faction in Constantinople, led by the ambitious Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Keroularios, pressured Michael to abdicate. After Michael abdicated on 30 August 1057, Isaac was crowned emperor in the Hagia Sophia on 1 September.\nAs emperor, he rewarded his supporters, but also embarked on a series of fiscal measures designed to shore up revenue and eliminate the excesses allowed to flourish under his predecessors. His aim was to fill the treasury and restore the Byzantine army's effectiveness to preserve the empire. The reduction of salaries, harsh tax measures and confiscation of Church properties aroused much opposition, particularly from Patriarch Keroularios, who had come to think of himself as a king-maker. In November 1058, Keroularios was arrested and exiled, and died before a synod to depose him could be convened. \nThe eastern frontier held firm during Isaac's reign, Hungarian raids were resolved by a treaty in 1059, while the restive Pechenegs were subdued by Isaac in person in summer 1059. Shortly after, Isaac fell ill, and on the advice and pressure of Michael Psellos, he abdicated his throne in favour of Constantine X Doukas, retiring to the Stoudion monastery where he died later in 1060.\nBiography.\nOrigin and early career.\nIsaac was the son of Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, who reportedly served as \"strategos autokrator\" of the East under Emperor Basil\u00a0II and defended Nicaea against the rebel Bardas Skleros in 978. His mother's name was Maria, about whom nothing else is known. Manuel's native language was Greek and modern scholarship considers the family to have been of Greek origin. It is said that the family name was derived from the city of Komne, near Philippopolis in Thrace. Isaac was born c.\u20091007. \nAs Maria had died early, on his deathbed in 1020, Isaac's father commended his two surviving sons Isaac and John to the care of Emperor Basil II. According to Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger, the two children were raised with the utmost solicitude and the best tutors at the Stoudion monastery, with care taken to teach them military exercises and hunting. As soon as they came of age, Isaac and his brother joined the imperial bodyguard, the \"Hetaireia\".\nAt a young age, perhaps as early as 1025, Isaac married Catherine of Bulgaria (born c.\u20091010), a daughter of Ivan Vladislav (r.\u20091015\u00a0\u2013\u00a01018), the last Tsar of the First Bulgarian Empire. From c.\u20091042 he held the post of \"stratopedarches\" of the East\u2014likely denoting that he was \"domestikos ton scholon\", commander-in-chief, of the eastern field army, but this title is not explicitly attested\u2014and the ranks of \"magistros\" and \"vestes\". He was dismissed by Empress Theodora in 1054, and replaced by her eunuch confidant, the \"proedros\" Theodore.\nRevolt of the eastern generals.\nMichael VI and the military leadership.\nWhen Michael VI Bringas came to the throne in 1056, Isaac was chosen to lead a deputation of eastern generals to the new emperor. Michael VI engaged in mass promotions of individuals\u2014in the eyes of the contemporary courtier Michael Psellos, to an excessive degree\u2014and the military sought to partake in the emperor's bounty. This was not a trivial matter: the debasement of the Byzantine currency under Constantine IX Monomachos (r.\u20091042\u00a0\u2013\u00a01054) had affected military pay\u2014not coincidentally presided over by none other than Michael Bringas, who was then military logothete\u2014and while civil officials were compensated by being raised to higher dignities (which commanded higher salaries, \"rogai\"), the army was not. This exacerbated the already simmering dislike of the military aristocracy for the \"regime of eunuchs and civilian politicians\" that had dominated the empire during the last decades of the Macedonian dynasty.\nAt Easter 1057, the traditional time when the emperor paid title holders their stipends, the delegation presented itself before the emperor. Along with Isaac, the delegation included the \"magistros\" Katakalon Kekaumenos, who had just been dismissed as \"doux\" of Antioch; the \"vestarches\" Michael Bourtzes, whose namesake grandfather had captured Antioch for Byzantium a century earlier; Constantine Doukas, married to a niece of the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael Keroularios; his brother John Doukas, a friend of Psellos; and others not explicitly named. As the historian Anthony Kaldellis comments, this was a formidable assemblage, as the families represented in it, all of them descended from military men promoted by the warrior-emperor Basil II, would define \"the future of the empire for the next thirty years, indeed for the next century and more\". \nPsellos himself was an eyewitness at the reception of the generals' delegation, and claims that the emperor began abusing them at once; he then made Isaac, as the leader of the deputation, and his second, Kekaumenos, stand forth, and proceeded to denounce him, claiming that he was responsible for \"all but losing Antioch\" and \"corrupting his army\", being a coward and incompetent, and of having misappropriated army funds for his own use. John Skylitzes, who wrote later in the century, reports that the emperor treated the generals courteously, but agrees that he refused outright to consider the honours they claimed for themselves, notably the promotion of Isaac and Kekaumenos to the rank of \"proedros\". \nThe effect of the emperor's attitude on the army leadership was profound, and turned them against Michael. A second delegation to the chief minister, the \"protosynkellos\" Leo Paraspondylos, was received in similar manner, and according to Psellos Isaac could barely restrain his colleagues from attacking the emperor then and there, in his own throne room. At length, a plot was formed against the emperor, and despite Isaac's own reluctance, according to Psellos, he was nominated as its leader. \nThe conspirators contacted the veteran general Nikephoros Bryennios, who had unsuccessfully tried to usurp the throne from Theodora but had recently been recalled by Michael VI as commander of the Macedonian army, and he apparently agreed to support them. Soon after, however, Bryennios left with his troops for Asia Minor, to campaign against the Turks. Once in the Anatolic Theme he quarreled with the army treasurer, threw him in prison, and appropriated the funds to pay his soldiers as he saw fit. This was seen by another local commander as a sign of rebellion; Bryennios was arrested and blinded.\nProclamation of Isaac as emperor and the Battle of Hades.\nFearing that their plot was about to be discovered, the eastern generals hastened to act: the conspirators resident in the Anatolic Theme, Romanos Skleros, Michael Bourtzes, Nikephoros Botaneiates and the sons of Basil Argyros, hastened to find Isaac Komnenos at his estates near Kastamon in Paphlagonia, and on 8 June 1057, at a place called Gounaria, proclaimed him emperor. It is unclear whether any of the rebels held command of troops; rather, according to Kaldellis, \"they had to canvass for support among the officers and soldiers and forge orders of imperial appointment for themselves\". Thus Skylitzes reports that Kekaumenos had to forge imperial letters to mobilize the regiments of the Armeniac Theme. With this force he went to join Komnenos. Leaving his family for safety with his brother at the fortress of Pemolissa on the banks of the Halys River, Komnenos advanced west towards Constantinople. \nAt the same time, the western regiments, and some of the eastern ones too, remained loyal to Michael VI. The emperor placed them under the command of Theodora's eunuch favourite, the \"proedros\" Theodore, and Aaron, Isaac's brother-in-law; unlike previously, he now showered his commanders with honours to secure their allegiance. The loyalist army assembled at Nicomedia, controlling the direct route to the capital. Therefore Komnenos turned south and seized Nicaea as his base of operations. \nThe two armies met at the Battle of Hades, near Nicaea. In a hard-fought battle with many casualties, the loyalist left defeated the right wing of the rebel army. On the other flank, Kekaumenos broke through the loyalists to capture their camp and decide the battle, while Isaac held the centre.\nNegotiations and downfall of Michael VI.\nMichael\u00a0VI then attempted to negotiate with the rebels, sending Psellos, Leo Alopos, and the former \"mesazon\" of Constantine IX, Constantine Leichoudes, to Isaac's camp. Michael offered to adopt Isaac as his son and to grant him the title of \"Caesar\", making him effectively his successor, but this was rejected in a public audience. Psellos claims that Isaac was inclined to accept, but the pressure of the assembled troops, who vocally refused it, forced him to agree with his supporters. At a private meeting afterwards Isaac insisted that he had accepted the title of emperor only under the pressure of his followers, and secretly accepted the offer provided that Michael would also share \"some, at any rate, of his imperial power\", so that he could make appointments and reward his followers, especially in the military. \nThe envoys returned to Constantinople, and rapidly secured Michael's consent to the proposal; the Emperor explicitly agreed to pardon Isaac's followers, and to accord Isaac additional honours above those of \"Caesar\", setting him up almost as a co-emperor (\"symbasileus\"). As a sign of good faith, furthermore, Paraspondylos was dismissed from office. When the envoys returned to Isaac with this news, he publicly accepted the proposal and prepared to enter the capital. \nBack in Constantinople, however, a crowd of officials assembled in the Hagia Sophia and began protesting that by making a deal, the Emperor was forcing them to renounce their oaths to oppose the rebels. Going a step further, they began themselves acclaiming Isaac as emperor. After a short while, on 30 August, Michael Keroularios and the clergy joined their cause, raising suspicions that this \"spontaneous\" assembly had been planned by the ambitious and wily Patriarch all along. Pressured by Keroularios and wanting to avoid bloodshed in the city, Michael agreed to abdicate. He was quickly tonsured and retired to a monastery. On the next day, 31 August, Isaac and his entourage crossed the Bosporus into Constantinople and entered the palace; on 1 September, he was crowned emperor by the Patriarch in the Hagia Sophia.\nReign.\nThe first act of the new emperor was to reward his partisans: his fellow conspirators were named to high offices\u2014his own brother John was named \"domestikos ton scholon\" of the West and received the high title of \"kouropalates\", which was also awarded to Kekaumenos and Bryennios. The troops that had followed him received a donative and were quickly sent back east, to avoid any trouble with the populace of Constantinople. Patriarch Michael Keroularios was also rewarded for his support, by receiving sole authority for all personnel and financial matters of the Church, which were previously under the purview of the emperor, while the Patriarch's nephews received high court titles.\nFiscal reforms.\nIsaac's rise to power was a turning point in Byzantine history, marking the definitive end of the long-lived Macedonian dynasty. Although powerful generals had previously suborned power, they had ruled alongside the Macedonian emperors; Isaac was the first military strongman to usurp power outright since the 9th century. This was reflected in the coinage struck in his name, which uniquely showed him holding a drawn sword; while it may have simply indicated his intention to restore \"capable military rule\" (Kaldellis), it came to be understood as a claim to rule by right of conquest. Certainly it highlighted Isaac's determination to make reforms and restore the effectiveness of the army. \nThe task he faced was truly herculean, as the politically weak emperors of the previous thirty years had fostered corruption and inefficiency, handing out titles and their attendant state salaries (\"rogai\") in exchange for support. The devaluation of the coinage under Constantine IX had been a first reaction to the brewing crisis, but Isaac was the first emperor in this period who certainly faced a budget deficit. To fund his cherished army, Isaac was therefore obliged to begin strict economies: he reduced or abolished the \"rogai\" of those who had been awarded titles, enforced a stricter and more efficient collection of taxes, reclaimed misappropriated imperial estates, and cancelled grants of such lands and tax exemptions made under Constantine IX and Michael VI, particularly those that had been granted to monasteries and churches, using a law of Nikephoros II Phokas. Even though salaries of officials, especially members of the Senate, were cut, Isaac's efforts were enthusiastically received even among some senior members of the civil bureaucracy, judging by the comments of Psellos and Michael Attaleiates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Isaac Komnenos] was eager to lose no time in cutting out the dead wood which had long been accumulating in the Roman Empire. We can liken it to a monstrous body, a body with a multitude of heads, an ugly bull-neck, hands so many that they were beyond counting, and just as many feet; its entrails were festering and diseased, in some parts swollen, in others wasting away, here afflicted with dropsy, there diminishing with consumption. Now Isaac tried to remedy this by wholesale surgery.\u2014\u200a\nDownfall of Keroularios.\nThe only point of criticism raised by Psellos is his haste and severity, judging that by a more gradual and judicious, step by step approach, he would have reaped greater success with far less opposition. Thus his appropriation of Church lands provoked the reaction of Michael Keroularios, with whom Isaac's relations had been steadily deteriorating. The Patriarch's role in Isaac's accession and his extensive new powers over the Church quickly went to his head. He is said to have admonished and berated the emperor, even going as far as threatening to destroy him \"like an oven he had made\". He is also alleged to have worn imperial purple boots, a privilege restricted to the emperor, and which may indicate, according to Kaldellis, that Keroularios was influenced by Papal theories and conceived of the secular and clerical powers as co-equal, a traditional Byzantine approach known as a symphonia.\nFinally, on 8 November 1058, while Keroularios was visiting a church outside the city walls, and hence was away from his supporters in the urban mob, Isaac sent the Varangian Guard to arrest him and take him to Prokonnesos, where he was placed under house arrest. Isaac applied considerable pressure on Keroularios to resign, but the latter steadfastly refused. In the end, the emperor decided to convene a synod against the Patriarch. This too was to take place away from the capital, somewhere in Thrace, with Psellos, who had himself been earlier persecuted by Keroularios, as the chief accuser. In the event, Keroularios died on 21 January 1059, before the synod could take place. Isaac appointed the bureaucrat Constantine Leichoudes as the new patriarch.\nMilitary situation.\nThe rebellion and civil war that brought Isaac to the throne had concentrated Byzantium's military might away from its borders. The contemporary Armenian historian Aristakes Lastivertsi reports that the Georgian lord Ivane took advantage of this opportunity to capture two Byzantine frontier forts as well as an imperial tax collector, and lay siege to Theodosiopolis. The Byzantine \"doux\" at Ani drove him off, but Ivane then called upon some Turks for assistance. About a month after Isaac's coronation, these raiders reached Melitene, whose inhabitants were allowed to depart before the city was plundered by the Turks. Local Byzantine troops managed to blockade the mountain passes, forcing the raiders to winter in the region of Chorzane. In spring 1058, the Turks were ambushed and defeated while they attacked the fort of Mormrans, leaving most of their captives behind. At about the same time or shortly after, another Turkish raid into Taron was heavily defeated by the Byzantine defenders. Melitene was repaired and refortified, and made the seat of a \"doux\". \nConstantine IX had famously abolished the military obligations of the Armenian thematic troops in exchange for cash payments, a step widely regarded, both by contemporaries and modern historians, as having catastrophic consequences for Byzantium's eastern defences, especially against the mounting Turkish threat. The Turks had taken Vaspurakan during the regency following Constantine's death, exposing the Anatolian interior to their raids. While Isaac does not appear to have acted to restore the thematic armies, according to Kaldellis, the reaction of the local forces to these events does not appear to indicate a degradation of Byzantium's defensive abilities in the East, but rather the continued and successful application of old-established counter-raiding principles as codified in Nikephoros Phokas' \"De velitatione bellica\" a century earlier.\nIsaac led only one military expedition, in late summer of 1059, into the Balkan provinces that had been suffering raids by the Hungarians and the Pechenegs. The details of the campaign are obscure, but the two had possibly entered into an alliance. At Serdica, the emperor made a treaty with the Hungarians\u2014who appear to have kept the fortress town of Sirmium\u2014before moving against the Pechenegs in the area of Moesia. Most of the Pechenegs submitted again to imperial authority. The only major combat was against the fortified stronghold of a certain Selte, a recalcitrant Pecheneg leader.\nOn its return march the army was caught in a sudden storm on 24 September. Many men and supplies were lost, while Isaac barely escaped death when a tree struck by lightning fell next to him. This was followed by the false rumour that a tax assessor in the eastern provinces was plotting rebellion, and Isaac hastened back to the capital. Despite these events, Psellos claims that at this point Isaac's character changed markedly, and that he became \"more haughty to such an extent that he held everyone else in contempt\", including his own brother.\nIllness, abdication, and death.\nIsaac was a passionate hunter with both the horse and the falcon, spending much time at a hunting lodge outside Constantinople. On a hunt he fell ill. As the fever lasted for several days, Isaac, fearing he would die soon, named Constantine Doukas as his successor on 22 November 1059, and agreed to resign and retire to a monastery. Psellos claims that he was the main author of this nomination, even against the initial opposition of Empress Catherine. \nAccording to Psellos, Isaac began to recover soon after Doukas' nomination, and started reconsidering his decision. Psellos again took the decisive step of having Doukas publicly acclaimed as emperor on 23 November, with Psellos putting the purple sandals on his feet. Isaac then resigned himself to his fate, and was tonsured as a monk, retiring to the Stoudion monastery. Psellos' prominent role in these events may simply be exaggeration and self-promotion, especially as he was writing this part of his history during the reign of Constantine Doukas and his son Michael VII Doukas (r.\u20091071\u00a0\u2013\u00a01078). No contemporary or later source, not even during the Komnenian dynasty (1081\u20131180), described or implied a coup by Doukas and his supporters, and the legality of the transition was never questioned. \nEmpress Catherine remained at the palace, and was even allowed to be mentioned first in the imperial acclamations, with Doukas coming second. This joint reign lasted for a brief while, before she too retired to the Myrelaion monastery under the monastic name of Xene. Isaac lived the remainder of his life as a simple monk in Stoudion, readily performing menial tasks until he died in 1060, probably on 1 June.\nFamily.\nIsaac was married to Catherine of Bulgaria, a daughter of Ivan Vladislav, the last ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire. Isaac raised her to the position of \"Augusta\". The couple had at least two children:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cain\nMildred Pierce is a psychological hardboiled novel by James M. Cain published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1941.\nA story of \u201csocial inequity and opportunity in America\" set during the Great Depression, \"Mildred Pierce\" follows the trajectory of a lower-middle class divorcee with two children in her tragic struggle to achieve financial and personal success. The novel is one of four major works Cain wrote featuring opera as a key component in the plot (\"Serenade\" (1937), \"Career in C Major\" (1938) and \"The Moth\" (1948) are the others.)\n\"Mildred Pierce\" is Cain\u2019s first effort to write a novel in the third-person narrative form, a departure from his earlier works of the 1930s, all of them confessional narratives written in the first-person.\nPlot.\nSet in Glendale, California, in the 1930s, the book is the story of a middle-class housewife, Mildred Pierce, and her attempts to maintain her family's social position during the Great Depression.\nMildred separates from Bert, her unemployed husband, and sets out to support herself and her children. After a difficult search, she finds a job as a waitress but worries that it is beneath her middle class station. More than that, she worries that her ambitious and increasingly pretentious elder daughter, Veda, will think her new job is demeaning. Mildred encounters both success and failure as she opens three successful restaurants, operates a pie-selling business and copes with the death of her younger daughter, Ray. Veda enjoys Mildred's newfound success but increasingly turns ungrateful, demanding more and more from her hard-working mother while openly condemning her and anyone else who must work for a living.\nWhen Mildred discovers Veda's plot to blackmail a wealthy family with a fake pregnancy, she kicks her out of their house. Veda, who has been training to become an opera singer, goes on to great fame, and Mildred's increasing obsession with her daughter leads her to use her former lover, Monty (a man who, like Mildred, lost his family's wealth at the start of the Depression), and his social connections to bring Veda back into her life. Unfortunately, this means buying Monty's family estate and using her earnings to pay for Veda's extravagances. Mildred and Monty marry, but things go sour as her lavish lifestyle and neglect of her businesses impact the company's profits. Creditors line up, led by Wally, a former business associate of Bert's, with whom Mildred had a brief affair upon their separation. With no one to turn to, Mildred confesses to Bert that she has been embezzling money from her company in order to buy Veda's love.\nHaving decided that the only course of action is to ask Veda to contribute some of her now considerable earnings to balance the books\u00a0\u2013 and fearing that Wally might target her daughter's assets if they are exposed\u00a0\u2013 Mildred goes to her room to confront her. There, she finds Veda in bed with Monty, her stepfather. Monty reproaches Mildred for using him to bring Veda back and for her attitude to him as a financial dependent of hers, while Veda affects boredom but joins in to chide Mildred for embarrassing her and taking glory in her success. Mildred snaps, brutally attacking and strangling Veda, who now appears incapable of singing and loses her contract.\nWeeks pass as Mildred moves to Reno, Nevada, to establish residency in order to get a speedy divorce from Monty. Bert visits her. Mildred ultimately is forced to resign from her company, leaving it to Ida, a former assistant. Mildred and Bert, upon the finalization of her divorce, remarry. Veda travels to Reno and apparently reconciles with Mildred, but several months later, Veda reveals that her voice has healed and announces that she is moving to New York City with Monty. The \"reconciliation\" (which had been accompanied by reporters and photographers) was designed to defuse the negative publicity resulting from their affair, and it emerges the apparent loss of her voice was a ploy so that she could renege on her existing contract and be free to take up a more lucrative one offered by another company. As Veda leaves the house, a broken Mildred, encouraged by Bert, eventually says \"to hell\" with her monstrous daughter, and the pair agree to get \"stinko\" (drunk).\nPublication history.\nCain\u2019s desire to write a novel about \u201ca grass widow with two small children to support\u201d had its origins in 1932 from a suggestion by fellow writer James McGuiness, and went through numerous plot and character permutations during the years of the Great Depression.\n\"Mildred Pierce\" is the third of his four novels in which Cain incorporated Grand opera, for which he had trained as a baritone in his youth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"Mildred Pierce\" is a deliberate departure from Cain\u2019s earlier novels, yet it also culminates in his 1930s work. There is no killing, no crime, and no conflicts with the law in the story\u2026the action is not concentrated into a narrow period of time, as in his earlier fiction, but stretches across the Depression...Cain was determined to create a broad social and temporal landscape through third-person reportage, as against the narrowly defined first-person focused on erotic obsessiveness\u2026\u201d\nKate Cummings, mother of Hollywood actress Constance Cummings, became a friend, a lover and a literary advisor to Cain during the writing of \"Mildred Pierce\". Their relationship ended in 1943, in part due to Cain\u2019s heavy drinking. Cummings provided Cain with insights essential to the development of his female protagonists in \"Mildred Pierce\". Cain freely acknowledged that Cummings \u201csaw me through\u201d the writing of his \u201cfirst serious novel.\u201d\nBy November 1941 Cain had completed two-thirds of the novel, but was struggling with adapting to writing in the third-person, his first effort in that narrative form. Cain wrote publisher Blanche Knopf in 1940:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am telling it \u2018straight\u2019 in the third-person, and am having plenty of trouble with it\u2026probably I am not really a novelist. If I can pretend it is somebody else\u2019s story, be sort of a secretary to the yarn, I do all right. When I try to step out on the stage myself, I get red behind the ears and boot it. Well, I shall finish it, wind, weather and tide permitting and we shall see.\nThe novel required four rewrites before Cain completed \"Mildred Pierce\" in the spring of 1941 and sold it to Alfred A. Knopf publishers on a $5000 advance.\nCritical response.\n\"Mildred Pierce\" was released in September 1941 by Alfred A. Knopf publishers, Literary critic Edmund Wilson introduced the novel in an essay for The New Republic entitled \u201cThe Boys in the Back Room.\u201d Biographer Ray Hoopes observed that Wilson\u2019s measured praise \u201cwas the first suggestion by a major American critic that Cain had edged his way into the front ranks of American authors.\u201d\nCain's unsavory characterizations of Mildred and Veda were controversial, but the novel\u2019s plot lacked the sensational devices that many of his fans anticipated. Retail Bookseller predicted that \u201cJames Cain fans are likely to find \"Mildred Pierce\" decidedly mild and tame.\u201d Reviews of \"Mildred Pierce\" were mixed, but on the whole favorable. Never a best-seller, first editions had sold 11,000 hard-cover copies which quickly increased to 14,000 after several weeks. Hundreds of thousands of copies were sold in reprint by 1945.\nTheme.\nThe theme of the novel derives from Cain\u2019s female protagonist, Mildred Pierce, a housewife who \u201cuses men to gain her ends\u201d, in achieving financial success as a restaurateur. Mildred\u2019s daughter Veda, in turn, manipulates her mother to advance her musical ambitions. The elements of \u201cfood, finance and mothering\u201d appear forcefully, as they did in earlier works, especially Cain\u2019s 1937 novel Serenade.\nThe social and economic hardships of the depression era are co-mingled with Cain\u2019s \u201cobsessive concern with power within heterosexual relationships.\u201d Though never a \u201csocial\u201d novelist in the tradition of Theodore Dreiser, Cain\u2019s descriptions of the working class experience are \u201cbitter, incisive and unquestionably authentic.\u201d Critic Paul Skenazy writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For Cain, the most impressive elements of the Depression are not alterations in the job market, or class inequities, but the obsession with money that the economic crisis creates, and the way the economic collapse affects relations between the sexes. Because all of the men in the novel are out of work and financially dependent on women, the power structure of personal relations have been inverted.\nCain signaled his intention to treat the larger social landscape of the period when he chose to write Mildred Pierce in the third-person \u201cas against the narrowly defined first-person focused on erotic obsessiveness\u2026\u201d This point-of-view allowed the author to more convincingly \u201cconvey a sense of a woman\u2019s perspective.\u201d Biographer David Madden observes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cain depicts ways in which certain aspects of the American character and the dream produce grotesque women like Veda\u2026in the depression when everything is suddenly taken from her\u2026Veda alone holds on desperately and arrogantly to all the dreams of affluence\u2026she is the flowering of the seed of corruption in the American Dream...\nAdaptations.\n1945 film adaptation.\nCain was first approached about a film adaptation of \"Mildred Pierce\" by Warner Brothers producer Jerry Wald in 1943. Though Cain declined Wald\u2019s request to write a film treatment, Wald\u2014known as a producer of films appealing to women moviegoers\u2014continued to seek a suitable screenwriter. In the spring of 1944, Warners purchased the film rights for $15,000, \nWhen Cain received Wald\u2019s proposed treatments, the producer had inserted a murder into the story, and according to Cain, had failed to emphasize the dramatic implications \u201cof having a big coloratura soprano in the family.\u201d When filmmaker Michael Curtiz was enlisted to direct \"Mildred Pierce\", Cain urged him to avoid introducing hard-boiled themes and rather emphasize the novel\u2019s \u201cwider implication\u2026 Mildred Pierce is one woman\u2019s struggle against a great social injustice\u2014which is the mother\u2019s necessity to support her children even though husband and community give her not the slightest assistance.\u201d Literary critic Paul Skenazy notes the impact that Cain\u2019s novels had on 1940s filmmaking in America:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; In quick succession - in 1944, 1945 and 1946 - Hollywood produced successful movies from Cain\u2019s \"Double Indemnity\", \"Mildred Pierce\" and \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\". All three films helped break down the censorship barriers constructed by the Hays Office in the 1930s that prevented the portrayal of infidelity and sexual passion on the screen.\nThe film was a box-office success. According to Warner Bros., it earned $3,483,000 in the U.S. and $2,155,000 in other markets.\nOther adaptations.\n1954: An hour-long radio play of the novel was first broadcast by the Lux Radio Theatre on the NBC Radio Network on 14 June 1954 starring Zachary Scott (also in the 1945 film) and Claire Trevor.\n1993: A 90-minute dramatization by John Fletcher for the Radio Noir series for Saturday Night Theatre on BBC Radio 4 was first broadcast on 26 June 1993. Shelley Thompson played the title role with Martin Jarvis as Monte Beragon and Ed Bishop as Bert Pierce.\n2011: Director Todd Haynes filmed a five-part miniseries for television, with Kate Winslet as Mildred, Guy Pearce as Monty Beragon, and Evan Rachel Wood as Veda, in Spring 2010 (with Morgan Turner as the young Veda). Haynes wrote the script with Jon Raymond and served as an executive producer with Pamela Koffler, John Wells, Ilene S. Landress, and Christine Vachon, along with HBO in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\nThe miniseries aired on HBO, starting on March 27, 2011, and ending with a two-part finale on April 10, 2011. Unlike the movie version, it is almost a word-for-word dramatization of the novel, including nearly every scene and using Cain's dialogue. It features period music performed by Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks Orchestra.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A cliffhanger is intended to incentivize the audience to return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma.\nSome serials end with the caveat, \"To Be Continued\" or \"The End?\" In serial films and television series, the following episode sometimes begins with a recap sequence.\nCliffhangers were used as literary devices in several works of the Middle Ages with \"One Thousand and One Nights\" ending on a cliffhanger each night. Cliffhangers appeared as an element of the Victorian era serial novel that emerged in the 1840s, with many associating the form with Charles Dickens, a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction. Following the enormous success of Dickens, by the 1860s cliffhanger endings had become a staple part of the sensation serials.\nHistory.\nCliffhangers were used as literary devices in several works of the Middle Ages. The Arabic literary work \"One Thousand and One Nights\" involves Scheherazade narrating a series of stories to King Shahry\u0101r for 1,001 nights, with each night ending on a cliffhanger in order to save herself from execution. Some medieval Chinese ballads like the \"Liu chih-yuan chu-kung-tiao\" ended each chapter on a cliffhanger to keep the audience in suspense.\nThe Scottish comic magazine \"The Glasgow Looking Glass\", founded by English artist William Heath\",\" pioneered the use of the phrase 'To Be Continued' in its serials in 1825.\nVictorian serials.\nCliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction, pioneered by Charles Dickens. Printed episodically in magazines, Dickens's cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers. Writing in the \"New Yorker\", Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens' \"The Old Curiosity Shop\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn Dickens' instalment format and cliffhangers\u2014first seen with \"The Pickwick Papers\" in 1836\u2014Leslie Howsam in \"The Cambridge Companion to the History of the Book\" (2015) writes, \"It inspired a narrative that Dickens would explore and develop throughout his career. The instalments would typically culminate at a point in the plot that created reader anticipation and thus reader demand.\"\nWith each new instalment widely anticipated with its cliffhanger ending, Dickens' audience was enormous; his instalment format was also much more affordable and accessible to the masses, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than previous. The popularity of Dickens's serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the 1860s. His influence is also seen in television soap operas and film series, with \"The Guardian\" stating \"the DNA of Dickens's busy, episodic storytelling, delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions, is traceable in everything.\"\nEtymology.\nThe term \"cliffhanger\" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of Thomas Hardy's \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" (which was published in \"Tinsley's Magazine\" between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left hanging off a cliff. According to the Random House \"Historical Dictionary of American Slang\", the term's first use in print was in 1937.\nSerial media.\nFilm.\nCliffhangers were especially popular from the 1910s through to the mid-1950s serials when nickelodeons and movie theaters filled the cultural niche later primarily occupied by television. The first film serial designed around the cliffhanger device was 1913's \"The Adventures of Kathlyn\" from Selig Polyscope.\nFilm serials were normally shown in cinemas at weekly intervals, with the cliffhanger resolved in the next instalment by a \"take-out', which extracted the protagonist(s) from the perilous situation in which they had been left. Hoping that audiences would forget some important details of what they had seen a week earlier, filmmakers sometimes resolved the peril by changing some of the events in the recap sequence. The cinema scholar Deborah Allison argues that cliffhanger take-outs can be grouped into three categories, which she calls 'sequential', 'augmented', and 'incompatible'.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sequential take-outs continue the story either by revealing pertinent facts in subsequent shots or by skipping potentially tricky explanations entirely and moving on swiftly. [...] whereas sequential take-outs fill the gaps in our knowledge after we have been shown the moment of fatal peril for the second time, augmented take-outs insert supplementary shots or scenes before the point of crisis. [...] Incompatible take-outs present narrative information that directly conflicts with that provided by the original cliffhanger.\nDuring the 1910s, when Fort Lee, New Jersey was a center of film production, the cliffs facing New York and the Hudson River were frequently used as film locations. The most notable of these films was \"The Perils of Pauline\", a serial which helped popularize the term \"cliffhanger\". In them, the serial would often end suddenly leaving actress Pearl White's Pauline character hanging from a cliff.\nModern usage.\nCliffhangers are often used in television series, especially soap operas and game shows.\nSeveral Australian soap operas, which went off air over summer, such as \"Number 96\", \"The Restless Years\", and \"Prisoner\", ended each year with a major and much publicized catastrophe, such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year's closing episode.\nCliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese manga and anime. In contrast to American superhero comics, Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers, often with each volume or issue. This is particularly the case with sh\u014dnen manga, especially those published by \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\", such as \"Dragon Ball\", \"Shaman King\", \"One Piece\" and the origin show of the \"To be continued\" Internet meme, \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\". \nDuring its original run, \"Doctor Who\" was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger. In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. The programme's cliffhangers sometimes caused controversy, most notably Part Three of \"The Deadly Assassin\" (1976), which was altered for future broadcasts following a complaint from campaigner Mary Whitehouse. Whitehouse objected to the violence of the scene (the Doctor's head is held underwater in an attempt to drown him). She often cited it in interviews as one of the most frightening scenes in \"Doctor Who\", her reasoning being that children would not know if the Doctor survived until the following week and that they would \"have this strong image in their minds\" during all that time. The producer of \"Doctor Who\" at the time, Philip Hinchcliffe, cited the 1950s radio serial \"Journey into Space\" as an influence for its use of cliffhangers. A later serial, \"Dragonfire\" (1987), is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved the Seventh Doctor literally hanging from a cliff, seemingly by choice, which has been described as \"the most ludicrous ever presented in \"Doctor Who\"\". \nFrom 1966 to 1968 and in broadcast syndication, \"Same bat-time, same bat-channel\" encouraged viewers to tune in the next night for 120 episodes of \"Batman\". The next episode quickly resolved the heroes from each supervillain's trap. A few triple episodes had double cliffhangers. The 1969 British caper film \"The Italian Job\", starring Michael Caine and No\u00ebl Coward, ends literally in a cliffhanger, with the villains' coach hanging precariously over a cliff.\nCliffhangers were rare on American primetime television before 1980, as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order. The sitcom \"Soap\" was the first US primetime television programme to utilise the end-of-season cliffhanger, at the end of its first season in 1978. Cliffhangers then went on to become a staple of American primetime soap operas; the phenomenal success of the 1980 \"Who shot J.R.?\" third season-ending cliffhanger of \"Dallas\", and the \"Who Done It\" fourth-season episode that finally solved the mystery, contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on American television. Another notable cliffhanger was the \"Moldavian Massacre\" on \"Dynasty\" in 1985, which fueled speculation throughout the summer months regarding who lived or died when almost all the characters attended a wedding in the country of Moldavia, only to have revolutionaries topple the government and machine-gun the entire wedding party. Other primetime soap operas, such as \"Falcon Crest\" and \"Knots Landing\", also employed dramatic end-of-season cliffhangers on an annual basis. Sitcoms also utilised the cliffhanger device. As well as the aforementioned \"Soap\", the long-running sitcom \"Cheers\" would often incorporate cliffhanger season endings, largely (in its earlier years) to increase interest in the on-and-off relationship between its two lead characters, Sam Malone and Diane Chambers. These cliffhangers did not place the characters in peril of any kind, but rather left their relationship (which was at the core of the show) hanging in the balance.\nCliffhanger endings in films date back to the early 20th century, and were prominently used in the serial films of the 1930s (such as \"Flash Gordon\" and \"Buck Rogers\"), though these tended to be resolved with the next installment the following week. A longer term cliffhanger was employed in the \"Star Wars\" film series, in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) in which Darth Vader makes a shock revelation to Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo's life is left in jeopardy after he is frozen and taken away by a bounty hunter. These plotlines were left unresolved until the next film in the series, which was released three years later. The first two films in the \"Back to the Future\" series end in cliffhangers, with the first displaying the \"to be continued\" title card. The film adaptation of the musical \"Wicked\" is split into two parts, with the first film ending on a cliffhanger with the first act closer \"Defying Gravity\", making the second film \"\" begin at the top of the musical's second act.\nThe two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers/viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful, possibly life-threatening situation, or to feature a sudden shocking revelation. Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role.\nCliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned, in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved. Such was the case with the second season of \"Twin Peaks\", which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist, but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled, resulting in the unresolved ending. The final episodes of soaps \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\" also ended in similar fashion, though all three shows would return years later in some form or other to resolve these storylines. The Australian soap opera \"Return To Eden\" ended in 1986 with a dramatic cliffhanger in anticipation of a second season. However, the network chose not to renew the show and so a hastily filmed five-minute \"conclusion\" was filmed and added on to the end of existing final episode to provide closure. Some shows, however, became known for never being resolved. In addition to the aforementioned \"Blake's 7\", the supernatural series \"Angel\", the original 1984 series \"V\" and its 2009 remake, all ended with unresolved cliffhangers. On occasion, TV series are given the opportunity to resolve their end-of-series cliffhangers at a later date; examples include the 1999\u20132003 series, \"Farscape\", which was cancelled after a cliffhanger ending, but which was able to resolve it in a later follow-up miniseries, \"\"; and the aforementioned \"Twin Peaks\" 1991 cliffhanger, which was resolved 26 years later when a sequel to the series (considered a third season) aired in 2017.\nThe cliffhanger has become a genre staple (especially in comics, due to the multi-part storylines becoming the norm instead of self-contained stories) to such a degree, in fact, that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved, or even referenced, when the next episode is shown, variously because the writer did not feel it was \"a strong enough opener\", or simply \"couldn't be bothered\". The heavily serialized television drama \"True Blood\" has become notorious for cliffhangers. Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers, but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment, much like the primetime soap operas of the 1980s and 90s.\nCommercial breaks can be a nuisance to script writers because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break. Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory d\u00e9nouement, but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out.\nSometimes a film, book, or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second, evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance (becoming the villain of the next film). Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel.\nPeter H\u00f8eg's novel \"Smilla's Sense of Snow\" ends with a deliberate cliffhanger, with the protagonist and main villain involved in a life-and-death chase on the arctic ice off Greenland \u2013 and in this case, the author has no intention of ever writing a sequel, the ambiguous ending being part and parcel of the basic ideas permeating the book's plot. Similarly, Michael Flynn's science fiction novelette \"The Forest of Time\" ends with a deliberate and permanent cliffhanger: readers are not to be ever told where the protagonist ended up in his wandering the \"forest\" of alternate history timelines and whether he ever got back to his home and his beloved, nor whether the war which takes a large part of the plot ended in victory for the protagonists or the antagonists.\nGeorge Cukor, when adapting in 1972 Graham Greene's \"Travels with My Aunt\", deliberately introduced a cliffhanger missing from the original. While Greene's book ended with the protagonists definitely choosing the adventurous and rather shady life of smugglers in Paraguay and closing off other options for their future, at the conclusion of the Cukor film a character is seen tossing a coin whose fall would determine their next move, and the film ends on a freeze frame shot as the characters await the fall of the coin.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
