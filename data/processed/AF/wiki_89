He was named after the now beatified Reginald of Orleans, O.P. His maternal grandparents were George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence; thus he was a great-nephew of kings Edward IV and Richard III and a great-grandson of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick.\nAccounts vary as to where Pole received his early education: either Sheen Priory, Christchurch or Canterbury. Shortly thereafter, he matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1512. At Oxford he was taught by William Latimer, his principal tutor, and Thomas Linacre, who taught him at some point between 1518 and 1520. In 1512, Henry VIII had paid him a pension of \u00a312, renewed the following year; intended to go towards his education. Pole graduated with a BA degree on 27 June 1515. In February 1518, King Henry granted him the deanery of Wimborne Minster, Dorset. He went on to be Prebendary of Salisbury, and Dean of Exeter in 1527. On 19 March 1518 he was appointed prebend of \"Ruscombe Southbury, Salisbury\", only to exchange that on 10 April 1519 for \"Yetminster secunda\". He was also a canon in York, and had several other livings, albeit not yet ordained a priest. Assisted by Bishop Edward Foxe, he represented Henry VIII in Paris in 1529, probing general opinion among theologians of the Sorbonne on the annulment of Henry's marriage with Catherine of Aragon.\nIn 1521, with a \u00a3100 stipend from King Henry VIII, Pole went to the University of Padua. It was here that he met leading Renaissance figures, including Pietro Bembo, Gianmatteo Giberti (formerly Pope Leo X's datary and chief minister), Jacopo Sadoleto, Gianpietro Carafa (the future Pope Paul IV), Rodolfo Pio, Otto Truchsess, Stanislaus Hosius, Cristoforo Madruzzo, Giovanni Morone, Pier Paolo Vergerio the younger, Peter Martyr Vermigli and Vettor Soranzo. The last three were eventually to be condemned as heretics by the Catholic Church. As a widely known Protestant theologian, Vermigli contributed significantly to the Reformation in Pole's native England.\nPole's studies in Padua were partly financed by his election as a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. More than half of the cost was met by Henry VIII himself, on 14 February 1523. This allowed him to study abroad for three years.\nWhile in Padua, Reginald's brother, Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, presented to him the living of South Harting, Sussex on 10 April 1526. Three months later, Pole returned home, arriving from France escorted by Thomas Lupset. He was appointed prebend of Knaresborough in York Minster on 22 April 1527. On 25 July 1527, Pole was presented a canonry in Exeter Cathedral, to be declared Dean just four days later. Pole was sent to Paris in October 1529, but returned home in the summer of 1530. For some of his time in England he lived in John Colet's former house at Sheen.\nPole and Henry VIII.\nPole had most probably arrived back in England in 1527, but whatever political influence he had acquired was not documented until November 1528. By the following October, his being sent to Paris had been expressly to liberate from the university doctors an agreeable opinion on Henry VIII\u2019s annulment. It is possible that Pole started learning Hebrew from Robert Wakefield after he returned home from France, which would suggest that Henry might have wanted to deploy Pole in the annulment project. Henry offered him the Archbishopric of York or the Diocese of Winchester if he would support the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. It is likely that in May or June 1531 Pole furnished Henry with an analysis of the political difficulties with regard to a divorce, particularly the dangers this would bring to the succession. Pole withheld his support and went into self-imposed exile in France and Italy in 1532, where he continued his studies in Padua and Paris. After his return, he held the benefice of vicar of Piddletown, Dorset, between 20 December 1532 and sometime around January 1536.\nIn May 1536, Reginald Pole finally and decisively broke with the King. Five years earlier, he had warned of the dangers of the Boleyn marriage; he had returned to Padua in 1532 and received a last English benefice that December. Eustace Chapuys, the imperial ambassador to England, had suggested to Emperor Charles V that Pole marry Henry's daughter Mary and combine their dynastic claims; Chapuys also communicated with Reginald through his brother Geoffrey. At this time Pole was not definitively in Holy Orders.\nThe final break between Pole and Henry followed upon Thomas Cromwell, Cuthbert Tunstall, Thomas Starkey and others addressing questions to Pole on behalf of Henry. He answered by sending the King a copy of his published treatise \"Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione\", which, besides being a theological reply to the questions, was a strong denunciation of the King's policies, refuting Henry's position on marrying his brother Arthur's widow and denying the royal supremacy. Pole also urged the princes of Europe to depose Henry immediately. Henry wrote to Pole's mother, the Countess of Salisbury, who in turn sent her son a letter reproving him for his \"folly\".\nCardinal Pole.\nOn 22 December 1536, Pole, already a deacon, was created a cardinal over Pole's own objections. He was the fourth of the five English cardinals of the first half of the sixteenth century. He also became papal legate to England in February 1536/1537. Pope Paul III put him in charge of organising assistance for the Pilgrimage of Grace (and related movements), an effort to organise a march on London to demand Henry replace his \u2018reformist\u2019 advisers with more traditional, Catholic minds; neither Francis I of France nor the Emperor supported this effort, and the English government tried to have Pole assassinated. In 1539, Pole was sent to the Emperor to organise an embargo against England\u00a0\u2013 the sort of countermeasure he had himself warned Henry was possible.\nThe King, with Pole himself out of his reach, took revenge on Pole's family for engaging in treason by word against the King. This later became known as the Exeter Conspiracy. The leading members were arrested, and all their properties seized. This destroyed the Pole family. Sir Geoffrey Pole was arrested in August 1538; he had been corresponding with Reginald. The investigation of Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter (Henry VIII's first cousin and the Countess of Salisbury's first cousin once removed) had turned up his name. Sir Geoffrey appealed to Thomas Cromwell, who had him arrested and interrogated. Under interrogation, Sir Geoffrey admitted that Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, and Exeter had both been parties to his correspondence with Reginald. Montagu, Exeter, and Lady Salisbury were arrested in November 1538, together with Henry Pole and other family members, on charges of treason. This was despite Cromwell having previously written that they had \"little offended save that he [Reginald Pole] is of their kin\". They were committed to the Tower of London and, apart from Geoffrey Pole, they were all eventually executed.\nIn January 1539, Sir Geoffrey was pardoned. Montagu and Exeter were tried and executed for treason. Reginald Pole was attainted \"in absentia\". In May 1539, Montagu, Exeter, Lady Salisbury, and others were also attainted, as her father had been; this meant that they lost their lands \u2013 mostly in the South of England, conveniently located (alleged the crown) to assist any invasion \u2013 and titles. Those still alive in the Tower were also sentenced to death, and so could be executed at the King's will. As part of the evidence given in support of the Bill of Attainder, Cromwell produced a tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, purported to show Lady Salisbury's support of traditional Catholicism. This, supposedly, came to light six months after her house and effects had already been searched when she was arrested. It is likely to have been planted there.\nMargaret Pole was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years under severe conditions; she, her grandson (Montagu's son), and Exeter's son were held together on orders of the King. In 1540, Cromwell himself fell from favour and was himself attainted and executed. Margaret was finally executed in 1541, protesting her innocence until the last \u2013 a highly publicised case considered a grave miscarriage of justice both at the time and later. Her execution was gruesome, botched by an inexperienced executioner, who delivered nearly a dozen blows before she was finally killed. Pole is known to have said that he would \"never fear to call himself the son of a martyr\". Some 350 years later, in 1886, Margaret was beatified by Pope Leo XIII. Aside from the hostile treatise \"Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione\", another contribution fuelling King Henry's brutality towards the Pole family might have been that Pole's mother, Margaret, was one of the last surviving members of the House of Plantagenet. Under some circumstances, that line of descent could have made Reginald \u2013 until he definitely entered the clergy \u2013 a possible contender for the throne itself.\nIn 1542 Reginald Pole was appointed as one of the three papal legates to preside over the Council of Trent. In the 1549\u20131550 papal conclave which followed the death of Pope Paul III in 1549, Pole, at one point, had 26 out of the 28 votes he needed to become pope himself. His personal belief in justification by faith alone over works had caused him problems at Trent and accusations of heretical crypto-Lutheranism at the conclave. Thomas Hoby, visiting Rome so as to be present in the city during the conclave, recorded that Pole failed to be elected \"by the Cardinall of Ferrara his meanes the voice of manie cardinalls of the French partie, persuading them that Cardinall Pole was both Imperiall and also a verie Lutheran\".\nLater years.\nThe death of Edward VI on 6 July 1553 and the accession of Mary I to the throne of England hastened Pole's return from exile, as a papal legate to England (which he remained until 1557) with a view to receiving the kingdom back into the Catholic fold. However, Queen Mary I and Emperor Charles V delayed his arrival in the country until 20 November 1554, due to concerns that Pole might oppose Mary's forthcoming marriage to Charles's son, Philip of Spain. It was only after the marriage was safely out of the way, that the English parliament finally set about repealing his attainder on November 22, 1554. Pole opened his papal commission and presented his legatine credentials before Philip &amp; Mary and the assembled members of Parliament at the Palace of Whitehall on November 27, 1554, delivering a notable oration before them. Among the dignitaries in attendance was Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor of England, the most prominent Catholic minister in England, who would steer the restoration of Catholicism through parliament in January 1555.\nAs papal legate, Pole negotiated a papal dispensation allowing the new owners of confiscated former monastic lands to retain these. In return for this concession, Parliament then enabled the Revival of the Heresy Acts in January 1555. This revived former measures against heresy: the letters patent of 1382 of Richard II, the Suppression of Heresy Act 1400 (2 Hen. 4. c. 15) of Henry IV, and the Suppression of Heresy Act 1414 (2 Hen. 5. Stat. 1. c. 7) of Henry V. All of these had been repealed under Henry VIII and Edward VI. On 13 November 1555, Thomas Cranmer was officially deprived of the See of Canterbury. The Pope promoted Pole to the rank of cardinal-priest and made him administrator of the See of Canterbury on 11 December 1555.\nPole was finally ordained a priest on 20 March 1556 and consecrated a bishop two days later, becoming archbishop of Canterbury. an office he would hold until his death. In 1555 and 1555/1556 respectively he also became chancellor of both Oxford and Cambridge universities. As well as his religious duties, he was in effect the Queen's chief minister and adviser. Many former enemies, including Cranmer, signed recantations affirming their religious belief in transubstantiation and papal supremacy. Despite this, which should have absolved them under Mary's own Revival of the Heresy Acts, the Queen could not forget their responsibility for the annulment of her mother's marriage.\nIn 1555, Queen Mary began permitting the burning of Protestants for heresy, and some 220 men and 60 women were executed before her death in 1558. In the view of some historians, these Marian persecutions contributed to the ultimate victory of the English Reformation, though Pole's involvement in these heresy trials is disputed. Pole was in failing health during the worst period of persecution, and there is some evidence that he favoured a more lenient approach: \"Three condemned heretics from Bonner's diocese were pardoned on an appeal to him; he merely enjoined a penance and gave them absolution.\" As the reign wore on, an increasing number of people turned against Mary and her government, and some people who had been indifferent to the English Reformation began turning against Catholicism. Writings such as John Foxe's 1568 \"Book of Martyrs\", which emphasised the sufferings of the reformers under Mary, helped shape popular opinion against Catholicism in England for generations.\nDespite being a lifelong devout Catholic, Pole had a long-running dispute with Pope Paul IV, dating from before the latter's election as Pope. Elected in 1555, Paul IV had a distaste for Catholic humanism and men like Pole who pushed a softer version of Catholicism to win over Protestants, as well as being fiercely anti-Spanish and against Mary's marriage to Philip II of Spain and heavily against Pole's support for it. Because of this disagreement Paul first cancelled Pole's legatine authority, and then sought to recall Pole to Rome to face investigation for heresy in his early writings. Mary refused to send Pole to Rome, yet accepted his suspension from office. In the will of Sir Robert Acton dated 24 September 1558 he is named as one of the Executors, despite the fact that Sir Robert expressed himself in terms consistent with his dying in the Protestant faith.\nPole died in London, during an influenza epidemic, on 17 November 1558, at about 7:00\u00a0pm, nearly 12 hours after Queen Mary's death. He was buried on the north side of the Corona at Canterbury Cathedral.\nAuthor.\nPole was the author of \"De Concilio\", of a treatise on the authority of the pope and of a set of measures introduced by him to restore Catholic practice in England. He was also the author of many important letters, full of interest for the history of the time, edited by Angelo Maria Quirini.\nPole is known for his strong condemnation of Machiavelli's book \"The Prince\", which he read in Italy, and on which he commented: \"I found this type of book to be written by an enemy of the human race. It explains every means whereby religion, justice and any inclination toward virtue could be destroyed\".\nIn popular culture.\n\"Cardinal Pole\" is an 1863 novel by William Harrison Ainsworth. Cardinal Pole is a major character in the historical novels \"The Time Before You Die\" by Lucy Beckett, \"The Courier's Tale\" by Peter Walker and \"The Trusted Servant\" by Alison Macleod, and features in Hilary Mantel's novel \"The Mirror &amp; the Light\", the third and last of her novels on the life of Thomas Cromwell.\nIn Season 3 of Showtime's series \"The Tudors\", Cardinal Pole is portrayed by Canadian actor Mark Hildreth. In the mini-series \"The Virgin Queen\" he is played by Michael Feast; he is last seen leading Mary's servants out of Greenwich Palace as Elizabeth I arrives as queen.\nReginald Pole is a major character in \"Queen of Martyrs: The Story of Mary I\" by Samantha Wilcoxson.\nReginald Pole, along with his brothers, sister, and mother, are the central family in Philippa Gregory's historical novel \"The King's Curse\".\nCardinal Reginald Pole is a major supporting character in Rosamund Gravelle's play \"Three Queens\", with the role first played by Les Kenny-Green.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is typically combined with a given name to form the full name of a person, although several given names and surnames are possible in the full name. In modern times most surnames are hereditary, although in most countries a person has a right to change their name.\nDepending on culture, the surname may be placed either at the start of a person's name, or at the end. The number of surnames given to an individual also varies: in most cases it is just one, but in Portuguese-speaking countries and many Spanish-speaking countries, two surnames (one inherited from the mother and another from the father) are used for legal purposes. Depending on culture, not all members of a family unit are required to have identical surnames. In some countries, surnames are modified depending on gender and family membership status of a person. Compound surnames can be composed of separate names.\nThe use of names has been documented in even the oldest historical records. Examples of surnames are documented in the 11th century by the barons in England. English surnames began to be formed with reference to a certain aspect of that individual, such as their trade, father's name, location of birth, or physical features, and were not necessarily inherited. By 1400 most English families, and those from Lowland Scotland, had adopted the use of hereditary surnames.\nThe study of proper names (in family names, personal names, or places) is called onomastics.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nWhile the use of given names to identify individuals is attested in the oldest historical records, the advent of surnames is relatively recent. Many cultures have used and continue to use additional descriptive terms in identifying individuals. These terms may indicate personal attributes, location of origin, occupation, parentage, patronage, adoption, or clan affiliation.\nIn China, according to legend, family names started with Emperor Fu Xi in 2000 BC. His administration standardised the naming system to facilitate census-taking, and the use of census information. Originally, Chinese surnames were derived matrilineally, although by the time of the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BC) they had become patrilineal. Chinese women do not change their names upon marriage. In China, surnames have been the norm since at least the 2nd century BC.\nIn the early Islamic period (640\u2013900 AD) the use of patronymics is well attested. The famous scholar Rhazes (c.\u2009865\u2013925 AD) is referred to as \"al-Razi\" (lit. the one from Ray) due to his origins from the city of Ray, Iran. In the Levant, surnames were in use as early as the High Middle Ages and it was common for people to derive their surname from a distant ancestor, and historically the surname would be often preceded with 'ibn' or 'son of'. Arab family names often denote either one's tribe, profession, a famous ancestor, or the place of origin; but they were not universal. For example, Hunayn ibn Ishaq (fl. 850 AD) was known by the nisbah \"al-'Ibadi\", a federation of Arab Christian tribes that lived in Mesopotamia prior to the advent of Islam.\nIn Ancient Greece, as far back as the Archaic Period clan names and patronymics (\"son of\") were also common, as in Aristides as \u039b\u1fe1\u03c3\u1fd0\u03bc\u1fb0\u0301\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5 \u2013 a genitive singular form meaning son of Lysimachus. For example, Alexander the Great was known as \"Heracleides\", as a supposed descendant of Heracles, and by the dynastic name \"Karanos\"/\"Caranus\", which referred to the founder of the dynasty to which he belonged. These patronymics are already attested for many characters in the works of Homer. At other times formal identification commonly included the place of origin.\nOver the course of the Roman Republic and the later Empire, naming conventions went through multiple changes. (\"See Roman naming conventions.\") The \"nomen\", the name of the gens (tribe) inherited patrilineally, is thought to have already been in use by 650 BC. The \"nomen\" was to identify group kinship, while the \"praenomen\" (forename; plural \"praenomina\") was used to distinguish individuals within the group. Female \"praenomina\" were less common, as women had reduced public influence, and were commonly known by the feminine form of the \"nomen\" alone.\nMedieval era and beyond.\nLater with the gradual influence of Greek and Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional \"cognomina\", but eventually people reverted to single names. By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the Eastern Roman Empire. In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent. They would not significantly reappear again in Eastern Roman society until the 10th century, apparently influenced by the familial affiliations of the Armenian military aristocracy. The practice of using family names spread through the Eastern Roman Empire, however it was not until the 11th century that surnames came to be used in West Europe.\nMedieval Spain used a patronymic system. For example, \u00c1lvaro, a son of Rodrigo, would be named \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez. His son, Juan, would not be named Juan Rodr\u00edguez, but Juan \u00c1lvarez. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names, and they are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world today. Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. Delgado (\"thin\") and Moreno (\"dark\"); geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. Alem\u00e1n (\"German\"); and occupations, e.g. Molinero (\"miller\"), Zapatero (\"shoe-maker\") and Guerrero (\"warrior\"), although occupational names are much more often found in a shortened form referring to the trade itself, e.g. Molina (\"mill\"), Guerra (\"war\"), or Zapata (archaic form of \"zapato\", \"shoe\").\nIn England the introduction of family names is generally attributed to the preparation of the Domesday Book in 1086, following the Norman Conquest. Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. By the 14th century, most English and most Scottish people used surnames and in Wales following unification under Henry VIII in 1536.\nA four-year study led by the University of the West of England, which concluded in 2016, analysed sources dating from the 11th to the 19th century to explain the origins of the surnames in the British Isles. The study found that over 90% of the 45,602 surnames in the dictionary are native to Britain and Ireland, with the most common in the UK being Smith, Jones, Williams, Brown, Taylor, Davies, and Wilson. The findings have been published in the \"Oxford English Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland\", with project leader Richard Coates calling the study \"more detailed and accurate\" than those before. He elaborated on the origins: \"Some surnames have origins that are occupational \u2013 obvious examples are Smith and Baker. Other names can be linked to a place, for example, Hill or Green, which relates to a village green. Surnames that are 'patronymic' are those which originally enshrined the father's name \u2013 such as Jackson, or Jenkinson. There are also names where the origin describes the original bearer such as Brown, Short, or Thin \u2013 though Short may in fact be an ironic 'nickname' surname for a tall person.\"\nIn the modern era, governments have enacted laws to require people to adopt surnames. This served the purpose of uniquely identifying subjects for taxation purposes or for inheritance. In the late Middle Ages in England, mandatory surnames were resisted as they were associated with taxes.\nModern era.\nDuring the modern era many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600. The Napoleonic Code, adopted in various parts of Europe, stipulated that people should be known by both their given name(s) and a family name that would not change across generations. Other notable examples include the Netherlands (1795\u20131811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). The structure of the Japanese name was formalized by the government as \"family name\" + \"given name\" in 1868. \nIn Breslau Prussia enacted the Hoym Ordinance in 1790, mandating the adoption of Jewish surnames. Napoleon also insisted on Jews adopting fixed names in a decree issued in 1808.\nNames can sometimes be changed to protect individual privacy (such as in witness protection), or in cases where groups of people are escaping persecution. After arriving in the United States, European Jews who fled Nazi persecution sometimes anglicized their surnames to avoid discrimination. Governments can also forcibly change people's names, as when the National Socialist government of Germany assigned German names to European people in the territories they conquered. In the 1980s, the People's Republic of Bulgaria forcibly changed the first and last names of its Turkish citizens to Bulgarian names.\nOrigins of particular surnames.\nPatronymic and matronymic surnames.\nThese are the oldest and most common type of surname. They may be a first name such as \"Wilhelm\", a patronymic such as \"Andersen\", a matronymic such as \"Beaton\", or a clan name such as \"O'Brien\". Multiple surnames may be derived from a single given name: e.g. there are thought to be over 90 Italian surnames based on the given name \"Giovanni\". \n\"Kil-\" refers to a church or monastery (see Kilbride and Kilpatrick).\nCognominal surnames.\nThis is the broadest class of surnames, originating from nicknames, encompassing many types of origin. These include names based on appearance such as \"Schwartzkopf\", \"Short\", and possibly \"Caesar\", and names based on temperament and personality such as \"Daft\", \"Gutman\", and \"Maiden\", which, according to a number of sources, was an English nickname meaning \"effeminate\".\nA group of nicknames look like occupational ones: King, Bishop, Abbot, Sheriff, Knight, etc. but it is rather unlikely that a person with surname King was a king or descended from a king. Bernard Deacon suggests that the first nickname/surname bearer may have acted like a king or bishop, or was as corpulent as a bishop. etc.\nA considerable group of surname-producing nicknames may be found among ethnonymic surnames.\nOrnamental/artificial surnames.\nOrnamental surnames (also known as artificial surnames) are not specific to any attribute (place, parentage, occupation, caste) of the first person to acquire the name. They were generally acquired later in history and generally when those without surnames needed them. In 1526, King Frederik I of Denmark-Norway ordered that noble families must take up fixed surnames, and many of them took as their name some element of their coat of arms; for example, the Rosenkrantz (\"rose wreath\") family took their surname from a wreath of roses forming the torse of their arms, and the Gyldenstierne (\"golden star\") family took theirs from a 7-pointed gold star on their shield. Subsequently, many middle-class Scandinavian families desired names similar to those of the nobles and adopted \"ornamental\" surnames as well.\nMost other naming traditions refer to them as \"acquired\". They might be given to people newly immigrated, conquered, or converted, as well as those with unknown parentage, formerly enslaved, or from parentage without a surname tradition.\nOrnamental surnames are more common in communities that adopted (or were forced to adopt) surnames in the 18th and 19th centuries. They occur commonly in Scandinavia, and among Sinti and Romani and Eastern Ashkenazi Jews in Germany and Austria.\nAcquired/assigned surnames.\nDuring the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade many Africans were given new names by their masters. Many of the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery (\"i.e.\" slave name). Some freed slaves later created family names themselves.\nAnother category of acquired names is foundlings' names. Historically, children born to unwed parents or extremely poor parents would be abandoned in a public place or anonymously placed in a foundling wheel. Such abandoned children might be claimed and named by religious figures, the community leaders, or adoptive parents. Some such children were given surnames that reflected their condition, like (Italian) Esposito, Innocenti, Della Casagrande, Trovato, Abbandonata, or (Dutch) Vondeling, Verlaeten, Bijstand. Other children were named for the street/place they were found (Union, Liquorpond (street), di Palermo, Baan, Bijdam, van den Eyngel (shop name), van der Stoep, von Trapp), the date they were found (Monday, Septembre, Spring, di Gennaio), or festival/feast day they found or christened (Easter, SanJos\u00e9). Some foundlings were given the name of whoever found them.\nOccupational surnames.\nOccupational names include \"Smith\", Taylor (Tailor), \"Miller\", \"Farmer\", \"Thatcher\", \"Shepherd\", \"Potter\", and so on, and analogous names in many other languages; see, for example, . There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take a modified version of their employer's occupation or first name as their last name, adding the letter \"s\" to the word, although this formation could also be a patronymic. For instance, the surname \"Vickers\" is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar, while \"Roberts\" could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval mystery plays. The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include \"King\", \"Lord\" and \"Virgin\". \"A Dictionary of English Surnames\" says that \"surnames of office, such as Abbot, Bishop, Cardinal and King, are often nicknames\". The original meaning of names based on medieval occupations may no longer be obvious in modern English.\nToponymic surnames.\nLocation (toponymic, habitation) names derive from the inhabited location associated with the person given that name. Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds, or cottages. One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement. Examples of Old English elements are frequently found in the second element of habitational names. The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different periods, different locations, or with being used with certain other elements. For example, the Old English element \"t\u016bn\" may have originally meant \"enclosure\" in one name, but can have meant \"farmstead\", \"village\", \"manor\", or \"estate\" in other names.\nLocation names, or habitation names, may be as generic as \"Monte\" (Portuguese for \"mountain\"), \"G\u00f3rski\" (Polish for \"hill\"), or \"Pitt\" (variant of \"pit\"), but may also refer to specific locations. \"Washington\", for instance, is thought to mean \"the homestead of the family of Wassa\", while \"Lucci\" means \"resident of Lucca\". Although some surnames, such as \"London\", \"Lisboa\", or \"Bia\u0142ystok\" are derived from large cities, more people reflect the names of smaller communities, as in \u00d3 Creachmhaoil, derived from a village in County Galway. This is thought to be due to the tendency in Europe during the Middle Ages for migration to chiefly be from smaller communities to the cities and the need for new arrivals to choose a defining surname.\nIn Portuguese-speaking countries, it is uncommon, but not unprecedented, to find surnames derived from names of countries, such as Portugal, Fran\u00e7a, Brasil, Holanda. Surnames derived from country names are also found in English, such as \"England\", \"Wales\", \"Spain\".\nSome Japanese surnames derive from geographical features; for example, Ishikawa (\u77f3\u5ddd) means \"stone river\" (and is also the name of one of Japan's prefectures), Yamamoto (\u5c71\u672c) means \"the base of the mountain\", and Inoue (\u4e95\u4e0a) means \"above the well\".\nArabic names sometimes contain surnames that denote the city of origin. For example, in cases of Saddam Hussein al Tikriti, meaning Saddam Hussein originated from Tikrit, a city in Iraq. This component of the name is called a \"nisbah\".\nOther.\nThe meanings of some names are unknown or unclear. The most common European name in this category may be the Irish name Ryan, which means 'little king' in Irish. Also, Celtic origin of the name Arthur, meaning 'bear'. Other surnames may have arisen from more than one source: the name De Luca, for instance, likely arose either in or near Lucania or in the family of someone named Lucas or Lucius; in some instances, however, the name may have arisen from Lucca, with the spelling and pronunciation changing over time and with emigration. The same name may appear in different cultures by coincidence or romanization; the surname Lee is used in English culture, but is also a romanization of the Chinese surname \"Li\". In the Russian Empire, illegitimate children were sometimes given artificial surnames rather than the surnames of their adoptive parents.\nOrder of names.\nIn many cultures (particularly in European and European-influenced cultures in the Americas, Oceania, etc., as well as West Asia/North Africa, South Asia, and most Sub-Saharan African cultures), the surname or family name (\"last name\") is placed after the personal, forename (in Europe) or given name (\"first name\"). In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the Eastern naming order because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the East Asian cultural sphere, specifically, Greater China, Korea (both North and South), Japan, and Vietnam. This is also the case in Cambodia and among the Hmong of Laos and Thailand. The Telugu people of south India also place surname before personal name, and historically the Tamil people did the same. There are some parts of Europe, in particular Hungary, where the surname is placed before the personal name. In Dalarna and nearby parts of Sweden the old naming system is name of the family farm, personal name, patronymic; the name of the family farm takes the function of a family name. \nSince given name is normally written first in European societies, the term first name is commonly used for the given name, while in Japan (with vertical writing) the given name may be referred to as \"lower name\" ().\nWhen people from areas using Eastern naming order write their personal name in the Latin alphabet, it is common to reverse the order of the given and family names for the convenience of Westerners, so that they know which name is the family name for official/formal purposes. Reversing the order of names for the same reason is also customary for the Mordvins and the Hungarians, but other Uralic peoples traditionally did not have surnames, perhaps because of the clan structure of their societies. The Samis, depending on the circumstances of their names, either saw no change or did see a transformation of their name. For example: Sire in some cases became Siri, and H\u00e6tta J\u00e1hko\u0161 \u00c1sslat became Aslak Jacobsen H\u00e6tta \u2013 as was the norm. Recently, integration into the EU and increased communications with foreigners prompted many Samis to reverse the order of their full name to given name followed by surname, to avoid their given name being mistaken for and used as a surname.\nIndian surnames may often denote village, profession or caste and are invariably mentioned along with the personal or first names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Telugu-speaking families in south India, surname is placed before the personal or first name and in most cases it is only shown as an initial (for example 'S.' for Suryapeth).\nIn English and other languages, although the usual order of names is \"first middle last\", for the purpose of cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to \"last, first middle,\" with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name. In France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Latin America, administrative usage is to put the surname before the first on official documents.\nGender-specific versions of surname.\nIn most Balto-Slavic languages (such as Latvian, Lithuanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Polish, Slovak, Czech, etc.) as well as in Greek, Irish, Icelandic, and Azerbaijani, some surnames change form depending on the gender of the bearer.\nIn Slavic languages, substantivized adjective surnames have commonly symmetrical adjective variants for males and females (/ in Polish, / in Czech or Slovak, etc.). In the case of nominative and quasi-nominative surnames, the female variant is derived from the male variant by a possessive suffix (Nov\u00e1k/Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, Hromada/Hromadov\u00e1). In Czech and Slovak, the pure possessive would be , , but the surname evolved to a more adjectivized form , , to suppress the historical possessivity. Some rare types of surnames are universal and gender-neutral: examples in Czech are , , , . These are the archaic form of the possessive, related to the plural name of the family. Such rare surnames are also often used for transgender persons during transition because most common surnames are gender-specific.\nThe informal dialectal female form in Polish and Czech dialects was also (, ). With the exception of the / suffix, most feminine forms of surnames are seldom observed in Polish.\nGenerally, inflected languages use names and surnames as living words, not as static identifiers. Thus, the pair or the family can be named by a plural form which can differ from the singular male and female form. For instance, when the male form is Nov\u00e1k and the female form Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, the family name is in Czech and in Slovak. When the male form is Hrub\u00fd and the female form is Hrub\u00e1, the plural family name is Hrub\u00ed (or \"rodina Hrub\u00fdch\").\nIn Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter or wife, she will likely be named Papadopoulou, the genitive form, as if the daughter/wife is \"of\" a man named Papadopoulos. Likewise, the surnames of daughters and wives of males with surnames ending in -as will end in -a, and those of daughters and wives of males with the -is suffix will have the -i suffix.\nLatvian, like Lithuanian, uses strictly feminized surnames for women, even in the case of foreign names. The function of the suffix is purely grammatical. Male surnames ending or need not be modified for women. Exceptions are:\nIn Iceland, surnames have a gender-specific suffix (-d\u00f3ttir = daughter, -son = son). This was also the case in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, until they were abolished by law in 1856, 1923, and 1966 respectively.\nFinnish used gender-specific suffixes up to 1929 when the Marriage Act forced women to use the husband's form of the surname. In 1985, this clause was removed from the act.\nUntil at least 1850, women's surnames were suffixed with an -in in Tyrol.\nIndication of family membership status.\nSome Slavic cultures originally distinguished the surnames of married and unmarried women by different suffixes, but this distinction is no longer widely observed. Some Czech dialects (Southwest-Bohemian) use the form \"\" as informal for both genders. In the culture of the Sorbs (a.k.a. Wends or Lusatians), Sorbian used different female forms for unmarried daughters (, , , ), and for wives (, , , ). In Polish, typical surnames for unmarried women ended , , or , while the surnames of married women used the possessive suffixes or . In Serbia, unmarried women's surnames ended in -eva, while married women's surnames ended in -ka. In Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkien\u0117 and his unmarried daughter will be named Vilkait\u0117. Male surnames have suffixes -as, -is, -ius, or -us, unmarried girl surnames ait\u0117, -yt\u0117, -i\u016bt\u0117 or -ut\u0117, wife surnames -ien\u0117. These suffixes are also used for foreign names, exclusively for grammar; Welby, the surname of a former Archbishop of Canterbury for example, becomes in Lithuanian, while his wife is \"Velbien\u0117\", and his unmarried daughter, \"Velbait\u0117\".\nMany surnames include prefixes that may or may not be separated by a space or punctuation from the main part of the surname. These are usually not considered true compound names, rather single surnames are made up of more than one word. These prefixes often give hints about the type or origin of the surname (patronymic, toponymic, notable lineage) and include words that mean from [a place or lineage], and son of/daughter of/child of.\nThe common Celtic prefixes \" or \" (descendant of) and \" or \" (son of) can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, yielding \" or \" as well as the anglicized \" and \" or \"\". Other Irish prefixes include , (daughter of the son of), , and (wife of the son of).\nA surname with the prefix \"Fitz\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, as in \"Fitz William\", as well as \"FitzWilliam\" or \"Fitzwilliam\" (like, for example, Robert FitzRoy). \"Fitz\" comes from French () thus making these surnames a form of patronymic.\nSurname law.\nA family name is typically a part of a person's personal name and, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from at least one of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, but each culture has its own rules as to how the names are formed, passed, and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is far from universal (see \u00a7History below). In many cultures, it is common for people to have one name or mononym, with some cultures not using family names. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a newborn child, the adoption of a common family name on marriage, the renunciation of a family name, and the changing of a family name.\nSurname laws vary around the world. Traditionally in many European countries for the past few hundred years, it was the custom or the law for a woman, upon marriage, to use her husband's surname and for any children born to bear the father's surname. If a child's paternity was not known, or if the putative father denied paternity, the newborn child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom or law in many countries. The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father. In recent years, there has been a trend towards equality of treatment in relation to family names, with women being not automatically required, expected or, in some places, even forbidden, to take the husband's surname on marriage, with the children not automatically being given the father's surname. In this article, both family name and surname mean the patrilineal surname, which is handed down from or inherited from the father, unless it is explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, the term \"maternal surname\" means the \"patrilineal\" surname that one's mother inherited from either or both of her parents. For a discussion of \"matrilineal\" ('mother-line') surnames, passing from mothers to daughters, see matrilineal surname.\nSurname of women.\nKing Henry VIII of England (reigned 1509\u20131547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father. In England and cultures derived from there, there has long been a tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her birth name to her husband's family name. (See Maiden and married names.)\nIn the Middle Ages, when a man from a lower-status family married an only daughter from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife's family name. In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man's changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that the name of the testator continued.\nThe United States followed the naming customs and practices of English common law and traditions until recent times. The first known instance in the United States of a woman insisting on the use of her birth name was that of Lucy Stone in 1855, and there has been a general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, traditional naming practices (writes one commentator) were recognized as \"com[ing] into conflict with current sensitivities about children's and women's rights\". Those changes accelerated a shift away from the interests of the parents to a focus on the best interests of the child. The law in this area continues to evolve today mainly in the context of paternity and custody actions.\nNaming conventions in the US have gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband's family name after marriage.\nIt is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife's family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among matrilineal Canadian aboriginal groups, such as the Haida and Gitxsan). Upon marriage to a woman, men in the United States can change their surnames to that of their wives, or adopt a combination of both names with the federal government, through the Social Security Administration. Men may face difficulty doing so on the state level in some states.\nIt is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name. As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a double-barrelled name. For instance, when John Smith and Mary Jones marry each other, they may become known as \"John Smith-Jones\" and \"Mary Smith-Jones\". A spouse may also opt to use their birth name as a middle name, and e.g. become known as \"Mary Jones Smith\". An additional option, although rarely practiced, is the adoption of the last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as \"Simones\", which also requires a legal name change. Some couples keep their own last names but give their children hyphenated or combined surnames.\nIn 1979, the United Nations adopted the \"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\" (\"CEDAW\"), which declared in effect that women and men, and specifically wife and husband, shall have the same rights to choose a \"family name\", as well as a profession and an occupation.\nIn some places, civil rights lawsuits or constitutional amendments changed the law so that men could also easily change their married names (e.g., in British Columbia and California). Qu\u00e9bec law permits neither spouse to change surnames.\nIn France, until 1 January 2005, children were required by law to take the surname of their father. Article 311-21 of the French Civil code now permits parents to give their children the family name of either their father, mother, or hyphenation of both \u2013 although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, both names are used in alphabetical order. This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979.\nSimilar measures were adopted by West Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983), Finland (1985) and Spain (1999). The European Community has been active in eliminating gender discrimination. Several cases concerning discrimination in family names have reached the courts. \"Burghartz v. Switzerland\" challenged the lack of an option for husbands to add the wife's surname to his surname, which they had chosen as the family name when this option was available for women. \"Losonci Rose and Rose v. Switzerland\" challenged a prohibition on foreign men married to Swiss women keeping their surname if this option was provided in their national law, an option available to women. \"\u00dcnal Tekeli v. Turkey\" challenged prohibitions on women using their surname as the family name, an option only available to men. The Court found all these laws to be in violation of the convention.\nFrom 1945 to 2021 in the Czech Republic women by law had to use family names with the ending -ov\u00e1 after the name of their father or husband (so-called \"p\u0159ech\u00fdlen\u00ed\"). This was seen as discriminatory by a part of the public. Since 1 January 2022, Czech women can decide for themselves whether they want to use the feminine or neutral form of their family name.\nCompound surnames.\nWhile in many countries surnames are usually one word, in others a surname may contain two words or more, as described below.\nEnglish.\nCompound surnames in English and several other European cultures feature two (or occasionally more) words, often joined by a hyphen or hyphens. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the British Conservative Party, whose surname is \"Duncan Smith\".\nChinese.\nSome Chinese surnames use more than one character though this is very rare.\nMultiple surnames.\nSpanish-speaking countries.\nIn Spain and in most Spanish-speaking countries, the custom is for people to have two surnames, with the first surname coming from the father and the second from the mother; the opposite order is now legally allowed in Spain but still unusual. In informal situations typically only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purposes. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be their mother's first surname. For example, if Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Torres and Mar\u00eda Acosta G\u00f3mez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo Garc\u00eda Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.\nIn some instances, when an individual's first surname is very common, such as for example in Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, the second surname tends to gain preeminence over the first one in informal use. Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, therefore is more often called just \"Zapatero\" and almost never \"Rodr\u00edguez\" only; in other cases, such as in writer Mario Vargas Llosa, a person becomes usually called by both surnames. This changes from person to person and stems merely from habit.\nIn Spain, feminist activism pushed for a law approved in 1999 that allows an adult to change the order of his/her family names, and parents can also change the order of their children's family names if they (and the child, if over 12) agree, although this order must be the same for all their children.\nIn Spain, especially Catalonia, the paternal and maternal surnames are often combined using the conjunction \"y\" (\"and\" in Spanish) or \"i\" (\"and\" in Catalan), see for example the economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin or painter Salvador Dal\u00ed i Dom\u00e8nech.\nIn Spain, a woman does not generally change her legal surname when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother's surname and add her husband's surname to her father's surname using the preposition \"de\" (\"of\"), \"del\" (\"of the\", when the following word is masculine) or \"de la\" (\"of the\", when the following word is feminine). For example, if \"Clara Reyes Alba\" were to marry \"Alberto G\u00f3mez Rodr\u00edguez\", the wife could use \"Clara Reyes \"de\" G\u00f3mez\" as her name (or \"Clara Reyes G\u00f3mez\", or, rarely, \"Clara G\u00f3mez Reyes\". She can be addressed as \"Sra. de G\u00f3mez\" corresponding to \"Mrs G\u00f3mez\"). Feminist activists have criticized this custom as they consider it sexist. In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name. This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity in Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru, Panama, and to a certain extent in Mexico (where it is optional but becoming obsolete), but is frowned upon by people in Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere. In Peru and the Dominican Republic, women normally conserve all family names after getting married. For example, if \"Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez\" marries \"Juan Mart\u00edn De la Cruz G\u00f3mez\", she will be called \"Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez de De la Cruz\", and if the husband dies, she will be called \"Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez Vda. de De la Cruz\" (Vda. being the abbreviation for \"viuda\", \"widow\" in Spanish). The law in Peru changed some years ago, and all married women can keep their maiden last name if they wish with no alteration.\nHistorically, sometimes a father transmitted his combined family names, thus creating a new one e.g., the paternal surname of the son of \"Javier\" (given name) \"Reyes\" (paternal family name) \"de la Barrera\" (maternal surname) may have become the new paternal surname \"Reyes de la Barrera\". For example, Uruguayan politician Guido Manini Rios has inherited a compound surname constructed from the patrilineal and matrilineal surnames of a recent ancestor. \"De\" is also the nobiliary particle used with Spanish surnames. This can not be chosen by the person, as it is part of the surname, for example, \"Puente\" and \"Del Puente\" are not the same surname.\nSometimes, for single mothers or when the father would or could not recognize the child, the mother's surname has been used twice: for example, \"Ana Reyes Reyes\". In Spain, however, children with just one parent receive both surnames of that parent, although the order may also be changed. In 1973 in Chile, the law was changed to avoid stigmatizing illegitimate children with the maternal surname repeated.\nSome Hispanic people, after leaving their country, drop their maternal surname, even if not formally, so as to better fit into the non-Hispanic society they live or work in. Similarly, foreigners with just one surname may be asked to provide a second surname on official documents in Spanish-speaking countries. When none (such as the mother's maiden name) is provided, the last name may simply be repeated.\nA new trend in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American-born English-speakers are not aware of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the individual for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban \u00c1lvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban \u00c1lvarez Cobos, would become Esteban \u00c1lvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.\nIn some churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the family structure is emphasized, as well as a legal marriage, the wife is referred to as \"hermana\" [sister] plus the surname of her husband. And most records of the church follow that structure as well.\nInformal traditional names.\nIn many places, such as villages in Catalonia, Galicia, and Asturias and in Cuba, people are often informally known by the name of their dwelling or collective family nickname rather than by their surnames. For example, Remei Pujol i Serra who lives at Ca l'Elvira would be referred to as \"Remei de Ca l'Elvira\"; and Adela Barreira L\u00f3pez who is part of the \"Provisores\" family would be known as \"Adela dos Provisores\".\nAlso in many places, such as Cantabria, the family's nickname is used instead of the surname: if one family is known as \"\u00d1ecos\" because of an ancestor who was known as \"\u00d1ecu\", they would be \"Jos\u00e9 el de \u00d1ecu\" or \"Ana la de \u00d1ecu\" (collective: the \u00d1eco's). Some common nicknames are \"Rubiu\" (blond or red hair), \"Roju\" (reddish, referring to their red hair), \"Chiqui\" (small), \"Jinchu\" (big), and a bunch of names about certain characteristics, family relationship or geographical origin (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ).\nCompound surnames.\nBeyond the seemingly \"compound\" surname system in the Spanish-speaking world, there are also true compound surnames. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former chairman of the Supreme Military Junta of Ecuador, General Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o Estrella, has Luis as his first given name, Telmo as his middle name, the true compound surname Paz y Mi\u00f1o as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Estrella as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o Estrella is also known more casually as Luis Paz y Mi\u00f1o, Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o, or Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o. He would never be regarded as Luis Estrella, Telmo Estrella, or Luis Telmo Estrella, nor as Luis Paz, Telmo Paz, or Luis Telmo Paz. This is because \"Paz\" alone is not his surname (although other people use the \"Paz\" surname on its own). In this case, Paz y Mi\u00f1o is in fact the paternal surname, being a true compound surname. His children, therefore, would inherit the compound surname \"Paz y Mi\u00f1o\" as their paternal surname, while Estrella would be lost, since the mother's paternal surname becomes the children's second surname (as their own maternal surname). \"Paz\" alone would not be passed on, nor would \"Mi\u00f1o\" alone.\nTo avoid ambiguity, one might often informally see these true compound surnames hyphenated, for instance, as Paz-y-Mi\u00f1o. This is true especially in the English-speaking world, but also sometimes even in the Hispanic world, since many Hispanics are unfamiliar with this and other compound surnames, \"Paz y Mi\u00f1o\" might be inadvertently mistaken as \"Paz\" for the paternal surname and \"Mi\u00f1o\" for the maternal surname. Although Mi\u00f1o did start off as the maternal surname in this compound surname, it was many generations ago, around five centuries, that it became compounded, and henceforth inherited and passed on as a compound.\nOther surnames which started off as compounds of two or more surnames, but which merged into one single word, also exist. An example would be the surname Pazmi\u00f1o, whose members are related to the Paz y Mi\u00f1o, as both descend from the \"Paz Mi\u00f1o\" family of five centuries ago.\n\u00c1lava, Spain is known for its incidence of true compound surnames, characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic or more unusually a Basque patronymic, followed by the preposition \"de\", with the second part of the surname being a placename from \u00c1lava.\nPortuguese-speaking countries.\nIn Portuguese naming customs, the main surname (the one used in alpha sorting, indexing, abbreviations, and greetings), appears last.\nEach person usually has two family names: though the law specifies no order, the first one is usually the maternal family name and the last one is commonly the paternal family name. In Portugal, a person's full name has a minimum legal length of two names (one given name and one family name from either parent) and a maximum of six names (two first names and four surnames \u2013 he or she may have up to four surnames in any order desired picked up from the total of his/her parents and grandparents' surnames). The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy. Parents or the person him/herself must explain the claims they have to bear that surname (a family nickname, a rare surname lost in past generations, or any other reason one may find suitable). In Brazil, there is no limit of surnames used.\nIn the Portuguese tradition, the mother's surname usually comes first, followed by the father's surname. A woman may adopt her husband's surname(s), but nevertheless, she usually keeps her birth name or at least the last one. Since 1977 in Portugal and 2012 in Brazil, a husband can also adopt his wife's surname. When this happens, usually both spouses change their name after marriage.\nThe custom of a woman changing her name upon marriage is recent. It spread in the late 19th century in the upper classes, under French influence, and in the 20th century, particularly during the 1930s and 1940, it became socially almost obligatory. Nowadays, fewer women adopt, even officially, their husbands' names, and among those who do so officially, it is quite common not to use it either in their professional or informal life.\nThe children usually bear only the last surnames of the parents (i.e., the paternal surname of each of their parents). For example, \"Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves\" and \"Ana Lu\u00edsa de Albuquerque Pereira (Gon\u00e7alves)\" (in case she adopted her husband's name after marriage) would have a child named \"Lucas Pereira Gon\u00e7alves\". However, the child may have any other combination of the parents' surnames, according to euphony, social significance, or other reasons. For example, is not uncommon for the firstborn male to be given the father's full name followed by \"J\u00fanior\" or \"Filho\" (son), and the next generation's firstborn male to be given the grandfather's name followed by \"Neto\" (grandson). Hence \"Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves\" might choose to name his first born son \"Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves J\u00fanior\", who in turn might name his first born son \"Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves Neto\", in which case none of the mother's family names are passed on.\nIn ancient times a patronymic was commonly used \u2013 surnames like \"Gon\u00e7alves\" (\"son of \"Gon\u00e7alo\"\"), \"Fernandes\" (\"son of \"Fernando\"\"), \"Nunes\" (\"son of \"Nuno\"\"), \"Soares\" (\"son of \"Soeiro\"\"), \"Sanches\" (\"son of \"Sancho\"\"), \"Henriques\" (\"son of \"Henrique\"\"), \"Rodrigues\" (\"son of \"Rodrigo\"\") which along with many others are still in regular use as very prevalent family names.\nIn medieval times, Portuguese nobility started to use one of their estates' names or the name of the town or village they ruled as their surname, just after their patronymic. Soeiro Mendes da Maia bore a name \"Soeiro\", a patronymic \"Mendes\" (\"son of Hermenegildo \u2013 shortened to Mendo\") and the name of the town he ruled \"Maia\". He was often referred to in 12th-century documents as \"Soeiro Mendes, senhor da Maia\", Soeiro Mendes, lord of Maia. Noblewomen also bore patronymics and surnames in the same manner and never bore their husband's surnames. First-born males bore their father's surname, other children bore either both or only one of them at their will.\nOnly during the Early Modern Age, lower-class males started to use at least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse's surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Portuguese authorities realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were very liberal.\nUntil the end of the 19th century, it was common for women, especially those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by their first names. A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames.\nDuring the mid-20th century, under French influence and among upper classes, women started to take up their husbands' surname(s). From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands' surname which was imposed onto Portuguese immigrant women in France.\nFrom the 1974 Carnation Revolution onwards the adoption of their husbands' surname(s) receded again, and today both the adoption and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen in the majority of cases in recent years (60%). Also, it is legally possible for the husband to adopt his wife's surname(s), but this practice is rare.\nPrevalence.\nIn the United States, 1,712 surnames cover 50% of the population, and about 1% of the population has the surname Smith, the most common American name.\nAccording to some estimates, 85% of China's population shares just 100 surnames. The names Wang (\u738b), Zhang (\u5f20), and Li (\u674e) are the most frequent.\nThe surname Silva is by far the most common surname in Brazil and Portugal, forming the basis of Brazilian onomastics. The surname is borne by 34,030,104 (thirty-four million, thirty thousand, one hundred and four) Brazilians. This colossal number represents 16.76% of the total population analyzed, consolidating Silva as the most fundamental and widespread surname in the country.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a result of Margaret's marriage to Richard Pole, she was also known as Margaret Pole. She was one of just two women in 16th-century England to be a peeress in her own right (\"suo jure\") without a husband in the House of Lords.\nOne of the few members of the House of Plantagenet to have survived the Wars of the Roses, Margaret was executed in 1541 at the command of King Henry VIII, the second monarch of the House of Tudor, who was the son of her first cousin, Elizabeth of York. Pope Leo XIII beatified her as a martyr for the Catholic Church on 29 December 1886. One of her sons, Reginald Pole, was the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury.\nEarly life.\nMargaret was born at Farleigh Castle in Somerset. She was the only surviving daughter of George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, and his wife Isabel Neville. George was a son of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and a brother of both Edward IV and Richard III. Isabel was the elder daughter and coheiress of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (\"Warwick the Kingmaker\") and his wife Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick.\nWarwick was killed fighting against Margaret's uncles at the Battle of Barnet. Her father, already Duke of Clarence, was then created Earl of Salisbury and of Warwick. Edward IV declared that Margaret's younger brother, Edward, should be known as Earl of Warwick, but only as a courtesy title and no peerage was ever created for him. Margaret would have had a claim to the Earldom of Warwick, but the earldom was forfeited on the attainder of her brother Edward. She was most likely named for her paternal aunt Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy.\nIsabel died suddenly on 22 December 1476, when Margaret was only three years old. Two months earlier she had given birth to a son, Richard (who would only outlive her by a year). The death of his wife led Clarence to believe that her lady-in-waiting and midwife, Ankarette Twynyho, and a servant, had poisoned her and his son with a \"venomous drink of ale\". He had them brought to trial, found guilty and executed on very slim evidence by a rigged court in April 1477. His grief over his wife's death, and the midwife having been a distant cousin of the Woodvilles, suggested by his sister-in-law Elizabeth Woodville, made him distance himself from his brother, Edward IV.\nThe Duke of Clarence plotted against Edward IV, and in February 1478 was attainted and executed for treason. His lands and titles were thereby forfeited. Edward IV died in 1483 when Margaret was ten. The following year, the late King's marriage was declared invalid by the statute \"Titulus Regius\", making his children illegitimate. As Margaret and her brother, Edward, were debarred from the throne by their father's attainder, their uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, became King Richard III in 1483. He reinforced young Margaret and Edward\u2019s exclusion from the line of succession, and married Anne Neville, Margaret\u2019s maternal aunt. In 1484, Margaret and her brother were residing in the King's Northern estates in the care of their aunt. Pole learned how to play the virginals as a child.\nIn 1485, Richard III was defeated and killed at the Battle of Bosworth by Henry Tudor, who succeeded him as Henry VII. The new King married Margaret's cousin, Elizabeth of York, Edward IV's eldest daughter. Margaret and her brother were taken into their care as wards of the crown. They lived with the King's mother, Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond, and Margaret is recorded as attending the christening of the King's and Queen's first child, Arthur Tudor, Prince of Wales, in Winchester during September 1486.\nThe new Tudor King suspected anyone with blood ties to the Plantagenets as coveting the throne, and as young Edward was the last male Plantagenet and a potential House of York claimant, he was moved to the Tower of London in 1485. Edward was briefly displayed in public at St Paul's Cathedral in 1487 in response to the presentation of the impostor Lambert Simnel as the \"Earl of Warwick\" to the Irish lords. When Perkin Warbeck impersonated Edward IV's presumed-dead son, Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, in 1499, Margaret's brother Edward was attainted and executed. His lands and titles were confiscated.\nMarriage.\nMargaret remained important to the new Tudor dynasty due to her Yorkist lineage and unquestionably noble blood. When she was 14 years old, Henry VII arranged her marriage to his favoured cousin and loyal servant, Richard Pole, who was 11 years her senior and from a gentry family. Whilst Richard's mother Edith St. John was an older half-sister of the King's mother, Margaret Beaufort, making him from a Lancastrian supporting family, he was of a lower status compared to his new wife. It has been argued by historians such as Tracy Borman that this was intended to undermine her status, weaken her claim to the English throne and ensure that she was married to a loyal supporter. Horace Walpole later reflected in his correspondence that \"Henry had married her to the insignificant Sir Richard Pole who is called a Welsh Knight\". Nevertheless, the King and Queen attended the marriage ceremony. Historians debate the date of the marriage; it may have taken place in 1487 or 1491.\nAfter the marriage, Margaret lived at her husband's manor of Bockmer, Buckinghamshire and gave birth to five children. She was in attendance at court for important events such as at the Feast of St George in April 1488.\nMargaret's husband Richard prospered under the Tudor regime and held various offices in Henry VII's government. He was appointed as a Knight of the Garter in 1499, and he was entrusted with the prestigious role of Chamberlain for Arthur, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent to the throne. Around the time when Richard was appointed Arthur's Chamberlain, Margaret received a generous gift of \u00a320 from Henry VII.\nWhen the Prince of Wales married the Spanish Infanta Catherine of Aragon in 1501, they established an independent household at Ludlow Castle. Margaret was appointed as one of Catherine's ladies-in-waiting. Despite a ten year difference in age, she and the Princess became loyal friends. The friendship lasted throughout their whole lives and they exchanged frequent correspondence. Margaret held her position until Catherine's entourage was dissolved, after Arthur died on 2 April 1502.\nWidowhood.\nRichard Pole died of an illness in 1505, leaving Margaret a widow with five young children. She borrowed \u00a340 from Henry VII to pay for Pole's funeral, with Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, standing in surety for the loan. She had a small estate of land inherited from her husband but her jointure provided little income or means of supporting herself and her children.\nShe took lodgings at Syon Abbey, on the banks of the River Thames, along with her daughter Ursula and youngest son Geoffrey, as guests of the Bridgettine nuns. To ease the difficult financial situation, her eldest sons were likely sent to other noble households. She devoted her third son, Reginald Pole, to the Church, relinquishing all financial responsibility for him and sending him to the Carthusian Monastery at Sheen to be educated with the monks of the Charterhouse. Margaret was also supported by monthly payments from the King's Mother from May 1505 until May 1509. She remained at Syon Abbey until Henry VIII came to the throne in 1509, and her fortunes improved.\nCountess of Salisbury.\nHenry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in 1509, and Margaret was once again appointed as one of Catherine's ladies-in-waiting. She attended to the new Queen during the coronation. Her son Henry was also immediately given a place in the King's household.\nIn July 1509, the King granted Margaret an annuity of \u00a3100 a year. Then on 4 February 1512, after Margaret's petition to the King, her brother's attainder was reversed and an Act of Parliament restored the Earldom of Salisbury to her. It included some of her brother's former land. Henry VII had controlled these lands while Margaret's brother was a minor and then during his imprisonment; he confiscated them after Edward's trial. She paid 5,000 marks (the mark had a value of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 of a pound, thus \u00a32,667) for the restoration of her lands, . These terms were generous when compared to the amounts other peers were made to pay for restoration of land.\nEdward's Warwick and Spencer [Despencer] estates remained in the hands of the Crown, but Margaret now owned property in Calais, estates in Wales and 17 English counties, and the London palace \"Le Herber\". In 1517, Margaret commissioned the building of Warblington Castle, Hampshire, which would become her principal seat. It was built in brick, was sumptuously furnished and had a moat. The King and Queen are known to have visited for extended periods and Henry VIII reportedly enjoyed the hunting there. She had many church livings under her control. She also commissioned a chantry at Christchurch Priory.\nAs Countess of Salisbury, she played an active role in administering her estates. By 1538 she was the fifth-richest peer in England and ranked among the most powerful tenants in-chief during Henry VIII\u2019s reign. She was a patron of the New Learning, like many Renaissance noblewomen. Gentian Hervet translated Erasmus' \"de immensa misericordia Dei\" (\"The Great Mercy of God\") into English for her.\nMargaret\u2019s lineage was continued through her five children, Henry, Ursula, Arthur, Reginald, and Geoffrey, who all rose to prominence. Her first son, Henry Pole, was created Baron Montagu in 1514, another of the Neville titles in its first creation, speaking for the family on Margaret's behalf in the House of Lords. His mother negotiated his marriage to the coheiress Jane Neville, daughter of Lord Bergavenny.\nHer second son, Arthur Pole, had a successful career as a courtier, becoming one of the six Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber and one of the noblemen who accompanied the king's sister Mary Tudor to France for her marriage to King Louis XII in 1514. Arthur suffered a setback when his patron Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was convicted of treason in 1521 but was soon restored to favour. He died young (about 1526), having married Jane Pickering, the heiress of Roger Lewknor. Margaret and her son Henry pressed Arthur's widow to take a vow of perpetual chastity to preserve her inheritance for the Pole children.\nMargaret's daughter Ursula married Henry Stafford, the only son of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Lady Alianore Percy, in 1519. She was about 15 years old, and he was not yet 18 at the time of the marriage. After the Duke of Buckingham was beheaded for treason and posthumously attainted by an Act of Parliament in 1521, the couple were given only fragments of his estates. Ursula's husband was created 1st Baron Stafford by King Henry's son and successor, Edward VI in 1547. They had a total of seven sons and seven daughters.\nMargaret's third son, Reginald Pole, was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and studied abroad at the University of Padua in Italy, with a \u00a3100 stipend from the king. He was Dean of Exeter and Wimborne Minster, Dorset, and a canon of York. He had several other livings, although he had not been ordained a priest. In 1529, he represented Henry VIII in Paris, persuading the theologians of the Sorbonne to support Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. He was the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of All England.\nMargaret's youngest son, Geoffrey Pole, married Constance, daughter of Edmund Pakenham, and inherited the estate of Lordington in Sussex.\nMargaret's own favour at Court in these years varied. She received a New Years gift from the King valued at forty shillings, which was equal to the value of gifts given to the Dukes of Buckingham and Norfolk. She also had a dispute over land with Henry VIII in 1518 when he awarded contested lands to the Dukedom of Somerset, which had been held by his Beaufort great-grandfather, and was then in the possession of the Crown.\nGoverness to Mary Tudor.\nIn 1516, Margaret became godmother of the King's and Queen's daughter Mary and stood sponsor for her confirmation. In 1520 she was also appointed as Lady governess to Mary, a position of great honour and prestige that solidified her as a powerful force for patronage. In July 1521, when her sons were caught up in the Duke of Buckingham's treason conviction, she was dismissed from her appointment. It had been restored to her by 1525, when Margaret was reappointed governess to the Princess at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire. Margaret and the Princess spent the Christmases of 1529 and 1530 at court. During her time as governess, Margaret became like \"a second mother\" to Mary.\nMargaret was initially amongst a group of high ranking noblewomen who openly opposed the King's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Others were Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, the King's sister; Elizabeth Howard, Duchess of Norfolk; Gertrude Courtenay, Marchioness of Exeter; and Anne Grey, Baroness Hussey. This soured Margaret's relationship with Henry.\nWhen Mary was declared illegitimate in 1533, Margaret refused to give Mary's gold plate and jewels back to the King. Mary's Chamberlain John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford, wrote to Thomas Cromwell that \u201cin no wyse she wyll as yete deliyver to Mistress Frances the jewells for anything that I can say or doo onlesse that yt may please you to obteyne the kings letters unto hyr in that behalf.\u201d\nMary's household was broken up at the end of 1533 and Margaret asked if she could serve Mary at her own cost, but this was not permitted. When the Imperial Ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, suggested two years later that Mary be handed over to Margaret, Henry refused, calling Margaret \"a fool, of no experience\". She was also unwell for several months during this time, in her sickbed at Bisham. She eventually capitulated and accepted the King's annulment, the Act of Supremacy, and the Act of Succession, and her household were instructed to comply.\nFall.\nIn 1531, Margaret's son Reginald had warned of the risks if Henry should divorce Queen Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. Chapuys suggested to Emperor Charles V that Reginald should marry Henry VIII's daughter Mary and combine their dynastic claims. Chapuys also communicated with Reginald through his brother, Geoffrey, who urged that, should the wedding take place, a popular uprising against Henry would follow.\nIn June 1536, Reginald definitively broke with the King. He replied to a letter that he had received from Henry VIII with a copy of his own pamphlet, \"pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione,\" commonly known \"as De unitate.\" The pamphlet denied both royal supremacy and Henry's position on marriage to a brother's wife, and referred to him as \"a robber, murderer and greater enemy to Christianity than the Turk\". This was a great offence to the King. Reginald also urged the princes of Europe to invade England and depose Henry immediately.\nMargaret was summoned to the King's presence where he personally informed her of Reginald's treasonable actions. She consulted with her son Henry then wrote directly to Reginald, saying that she could not bear the King's wrath, strongly reproving him for his \"folly\", and advising him to \"take another way and serve our master as thy bounden duty is to do unless thou wilt be the confusion of thy mother\". She sent a copy of the letter to the King's council and retired from court. After Anne Boleyn was arrested and executed, Margaret was permitted to return to court, albeit briefly, to serve the new Queen Jane Seymour.\nIn 1537, Reginald was made a Cardinal, despite not being ordained a priest. Pope Paul III put him in charge of organising assistance for the Pilgrimage of Grace. The English government tried to assassinate him.\nMargaret's son Geoffrey was arrested in August 1538. He had been corresponding with his brother Reginald and the investigation of Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter and the so-called Exeter Conspiracy implicated him. Under interrogation, Geoffrey's nerve broke. He said that Exeter had been party to his correspondence with Reginald and he shared details about Henry, Lord Montagu's dislike of the King and his policies. Montagu, Exeter, and Margaret were all arrested in November 1538 as the entire Pole family became implicated in the treason. Margaret wrote of Geoffrey that, \"I trow he is not so unhappy that he will hurt his mother, and yet I care neither for him, nor for any other, for I am true to my Prince.\"\nMargaret was nevertheless accused of abetting her sons and of having \u201ccomytted and p[er]petrated div[er]se and sundry other detestable and abominable treasons.\u201d She was interrogated for three days by William FitzWilliam, Earl of Southampton, and Thomas Thirlby, Bishop of Ely, while imprisoned at Cowdray House, Midhurst, West Sussex, which was Fitzwilliam\u2019s home. She defended herself against their accusations, and her interrogators reported to Cromwell that \"We assure your lordship we have dealed with such a one as men have not dealed withal tofore [i.e. before] us; we may call her rather a strong and constant man, than a woman. For in all behaviour, howsoever we have used her, she hath showed herself so earnest, vehement, and precise that more could not be.\" She also denied receiving any treasonous letters from her sons, with the reports to Cromwell also stating that \"..[either] her sons have not made her privy ne participant of the bottom and pit [of] their stomachs, or else is she the [most] arrant traitoress that ever [lived].\" Lady Fitzwilliam refused to be in the home while Margaret was there, and Fitzwilliam himself pleaded with Cromwell to remove her from his custody. He wrote to him: \"I beg you to rid me of her company, for she is both chargeable and troubles my mind.\"\nIn January 1539, Geoffrey was pardoned, but Montagu and Exeter were executed for treason after trial. The King convinced himself that he had escaped death by a narrow margin and informed Emperor Charles V that for ten years Exeter and Montagu had planned to murder him.\nIn May 1539, Margaret was attainted, as her father had been. The attainder meant that her titles and lands were forfeit, her Earldom was confiscated and she was demoted to the title of Lady Margaret Pole. Her estate, including Warblington Castle, was temporarily awarded to Sir Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton and the king's personal secretary.\nAs part of the evidence for the bill of attainder, Cromwell produced an embroidered tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, and heraldic symbols supposedly symbolising Margaret's support for the Church of Rome and the rule of her son Reginald with the King's Catholic daughter Mary. This had allegedly been found in her coffers at Warblington Castle.\nMargaret was sentenced to death but was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years with her grandson Henry and Exeter's son. The King paid adequate sums for her maintenance including wages for a waiting woman. In March 1541, the King ordered warm gowns and footwear for her to wear. In 1540, Cromwell had also fallen from favour and was himself attainted and executed.\nExecution.\nThe following poem was found carved on the wall of Margaret's cell:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn the morning of 27 May 1541, Margaret was told she would die within the hour. She answered that no crime had been attributed to her. Nevertheless, she was taken from her cell to the precincts of the Tower where a low wooden block had been prepared instead of the customary scaffold.\nTwo written eyewitness reports survived her execution: one by Charles de Marillac, the French ambassador, and the other by Chapuys, ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor. The accounts differ somewhat. Marillac's report, dispatched two days afterwards, recorded that the execution took place with so few people present that, in the evening, news of her execution was doubted. Chapuys wrote two weeks after the execution that one hundred and fifty witnesses were present for the execution, including the Lord Mayor of London.\nChapuys wrote: \"At first, when the sentence of death was made known to her, she found the thing very strange, not knowing of what crime she was accused, nor how she had been sentenced\". Because the chief executioner had been sent north to deal with rebels, the execution was performed by \"a wretched and blundering youth who hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner\". It took eleven strokes of an axe for the executioner to remove her head. The first blow missed its mark, gashing her shoulder.\nA third account in Burke's \"Peerage\" described the appalling circumstances of the execution. It states that Margaret refused to lay her head on the block, declaiming: \"So should traitors do, and I am none\". According to the account, she turned her head \"every which way\", instructing the executioner that, if he wanted her head, he should take it as he could.\nMargaret was buried in the Chapel Royale of St Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London. Her remains were rediscovered when the chapel was renovated in 1876.\nDescendants.\nWhen not at Court, Margaret lived chiefly at Warblington Castle in Hampshire and Bisham Manor in Berkshire.\nShe and her husband were parents to five children:\nLegacy.\nMargaret's son Reginald Pole said, \"I am now the son of a martyr whom the King of England has brought to the scaffold although she was seventy years old and his own near relation, for her perseverance in the Catholic faith.\" Margaret was later regarded by the Catholic Church as a martyr. She was beatified on 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII, and is known in the Roman Catholic Calendar as the Blessed Margaret Pole.\nPanel paintings of Margaret are in a number of English churches, including:\nThere are stained glass windows of her in several English churches as well:\nShe is commemorated in the dedication of the Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace &amp; Blessed Margaret Pole in Southbourne, Bournemouth.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the war, he was involved in a number of operations, including the removal from power of Hungarian Regent Mikl\u00f3s Horthy and the Gran Sasso raid that rescued Benito Mussolini from captivity. Skorzeny led Operation Greif in which German soldiers infiltrated Allied lines wearing their enemies' uniforms. As a result, he was charged in 1947 at the Dachau Military Tribunal with breaching the 1907 Hague Convention, but was acquitted when it was confirmed the Allies had often committed the same offences.\nSkorzeny escaped from an internment camp in 1948, hiding out on a Bavarian farm as well as in Salzburg and Paris before eventually settling in Spain. In 1953, he served as a military advisor to the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. He was allegedly an advisor to Argentinian president Juan Per\u00f3n. He died of lung cancer on 5 July 1975 in Madrid at the age of 67.\nEarly life.\nOtto Skorzeny was born in Vienna into a middle-class Austrian family which had a long history of military service. His surname is of Polish origin, and Skorzeny's distant ancestors came from Skorz\u0119cin in the Greater Poland region, eventually immigrating to East Prussia.\nIn addition to his native German, he spoke excellent French and was proficient in English. In his teens, Skorzeny once complained to his father about the austere lifestyle the family was enduring; his father replied, \"There is no harm in doing without things. It might even be good for you not to get used to a soft life.\"\nHe was a noted fencer as a member of a German-national \"Burschenschaft\" while studying at the Technical University of Vienna. He engaged in fifteen personal combats. The tenth resulted in a wound that left a dramatic duelling scar\u2014known in academic fencing as a \"Schmiss\" (German for \"smite\" or \"hit\")\u2014on his cheek.\nIn May 1932, Skorzeny joined the Austrian Nazi organization and soon became a member of the Austrian branch of the Nazi \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) in February 1934. A charismatic figure, Skorzeny played a minor role in the Anschluss on 12 March 1938 when, according to his own account, he saved the Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas from being shot by Austrian Nazis.\nEastern Front.\nAfter the 1939 Invasion of Poland, Skorzeny, then working as a civil engineer, volunteered for service in the German Air Force (the Luftwaffe), but was turned down because he was considered too tall at and too old (31 years in 1939) for aircrew training. He then joined the Waffen-SS, training with Hitler's bodyguard regiment, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH).\nSkorzeny took part in the invasion of the Soviet Union with the SS Division Das Reich and subsequently fought in several battles on the Eastern Front. In October 1941, he was in charge of a \"technical section\" of German forces during the Battle of Moscow. His mission was to seize important buildings of the Communist Party, including the NKVD headquarters at Lubyanka, and the central telegraph office and other high priority facilities, before they could be destroyed. He was also ordered to capture the sluices of the Moscow-Volga Canal because Hitler wanted to turn Moscow into a huge artificial lake by opening them. The missions were cancelled since German forces had failed to capture the Soviet capital.\nIn January 1942, Skorzeny was hit in the back of the head by shrapnel; he was evacuated to the rear for treatment. He had previously been awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class while fighting in the Yelnya bridgehead. Recuperating from his injuries he was given a staff role in Berlin, where he developed his ideas on unconventional commando warfare. \nStrategically and tactically, Skorzeny's proposals were to develop units specialized in such warfare, including partisan-like fighting deep behind enemy lines, fighting in enemy uniform, sabotage attacks, etc. In April 1943 Skorzeny's name was put forward by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the new head of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), and Skorzeny met with Walter Schellenberg, head of Amt VI, Ausland-SD (the SS foreign intelligence service department of the RSHA); Schellenberg charged Skorzeny with command of the schools organized to train operatives in sabotage, espionage, and paramilitary techniques. Skorzeny was appointed commander of the recently created \"Waffen SS Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal\" stationed near Berlin (the unit was later renamed SS Jagdverband 502, and in November 1944 again to SS Combat Unit \"Centre\", expanding ultimately to five battalions).\nThe unit's first mission was Operation Fran\u00e7ois in mid-1943. Skorzeny sent a group by parachute into Iran to make contact with the dissident mountain tribes to encourage them to sabotage Allied shipments to the Soviet Union via the Trans-Iranian Railway. However, commitment among the rebel tribes was suspect, and Operation Fran\u00e7ois was deemed a failure.\nOperations by Skorzeny.\nLiberation of Benito Mussolini.\nOn the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the Allied invasion of Sicily and bombing of Rome, the Italian Grand Council of Fascism voted a motion of no confidence (\"Ordine del Giorno\" Grandi) against Benito Mussolini. On the same day, the king replaced him with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and had him arrested.\nHitler ordered military operations to liberate Mussolini, and, as was his common procedure, he issued similar orders to competing organisations within the German military. So he ordered Skorzeny to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.\nMussolini was being transported around Italy by his captors (first to Ponza, then to La Maddalena, both small islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea). Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by SS-\"Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Herbert Kappler's network of agents and informants (helped with counterfeit British bank notes with a face value of \u00a3100,000, forged under Operation Bernhard). It was determined that Mussolini was being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore Hotel, a ski resort at Campo Imperatore in Italy's Gran Sasso massif, high in the Apennine Mountains.\nOn 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the \"Fallschirmj\u00e4ger\" to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten DFS 230 gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by Henschel Hs 126 planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the Pratica di Mare Air Base near Rome. The leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-Oberleutnant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, entered the first glider, Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close by Alban Hills the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skorzeny's two units arrived first over the target. Meanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Otto-Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05 the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; only one crashed, causing injuries. The \"Fallschirmj\u00e4ger\" and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors (200 well-equipped \"Carabinieri\" guards) without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General Fernando Soleti of the \"Polizia dell' Africa Italiana\", who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, being followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45, Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini.\nSubsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a Fieseler Fi 156 STOL plane. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted on accompanying Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful lift-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a Heinkel He 111 to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the Hotel Imperial. The next day he was flown to Munich and on 14 September he met Hitler at the Wolf's Lair F\u00fchrer Headquarters near Rastenburg.\nThe landing at Campo Imperatore was in fact led by First Lieutenant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, commanded by Major Otto-Harald Mors and under orders from General Kurt Student, all \"Fallschirmj\u00e4ger\" (German air force paratroop) officers; but Skorzeny stewarded the Italian leader right in front of the cameras. After a pro-SS propaganda coup at the behest of \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler and propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Skorzeny and his special forces (\"SS-Sonderverband z. b. V. \"Friedenthal\"\") of the \"Waffen-SS\" were granted the majority of the credit for the operation.\nOperation Long Jump.\n\"Operation Long Jump\" was the alleged code name given to a plot to assassinate the \"Big Three\" (Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt) at the 1943 Tehran Conference. Hitler supposedly gave the command of the operation to Ernst Kaltenbrunner, chief of the RSHA, who, in turn, ceded the mission to Skorzeny. Knowledge of the whole scheme was presented to the Western Allies by Stalin's NKVD at the Tehran Conference. The Soviets said they had learned about its existence from counter-espionage activities against German intelligence. Their agents had found out the Nazis knew the time and place of this meeting because they had cracked a US naval code. According to the NKVD, the assassination plot was foiled after they identified the German spies in Iran forcing Skorzeny to call off the mission due to inadequate intelligence.\nFollowing Tehran, the story was treated with incredulity by the British and Americans who dismissed it as Soviet propaganda. Skorzeny supported this view by stating in his post-war memoirs that no such operation ever existed. He said the story about the plans being leaked to Soviet spy Nikolai Kuznetsov by an SS-\"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" named Hans Ulrich von Ortel was a Soviet invention; Hans Ulrich von Ortel never existed. Skorzeny claimed his name was used only to add credibility to the story because the NKVD knew his record as an SS commando would make the existence of such an operation more plausible.\nRaid on Drvar.\nIn early 1944, \"Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal\" was re-designated SS-J\u00e4ger-Bataillon 502 with Skorzeny staying on as commander. They were assigned to \"Operation R\u00f6sselsprung\", known subsequently as the Raid on Drvar. \"R\u00f6sselsprung\" was a commando operation meant to capture the Yugoslav commander-in-chief, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had also recently been recognized by the Allies as the Yugoslav prime minister. Marshal Tito led the Yugoslav Partisan resistance army from his headquarters near the Bosnian town of Drvar, in the centre of a large area held by the Partisans.\nHitler knew Tito was receiving Allied support and was aware that either British or American troops might land in Dalmatia along the Adriatic coastline with support from the Partisans. Killing or capturing Tito would not only hinder this, it would give a badly needed boost to the morale of Axis forces engaged in occupied Yugoslavia. Skorzeny was involved in planning \"R\u00f6sselsprung\" and was intended to command it. However, he argued against implementation after he visited Zagreb and discovered that the operation had been compromised through the carelessness of German agents in the Nazi-affiliated Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslav territory.\n\"R\u00f6sselsprung\" was put into action nonetheless, but it was a complete disaster. The first wave of paratroopers, following heavy bombardment by the Luftwaffe, jumped between Tito's hideout in a cave and the town of Drvar; they landed on open ground and many were promptly shot by members of the Tito Escort Battalion, a unit numbering fewer than a hundred soldiers. The second wave of paratroopers missed their target and landed several miles out of town. Tito was long gone before paratroopers reached the cave; a trail at the back of the cave led to the railway tracks where Tito boarded a train that took him safely to Jajce. In the meantime, the Partisan 1st Brigade, from the 6th \"Lika\" Partisan Division, arrived after a twelve-mile (nineteen-kilometre) forced march and attacked the Waffen-SS paratroopers, inflicting heavy casualties.\nHungary and Operation Panzerfaust.\nIn October 1944, Hitler sent Skorzeny to Hungary after receiving word that the Regent of Hungary, Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, was secretly negotiating with the Red Army. The surrender of Hungary would have cut off the million German troops still fighting in the Balkans.\nSkorzeny, in a daring \"snatch\" codenamed Operation Panzerfaust (known as \"Operation Eisenfaust\" in Germany), kidnapped Horthy's son Mikl\u00f3s Horthy Jr. and forced his father to resign as head of state. A pro-Nazi government under dictator Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi was then installed in Hungary. In April 1945, after German and Hungarian forces were driven out of Hungary, Sz\u00e1lasi and his Arrow Cross Party-based forces continued the fight in Austria and Slovakia. The success of the operation earned Skorzeny promotion to \"Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer\".\nOperation Greif and the German defeat.\nAs part of the German Ardennes offensive in late 1944 (Battle of the Bulge), Skorzeny's English-speaking troops were charged with infiltrating American lines disguised in American uniforms in order to produce confusion to support the German attack. For the campaign, Skorzeny was the commander of a composite unit, the 150th SS Panzer Brigade. As planned by Skorzeny, Operation Greif involved about two dozen German soldiers, most of them in captured American Jeeps and disguised in American uniforms, who would penetrate American lines in the early hours of the Battle of the Bulge to cause disorder and confusion. Skorzeny was well aware that under the Hague Convention of 1907, any of his men captured while wearing American uniforms would be executed as spies and this possibility caused much discussion with Generaloberst Alfred Jodl and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt.\nA handful of his men were captured and spread a rumour that Skorzeny personally was leading a raid on Paris to kill or capture General Eisenhower, who was not amused by having to spend Christmas 1944 isolated for security reasons. Eisenhower retaliated by ordering an all-out manhunt for Skorzeny, with \"Wanted\" posters distributed throughout Allied-controlled territories featuring a detailed description and a photograph. In all, twenty-three of Skorzeny's men were captured behind American lines and sixteen were executed as spies for contravening the rules of war by wearing enemy uniforms.\nSkorzeny spent February 1945 as an acting major general commanding about 5,000 troops, only some of which were his SS commandos and paratroopers, during the defense of the Schwedt Bridgehead on the River Oder. On 17 March, he received orders to sabotage the last remaining intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen following its capture by the Allies, but the bridge collapsed that same day, and the naval demolitions squad that had been preparing its destruction instead unsuccessfully attacked a nearby Allied pontoon bridge between Kripp and Linz. Hitler awarded him one of Germany's highest military honours, the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross.\nPost-war.\nDachau trials.\nSkorzeny was interned for two years before being tried as a war criminal at the Dachau trials in 1947 for allegedly violating the laws of war during the Battle of the Bulge. He and nine officers of the Panzerbrigade 150 were tried before an American military tribunal in Dachau on 18 August 1947. They faced charges of improper use of American military insignia, theft of American uniforms, and theft of Red Cross parcels from American POWs. The trial lasted over three weeks. The charge of stealing Red Cross parcels was dropped for lack of evidence. Skorzeny admitted to ordering his men to wear American uniforms, but his defence argued that as long as enemy uniforms were discarded before combat started, such a tactic was a legitimate \"ruse de guerre\".\nOn the final day of the trial, 9 September, F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, a former British SOE agent, testified in defence of Skorzeny and his operatives wearing American uniforms behind enemy lines, claiming that the Western Allies had actively contemplated carrying out exactly the same kind of \"false flag\" operations; the Tribunal subsequently acquitted the ten defendants. The Tribunal drew a distinction between using enemy uniforms during combat and for other purposes including deception and were unable to prove that Skorzeny had given any orders to actually fight in American uniforms.\nEscape from prison.\nSkorzeny was detained in an internment camp at Darmstadt awaiting the decision of a denazification court. On 27 July 1948, he escaped from the camp with the help of three former SS officers dressed in American military police uniforms who entered the camp and claimed that they had been ordered to take Skorzeny to Nuremberg for a legal hearing. Skorzeny afterwards maintained that American authorities had aided his escape and had supplied the uniforms.\nSkorzeny hid out at a farm in Bavaria which had been rented by Countess Ilse L\u00fcthje, the niece of Hjalmar Schacht (Hitler's former finance minister), for around 18 months, during which time he was in contact with Reinhard Gehlen, and together with Hartmann Lauterbacher (former deputy head of the Hitler Youth) recruited for the Gehlen Organization. Skorzeny was photographed at a caf\u00e9 on the Champs Elys\u00e9es in Paris on 13 February 1950. The photo appeared in the French press the next day, causing him to move to Salzburg, where he met up with German veterans and also filed for divorce so that he could marry L\u00fcthje.\nShortly afterwards, with the help of a Nansen passport issued by the Spanish government, he moved to Madrid, where he set up a small engineering business. In April 1950, the publication of Skorzeny's memoirs by the French newspaper \"Le Figaro\" caused 1,500 communists to riot outside the journal's headquarters.\nMilitary advisor.\nIn 1952, when Egypt was taken over by General Mohammed Naguib, Skorzeny was sent to Egypt the following year by former General Reinhard Gehlen (who was now working indirectly for the CIA) to act as Naguib's military adviser. Skorzeny recruited a staff made up of former SS and Wehrmacht officers to train the Egyptian army. Among these officers were former Wehrmacht generals Wilhelm Fahrmbacher and Oskar Munzel; the head of the Gestapo Department for Jewish Affairs in occupied Poland Leopold Gleim; and Joachim Daemling, former chief of the Gestapo in D\u00fcsseldorf. In addition to training the army, Skorzeny also trained Arab volunteers in commando tactics for possible use against British troops stationed in the Suez Canal zone. Several Palestinian refugees also received commando training, and Skorzeny planned their raids into Israel via the Gaza Strip in 1953\u20131954. One of these Palestinians was Yasser Arafat. He stayed on to serve as an adviser to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.\nAccording to some authors, he traveled between Spain and Argentina, where he acted as an advisor to President Juan Per\u00f3n and as a bodyguard for Eva Per\u00f3n, while fostering an ambition for the \"Fourth Reich\" to be centred in Latin America.\nAlleged recruitment by Mossad.\nThe Israeli security and intelligence magazine \"Matara\" published an article in 1989 claiming that Skorzeny had been recruited by Mossad in 1963 to obtain information on German scientists who were working on an Egyptian project to develop rockets to be used against Israel. Reporting on the \"Matara\" story, the major Israeli daily newspaper \"Yedioth Ahronot\" said that it had confirmed the story from their own senior Mossad source. Former Mossad head Isser Harel confirmed the story that former Nazis were recruited to provide intelligence on Arab countries.\nIan Black and Benny Morris wrote in 1991 that Skorzeny may not have known for whom he was working, but in 2010, Tom Segev published in his biography of Simon Wiesenthal that Skorzeny had offered to help only if Wiesenthal removed him from his list of wanted war criminals. Wiesenthal refused, but Skorzeny finally agreed to help anyway. Segev gave as his main source the senior Mossad agent Rafi Meidan to whom Segev attributes the primary role in the recruitment of Skorzeny.\nFurther details of the story were published by Yossi Melman and Dan Raviv in 2016. According to their information, a Mossad team had started to develop a plan to kill Skorzeny, but chief Isser Harel decided to attempt to recruit him instead, as a man on the inside would greatly enhance their ability to target Nazis who were providing military assistance to Egypt. He allegedly was recruited and conducted operations for Mossad from 1964, working with Avraham Ahituv and Rafi Eitan.\nOther unnamed sources asserted that Skorzeny was recruited after Mossad visited his home in Spain, where he expected that he would be assassinated. After undergoing instruction and training in Mossad's facilities in Israel, the rumoured work for Mossad included assassinating German rocket scientist Heinz Krug who was working for the Egyptian government and posting a letter bomb which killed five Egyptians at the Egyptian military rocket site \"Factory 333\". He also allegedly supplied the names and addresses of German scientists working for Egypt and the names of European front companies supplying military hardware to Egypt.\nNo confirmed source can explain Skorzeny's motives for working with Israel, but he may have craved adventure and intrigue and feared assassination by Mossad. An article featured in \"Der Spiegel\" on 22 January 2018 raised doubts as to the involvement of Skorzeny in Krug's death, stating that Mossad boss Isser Harel ordered the murder.\nOther activities.\nLike thousands of other former Nazis, Skorzeny was declared (denazified) \"in absentia\" in 1952 by a West German government arbitration board, which meant that he could now travel from Spain into other Western countries, on a special Nansen passport for stateless persons with which he visited Ireland in 1957 and 1958. In late 1958, he qualified for an Austrian passport and in 1959, he purchased Martinstown House (), a farm near The Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland. Although Skorzeny could not be refused entry without due cause, he was refused a residency visa by the Irish government and had to limit his stays to six weeks at a time, and he was monitored by G2. He rarely visited after 1963 and sold Martinstown House in 1971. At 6\u00a0ft 4 in (193\u00a0cm) and weighing , along with his scar, he was easily recognizable and caused speculation among the English and Irish press as to why he was in Ireland. One Kildare resident recalled Skorzeny as someone who \"wasn't particularly friendly and [who] didn't really mix with local people\". Skorzeny also owned property on Majorca.\nIn the 1960s, Skorzeny set up the Paladin Group, which he envisioned as \"an international directorship of strategic assault personnel [that would] straddle the watershed between paramilitary operations carried out by troops in uniform and the political warfare which is conducted by civilian agents\". Based near Alicante, Spain, the Paladin Group specialized in arming and training guerrillas. Some of its operatives were recruited by the Spanish Interior Ministry to wage a clandestine war against the separatist group ETA. Skorzeny was a founder and an advisor to the leadership of the Spanish neo-Nazi group CEDADE, established in 1966.\nOn Feb 24, 1975, as he left the studios of French television in Paris, he was whipped by a former officer of the French Army, who was unarmed but threatened to kill him on the spot. The killing was prevented, however, by French police. The story appeared on \"Le Monde\" two days later.\nIt was rumoured that under the cover names Robert Steinbacher and Otto Steinbauer and supported by either Nazi funds or (according to some sources) by Austrian intelligence, Skorzeny set up a secret organization named Die Spinne (English: \"The Spider\"), which helped as many as 600 former SS men escape from Germany to Spain, Argentina, and from there to other countries.\nAliases.\nIn his clandestine post-war life, Skorzeny was known to have used numerous aliases according to foreign intelligence agencies. \nAs early as 1951, the United States foreign service was briefed of his whereabouts in Spain, under the assumed name of Rolf Steinbauer.\nA full decade later, the CIA was aware of other aliases used by Skorzeny during his life as an emigre: Rolf Steiner and Otto Steinbauer.\nDeath.\nIn 1970, a cancerous tumour was discovered on Skorzeny's spine. Two tumours were later removed while he was staying at a hospital in Hamburg, leaving him temporarily paralyzed. Skorzeny died of lung cancer on 5 July 1975 in Madrid. He was 67 years old. Skorzeny never denounced Nazism.\nHe was given a Catholic funeral in Madrid on 7 August 1975. His body was then cremated and his ashes were later taken to Vienna to be interred in the Skorzeny family plot at D\u00f6blinger Friedhof. His funerals in Madrid and Vienna were attended by former SS colleagues who gave the Nazi salute, and also sang some of Hitler's favourite songs.\nIn fiction.\nLike many other prominent World War II figures, Skorzeny has been portrayed in several works of fiction, such as the \"Worldwar tetralogy\" by Harry Turtledove and \"1945\" by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen. In \"The Eagle has Landed\" by Jack Higgins, Skorzeny's rescue of Mussolini inspires a plan to kidnap Winston Churchill.\nSkorzeny was portrayed in the television drama series \"\" and \"Mussolini and I\", and the drama film \"Walking with the Enemy\" (2014). The Spanish drama-series \"Jaguar\" is inspired by Skorzeny.\nPromotions.\nSkorzeny was promoted as follows:\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPublications by Skorzeny.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With his brother, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector of England, he vied for control of their nephew, the young King Edward VI (r.\u20091547\u00a0\u2013\u00a01553). In 1547, Seymour married Catherine Parr, the widow of Henry VIII. During his marriage to Catherine, Seymour involved the future Queen Elizabeth I (then 14 years old), who resided in his household, in flirtatious and possibly sexual behaviour.\nFamily and royal connections.\nThomas Seymour was the son of Sir John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth. He was the fourth of their six sons; his elder brother Edward (1500\u20131552) would become 1st Duke of Somerset. He grew up at Wulfhall, the Seymour family home in Wiltshire. The Seymours were a family of country gentry, who, like most holders of manorial rights, traced their ancestry to a Norman origin.\nHenry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, did not have a son although Henry hoped for a male heir. His interests turned elsewhere, to Seymour's sister Jane, one of Anne's ladies-in-waiting. Henry married Jane eleven days after Anne's execution in May 1536, and the Seymour brothers saw their fortunes rise: in that year, Thomas became a gentleman of the privy chamber.\nIn October of the following year, Queen Jane gave birth to a son, Edward Tudor, who would become King Edward VI. Her two brothers, Edward and Thomas, were, therefore, uncles to the baby Edward, heir to the throne. Less than two weeks later, Jane died from complications related to childbirth.\nThomas Seymour's other royal connection was with Catherine Parr, Henry VIII's sixth wife, whom Seymour would later marry, after Henry's death. In 1543, Parr established herself as part of Princess Mary's household, where she caught the attention of the King. Although she had already begun a romantic relationship with Seymour, she saw it as her duty to accept Henry's proposal.\nForeign affairs.\nIn 1538, Seymour was sent to the embassy at the French court. He was one of those appointed to meet Anne of Cleves, King Henry's fourth wife, at Calais on 13 December 1539. A few weeks later he was sent to King Ferdinand I of Hungary, brother of Emperor Charles V, to enlist support for Henry against France and Scotland. In May 1543, he was appointed ambassador to the Habsburg court in Brussels. He was given this posting to remove him from King Henry's court, in view of the King's marriage to Catherine Parr.\nWhen war broke out between England and France, Seymour was made marshal of the English army in the Netherlands on 26 June 1543, being second in command to Sir John Wallop. On 24 July, with a strong detachment, he captured and destroyed the castles of Rinquecen and Arbrittayne near the French port of Boulogne. For a short time, he held the chief command during Wallop's illness. Due to his position of privilege as a royal uncle and as a reward for his services, Seymour was made Master-General of the Ordnance in 1544 and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1545, both senior military positions.\nRegency Council and marriage to Catherine Parr.\nSeymour returned to court just before Henry VIII died in January 1547, leaving Catherine one of the wealthiest women in England. According to the King's will, a regency council was constituted to rule on behalf of the nine-year-old orphaned King Edward. Thomas Seymour became 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, and his older brother Edward became Duke of Somerset, and is often, therefore, referred to as \"Somerset\". In addition, Thomas Seymour saw his brother rise, amid the contentious and dangerous politics of the English Reformation, to the position of chief councillor with an approved title of \"Protector\" regent, referred to unofficially as Lord Protector of England, in effect, ruler of the realm as regent for his nephew, the king. Thomas began to resent his brother and the relationship between them began to dissolve. Although Thomas was named Lord High Admiral as a concession, he was consumed by jealousy of his brother's power and influence and worked to unseat and replace his brother as Lord Protector.\nThomas Seymour sought to overturn his brother's position on the regency council by his personal influence over the young king, and also possibly by making a royal marriage. Although his name had been linked to Mary Howard, Duchess of Richmond, he was still unmarried at the time of Henry VIII's death. He had previously shown some interest in marrying either of Henry's daughters, Elizabeth or Mary; however, within weeks of Henry's death, Thomas Seymour had rekindled the affair with Catherine Parr, and they were secretly married in April or May 1547, too soon after the king's death to suit many. Anne Stanhope, Somerset's proud wife, disliked Catherine and Thomas and began to turn many people in court against them.\nRelationship with Elizabeth.\nUpon their marriage, Seymour moved into his wife's house, Chelsea Manor in London, where she lived with her step-daughter, the 14-year-old Elizabeth. Seymour was the uncle of Elizabeth's half-brother, and the newly-wed husband of her stepmother. Now, living under the same roof as Elizabeth, Thomas Seymour began to show affection toward Elizabeth, tickling her, and slapping her on her behind as she lay in her bed, or coming into her room in his nightclothes. Her governess, Kat Ashley, thought of this as scandalous, and reported it to Catherine. Indignant, Seymour retorted, \"By God's precious soul, I mean no evil, and I will not leave it!\".\nAt first, Catherine dismissed the behaviour as innocent fun, and even joined in the behaviour on a few occasions. Elizabeth's feelings regarding this behaviour are unknown, but it was said that she bore Thomas some degree of affection and though her governess \"bade him go away in shame\", she found him more amusing than dangerous. Not long after Edward VI's accession, Seymour sought to court Elizabeth by writing in his suit to the princess, \"If it is my good fortune to inspire in you feelings of kindness and you will consent to marriage, you may assure yourself of having made the happiness of a man who will adore you till death\". Although in Elizabeth's reply she stated that \"neither my age nor my inclination allows me to think of marriage\", the tone of her response made it seem she was quite enamoured with Seymour's proposal. It seems impossible to know whether or not Elizabeth felt she was captivated or victimized by Seymour. Given her relatively young age, the fact she was Catherine's step-daughter and also second in the line of succession of the English throne, and that Seymour was married to the dowager queen, his behaviour was considered to be highly improper, shocking, and immoral. When Catherine was pregnant in the spring of 1548, she had become concerned enough about her husband's flirtatious relationship with Elizabeth that she sent Elizabeth away to live with Anthony Denny and his wife, Joan Champernowne (Kat Ashley's sister), in Hertfordshire.\nIn June 1548, Catherine and Thomas Seymour moved their household from London to Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, the property granted to Seymour when he became Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September 1548, Catherine gave birth to a daughter, Mary Seymour. In the following days, she became uncharacteristically hostile and delusional. Thomas lay in bed with her to quiet her, but she did not get better, and died of childbirth complications, just before Elizabeth's 15th birthday. Upon her death, Catherine bequeathed all of her possessions to Thomas, making him one of the wealthiest men in England. He said he was \"amazed\" at her death; yet it opened up new opportunities for him, as his eye returned to Elizabeth. She avoided him, returning with her governess to her childhood home, Hatfield House in Hertfordshire.\nRelationship with Edward VI.\nDespite his great wealth and high position, Thomas Seymour could not come to terms with his brother's appointment as protector; and in his struggle with Somerset, he tried to ingratiate himself with the king, who was merely a child. He sought the 9-year-old Edward to write a letter on his behalf in support of his marriage to the dowager queen, Catherine Parr. The letter was obviously dictated by Thomas for Edward's signature and only enraged Somerset. He began to visit Edward frequently, secretly giving him an extravagant allowance of coins, so that Edward might be satisfied in feeling more grown-up and more king-like, giving gifts to his servants, teachers, and friends. Even though he lived in sumptuous splendour and wanting for nothing, no provisions had been made for Edward's pocket money; he became accustomed to these regular payments and began to ask Seymour freely for his allowance.\nThomas continued his manipulation of the king. In trying to get a bill through Parliament making him Edward's personal governor, Seymour requested Edward's royal signature on the bill. But Edward was uncertain and reluctant to go behind the back of the protector, Somerset, and of the regency council, and he would not sign it. Seymour persistently pressured Edward, until Edward felt threatened. But Seymour did not give up. He tried to persuade Edward that he did not need a protector, getting Edward to admit that it might be better for Somerset to die. It is not known what the king meant by this, but it was probably uttered innocently. Seymour intended that the king's royal signature and personal support would destabilise Somerset's position as protector, and as a member of the regency council. In his frustration and inability to gain any significant influence over the king, Thomas Seymour began to think in terms of open rebellion.\nDownfall.\nIn the summer of 1547, Somerset invaded Scotland. During his absence from the court, his brother, Thomas, fomented opposition to his authority, voicing open disapproval of his brother's administrative skills. Because his activities seemed suspicious, several members of the nobility advised him to be content with his position, but he would not listen. As Lord High Admiral, he was able to control the English navy, and he openly asked for support in case of a rebellion. Although it was his duty to suppress piracy, he entered into relations with pirates on the western coasts, with a view to securing their support. Thomas seems also to have hoped to finance a rebellion through crooked dealings with the vice-treasurer of the Bristol Mint, Sir William Sharington.\nBy 1548, the regency council was becoming aware of Thomas's bid for power. Somerset tried to save his brother from ruin, calling a council meeting so that Thomas might explain himself. However, Thomas did not appear. On the night of 16 January 1549, for reasons that are not clear (perhaps to take the young king away in his own custody), Seymour was caught trying to break into the King's apartments at Hampton Court Palace. He entered the privy garden and woke one of the King's pet spaniels. In response to the dog's barking, he shot and killed it. The next day, he was arrested and sent to the Tower of London. The incident, being caught outside the king's bedroom, at night, with a loaded pistol, was interpreted in the most menacing light, even casting suspicion on Elizabeth's involvement with Thomas. On 18 January, the council sent agents to question everyone associated with Thomas, including Elizabeth. On 22 February, the council officially accused him of thirty-three charges of treason. He was attainted of treason, condemned to death and executed on 20 March 1549. Catherine's brother William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, inherited Sudeley Castle.\nSeymour was a \"trusty friend\" of Sir Rowland Hill, who would publish the Geneva Bible, and was given land at Hoxten for life under his will. It was said that Hill \"knew much of the intent and purpose\" of Sir Thomas Seymour.\nAftermath.\nWhen he was arrested for treason, Seymour's associates were also cast under suspicion, including 15-year-old Elizabeth. She did not realize her own danger until her servants, including her governess Kat Ashley, were also arrested. Upon realising that Thomas would probably be executed, she was noticeably disconsolate, trying to free herself and her servants from suspicion. The regency council was sure of her complicity with Thomas and she was interrogated for weeks. But the council found itself in a sharply defined game of wits with Elizabeth, who proved to be a master of logic, defiance, and shrewdness. The embarrassing details of Seymour's improper behaviour towards her came to light but there was no evidence that Elizabeth had conspired with him. After his execution, all of Seymour's property was seized by the Crown. His attainder was reversed by Parliament in 1550, although the property was not returned to Mary Seymour, his only child; she is believed to have died at about the age of two, possibly while in the care of Katherine Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk. To his contemporaries, he appeared forceful and reckless, and also attractive to women. Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, a boyhood friend of King Edward, described Thomas Seymour as \"hardy, wise and liberal ... fierce in courage, courtly in fashion, in personage stately, in voice magnificent, but somewhat empty of matter\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution"}

The nickname \"Hotspur\" was given to him by the Scots as a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack. The heir to a leading noble family in northern England, Hotspur was one of the earliest and prime movers behind the deposition of King Richard II in favour of Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. He later fell out with the new regime and rebelled, and was slain at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 at the height of his fame.\nCareer.\nHenry Percy was born 20 May 1364 at either Alnwick Castle or Warkworth Castle in Northumberland, the eldest son of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and Margaret Neville, daughter of Ralph de Neville, 2nd Lord Neville of Raby, and Alice de Audley. He was knighted by King Edward III in April 1377, together with the future kings Richard II and Henry IV. In 1380, he was in Ireland with the Earl of March, and in 1383, he travelled in Prussia. He was appointed Warden of the East March either on 30 July 1384 or in May 1385, and in 1385 accompanied Richard II on an expedition into Scotland. \"As a tribute to his speed in advance and readiness to attack\" on the Scottish borders, the Scots bestowed on him the name 'Haatspore'. In April 1386, he was sent to France to reinforce the garrison at Calais and led raids into Picardy. Between August and October 1387, he was in command of a naval force in an attempt to relieve the siege of Brest. In appreciation of these military endeavours, at the age of 24 he was made a Knight of the Garter in 1388. Reappointed as Warden of the East March, he commanded the English forces against James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas, at the Battle of Otterburn on 10 August 1388, where he was captured, but soon ransomed for 7000 marks.\nDuring the next few years Percy's reputation continued to grow. Although not 30, he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Cyprus in June 1393 and appointed Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine (1394\u201398) on behalf of John of Gaunt, Duke of Aquitaine. He returned to England in January 1395, taking part in Richard II's expedition to Ireland, and was back in Aquitaine the following autumn. In the summer of 1396, he was again in Calais.\nPercy's military and diplomatic service brought him substantial marks of royal favour in the form of grants and appointments, but despite this, the Percy family decided to support Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV, in his rebellion against Richard II. On Henry's return from exile in June 1399, Percy and his father joined his forces at Doncaster and marched south with them. After King Richard's deposition, Percy and his father were \"lavishly rewarded\" with lands and offices.\nUnder the new king, Percy had extensive civil and military responsibility in both the East March towards Wales, where he was appointed High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1399, and in the north toward Scotland. In north Wales, he was under increasing pressure as a result of the rebellion of Owain Glynd\u0175r. In March 1402, Henry IV appointed Percy royal lieutenant in north Wales, and on 14 September 1402, Percy, his father, and the Earl of Dunbar and March defeated a Scottish force at the Battle of Homildon Hill. Among others, they made a prisoner of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas.\nRebellion, death and exhumation.\nIn spite of the favour that Henry IV showed the Percys in many respects, they became increasingly discontented with him. Among their grievances were:\nSpurred by these grievances, the Percys rebelled in the summer of 1403 and took up arms against the king. According to J. M. W. Bean, it is clear that the Percys were in collusion with Glynd\u0175r. On his return to England shortly after the victory at Homildon Hill, Henry Percy issued proclamations in Cheshire accusing the king of 'tyrannical government'.\nJoined by his uncle, Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, Percy marched to Shrewsbury, where he intended to do battle against a force there under the command of the Prince of Wales. The army of his father, however, was slow to move south, and it was without the assistance of his father that Henry Percy and Worcester arrived at Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, where they encountered the king with a large army. The ensuing Battle of Shrewsbury was fierce, with heavy casualties on both sides but, when Henry Percy himself was struck down and killed, his own forces fled.\nThe circumstances of Percy's death differ in accounts. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham stated in his \"Historia Anglicana\" that \"while he led his men in the fight rashly penetrating the enemy host, [Hotspur] was unexpectedly cut down, by whose hand is not known\". Another account states that Percy was struck in the face by an arrow when he opened his visor for a better view. This is the view taken by Alnwick Castle, home of Hotspur's descendants and place where a statue of him is exhibited. The legend that he was killed by the Prince of Wales seems to have been given currency by William Shakespeare, writing at the end of the following century. The Earl of Worcester was executed two days later.\nKing Henry, upon being brought Percy's body after the battle, is said to have wept. The body was taken by Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall, to Whitchurch, Shropshire, for burial. However, when rumours circulated that Percy was still alive, the king \"had the corpse exhumed and displayed it, propped upright between two millstones, in the market place at Shrewsbury\". That being done, Percy was subjected to posthumous execution. The king dispatched Percy's head to York, where it was impaled on the Micklegate Bar (one of the city's gates). His four-quarters were separately displayed in London, Newcastle upon Tyne, Bristol, and Chester before they were finally delivered to his widow. She had the body buried in York Minster in November of that year. In January 1404, Percy was posthumously attainted, declared guilty of high treason, and his titles and lands were declared forfeit to the Crown.\nMarriage and issue.\nHenry Percy married Elizabeth Mortimer, the eldest daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, and his wife, Philippa, the only child of Lionel, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Elizabeth de Burgh, Countess of Ulster. By her he had two children:\nSometime after 3 June 1406, Elizabeth Mortimer married, as her second husband, Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys, by whom she had a son, Sir Roger Camoys. Thomas Camoys distinguished himself as a soldier in command of the rearguard of the English army at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415.\nLegacy.\nHenry Percy, 'Hotspur', is one of Shakespeare's best-known characters. In \"Henry IV, Part 1\", Percy is portrayed as the same age as his rival, Prince Hal, by whom he is slain in single combat. In fact, he was 23 years older than Prince Hal, the future King Henry V, who was a youth of 16 at the date of the Battle of Shrewsbury.\nOne of England's football clubs, Tottenham Hotspur, is named after Hotspur, who lived in the region and whose descendants owned land in the neighbourhood of the club's first ground in the Tottenham Marshes. He was also well known for having a highly favoured enjoyment of watching cockfighting, hence the club's badge symbol.\nA statue of Henry Percy was unveiled in Alnwick by the Duke of Northumberland in 2010.\nThe protagonist of the video game \"Shadows of the Damned\" is named Garcia Hotspur.\nTom Glynn-Carney portrayed Hotspur in \"The King\" (2019).\nJoe Armstrong portrayed Hotspur in \"The Hollow Crown\" (2013).\nSean Connery portrayed Hotspur with Robert Hardy as Prince Hal. The 1960 production was part of a BBC series \"An Age of Kings\", a synthesis of Shakespeare's histories, with the episodes (3 &amp; 4) featuring Hotspur first broadcast in summer 1960.\nA British Airways Boeing 737-200, registered as G-BKYH, was given the name \"Hotspur\" in 1994, until the airline retired the aircraft.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The classification of this family has undergone significant change. Several groups formerly treated as subfamilies have been elevated to family rank (e.g., Bolboceratidae, Geotrupidae, Glaresidae, Glaphyridae, Hybosoridae, Ochodaeidae, and Pleocomidae), and some reduced to lower ranks. The subfamilies listed in this article are in accordance with those in \"Catalog of Life\" (2023).\nDescription.\nScarabs are stout-bodied beetles; most are brown or black in colour, but many, generally species that are diurnally active, have bright metallic colours, measuring between . The antennae of most species superficially seem to be knobbed (capitated), but the several segments comprising the head of the antenna are, as a rule, lamellate; they extend laterally into plates called lamellae that they usually keep compressed into a ball. Then, when following a scent, such a beetle fans the lamellae out like leaves to sense odours. \nMany species are fossorial, with legs adapted for digging. In some groups, males (and sometimes females) have prominent horns on the head and/or pronotum to fight over mates or resources. The largest fossil scarabaeid was \"Oryctoantiquus borealis\" with a length of . \nThe C-shaped larvae, called grubs, are pale yellow or white. Most adult beetles are nocturnal, although the flower chafers (Cetoniinae) and many leaf chafers (Rutelinae) are active during the day. The grubs mostly live underground or under debris, so are not exposed to sunlight. Many scarabs are scavengers that recycle dung, carrion, or decaying plant material. Others, such as the Japanese beetle, are plant-eaters, wreaking havoc on various crops and vegetation.\nSome of the well-known beetles from the Scarabaeidae are Japanese beetles, dung beetles, June beetles, rose chafers (Australian, European, and North American), rhinoceros beetles, Hercules beetles, and Goliath beetles.\nSeveral members of this family have structurally coloured shells which act as left-handed circular polarizers; this was the first-discovered example of circular polarization in nature.\nAncient Egypt.\nIn Ancient Egypt, the dung beetle now known as \"Scarabaeus sacer\" (formerly \"Ateuchus sacer\") was revered as sacred. Egyptian amulets representing the sacred scarab beetles were traded throughout the Mediterranean world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Using, for the most part, his own compositions, it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in Old Norse poetry. Snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach; he has systematized the material, and often notes that \"the older poets did not always\" follow his rules.\nMost of the forms depend on number of syllables per line, as well as assonance, consonance, and alliteration. Although end rhyme is represented, it does not function in the ways most modern English speakers expect (forms include AAAAAAAA, and AAAABBBB), and plays a very minor role. Understanding this work will be much easier if the First Grammatical Treatise is also available to hand.\nMany scholars have suggested that the form of \"H\u00e1ttatal\" suggests a classical influence deriving from the traditions of Christian learning to which Snorri was doubtlessly exposed.

In the \"Poetic Edda\" and the \"Prose Edda\", Vanaheimr is described as the location where the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was raised.\nAttestations.\nVanaheimr is mentioned a single time in the \"Poetic Edda\"; in a stanza of the poem \"Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l\". In \"Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l\", Gagnr\u00e1\u00f0r (the god Odin in disguise) engages in a game of wits with the j\u00f6tunn Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir. Gagnr\u00e1\u00f0r asks Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir whence the Van god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r came, for, though he rules over many hofs and h\u00f6rgrs, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was not raised among the \u00c6sir. Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir responds that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was created in Vanaheimr by \"wise powers\" and references that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was exchanged as a hostage during the \u00c6sir-Vanir War. In addition, Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir comments that, when the world ends (Ragnar\u00f6k), Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r will return to the \"wise Vanir\" (Bellows here anglicizes \"Vanir\" to \"Wanes\"):\nIn chapter 23 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", the enthroned figure of High says that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was raised in Vanaheimr, but was later sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir. \nThe \"Heimskringla\" book \"Ynglinga saga\" records an euhemerized account of the origins of Norse mythology. In chapter 1, \"Van Home or the Home of the Vanir\" is described as located around the Don River (which Snorri writes was once called \"Tana Fork\" or \"Vana Fork\"). Chapter 4 describes the \u00c6sir-Vanir War, noting that during a hostage exchange, the \u00c6sir sent the god H\u0153nir to Vanaheim and there he was immediately made chieftain. In chapter 15, the king Sveig\u00f0ir is recorded as having married a woman named Vana in \"Vanaland\", located in Sweden. The two produced a child, who they named Vanlandi (meaning \"Man from the Land of the Vanir\").\nTheories.\nThe existence of Nine Worlds receive mention in some Old Norse texts. These worlds are nowhere specifically listed in sequence, but are generally assumed to include Vanaheimr.

{"id": "72293", "revid": "49736349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72293", "title": "Mao Dun", "text": "Chinese writer (1896\u20131981)\nShen Dehong (Shen Yanbing; 4 July 1896 \u2013 27 March 1981), best known by the pen name of Mao Dun, was a Chinese novelist, essayist, journalist, playwright, literary and cultural critic. He was highly celebrated for his realist novels, including \"Midnight\", which depicts life in cosmopolitan Shanghai. Mao was one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party and participated in a number of left-wing cultural movements during the 1920s and 1930s. He was the editor-in-chief of \"Fiction Monthly\" and helped lead the League of Left-Wing Writers. He formed a strong friendship with fellow left-wing Chinese author Lu Xun. From 1949 to 1965, Mao served as the first Minister of Culture in the People's Republic of China.\nIn addition to novels, Mao Dun published a number of essays, scripts, theories, short stories, and novellas. He was well known for translating Western literature, as he had gained academic knowledge of European literature from his studies at Peking University. Additionally, although he was not the first person in China to translate the works of Scottish historical novelist Walter Scott, he is considered to be the first person to popularize Walter Scott's work in China through his \"Critical Biography\".\nHe adopted the pen name \"Mao Dun\" () to express the tension in the conflicting revolutionary ideology within China in the 1920s. The name means \"contradiction\", as Mao means spears and Dun means shields. His friend Ye Shengtao changed the first character from to , which literally means \"thatch\".\nEarly life.\nHis father, Shen Yongxi () taught and designed the curriculum for his son, but he died when Mao Dun was ten. Mao Dun's mother Chen Aizhu () then became his teacher. He mentions in his memoirs that \"my first instructor is my mother\". Through learning from his parents, Mao Dun developed great interest in writing as well as reading during his childhood.\nMao Dun had already started to develop his writing skills when he was still in primary school. In one examination the examiner commented on Mao Dun's script: '12 year old young child, can make this language, not says motherland nobody'. There were other similar comments which indicate that Mao Dun had been a brilliant writer since his youth.\nWhile Mao Dun was studying in secondary school in Hangzhou, extensive reading and strict writing skills training filled his life. He read the \"Wen Xuan\", \"Shishuo Xinyu\", and a large number of classical novels, which influenced his writing style.\nMao Dun entered the three-year foundation school offered by Peking University in 1913, in which he studied Chinese and Western literature. Due to financial difficulties, he had to quit in the summer of 1916, before his graduation. After quitting from university, he immediately got married with the daughter of Kong family, Kong Dezhi (\u5b54\u5fb7\u6c9a).\nThe trainings in Chinese and English as well as knowledge of Chinese and Western literature provided by the fifteen years of education Mao Dun received had prepared him to show up in the limelight of the Chinese journalistic and literary arena.\nJournalistic career.\nAfter graduation, Mao Dun soon got his first job in the English editing and translation sections of the Commercial Press,139 Shanghai branch. At the age of 21, he was invited to be the assistant editor of \"Xuesheng Zazhi\" () under the Commercial Press, which had published many articles about the new ideologies that had emerged in China at that time.\nApart from editing, Mao Dun also started to write about his social thoughts and criticisms. To some extent, he was inspired by the famous magazine \"New Youth\". Like in 1917 and 1918, he wrote two editorials for \"Xuesheng Zazhi\": \"Students and Society\" (\u5b78\u751f\u8207\u793e\u6703) and \"The Students of 1918\", those were significant in stimulating political consciousness among the young educated Chinese.\nHis early literary career also included writing children's literature.139\nAt 24 years of age, Mao Dun was already renowned as a novelist by the community in general, and in 1920, he and a group of young writers took over the magazine \"Fiction Monthly\", to publish literature by western authors, such as Tolstoy, Chekhov, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, Byron, Keats, and Shaw, and make new theories of literature better known. Despite the fact that he was a naturalistic novelist, he admired writers like Leo Tolstoy for their great artistic style.\nIn 1920, he was invited to edit a new column: \"The Fiction-New-Waves\" () in \"Fiction Monthly\". He even took up the post of Chief Editor of the Monthly in the same year and was obliged to reform it thoroughly, in response to the May Fourth Movement. His young writer friends in Beijing supported him by submitting their creative writings, translating Western literature and their views on new literature theories and techniques to the magazines. The Literary Study Group () was formed partly because of this. The reformed Monthly was proved to be a success. It had facilitated the continuation of the New Culture Movement by selling ten thousand copies a month and more importantly by introducing Literature for life, a brand new realistic approach to Chinese literature. In this period, Mao Dun had become a leading figure of the movement in the southern part of China.\nOn the notion of content reformation, both the innovative and conservative parties in the Commercial Press could not make a compromise. Mao Dun resigned from the Chief Editor of Fiction Monthly in 1923, but in 1927 he became the chief columnist of the \"Minguo yuebao\" (\u6c11\u56fd\u6708\u62a5). He wrote more than 30 editorials for this newspaper to criticize Chiang Kai-shek, and to support revolutions.\nPolitical life.\nInspired by the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia, Mao Dun took part in the May Fourth Movement in China. In 1920, he joined the Shanghai Communist Team, and helped to establish the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1921. At first, he worked as a liaison for the party. He also wrote for the party magazine \"The Communist Party\".\nAt the time, the CCP was allied with the Kuomintang in the First United Front. Mao Dun participated in Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition to reunite the country. He quit, however, when Chiang's Kuomintang broke with the Communists in 1927. In July 1928, he went to Japan in order to take refuge. As he returned to China in 1930, he joined the League of Left-Wing Writers. Later, China went to war with Japan and he actively engaged in resisting the Japanese attack in 1937. In 1949, the communist government took over and he was responsible for working as Mao Zedong's secretary and Culture Minister until 1965.\nLiterary career.\nAs a literary man, Mao Dun had a great number of achievements. His reforms at \"Fiction Monthly\" were his first contribution to Chinese literature. The magazine then became a place where \"New Literature\" circulated. Many famous writers like Lu Xun, Xu Dishan, Bing Xin, Ye Shengtao, had their works published through it. Mao Dun supported movements such as \"New Literature\" and \"New Thinking\". He believed that Chinese literature should have a place in the world.\nThe experience of political conflict broadened his horizon in literature, therefore the theme of his later writing was mostly based on this. He helped to found the League of Left-Wing Writers in 1930. After that, he worked together with Lu Xun to fight for the right of the society and the revolutionary movement in literature. The harvest period of Mao Dun's writing is considered to have been from 1927 to 1937.\n\"Shi\" (\u8680), also translated in English as \"The Eclipse\", was Mao's first novel. It was published in three volumes: \"Disillusions\" (\u5e7b\u706d, 1927), \"Wavering\" (\u52a8\u6447, 1928), and \"Pursuits\" (\u8ffd\u6c42, 1928). It tells the story of a generation of young intellectuals caught up in the world of revolutionary fervor without a true understanding of the nature of social change. His next major work was \"Rainbow\" (\u8679, 1929), which became famous for having no less than 70 main characters and numerous plot twists and turns. In 1933 came his next work, \"Midnight\", which gained great popularity, to a point that it was also published in French and English, and it allowed to develop a sense of revolutionary realism. It is a naturalistic novel exploring the commercial world of Shanghai in detail. In addition, his fiction offered a sympathetic portrayal of working-class life and praise of revolution. He left a work unfinished, the trilogy \"Shuangye Hongsi Eryuehua\" (\u971c\u53f6\u7ea2\u4f3c\u4e8c\u6708\u82b1, 1942).\nThe League of Left-Wing Writers was dissolved in a quarrel in 1936. After the initiation of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Mao traveled to many places and started a literary magazine in Wuhan. He edited the periodical \"Literary Front\" and the literary page of the newspaper \"Libao\" in Hong Kong and worked as a teacher.\nIn May 1940, Mao and his family traveled to Yan'an.146 In Yan'an, he wrote essays praising the Communist Party's transformation of the region through both cultivation of culture and of labor.146\nAfter 1943 Mao Dun did not produce any major works, but still wrote some articles and essays. In 1946 he visited the Soviet Union.\nWhen the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, he became active in several committees and he worked as the Secretary and then the Minister of Culture for Mao Zedong until 1965. He started the monthly literary journal Chinese Literature, which became the most popular for western readers. He was dismissed from his position as minister in 1964 due to the ideological upheavals. Despite this fact, Mao Dun survived the Cultural Revolution and was afterwards rehabilitated. In the 1970s he became an editor of a children's magazine, and began working on his memoirs, which were serialized in the Party publication, the quarterly \"Historical Materials on New literature\" (), but he died on 27 March 1981, before he could finish it. His influence on Chinese literature continues to the present day because he used his savings to set up a fund called the Mao Dun Literature Scholarship to promote an atmosphere for writing fiction.\nMao Dun's achievements in literature were also seen at his 50th birthday, which was also the 25th anniversary of his literary life. More than five hundred guests came to celebrate with him. Russian and American friends also joined the celebration. Wong Roufei wrote an essay as congratulations on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Mao Dun's influence and achievements in the literary field were witnessed. On the other hand, he was twice elected as the chairman and then once elected as the vice-chairman of the China Literary Arts Representative Assembly. His status in the literary field has been highly recognized. Although he suffered great pain from illness in his old age, he still kept writing his memoirs, called \"The Road I Walked\" ().\nBesides his achievements, Mao Dun also had great influence on Chinese literature. The Mao Dun Literature Prize was created due to Mao Dun's wish that outstanding novels should be encouraged and communist literature should be promoted. It is one of the most honorable literature awards in China. Many famous modern Chinese literary authors like Wei Wei and Zhou Keqin have received the prize.\nMarriage and personal life.\nMao Dun had a typical traditional Chinese marriage. His family got him engaged to the Kong family when he was five years old and he married the daughter of Kong family after he quit from university. After their marriage, the daughter of Kong family had been renamed as Kong Dezhi (\u5b54\u5fb7\u6c9a), and she would go on to assist Mao Dun with his literary and political career during their marriage. However, Mao had had a two-year long affair with Qin Dejun (\u79e6\u5fb7\u541b) during his marriage, which is also believed to have effects on his novel \"Rainbow\". In the end, Mao Dun ended the affair and returned to his own family.\nList of works.\nMao Dun has over 100 publications throughout his life, which includes short stories, novels, theories etc. Some of his most famous works include:\nTransition of female characters.\nThe 1930s is a turning point of the female characters' identity in Mao Dun's works. Between the 1920s and the 1930s, which was also the early period of Mao Dun's writing career, the female characters occurring in his works mostly were in identity of \"New Woman\", for instance, Mrs. Gui (\u6842\u963f\u59e8) and Qionghua (\u743c\u534e) in \"Wild Rose\" (\u91ce\u8537\u8587, 1929), Ms. Mei (\u6885\u5c0f\u59d0) in \"Rainbow\" (\u8679, 1930).\nHowever, from the 1930s, the \"New Woman\" characters in Mao Dun's works started to be replaced by the women who were living in traditional Chinese family. Furthermore, female characters even started to lose their own names. As in one of Mao Dun's short novels, which was released in the 1930s, Shui zaoxing (\u6c34\u85fb\u884c), the only female character did not even have an actual name but only be called as \"Xiusheng (one of the two main male characters)'s wife (\u79c0\u751f\u59bb)\" in the novel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By 2024, Peking University's staff included 54 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 16 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and 20 members of the World Academy of Sciences.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nFollowing China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, intellectuals \u2013 including Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu \u2013 called for reforms to the country's education system. In June 1896, Minister Li Duanfen proposed to create a university in the capital. On 11 June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor, as part of the Hundred Days' Reform, authorised the creation of the Imperial University of Peking (). The Imperial University was formally established on 3 July 1898 when the emperor approved the royal charter written by Liang. Minister Sun Jianai was charged with the implementation. IUP served as the country's foremost institute for higher learning, but also as its highest educational authority. William Alexander Parsons Martin was appointed as the first president. Most of the reforms were abolished when the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power on 21 September. The university survived with altered objectives and reduced scope. It opened on 31 December with 160 students, instead of the planned 500.\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution, the Imperial University of Peking was renamed \"Government University of Peking\" in 1912 and then \"National University of Peking\" in 1919 ().\nEarly Republic of China period (1916\u20131927).\nThe noted scholar Cai Yuanpei was appointed president on December 26, 1917. He helped transform Peking University into the country's largest institution of higher learning, with 14 departments and an enrollment of more than 2,000 students. President Cai, inspired by the German model of academic freedom, introduced faculty governance and democratic management to the university. Cai recruited an intellectually diverse faculty that included some of the most prominent figures in the progressive New Culture Movement, including Hu Shih, Liu Bannong, Ma Yinchu, Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, Lu Xun and Liang Shuming. Meanwhile, leading conservatives Gu Hongming and Huang Kan also taught at the university. A firm supporter for freedom of thought, Cai advocated for educational independence and resigned several times protesting the government's policy and interference.\nOn 1 May 1919, some students of Peking University learned that the Treaty of Versailles would allow Japan to receive Germany's colonising rights in Shandong province. An assembly at Peking University that included these students and representatives from other universities in Beijing was quickly organised. On 4 May, students from thirteen universities marched to Tiananmen to protest the terms of Treaty of Versailles, demanded the Beiyang government to refuse to sign the treaty. Demonstrators also demanded the immediate resignation of three officials: Cao Rulin, Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Zhang Zongxiang, China's Ambassador to Japan and Lu Zongyu, Minister of Currency, who they believed were in cooperation with Japanese. The protest ended up with some protesters being beaten and arrested, and Cao Rulin's house burned by protesters. Following the protest on 4 May, students, workers and merchants from nearly all China's major cities went on strike and boycotted Japanese goods in China. The Beiyang government eventually agreed to release the arrested students and fired the three officials under intense public pressure, China's representatives in Paris refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles.During the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign of 1973 to 1976, critique groups formed at Peking University and Tsinghua University disseminated commentaries under the pseudonym of \"Liang Xiao\". The pseudonym sounds like a person's name but is a homophone for \"two schools\".\nWorld War Two (1938\u20131946).\nDuring the Second World War, Peking University staff joined Tsinghua University and Nankai University staff in establishing the National Southwestern Associated University. Based in Kunming, Yunnan, this institution saw a period of high productivity that would shape the course of Chinese intellectual history and its reconstruction post-war.\n21st century (2001\u2013present).\nIn October 2015, Peking University alumnus and Professor Tu Youyou was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discovery of artemisinin. Having saved millions of lives, artemisinin has made significant contributions to global health in regard to the fight against malaria.\nOn 20 February 2017, the university officially signed a contract with the Open University to establish the Oxford Campus of Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University Oxford Center and Shenzhen Oxford Innovation Center.\nOn 29 June 2020, the Sino-Russian Mathematics Center was established. The Sino-Russian Mathematics Center is led by Peking University and Moscow State University, and jointly constructed by relevant domestic units and other Russian universities and research institutes such as St. Petersburg University, relying on the \"Double First-class\" construction alliance in mathematics.\nOn 2 April 2021, Peking University Nanchang Innovation Research Institute was inaugurated.\nOn 15 July 2021, Peking University School of Integrated Circuitswas inaugurated.\nOn 6 September 2021, the new Changping campus of Peking University was officially opened, welcoming the first batch of teachers and students. On 30 September, Peking University Lanyuan Centre was officially launched. The first dean of Lanyuan Centre is Ke Yang, Professor of Peking University School of Clinical Oncology and a foreign academician of the American Academy of Medical Sciences. In October, Peking University officially announced the establishment of Peking University School of Computer Science, which means the computer major of Peking University was officially upgraded from a department to a school. Yang Fuqing, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, served as the honorary president.\nIn 2022, Peking University and Lancet established a commission on healthy aging in China.162 The Commission's purpose is to re-focus the debate on aging not just on the risks of China's aging population but on opportunities by \"unleashing the intellectual and vocational capacities of the older population and the whole of Chinese society.\"162\nIn June 2022, the International University Sports Federation (FISU) released the first series of \"Healthy Campus\" list. Peking University, as the only Chinese university that has obtained platinum certification from the International University Sports Federation, participated in 4 projects and became the only representative from China among 130 projects worldwide.\nIn March 2025, PKU split its former Faculty of Information and Engineering into two new faculties\u2014Faculty of Informatics and Faculty of Engineering, with the latter having added two newly established schools\u2014School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics and School of Mechanics and Engineering Science.\nCampus.\nThe university campus is on the former site of Qing dynasty imperial gardens and it retains traditional Chinese-style landscaping, including traditional houses, gardens, pagodas, and notable historical buildings and structures. American architect and art historian Talbot Hamlin designed some of the university's buildings constructed during the 1919 to 1922 period. There are several gates that lead into campus \u2014 East, West and South gates, with the West Gate being the most well known for the painted murals on its ceiling. Weiming Lake is in the north of the campus and is surrounded by walking paths and small gardens. The university hosts many museums, such as the Museum of University History and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum of Art and Archaeology. Notable items in these museums include funerary objects that were excavated in Beijing and date back thousands of years from the graves of royals of the Warring States period. There are ritual pottery vessels as well as elaborate pieces of jewelry on display. There are also human bones set up in the traditional burial style of that period.\nBeyond its main campus, Peking University Health Science Center (PKUHSC) is on Xueyuan Road where the country's most distinguished colleges are, and is a fitting site for academics and research.\nDuring the Third Front construction, Peking University opened a branch in Hanzhong, Shaanxi.179\nIn 2001, Peking University's Shenzhen campus, the Shenzhen Graduate School, opened its doors. The campus is located in the northwest part of Shenzhen City.\nAcademics.\nPeking University consists of 55 schools and departments, with 137 majors for undergraduates, 59 Master's degree programs, and 59 doctoral programs. In addition to basic research, the university also conducts applied research.\nAt present, Peking University has 420 research institutions, including 7 State Key Laboratories, 5 National Engineering Research Centers, and 1 National Laboratory. With 8 million holdings, the university library is the largest of its kind in Asia.\nPeking University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Emory University jointly administer the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.\nOver the past century, some Peking University alumni have become presidents of other major Chinese universities, including former Tsinghua President Luo Jialun, Renmin University President Yuan Baohua, Zhejiang University President Qian Sanqiang, Fudan University President Zhang Zhirang, Nankai University President Teng Weizao, Chinese University of Science and Technology President Guan Weiyan and many others.\nRankings and reputation.\nGeneral rankings.\nSeveral rankings have placed Peking University among the top universities in mainland China.

BiMBA has also been ranked as the second most valuable full-time MBA in China by Forbes (after CEIBS) and among Asia's best business schools by Bloomberg Business.\nShenzhen Graduate School.\nPeking University Shenzhen Graduate School is a satellite campus of Peking University located in Shenzhen, Guangdong. It was founded in September 2001 in collaboration with the Shenzhen Municipal Government and is located in University Town of Shenzhen along with Tsinghua University Shenzhen International Graduate School and Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) campus. Dr. Wen Hai, a renowned economist in China and the vice-president of Peking University is the present chancellor of PKU Shenzhen. The graduate school houses several research schools including, Peking University HSBC Business School and Peking University School of Transnational Law.\nOn 29 August 2016, Peking University signed a strategic agreement with the Shenzhen Municipal Government to further develop its Shenzhen Graduate School, the university plans build a brand new campus near the existed graduate school and open undergraduate programs.\nInternational cooperation.\nEvery year, there are approximately 7,000 international students studying at Peking University.\nPeking University offers dual degree programs at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels with the renowned Waseda University (\u65e9\u7a32\u7530\u5927\u5b66) in Northeast Asia. It is one of the most engaged partners with Waseda, having established a strong cooperative relationship of the highest level. This partnership began with an academic agreement in 1982, enhancing dual degree programs and joint research initiatives since 2003. Under the PKU-Waseda project, each year, the university selects undergraduates to spend their third year studying at Waseda University in Japan, and then they return to Peking University for their fourth year. Simultaneously, Waseda University sends numerous students to Peking University as exchange students. Upon graduation, students receive two bachelor's degrees, one from each university. Additionally, joint master's student training programs and dual doctoral degree programs with Waseda University are also in operation. The comprehensive collaboration of offering dual degrees at all bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels, as seen in the Peking-Waseda partnership, is rare on a global scale.\nThe dormitories for international students at the main campus are located at \"Shaoyuan Garden\" (\u52fa\u56ed) and \"Zhongguanyuan Global Village\" (\u4e2d\u5173\u65b0\u56ed). Its international students are made up of students from most countries in the world including most of Western Europe, North America, and South America, Asia, Australia and many countries in Africa. In 2005, Peking University and Cornell University signed an agreement formally establishing the China and Asia-Pacific Studies major at Cornell, which requires students to spend a semester studying at Peking University while working at internships. In 2006, PKU launched a joint undergraduate program with Yale University in which students will spend a semester overseas, living and studying together with the host institute's students. PKU's School of International Studies also launched joint degree programs with London School of Economics, Paris School of International Affairs, Seoul National University, and the University of Tokyo. PKU also has a longstanding relationship with Stanford University which operates a joint research center and base for Stanford students and scholars at the Stanford Center at Peking University, located in the Lee Jung Sen Building. The Peking University HSBC Business School has joint degree programs with University of Hong Kong and Chinese University of Hong Kong. The university has maintained a partnership with the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin since 1981 and the Higher School of Economics since 2015, and in 2019, became a partner of Washington University in St. Louis through the McDonnell International Scholars Academy.\nGlobal excellence strategy.\nOn the 121st founding anniversary, Peking University unveiled the \"Global Excellence Strategy\", an international blueprint aiming to enhance Peking University's global presence during the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\". The \"Global Excellence Strategy\" aims to strengthen international cooperation, overcome development barriers, gather global resources, and stimulate collegial relationships. The Global Excellence Strategy is based upon the English word \"CLOUDS\", representing the \"cloud era\" of the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\". Each letter stands for a corresponding word, namely creativity, leadership, openness, uniqueness, diversity and shaping.\nArt research.\nPeking University has participated in many joint art-research projects, such as the Center for the Art of East Asia (CAEA) with the University of Chicago, and Department of Digital Art and Design with UNESCO.\nNotable people.\nNotable alumni.\nNotable alumni include the current chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the third-ranking member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee Zhao Leji.

First popularized around 1901, became a geopolitical goal of the German Empire in World War I (1914\u20131918), as the core element of the of territorial expansion.&lt;ref name=\"E/N301\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme form of this ideology was promoted and initiated by the Nazi Party, that had ruled Nazi Germany, whose ultimate goal of which was to establish a Greater German Reich. was a leading motivation of Nazi Germany to initiate World War II, and it would continue this policy until the end of the conflict.\nFollowing Adolf Hitler's rise to power, became an ideological principle of Nazism and provided justification for the German territorial expansion into Central and Eastern Europe. The Nazi policy (lit.\u2009'Master Plan for the East') was based on its tenets. It stipulated that Germany required a \"\" necessary for its survival and that most of the populations of Central and Eastern Europe would have to be removed permanently (either through mass deportation to Siberia, extermination, or enslavement), including Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Belarusian, Czech, and other Slavic nations considered non-Aryan. The Nazi government aimed at repopulating these lands with Germanic colonists in the name of during and following World War II. Entire populations were ravaged by starvation; any agricultural surplus was used to feed Germany. The Jewish population was to be exterminated outright.\nHitler's strategic program for Greater Germany was based on the belief in the power of , especially when pursued by a racially superior society. People deemed to be part of non-Aryan races, within the territory of expansion, were subjected to expulsion or destruction. The eugenics of assumed it to be the right of the German Aryan master race () to remove the indigenous people in the name of their own living space. They took inspiration for this concept from outside Germany, particularly the European colonization of North America. Hitler and Nazi officials took a particular interest in manifest destiny, and attempted to replicate it in occupied Europe. Nazi Germany also supported other Axis powers' expansionist ideologies such as Fascist Italy's and the Empire of Japan's .\nOrigins.\nIn the 19th century, the term was used by the German geographer and biologist Oscar Peschel in his 1860 review of Charles Darwin's \"Origins of Species\" (1859). In 1897, the geographer and ethnographer Friedrich Ratzel in his book applied the word (\"living space\") to describe physical geography as a factor that influences human activities in developing into a society. In 1901, Ratzel extended his thesis in his essay titled \"Lebensraum: A Biogeographical Study\". Ratzel wrote in the time when the overseas space for colonial expansion almost ended leaving few sovereign void. The event was emphasized by the contemporary observers and later called by Michael Heffernan \"global closure.\" The latter concept is reflected in the main point of the work:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Everything that wants space on our planet earth must draw on the finite amount of 506 million square kilometres of its surface. This number, therefore, represents the first spatial factor where the history of life is concerned, and it also represents the last. It determines all other factors; it is the yardstick for all other factors; it encompasses the absolute limits of all physical life... There is a tension between the movement of life, which never rests, and the space on earth, which does not change. It is from this tension that the struggle for space is born... The struggle for life... primarily means nothing more than a struggle for space.\nThe same, Ratzel continued, applies to \"the struggle of nations that we call battles\" and \"in a narrow space the struggle becomes desperate.\" Ratzel pointed to historical precedent of drang nach osten in the Middle Ages, when the social and economic pressures of rapid population growth in the German states had led to a steady colonization of Germanic peoples in Eastern Europe.\nBetween 1886 and 1914 became increasingly used as a justification for the German colonization of Africa; and was an influential factor during the Herero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa, from 1904 to 1908. The ethnic cleansing of Herero and Nama people was done in response to an attack on German settlers and soldiers on 12 January 1904.\nDuring the First World War, the Allied naval blockade of the Central Powers caused food shortages in Germany, and resources from German colonies in Africa were unable to slip past the blockade; this caused support to rise during the war for a that would expand Germany eastward into Russia to gain control of their resources to prevent such a situation from occurring in the future. In the period between the First and the Second World Wars, German nationalists adopted the term in their political demands for the re-establishment of the German colonial empire, which had been dismembered by the Allies at Versailles. Ratzel said that the development of a people into a society was primarily influenced by their geographic situation (habitat) and that a society that successfully adapted to one geographic territory would naturally and logically expand the boundaries of their nation into another territory. Yet, to resolve German overpopulation, Ratzel pointed out that Imperial Germany (1871\u20131918) required overseas colonies to which surplus Germans ought to emigrate.\nGeopolitics.\nFriedrich Ratzel's metaphoric concept of society as an organism\u2014which grows and shrinks in logical relation to its (habitat)\u2014proved especially influential upon the Swedish political scientist and conservative politician Johan Rudolf Kjell\u00e9n (1864\u20131922), who interpreted that biological metaphor as a geopolitical natural-law. In the political monograph (1917; \"Sweden\"), Kjell\u00e9n coined the terms (the conditions and problems of a state that arise from its geographic territory), (the economic factors that affect the power of the state), and (the social problems that arise from the racial composition of the state) to explain the political particulars to be considered for the successful administration and governing of a state. Moreover, he had a great intellectual influence upon the politics of Imperial Germany, especially with (1916; \"The State as a Life-form\"), an earlier political-science book read by the society of Imperial Germany, for whom the concept of acquired an ideological definition unlike the original, human-geography definition.\nKjell\u00e9n's geopolitical interpretation of the concept was adopted, expanded, and adapted to the politics of Germany by publicists of imperialism such as the militarist General Friedrich von Bernhardi (1849\u20131930) and the political geographer and proponent of geopolitics Karl Haushofer (1869\u20131946). In (1911; \"Germany and the Next War\"), General von Bernhardi developed Friedrich Ratzel's concept as a racial struggle for living space, explicitly identified Eastern Europe as the source of a new, national habitat for the German people, and said that the next war would be expressly for acquiring \u2014all in fulfillment of the \"biological necessity\" to protect German racial supremacy. Vanquishing the Slavic and the Latin races was deemed necessary because \"without war, inferior or decaying races would easily choke the growth of healthy, budding elements\" of the German race\u2014thus, the war for was a necessary means of defending Germany against cultural stagnation and the racial degeneracy of miscegenation.\nRacial ideology.\nIn the national politics of Weimar Germany, the geopolitical usage of is credited to Karl Ernst Haushofer and his Institute of Geopolitics, in Munich, especially the ultra-nationalist interpretation of it, which was used as a justification for the desire to avenge Germany's military defeat at the end of the First World War (1914\u201318) and the desire to reverse the dictates of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which reduced Germany geographically, economically, and militarily. Hitler said that the Nazi geopolitics of \"inevitable expansion\" would reverse overpopulation, provide natural resources, and uphold German national honor. In (1925; \"My Struggle\"), Hitler presented his conception of as the philosophic basis for the Greater Germanic Reich that was destined to colonize Eastern Europe\u2014especially Ukraine in the Soviet Union\u2014and so resolve the problems of overpopulation, and that the European states had to accede to his geopolitical demands.\nThe Nazi Party's usages of the term were explicitly racial, to justify the mystical right of the racially superior Germanic peoples () to fulfill their cultural destiny at the expense of racially inferior peoples (), such as the Slavs of Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and the other non\u2013Germanic peoples of \"the East\". Based upon Johan Rudolf Kjell\u00e9n's geopolitical interpretation of Friedrich Ratzel's human-geography term, the Nazi regime (1933\u201345) established as the racist rationale of the foreign policy by which they began the Second World War, on 1 September 1939, in an effort to realise the Greater Germanic Reich at the expense of the societies of Eastern Europe.\nPrussian policy.\nSome Prussian politicians were increasingly thinking in terms of \"Lebensraum\" by 1907. In 1902, the Prussian government had already allocated 200,000,000 \u2133\ufe01 for purposes of German colonization of Polish portions of eastern Prussia. These funds were intended to support the creation of settlements by acquiring Polish estates. By 1907, Prussian Chancellor B\u00fclow was promoting bills that explicitly called for the forced sale of Polish estates. A bill in late 1907 asked for another $100,000,000 for expropriations.\nIn 1903, the Prussian authorities tried a Polish countess for \"presenting a false heir\" for an estate near Wr\u00f3blewo. The case, tried in Berlin, generated crowds of people and police. Observers expressed concern that Prussian \"race partiality\" would result in a guilty verdict.\nFirst World War nationalist premise.\nIn September 1914, when the German victory in the First World War appeared feasible, the German government introduced the as an official war aim (), which was secretly ordered by Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg (1909\u201317), whereby, upon achieving battlefield victory, Germany would annex territories from western Poland to form the Polish Border Strip (, c.\u200930,000\u00a0km2, 12,000 square miles). would be realised by way of ethnic cleansing, the forcible removal of the local Slavic and Jewish populations, and the subsequent repopulation of the border strip with ethnic German colonists; likewise, the colonisations of Lithuania and Ukraine. However, military over-extension lost the war for Imperial Germany, and the went unrealised.\nIn April 1915, Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg authorised the Polish Border Strip plans in order to take advantage of the extensive territories in Eastern Europe that Germany had conquered and held since early in the war. The decisive campaigns of Imperial Germany almost realised in the East, especially when Bolshevik Russia unilaterally withdrew as a combatant in the \"Great War\" among the European great powers\u2014the Triple Entente (the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom) and the Central Powers (the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria).\nIn March 1918, in an effort to reform and modernise the Russian Empire into a soviet republic, the Bolshevik government agreed to the strategically onerous territorial cessions stipulated in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (33% of arable land, 30% of industry, and 90% of the coal mines of Russia). As a result, Russia yielded to Germany much of the arable land of European Russia, the Baltic governorates, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Caucasus region. Despite such an extensive geopolitical victory, tactical defeat in the Western Front, strategic over-extension, and factional division in government compelled Imperial Germany to abandon the Eastern European gained with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in favour of the peace-terms of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), and yielded those Russian lands to Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine.\nAs a for the conquest and colonisation of Polish territories as living-space and defensive-border for Imperial Germany, the derived from a foreign policy initially proposed by General Erich Ludendorff in 1914. Twenty-five years later, Nazi foreign policy resumed the cultural goal of the pursuit and realisation of German living-space at the expense of non-German peoples in Eastern Europe with the September Campaign (1 September \u2013 6 October 1939) that began the Second World War in Europe. In \"Germany and the Two World Wars\", the German historian Andreas Hillgruber said that the territorial gains of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918) were the imperial prototype for Adolf Hitler's Greater German Empire in Eastern Europe:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the moment of the November 1918 ceasefire in the West, newspaper maps of the military situation showed German troops in Finland, holding a line from the Finnish fjords near Narva, down through Pskov\u2013Orsha\u2013Mogilev and the area south of Kursk, to the Don east of Rostov. Germany had thus secured Ukraine. The Russian recognition of Ukraine's separation, exacted at Brest\u2013Litovsk, represented the key element in German efforts to keep Russia perpetually subservient. In addition, German troops held the Crimea, and were stationed, in smaller numbers, in Transcaucasia. Even the unoccupied \"rump\" Russia appeared\u2014with the conclusion of the German\u2013Soviet Supplementary Treaty, on 28 August 1918\u2014to be in firm, though indirect, dependency on the . Thus, Hitler's long-range aim, fixed in the 1920s, of erecting a German Eastern Imperium on the ruins of the Soviet Union was not simply a vision emanating from an abstract wish. In the Eastern sphere, established in 1918, this goal had a concrete point of departure. The German Eastern Imperium had already been\u2014if only for a short time\u2014a reality.\u2014\u200a\nThe (1914) documents \" in the East\" as philosophically integral to Germanic culture throughout the history of Germany; and that is not a racialist philosophy particular to the 20th century. As military strategy, the was unsuccessful due to its infeasibility, with too few soldiers to realise the plans during a two-front war. Politically, the allowed the Imperial Government to learn the opinions of the nationalist, economic, and military elites of the German ruling class who financed and facilitated geopolitics. Nationally, the annexation and ethnic cleansing of Poland for German was an official and a popular subject of \"nationalism-as-national-security\" endorsed by German society, including the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP). In \"The Origins of the Second World War\", the British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is equally obvious that always appeared as one element in these blueprints. This was not an original idea of Hitler's. It was commonplace at the time. (\"People Without Space\"), for instance, by Hans Grimm sold much better than when it was published in 1925. For that matter, plans for acquiring new territory were much aired in Germany during the First World War. It used to be thought that these were the plans of a few crack-pot theorisers or of extremist organisations. Now we know better. In 1961, a German professor Fritz Fischer reported the results of his investigations into German war aims. These were indeed a \"blueprint for aggression\", or, as the professor called them, \"a grasp at world power\": Belgium under German control, the French iron-fields annexed to Germany, and, what is more, Poland and Ukraine to be cleared of their inhabitants and resettled with Germans. These plans were not merely the work of the German General Staff. They were endorsed by the German Foreign Office and by the \"Good German\", Bethmann\u2013Hollweg.\u2014\u200a\nInterwar propaganda.\nIn the national politics of the Weimar Republic (1919\u201333), the German eugenicists took up the nationalist political slogan of , and matched it with the racial slogan (a People without Youth), a cultural proposition that ignored the declining German birth rate (since the 1880s) and contradicted the popular belief that the \"German race\" was a vigorous and growing people. Despite each slogan (political and racial) being contradicted by the reality of such demographic facts, the nationalists' demands for proved to be ideologically valid politics in Weimar Germany.\nIn the lead-up to (1938) and the invasion of Poland (1939), the propaganda of the Nazi Party in Germany used popular feelings of wounded national identity aroused in the aftermath of the First World War to promote policies of . Studies of the homeland focused on the lost colonies after the establishment of the Second Polish Republic, which was ratified by the Treaty of Versailles (), as well as the \"eternal Jewish threat\" (, 1937). Emphasis was put on the need for rearmament and the pseudoscience of superior races in the pursuit of \"blood and soil\" ().\nDuring the twenty-one-year inter-war period between the First (1914\u201318) and the Second (1939\u201345) World War, for Germany was the principal tenet of the extremist nationalism that characterised German party politics. The Nazis, led by Adolf Hitler, demanded not only the geographic reversion of Germany's post-war borders (to recuperate territory lost by the Treaty of Versailles), but also the German conquest and colonisation of Eastern Europe (whether or not those lands were German before 1918). To that end, Hitler said that flouting the Treaty of Versailles was required for Germany to obtain needed in Eastern Europe. During the 1920s, Heinrich Himmler\u2014as a member of the Artaman League, an anti-Slav, anti-urban, and anti-Semitic organisation of \"blood and soil\" ideology\u2014developed the ideas that advocated , for the realisation of which he said that the:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Increase [of] our peasant population is the only effective defense against the influx of the Slav working-class masses from the East. As six hundred years ago, the German peasant's destiny must be to preserve and increase the German people's patrimony in their holy mother earth battle against the Slav race.\nHitlerite doctrine of.\nIn (1925), Hitler dedicated a full chapter\u2014titled \"Eastern Orientation or Eastern Policy\"\u2014to outlining the need for the new \"living space\" for Germany. He claimed that in his vision, the expanding number of German people would require more land, visually expressing it in speeches by stretching and yawning to evoke an image of living in comfort and contentment. He also believed achieving required political will, and that the Nazi movement ought to strive to expand population area for the German people and acquire new sources of food.\n became the principal foreign-policy goal of the Nazi Party and the government of Nazi Germany (1933\u201345). Hitler rejected the restoration of the pre-war borders of Germany as an inadequate half-measure towards reducing purported national overpopulation. From that perspective, he opined that the nature of national borders is always unfinished and momentary, and that their redrawing must continue as Germany's political goal. Identifying the conquest of as a major ideological goal of his party, Hitler wrote in \"Mein Kampf\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And so, we National Socialists consciously draw a line beneath the foreign policy tendency of our pre\u2013War period. We take up where we broke off six hundred years ago. We stop the endless German movement to the south and west, and turn our gaze toward the land in the East. At long last, we break off the colonial and commercial policy of the pre\u2013War period and shift to the soil policy of the future. But when we speak of new territory in Europe today we must principally think of Russia and the border States subject to her.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The motif of winning a person (or subduing an enemy) by holding him through all forms of transformation is found throughout Europe in folktales.\nThe story has been adapted into numerous stories, songs, and films. It is also associated with a reel of the same name, which is also known as the \"Glasgow Reel\".\nTam Lin is listed as the 39th Child Ballad and number 35 in the Roud Folk Song Index.\nSynopsis.\nMost variants begin with the warning that Tam Lin collects either a possession or the virginity of any maiden who passes through the forest of Carterhaugh. When a young woman, usually called Janet or Margaret, goes to Carterhaugh and plucks a double rose, Tam appears and asks her why she has come without his leave and taken what is his. She states that she owns Carterhaugh because her father has given it to her.\nIn most variants, Janet then goes home and discovers that she is pregnant; some variants pick up the story at this point. When asked about her condition, she declares that her baby's father is an elf whom she will not forsake. In some versions, she is informed of a herb that will induce abortion; in all the variants, when she returns to Carterhaugh and picks a plant, either the same roses as on her earlier visit or the herb, Tam reappears and challenges her action.\nShe asks him whether he was ever human, either after that reappearance or, in some versions, immediately after their first meeting resulted in her pregnancy. Tam Lin reveals that, though he was once a mortal man, he was imprisoned in Carterhaugh by the Queen of Faeries after she kidnapped him by catching him when he fell from his horse. He goes on to tell Janet that the fairies give one of their people as a teind (tithe) to Hell at midnight on every seventh Hallowe'en. He asks Janet for her help in freeing him, and receives her agreement; he then instructs her to come to the forest at the time of the tithe, during which he'll be in the company of numerous faerie knights -- he tells her that she'll recognize him by his white horse. Janet must pull him down from his horse, thus making her the one to \"catch\" him this time, and hold him tightly: he warns her that the fairies will attempt to make her drop him by turning him into all manner of beasts (see Proteus), but states that none of these forms will actually cause her harm. Tam Lin will eventually take the shape of burning coal; when this occurs, Janet is to throw him into a well, whereupon he will reappear as a naked mortal man whom Janet must hide. She does as she is asked and wins her knight; though her success angers the Queen of Faeries, the latter accepts her defeat.\nIn different variations, Tam Lin is reportedly the grandson of the Laird of Roxburgh, the Laird of Foulis, the Earl of Forbes, or the Earl of Murray. His name also varies between versions (Tam Lin being the most common) as Tom Line, Tomlin, Young Tambling, Tam-a-line and Tamlane.\nEarly versions.\nThe ballad dates to at least as early as 1549 (the publication date of \"The Complaynt of Scotland\" that mentions \"The Tayl of the \u021cong Tamlene\" ('The Tale of the Young Tamelene') among a long list of medieval romances). Michael Drayton's narrative poem \"Nimphidia\" (1627) includes a character called Tomalin who is a vassal and kinsman of Oberon, King of the Fairies. Robert Burns wrote a version of Tam Lin based on older versions of the ballad, which was printed in James Johnson's \"Scots Musical Museum\" (1796).\nThe story featured in several nineteenth century books of fairy tales under different titles :\nFrancis James Child collected fourteen traditional variants in \"The English and Scottish Popular Ballads\" in the nineteenth century. (Another Child ballad, \"Burd Ellen and Young Tamlane\", has no connection with this ballad except for the similarity of the heroes' names.)\nMotifs.\nChild took the threat to take out Tam Lin's eyes as a common folklore precaution against mortals who could see fairies, in the tales of fairy ointment. Joseph Jacobs interpreted it as rather a reversal of the usual practice; the Queen of Faeries would have kept him from seeing the human woman who rescued him.\nIn some variants, \"Hind Etin\" has verses identical to this for the first meeting between the hero and the heroine.\nInfluences.\nField recordings.\nThe ballad has been recorded several times from Scottish and Northern Irish people who learned it in the oral tradition. Eddie Butcher of Magilligan, County Londonderry knew a fragment of the ballad which can be heard via the Irish Traditional Music Archive, and Paddy Tunney of Mollybreen, County Fermanagh sang a version to Hugh Shields in 1968. In Scotland, Duncan Williamson of Auchtermuchty, Fifeshire, William Whyte of Aberdeen and Betsy Johnston of Glasgow all had traditional versions recorded, the latter two by Hamish Henderson.\nPopular recordings of the ballad.\nFollowing are some of the notable recordings of the ballad, including their artists, titles, albums, and years:\nBenjamin Zephaniah was awarded Best Original Song in the Hancocks 2008, Talkawhile Awards for Folk Music (as voted by members of Talkawhile.co.uk) for \"Tam Lyn Retold\". He collected the award at The Cambridge Folk Festival on 2 August 2008.\nPopular instrumental recordings.\nFollowing are some of the notable instrumental recordings, including their artists, titles, albums, and years:\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He co-founded with Andr\u00e9 Breton and Philippe Soupault the surrealist review \"Litt\u00e9rature\". He was also a novelist and editor, a long-time member of the Communist Party and a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt. After 1959, he was a frequent nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nEarly life (1897\u20131939).\nLouis Aragon was born in Paris. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother, believing them to be his sister and foster mother, respectively. His biological father, , a former senator for Forcalquier, was married and thirty years older than Aragon's mother, whom he seduced when she was seventeen. Aragon's mother passed Andrieux off to her son as his godfather. Aragon was only told the truth at the age of 19, as he was leaving to serve in the First World War, from which neither he nor his parents believed he would return. Andrieux's refusal or inability to recognize his son would influence Aragon's poetry later on.\nHaving been involved in Dadaism from 1919 to 1924, he became a founding member of Surrealism in 1924, with Andr\u00e9 Breton and Philippe Soupault, under the pen-name \"Aragon\". In 1923, during the trial of Germaine Berton, Aragon released a 29 portrait piece in \"La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste\" in support of her stating Berton \"\"use terrorist means, in particular murder, to safeguard, at the risk of losing everything, what seems to her\u2014 rightly or wrongly \u2014 precious beyond anything in the world\".\nIn the 1920s, Aragon became a fellow traveller of the French Communist Party (PCF) along with several other surrealists, and joined the Party in January 1927.\nIn 1933, he began to write for the party's newspaper, \"L'Humanit\u00e9\", in the \"news in brief\" section. He would remain a member for the rest of his life, writing several political poems including one to Maurice Thorez, the general secretary of the PCF. During the https:// (1935), Aragon opposed his former friend Andr\u00e9 Breton, who wanted to use the opportunity as a tribune to defend the writer Victor Serge, associated with Leon Trotsky's Left Opposition.\nAragon was also critical of the USSR, particularly after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1956) during which Joseph Stalin's personality cult was denounced by Nikita Khrushchev.\nThe French surrealists had long claimed Lewis Carroll as one of their own, and Aragon published his translation of \"The Hunting of the Snark\" in 1929, \"shortly before he completed his transition from Snarxism to Marxism\", as Martin Gardner puts it. Witness the key stanza of the poem in Aragon's translation:\nGardner, who calls the translation \"pedestrian\" and deems the rest of Aragon's writings on Carroll's nonsense poetry full of factual errors, says that there is no evidence that Aragon intended any of it as a joke.\nThe \"Commune\" (1933\u20131939).\nApart from working as a journalist for \"L'Humanit\u00e9\", Louis Aragon also became, along with Paul Nizan, editor secretary of the journal \"Commune\", published by the \"Association des \u00c9crivains et Artistes R\u00e9volutionnaires\" (Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists), which aimed at gathering intellectuals and artists in a common front against fascism. Aragon became a member of the directing committee of the \"Commune\" journal in January 1937, along with Andr\u00e9 Gide, Romain Rolland and Paul Vaillant-Couturier. The journal then took the name of \"French literary review for the defence of culture\" (\"\u00ab revue litt\u00e9raire fran\u00e7aise pour la d\u00e9fense de la culture \u00bb\"). \nWith Gide's withdrawal in August 1937, Vaillant-Couturier's death in the autumn of 1937 and Romain Rolland's old age, Aragon became its effective director. In December 1938, he called as chief editor the young writer Jacques Decour. The \"Commune\" journal was strongly involved in the mobilization of French intellectuals in favour of the Spanish Republic.\nDirector of \"Ce soir\" (1937\u20131953).\nIn March 1937, Aragon was called on by the PCF to head the new evening daily \"Ce soir\", which he was charged with launching, along with the writer Jean-Richard Bloch. \"Ce soir\" attempted to compete with \"Paris-soir\". Outlawed in August 1939, \"Ce soir\" was re-opened after the Liberation, and Aragon again became its lead, first with Bloch then alone after Bloch's death in 1947. The newspaper, which counted \u00c9mile Dano\u00ebn among its collaborators, closed in March 1953.\nWorld War II (1939\u20131945).\nIn 1939, he married Russian-born author Elsa Triolet, the sister of Lilya Brik, a mistress and then partner of Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. He had met her in 1928, and she became his muse starting in the 1940s. Aragon and Triolet collaborated in the left-wing French media before and during World War II, going underground for most of the German occupation.\nAragon was mobilized in 1939, and awarded the \"Croix de Guerre\" (War Cross) and the military medal for acts of bravery. After the May 1940 defeat, he took refuge in the southern zone. He was one of several poets, along with Ren\u00e9 Char, Francis Ponge, Robert Desnos, Paul \u00c9luard, Jean Pr\u00e9vost, , etc., to join the Resistance, both through literary activities and as an actual organizer of Resistance acts.\nOtto Abetz was the German governor, and produced a series of \"black lists\" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi Occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. Aragon and Andr\u00e9 Malraux were both on these \"Otto Lists\" of forbidden authors.\nDuring the war, Aragon wrote for the underground press \"Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit\" and was a member of the National Front Resistance movement. His poetry was published along texts by Vercors (Jean Bruller), Pierre Seghers or Paul \u00c9luard in Switzerland in 1943 after being smuggled out of occupied France by his friend and publisher Fran\u00e7ois Lachenal.\nHe participated with his wife in the setting up of the National Front of Writers in the southern zone. This activism led him to break his friendly relationship with Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, who had chosen collaborationism.\nAlong with Paul \u00c9luard, Pierre Seghers and Ren\u00e9 Char, Aragon would maintain the memory of the Resistance in his post-war poems. He thus wrote, in 1954, \"Strophes pour se souvenir\" in commemoration of the role of foreigners in the Resistance, which celebrated the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d'Oeuvre Immigr\u00e9e (FTP-MOI).\nThe theme of the poem was the Red Poster affair, mainly the last letter that Missak Manouchian, an Armenian-French poet and Resistant, wrote to his wife M\u00e9lin\u00e9e before his execution on 21 February 1944. This poem was then set to music by L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9.\nAfter the war.\nAt the liberation of France, Aragon became one of the leading Communist intellectuals, assuming political responsibilities in the \"\" (National Committee of Writers). He celebrated the role of the general secretary of the PCF, Maurice Thorez, and defended the Kominform's condemnation of the Titoist regime in Yugoslavia.\nSponsored by Thorez, Aragon was elected, in 1950, to the central committee of the PCF. His post, however, did not protect him from all forms of criticism. Thus, when his journal \"Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises\" published a drawing by Pablo Picasso on the occasion of Stalin's death in March 1953, Aragon was forced to make excuses to his critics, who judged the drawing iconoclastic. Through the years, he had been kept informed of Stalinist repression by his Russian-born wife, and so his political line evolved.\n\"Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises\" (1953\u20131972).\nIn the days following the disappearance of \"Ce soir\", in March 1953, Aragon became the director of \"L'Humanit\u00e9\"'s literary supplement, \"Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises\". After Khrushchev's \"Secret Speech\" about Stalin delivered in 1956, Aragon suffered a deep personal crisis, but it was not until the 1960s when he started openly criticizing the Soviet regime. In 1956, Aragon didn't support the Hungarian Revolution, provoking the dissolution of the \"Comit\u00e9 national des \u00e9crivains\", which Vercors quit, and was granted the Lenin Peace Prize, but later he condemned Soviet totalitarianism and authoritarianism, opened his magazines to dissidents, and condemned show trials against intellectuals (in particular the 1966 Sinyavsky\u2013Daniel trial). \nAssisted by Pierre Daix, Aragon started in the 1960s a struggle against Soviet policies and its consequences in Eastern Europe. He published the writings of dissidents such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn or Milan Kundera. He strongly supported the student movement of May 68, although the PCF was sceptical about it. The crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968 led him to a critical preface published in a translation of one of Milan Kundera's books (\"La Plaisanterie\"). In 1970, he supported the Nobel Prize awarded to Solzhenitsyn. Despite his criticisms, Aragon remained an official member of the PCF's central committee until his death. The monetary loss caused by \"Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises\" led to its ceasing publication in 1972. It was later re-founded.\nThe publisher.\nBeside his journalistic activities, Louis Aragon was also CEO of the \"\" (EFR) publishing house, heir of two publishing houses founded by the Resistance, \"La Biblioth\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise\" and \"Hier et Aujourd'hui\". He directed the EFR along with Madeleine Braun, and in the 1950s published French and Soviet writers commonly related to the \"Socialist Realism\" current. Among other works, the EFR published Andr\u00e9 Stil's \"Premier choc\", which owed to the future Goncourt Academician the Stalin Prize in 1953. They also published other writers, such as Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Rafael Alberti, Yiannis Ritsos and Vladimir Mayakovsky. \nAt the beginning of the 1960s, the EFR brought to public knowledge the works of non-Russian Soviet writers, such as Chinghiz Aitmatov, or Russian writers belonging to the Khrushchev Thaw, such as Galina Nikolaeva, Yevgeny Yevtushenko's \"Babi Iar\" in 1967, etc. The EFR also published the first novel of Christa Wolf in 1964, and launched the poetic collection \"Petite sir\u00e8ne\", which collected works by Pablo Neruda, Eug\u00e8ne Guillevic, Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n, but also less known poets such as https://, Alain Lance or Jean Ristat.\nReturn to surrealism and death.\nFree from both his marital and editorial responsibilities (having ended publication of \"Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises\" \u2013 \"L'Humanit\u00e9\"'s literary supplement \u2013 in 1972), Aragon was free to return to his surrealist roots. During the last ten years of his life, he published at least two further novels: \"\" and \"Les Adieux\".\nAragon died on 24 December 1982, his friend Jean Ristat sitting up with him. He was buried in the garden of , in his property of Saint-Arnoult-en-Yvelines, alongside his wife Elsa Triolet.\nHe was and still is a popular poet in France because many of his poems have been set to music and sung by various composers and singers: Lino L\u00e9onardi, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Martin, L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9 (the first one to dedicate an entire LP to Aragon, with his 1961 breakthrough \"Les Chansons d'Aragon\" album), Jean Ferrat, Georges Brassens, Alain Barri\u00e8re, Isabelle Aubret, Nicole Rieu, , Marc Ogeret, Marjo Tal, \"et al.\" Many of his poems set to music by Jean Ferrat have been translated into German by Didier Caesar (alias Dieter Kaiser) and are sung by his Duo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the five main towns in the (lit.\u2009'Shire of the Five Villages'), along with Sos del Rey Cat\u00f3lico, Uncastillo, S\u00e1daba, and Tauste.\nHistory.\nThe town became part of the medieval Kingdom of Aragon in 1105 during the Spanish Reconquista, as Muslim rule in the region was receding.\nBy the late 15th century, Ejea de los Caballeros was home to a small Jewish community of roughly thirty families. On 1 July 1492, Juan de Peram\u00e1n, an emissary of the Inquisition of Zaragoza, entered the synagogue and ordered the \"muqaddamin\" (community leaders) to surrender all communal books, including Torah scrolls, Talmudic tractates, Bible commentaries, and \"halakhic\" codes such as the \"Turim\". The books, totaling over 260, were confiscated under threat of excommunication and transported to the Inquisition headquarters in Zaragoza. In the following weeks, the community petitioned Mart\u00edn de Gurrea, who was responsible for the expulsion, to appoint an escort for their departure, agreeing to pay 2,000 sueldos for transport to the port of exile, though they were temporarily detained until debts to the Crown were settled. By 1 August 1492, Leon Albo delivered the Torah scroll to the officials responsible for the expulsion, indicating that the Jewish community had left the town, likely embarking from a nearby port such as Tortosa-Ampolia.\nMain sights.\nThe town retains many medieval buildings, including:\nVillages.\nThe municipality of Ejea de los Caballeros comprises nine different centres of population:\nRivas and Farasdu\u00e9s are two historic villages that have been dependencies of Ejea for decades. The other six centres were built in the 1950s and 1960s in order to settle inhabitants and farmers to grow irrigation crops, following the construction of the Yesa Reservoir and Bardenas irrigation channel that brought water to these villages, among others (S\u00e1daba, Tauste, and others).\nCulture.\nThe main local festival honours the Virgin of the Olive, the local saint. In June, there is also a medieval celebration for the patron saint, Saint John the Baptist.\nAnother local festival commemorates The Vote Day (January 14), an event during the Black Plague in which the townsfolk voted for the bringing of the Virgin of the Olive across the town to worship her.

He is one of the poem's three antagonists (along with his mother and the dragon), all aligned in opposition against the protagonist Beowulf. He is referred to as both an , types of beings from wider Germanic mythology. He is also described as a descendant of the Biblical Cain and \"a creature of darkness, exiled from happiness and accursed of God, the destroyer and devourer of our human kind.\" He is usually depicted as a monster or a giant, although his status as a monster, giant, or other form of supernatural being is not clearly described in the poem and thus remains the subject of scholarly debate. The character of Grendel and his role in the story of \"Beowulf\" have been subject to numerous reinterpretations and re-imaginings. Grendel is feared by all in Heorot but Beowulf, who kills both him and his mother.\nStory.\nGrendel is a figure in the poem \"Beowulf\", preserved in the \"Nowell Codex\". Grendel, being cursed as the descendant of the Biblical Cain, along with elves and other eotens, is \"harrowed\" by the sounds of singing that come every night from the mead hall of Heorot built by King Hro\u00f0gar. Unable to bear it any more, he attacks Heorot. Grendel continues to attack the Hall every night for twelve years, killing its inhabitants and making the mead hall unusable. The poet also details how Grendel consumes the men he kills, \"now that he could hope to eat his fill.\"\nBeowulf hears of these attacks and leaves his native land of the Geats to destroy Grendel. He is warmly welcomed by King Hro\u00f0gar, who gives a banquet in celebration. Afterwards, Beowulf and his warriors bed down in the mead hall to await the inevitable attack. Grendel stalks outside the building for a time, spying the warriors inside. He then makes a sudden attack, bursting through the door with his fists. The first warrior Grendel finds is still asleep, so he seizes the man and devours him. Grendel grabs a second warrior, but is shocked when the warrior grabs back with fearsome strength. As Grendel attempts to disengage, the reader discovers that Beowulf is that second warrior. Beowulf uses neither weapon nor armour in this fight. He also places no reliance on his companions and has no need of them. He trusts that God has given him strength to defeat Grendel, whom he believes is God's adversary. Beowulf tears off Grendel's arm, mortally wounding the creature. Grendel flees but dies in his marsh den. There, Beowulf later engages in a fierce battle with Grendel's mother in a mere, over whom he triumphs with a sword found there. Following her death, Beowulf finds Grendel's corpse and removes his head, which he keeps as a trophy. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the \"ninth hour\". He returns to Heorot, where a grateful Hro\u00f0gar showers him with gifts.\nNarrative role.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien (1936) argues for the importance of Grendel's role in the poem as an \"eminently suitable beginning\" that sets the stage for Beowulf's fight with the dragon: \"Triumph over the lesser and more nearly human is cancelled by defeat before the older and more elemental.\" Tolkien argues that \"the evil spirits took visible shape\" in the characters of Grendel and the dragon; however, the author's concern is focused on Beowulf. Tolkien's essay was the first work of scholarship in which Anglo-Saxon literature was seriously examined on its literary merits \u2013 not just for scholarship about the origins of the English language, or what historical information could be gleaned from the text, as was common in the 19th century.\nIdentity and physical description.\nDescription in the poem.\nDuring the decades following Tolkien's essay, the exact description of Grendel was debated by scholars. Because his exact appearance is never directly described in Old English by the original \"Beowulf\" poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely his descent from the biblical Cain (the first murderer in the Bible). Grendel is called a \"sceadugenga\" \u2013 \"shadow walker\", in other words \"night goer\" \u2013 given that the monster was repeatedly described to be in the shroud of darkness.\nAfter Grendel's death, Hro\u00f0gar describes him as vaguely human in shape, though much larger:\nGrendel's severed head is also so large that it takes four men to transport it. Furthermore, when Grendel's torn arm is inspected it is described as being covered in impenetrable scales and horny growths.\nRelationship to Biblical traditions.\nSome scholars have linked Grendel's descent from Cain to the monsters and giants of the \"Cain tradition\". Alfred Bammesgerber (2008) looks closely at line 1266 where Grendel's ancestry is said to be the \"misbegotten spirits\" that sprang from Cain after he was cursed. He argues that the word in Old English should be translated \"the great former creation of spirits\".\nRelationship to wider Germanic traditions.\nIdentity as an eoten.\nIn 1936, J. R. R. Tolkien's \"\" discussed Grendel and the dragon in \"Beowulf\". Tolkien points out that while Grendel is the descendant of the Biblical Cain, he \"cannot be dissociated from the creatures of northern myth\". He notes that Cain is presented as the ancestor of beings such as and , which he equates with their Old Norse cognates of and . He further argues that this blending of traditions is intentional and seen throughout the poem more generally. Grendel specifically is described as both an and a , cognate with and respectively; it has been proposed that the poet and the audience of the poem would have seen Grendel as belonging to this same group of beings as the of Scandinavian tradition. While in Old Norse accounts are highly diverse, lacking a single physical appearance, and best thought of as a social grouping, some broadly shared traits have been identified such as living on the periphery of the world, outside society. In both Old Norse and Old English accounts, these borders between the realms of humanity and those of supernatural beings are often marked by water, such as rivers or the surface of lakes. This is notably consistent with Grendel's depiction as living in marshes and Maxims II, which identifies fens as the characteristic living place for .\nOther.\nKatherine O'Keefe (1981) has suggested that Grendel resembles a berserker, because of numerous associations that seem to point to this possibility.\nSonya R. Jensen (1998) argues for an identification between Grendel and Agnar, son of Ingeld, and suggests that the tale of the first two monsters is actually the tale of Ingeld, as mentioned by Alcuin in the 790s. The tale of Agnar tells how he was cut in half by the warrior B\u00f6dvar Bjarki (\"Warlike little Bear\"), and how he died \"with his lips separated into a smile\". One major parallel between Agnar and Grendel would thus be that the monster of the poem has a name perhaps composed of a combination of the words \"gren\" and \"daelan\". The poet may be stressing to his audience that Grendel \"died laughing\", or that he was \"gren-dael[ed]\" or \"grin-divid[ed]\", after having his arm torn off at the shoulder by Beowulf, whose name means \"bee-wolf\" or \"bear\". \nOther interpretations and discussions.\nPeter Dickinson (1979) argued that seeing as the considered distinction between man and beast at the time the poem was written was simply man's bipedalism, the given description of Grendel being man-like does not necessarily imply that Grendel is meant to be humanoid, going as far as stating that Grendel could easily have been a bipedal dragon.\nOther scholars such as Sherman Kuhn (1979) have questioned Grendel's description as a monster, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are five disputed instances of \u0101gl\u01e3ca [three of which are in \"Beowulf\", lines] 649, 1269, 1512 ... In the first ... the referent can be either Beowulf or Grendel. If the poet and his audience felt the word to have two meanings \u2013 \"monster\" and \"hero\" \u2013 the ambiguity would be troublesome; but if by \u0101gl\u01e3ca they understood a \"fighter\", the ambiguity would be of little consequence, for battle was destined for both Beowulf and Grendel and both were fierce fighters (216\u2013217).\nPlace-names.\nGrendel likely features in English place names dating to the Anglo-Saxon period such as (\"Grendel's pit\"), (\"Grendel's mere\") and (\"Grendel's bog\"). It has been further noted that these places are often nearby, or are, watery places, such as lakes and marshes, or other locations away from human habitation.\nDepictions.\nGrendel appears in many other cultural works.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In other words, the flesh of the fruit develops not from the floral ovary, but from some adjacent tissue exterior to the carpel (for example, from receptacles or sepal). As a general rule, the accessory fruit is a combination of several floral organs, including the ovary. In contrast, true fruit forms exclusively from the ovary of the flower.\nAccessory fruits are usually indehiscent, meaning that they do not split open to release seeds when they have reached maturity.\nIncorporated organs.\nThe following are examples of accessory fruits listed by the plant organ from which the accessory tissue is derived:\nFruit with fleshy seeds, such as pomegranate or mamoncillo, are not considered to be accessory fruits.\nExamples.\nApples and pears.\nThe part of apples and pears that is consumed is, in fact, the hypanthium. The ovary is the papery core that surrounds the apple seeds. As the hypanthium ripens it forms the edible tissues.\nRoses.\nFor roses, the hypanthium is the tissue that composes the edible part of rosehips. Roses and apples are both members of the Rosaceae family; the fact that they have similar fruit morphology is a major consideration in placing them in the same taxonomic family.\nStrawberries.\nThe edible part of the strawberry is formed, as part of the ripening process, from the receptacle of the strawberry flower. The true fruits (hence, containing the seeds) are the roughly 200 pips (which are, technically, achenes, a true fruit that contains a single seed from a single ovary). These pips dot the exterior of the strawberry.\nCashew apple.\nThe cashew apple is an oval- or pear-shaped structure that develops from the pedicel and the receptacle of the cashew flower and is technically called a hypocarpium. It ripens into a yellow or red structure about long. The true fruit of the cashew tree is a kidney\u2013shaped drupe that grows at the end of the cashew apple; the seed inside this drupe is the cashew nut of commerce.\nPineapple.\nThe pineapple is formed when 50 to 200 unpollinated flowers coalesce in a spiral arrangement\u2014 the flowers form individually and then fuse as a single 'multiple fruit'. The ovaries develop into berries and the fruit forms around an intercalary spike. The intercalary inflorescence (cluster of flowers) results when the terminal cluster of flowers are left behind by the growth of the main axis of the plant. Each polygonal area on the pineapple's surface is an individual flower.\nResearch.\nCurrent research has proposed that a single class of genes may be responsible for regulating accessory fruit formation and ripening. A study using strawberries concluded that hormone signaling pathways involving gibberellic acid and auxin affect gene expression, and contribute to the initiation of accessory fruit development. Metabolic modifications in different developing accessory fruit tissues are due to the varied distributions of compounds such as triterpenoids and steroids.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72311", "revid": "2909459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72311", "title": "1996 Summer Olympics", "text": "Multi-sport event in Atlanta, Georgia, US\nThe 1996 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the XXVI Olympiad, also known as Atlanta 1996 and commonly referred to as the Centennial Olympic Games) were an international multi-sport event held from July 19 to August 4, 1996, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. These were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States, making it the first country to have three different cities host the Summer Olympics. It also marked the 100th anniversary of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games. These were also the first Summer Olympics to be held in a different year than the Winter Olympics since the same time practice commenced in 1924, as part of a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating, even-numbered years. The 1996 Games were the first of the two consecutive Summer Olympics to be held in a predominantly English-speaking country, preceding the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. These were also the last Summer Olympics to be held in North America until 2028, when Los Angeles will host the games for the third time.\n10,318 athletes from 197 National Olympic Committees competed in 26 sports, including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball, mountain biking and softball, as well as the new disciplines of lightweight rowing, women's swimming 4 x 200 freestyle relay, women's fencing, team rhythmic gymnastics, and women's association football. A total of 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debuts in Atlanta, including 11 former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations. With a total of 101 medals, the United States topped both the gold and overall medal count for the first time since 1984 (and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics), also winning the most gold (44) and silver (32) medals out of all the participating nations. Notable performances during the competition included those of Andre Agassi, whose gold medal in these Games would be followed up with the French Open title in 1999, making him the first men's singles tennis player to complete the Career Golden Slam; Donovan Bailey, who set a new world record of 9.84 for the men's 100 meters; Lilia Podkopayeva, who became the second gymnast to win an individual event gold medal after winning the all-around title in the same Olympics; and the Magnificent Seven, who dramatically won the first ever U.S. gold medal in the women's artistic gymnastics team all-around.\nThe Games were marred by violence on July 27, 1996, when a pipe bomb was detonated at Centennial Olympic Park (which had been built to serve as a public focal point for the festivities), killing two and injuring 111. Years later, Eric Rudolph confessed to the bombing and a series of related terrorist attacks, and was sentenced to life in prison. Nonetheless, the 1996 Olympics turned a profit, helped by record revenue from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights, and a reliance on private funding, among other factors. There were 8.3 million tickets sold for events at this Olympics, a record broken only in 2024. There was some criticism of the perceived over-commercialization of the Games, with other issues raised by European officials, such as the availability of food and transport. The event had a lasting impact on the city; Centennial Olympic Park led a revitalization of Atlanta's downtown area, and has served as a symbol of the legacy of the 1996 Games; the Olympic Village buildings have since been used as residential housing for area universities; and Centennial Olympic Stadium has since been redeveloped twice, first as the Turner Field baseball stadium, then as the Center Parc American football stadium.\nBidding process.\nAtlanta was selected on September 18, 1990, in Tokyo, Japan, over Athens, Belgrade, Manchester, Melbourne, and Toronto at the 96th IOC Session. The city entered the competition as a dark horse, being up against stiff competition. The US media also criticized Atlanta as a second-tier city and complained of Georgia's Confederate history. However, the IOC Evaluation Commission ranked Atlanta's infrastructure and facilities the highest, while IOC members said that it could guarantee large television revenues similar to the success of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the most recent Olympics in the United States. Additionally, former US ambassador to the UN and Atlanta mayor Andrew Young touted Atlanta's civil rights history and reputation for racial harmony. Young also wanted to showcase a reformed American South. The strong economy of Atlanta and improved race relations in the South helped to impress the IOC officials. Coca-Cola, a long-standing partner of the Olympics, was also a strong advocate to bring the Games to its hometown. The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) also proposed a substantial revenue-sharing with the IOC, USOC, and other NOCs. Atlanta's main rivals were Toronto, whose front-running bid that began in 1986 had chances to succeed after Canada had held a successful 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and Melbourne, Australia, who hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics and after Brisbane, Australia's failed bid for the 1992 games (which were awarded to Barcelona) and prior to Sydney, Australia's successful 2000 Summer Olympics bid. This would be Toronto's fourth failed attempt since 1960 (tried in 1960, 1964, and 1976, but was defeated by Rome, Tokyo and Montreal).\nGreece, the home of the ancient and first modern Olympics, was considered by many observers the \"natural choice\" for the Centennial Games, due to its \"divine right\" in history. Athens bid chairman Spyros Metaxas gave repeated warnings to the IOC and demanded to give them the games to mark the centennial, saying \"You don't hold a 100th birthday in someone else's home. The Centenary Games should be held in Athens.\" He also warned that \"if we don't get the Olympics in 1996 we will never bid again to host them.\"\nHowever, the Athens bid was described as \"arrogant and poorly prepared,\" being regarded as \"not being up to the task of coping with the modern and risk-prone extravaganza\" of the current Games. Athens faced numerous obstacles, including \"political instability, potential security problems, air pollution, traffic congestion and the fact that it would have to spend about US$3\u00a0billion to improve its infrastructure of airports, roads, rail lines and other amenities.\" Athens would later be selected to host the 2004 Summer Olympics seven years later on September 5, 1997.\nDevelopment and preparation.\nBudget.\nThe total cost of the 1996 Summer Olympics was estimated to be around US$1.7 billion. The venues and the Games themselves were funded entirely via private investment, and the only public funding came from the U.S. government for security, and around $500\u00a0million of public money used on physical public infrastructure including streetscaping, road improvements, Centennial Olympic Park (alongside $75\u00a0million in private funding), expansion of the airport, improvements in public transportation, and redevelopment of public housing projects. $420\u00a0million worth of tickets were sold, sale of sponsorship rights accounted for $540 million, and sale of the domestic broadcast rights to NBC accounted for $456\u00a0million. In total, the Games turned a profit of $19 million.\nThe cost for Atlanta 1996 compares with costs of $4.6\u00a0billion for Rio 2016, $40\u201344\u00a0billion for Beijing 2008, and $51 billion for Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics (the most expensive Olympic Games without differentiating between summer and winter in history). The average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is $5.2\u00a0billion. Using the 1984 Summer Olympics financing model, this edition was organized 100% privately without any cent of public money. Beijing 2008 and Sochi 2014 were financed entirely by the governments of their respective countries.\nVenues and infrastructure.\nEvents of the 1996 Games were held in a completely decentralized way using mostly existing facilities that were not built for the Games. Most of the events were held in the so-called Olympic Ring, a circle from the center of Atlanta. Others were held at Stone Mountain, about outside of the city. In many cases, it was decided to remove events from the Atlanta Metropolitan Region to save money, while in others the calendar was a difficulty, as was the case with association football which ended up having its host cities spread across the Southeastern United States region.\nMarketing.\nThe Olympiad's official theme, \"Summon the Heroes\", was written by John Williams, making it the third Olympiad at that point for which he had composed (official composer in 1984, NBC's coverage composer in 1988). The opening ceremony featured C\u00e9line Dion singing \"The Power of the Dream\", the theme song of the 1996 Olympics. The closing ceremony featured Gloria Estefan singing \"Reach\", the official theme song of the 1996 Olympics. The mascot for the Olympiad was an abstract, animated character named Izzy. In contrast to the standing tradition of mascots of national or regional significance in the city hosting the Olympiad, Izzy was an amorphous, fantasy figure. A video game featuring the Games' mascot, \"Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings\", was also released.\nAtlanta's Olympic slogan \"Come Celebrate Our Dream\" was written by Jack Arogeti, a managing director at McCann-Erickson in Atlanta at the time. The slogan was selected from more than 5,000 submitted by the public to the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. Billy Payne noted that Jack \"captured the spirit and our true motivation for the Olympic games.\"\nIn 1994, African-American artist Kevin Cole was commissioned to create the Coca-Cola Centennial Olympic Wall, and the 15-story mural took two years to complete.\nCalendar.\n&lt;section begin=\"Calendar\"/&gt;\n\"All times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4); the other, Birmingham, Alabama, uses Central Daylight Time (UTC-5)\"\n&lt;section end=\"Calendar\"/&gt;\nGames.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe ceremony began with a 60-second countdown, which included footage from all of the previous Olympic Games at twenty-two seconds. There was then a flashback to the closing ceremony of the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, showing the then president of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch, inviting the athletes to compete in Atlanta in 1996. Then, spirits ascended in the northwest corner of the stadium, each representing one of the colors in the Olympic rings. The spirits called the tribes of the world which, after mixed percussion, formed the Olympic rings while the youth of Atlanta formed the number 100. Famed film score composer John Williams wrote the official overture for the 1996 Olympics, called \"Summon the Heroes\"; this was his second overture for Olympic games, the first being \"Olympic Fanfare and Theme\" written for the 1984 Summer Olympics. C\u00e9line Dion performed David Foster's official 1996 Olympics song \"The Power of the Dream\", accompanied by Foster on the piano, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Centennial Choir (comprising Morehouse College Glee Club, Spelman College Glee Club and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus). Gladys Knight sang Georgia's official state song, \"Georgia on My Mind\".\nThere was a showcase entitled \"Welcome To The World\", featuring cheerleaders, Chevrolet pick-up trucks, marching bands, and steppers, which highlighted the American youth and a typical Saturday college football game in the South, including the wave commonly produced by spectators in sporting events around the world. There was another showcase entitled \"Summertime\" which focused on Atlanta and the Old South, emphasizing its beauty, spirit, music, history, culture, and rebirth after the American Civil War. The ceremony also featured a memorable dance tribute to the athletes and to the goddesses of victory of the ancient Greek Olympics, using silhouette imagery. The accompanying music, \"The Tradition of the Games\", was composed by Basil Poledouris.\nMuhammad Ali lit the Olympic cauldron and later received a replacement gold medal for his boxing victory in the 1960 Summer Olympics. For the torch ceremony, more than 10,000 Olympic torches were manufactured by the American Meter Company and electroplated by Erie Plating Company. Each torch weighed about and was made primarily of aluminum, with a Georgia pecan wood handle and gold ornamentation.\nThe city of Savannah, Georgia, host of the yachting events, also held their own opening ceremony on the first day of their competitions. The event was headlined by a performance by country musician Trisha Yearwood.\nSports.\nThe 1996 Summer Olympic program featured 271 events in 26 sports. Softball, beach volleyball and mountain biking debuted on the Olympic program, together with women's football, lightweight events in rowing, Women's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay in swimming, the Women's \u00e9p\u00e9e in fencing and the group all-around event in rhythmic gymnastics.\nIn women's gymnastics, Ukrainian Lilia Podkopayeva became the all-around Olympic champion. Podkopayeva also won a second gold medal in the floor exercise final and a silver on the beam \u2013 becoming the only female gymnast since Nadia Com\u0103neci to win an individual event gold after winning the all-around title in the same Olympics. Kerri Strug of the United States women's gymnastics team vaulted with an injured ankle and landed on one foot, winning the first women's team gold medal for the US. Shannon Miller won the gold medal on the balance beam event, the first time an American gymnast had won an individual gold medal in non-boycotted Olympic games. The Spanish team won the first gold medal in the new competition of women's rhythmic group all-around. The team was formed by Estela Gim\u00e9nez, Marta Bald\u00f3, Nuria Cabanillas, Lorena Gur\u00e9ndez, Est\u00edbaliz Mart\u00ednez and Tania Lamarca.\nAmy Van Dyken won four gold medals in the Olympic swimming pool, the first American woman to win four titles in a single Olympiad. Penny Heyns, swimmer of South Africa, won the gold medals in both the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke events. Michelle Smith of Ireland won three gold medals and a bronze in swimming. She remains her nation's most decorated Olympian. However, her victories were overshadowed by doping allegations even though she did not test positive in 1996. She received a four-year suspension in 1998 for tampering with a urine sample, though her medals and records were allowed to stand.\nIn track and field, Donovan Bailey of Canada won the men's 100 m, setting a new world record of 9.84\u00a0seconds at that time. He also anchored his team's gold in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay.\nMichael Johnson won gold in both the 200\u00a0m and 400 m, setting a new world record of 19.32\u00a0seconds in the 200 m. Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec equaled Johnson's performance, although without a world record, by winning the rare 200 m/400\u00a0m double. Carl Lewis won his 4th long jump gold medal at the age of 35.\nIn tennis, Andre Agassi won the gold medal, which would eventually make him the first man and second singles player overall (after his eventual wife, Steffi Graf) to win the career Golden Slam, which consists of an Olympic gold medal and victories in the singles tournaments held at professional tennis' four major events (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open).\nThere were a series of national firsts realized during the Games. Deon Hemmings became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal for Jamaica and the English-speaking West Indies. Lee Lai Shan won a gold medal in sailing, the only Olympic medal that Hong Kong ever won as a British colony (1842\u20131997). This meant that for the only time, the colonial flag of Hong Kong was raised to the accompaniment of the British national anthem \"God Save the Queen\", as Hong Kong's sovereignty was later transferred to China in 1997. The U.S. women's soccer team won the gold medal in the first-ever women's football event. For the first time, Olympic medals were won by athletes from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burundi, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Georgia (country, not U.S. state), Hong Kong, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Mozambique, Slovakia, Tonga, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.\nMedal table.\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1996 Games.\nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nA total of 197 nations, all of the then-existing and recognized National Olympic Committees, were represented at the 1996 Games, and the combined total of athletes was about 10,318. Twenty-four countries made their Olympic debut this year, including eleven of the ex-Soviet countries that competed as part of the Unified Team in 1992. Russia participated in the Summer Olympics separately from the other countries of the former Soviet Union for the first time since 1912 (when it was the Russian Empire). Russia had been a member of the Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics together with 11 post-Soviet states. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia competed as \"Yugoslavia\". After missing the 1992 Summer Games were Afghanistan and Cambodia returned to send delegations to Atlanta.\nThe 14 countries making their Olympic debut were: Azerbaijan, Burundi, Cape Verde, Comoros, Dominica, Guinea-Bissau, Macedonia, Nauru, Palestinian Authority, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. The ten countries making their Summer Olympic debut (after competing at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer) were: Armenia, Belarus, Czech Republic, Georgia (country, not U.S. state), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Slovakia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The Czech Republic and Slovakia attended the games as independent nations for the first time since the breakup of Czechoslovakia, while the rest of the nations that made their Summer Olympic debut were formerly part of the Soviet Union.\nNumber of athletes by National Olympic Committee.\n10,339 athletes from 197 NOCs participated in the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sticky table start/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCentennial Olympic Park bombing.\nThe 1996 Olympics were marred by the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, which occurred on July\u00a027. Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the pipe bomb and immediately notified law enforcement, helping to evacuate as many people as possible from the area before it exploded. Although Jewell's quick actions are credited for saving many lives, the bombing killed spectator Alice Hawthorne, wounded 111 others, and caused the death of Melih Uzunyol by a heart attack. Jewell was later considered a suspect in the bombing but was never charged, and he was cleared in October 1996.\nFugitive Eric Rudolph was arrested in May 2003 and charged with the Olympic Park bombing as well as the bombings of two abortion clinics and a gay nightclub. At his trial two years later, he confessed to all charges and afterwards released a statement, saying: \"the purpose of the attack on July 27th was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.\" He received four life sentences without parole, to be served at USP Florence ADMAX near Florence, Colorado.\nLegacy.\nPreparations for the Olympics lasted more than seven years and had an economic impact of at least US$5.14\u00a0billion. Over two million visitors came to Atlanta, and approximately 3.5\u00a0billion people around the world watched at least some of the events on television. Although marred by the tragedy of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, the Games were a financial success, due in part to TV rights contracts and sponsorships at record levels. Atlanta also set a new record for the most tickets sold at a single Games (8.3 million), and held it until 2024.\nBeyond international recognition, the Games resulted in many modern infrastructure improvements. The mid-rise dormitories built for the Olympic Village, which became the first residential housing for Georgia State University (Georgia State Village), are now used by the Georgia Institute of Technology (North Avenue Apartments). As designed, the Centennial Olympic Stadium was converted into Turner Field after the Paralympics, which became the home of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team from 1997 to 2016. The Braves' former home, Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium, was demolished in 1997 and the site became a parking lot for Turner Field; the Omni Coliseum was demolished the same year to make way for State Farm Arena. The city's permanent memorial to the 1996 Olympics is Centennial Olympic Park, which was built as a focal point for the Games. The park initiated a revitalization of the surrounding area and now serves as the hub for Atlanta's tourism district.\nIn November 2016, a commemorative plaque was unveiled for Centennial Olympic Park to honor the 20th anniversary of the Games.\nFollowing the Braves' departure from Turner Field to Truist Park in 2017, Georgia State University acquired the former Olympic Stadium and surrounding parking lots. It reconfigured the stadium for a second time into Center Parc Stadium for its college football team.\nThe 1996 Olympic cauldron was originally built and placed at the intersection of Fulton Street and Capitol Avenue, near the Centennial Olympic Stadium. After the Paralympics, in order to make room for the stadium conversion, the Olympic cauldron was moved (except its ramp, which was demolished) to the intersection of Capitol Avenue and Fulton Street in 1997, where it has stayed since. Since Georgia State University's acquisition of the former Olympic Stadium and surrounding lots, there has been proposals and growing calls to move the Olympic cauldron to Centennial Olympic Park.\nThe Olympic cauldron was re-lit in February 2020 for the 2020 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials.\nThe 1996 Olympics are the most recent edition of the Summer Olympics to be held in the United States. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics, 32 years after the Games were held in Atlanta.\nSponsors.\nThe 1996 Summer Olympics relied heavily on commercial sponsorship. The Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company was the exclusive provider of soft drinks at Olympics venues, and built an attraction known as Coca-Cola Olympic City for the Games. As part of a sponsorship agreement with Columbia TriStar Television, the syndicated game shows \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" both produced episodes with Olympics tie-ins (including branded memorabilia and contests) for broadcast between April and July 1996. These included a \"Jeopardy!\" international tournament, and three weeks of \"Wheel of Fortune\" episodes filmed on-location at Atlanta's Fox Theatre.\nThe Games were affected by several instances of ambush marketing\u2014in which companies attempt to use the Games as a means to promote their brand, in competition with the exclusive, category-based sponsorship rights issued by the Atlanta organizing committee and the IOC (which grants the rights to use Olympics-related terms and emblems in marketing). The Atlanta organizing committee threatened legal actions against advertisers whose marketing implied an official association with the Games. Several non-sponsors set up marketing activities in areas near venues, such as Samsung (competing with Motorola), which ambushed the Games with its \"96 Expo\". The city of Atlanta had also licensed street vendors to sell products from competitors to Olympic sponsors.\nThe most controversial ambush campaign was undertaken by Nike, Inc., which had begun an advertising campaign with aggressive slogans that mocked the Games' values, such as \"Faster, Higher, Stronger, Badder\", \"If you're not here to win, you're a tourist\", and \"You don't win silver, you lose gold.\" The slogans were featured on magazine ads and billboards it purchased in Atlanta. Nike also opened a pop-up store known as the Nike Center near the Athletes' Village, which distributed Nike-branded flags to visitors (presumably to be used at events). IOC marketing director Michael Payne expressed concern for the campaign, believing that athletes could perceive them as being an insult to their accomplishments. Payne and the United States Olympic Committee's marketing director, John Krimsky, met with Howard Slusher, a subordinate of Nike co-founder Phil Knight. The meeting quickly turned aggressive, with Payne warning that the IOC could pull accreditation for Nike employees and ban the display of its logos on equipment; he also threatened to organize a press conference where silver medallists from the Games, as well as prominent Nike-sponsored athlete Michael Johnson (who attracted attention during the Games for wearing custom, gold-colored Nike shoes), would denounce the company. Faced with these threats, Nike agreed to retract most of its negative advertising and public relations stunts.\nReception.\nAt the closing ceremony, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said in his closing speech, \"Well done, Atlanta\" and simply called the Games \"most exceptional.\" This broke precedent for Samaranch, who had traditionally labeled each Games \"the best Olympics ever\" at each closing ceremony, a practice he resumed at the subsequent Winter Games in Nagano in 1998.\nA report prepared after the Games by European Olympic officials was critical of Atlanta's performance in several key areas, including the level of crowding in the Olympic Village, the quality of available food, the accessibility and convenience of transportation, and the Games' general atmosphere of commercialism. IOC vice-president Dick Pound responded to criticism of the commercialization of these Games, stating that they still adhered to a historic policy barring the display of advertising within venues, and that \"you have to look to the private sector for at least a portion of the funding, and unless you're looking for handouts, you're dealing with people who are investing business assets, and they have to get a return.\"\nIn 1997, Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics. Along with addressing the shortcomings of its 1996 bid, it was lauded for its efforts to promote the traditional values of the Olympic Games, which some IOC observers felt had been lost due to the over-commercialization of the 1996 Games. However, the 2004 Games heavily relied on public funding and eventually failed to make a profit, which some have claimed contributed to the Greek government-debt crisis.\nThe financial struggles faced by many later Games, such as the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, have caused some to offer more positive reappraisals of the management of the 1996 Summer Games. Former JPMorgan Chase president (and torchbearer) Kabir Sehgal noted that in contrast to many later Olympics, those of 1996 were financially viable, had a positive economic impact on the city, and most of the facilities constructed continued to be used after the Games. Sehgal contrasted the 1996 Games' \"grassroots\" effort backed almost entirely by private funding, with the only significant public spending coming from infrastructure associated with the Games, to modern \"top-down\" bids, instigated by local governments and reliant on taxpayer funding, making them unpopular among citizens who may not necessarily be interested. The 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles will rely almost entirely on private funding, with the city of Los Angeles and state of California each intending to provide up to $250 million in funding in the event of shortfalls, and the U.S. federal government providing funding solely for security.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The cathedral is regarded as one of the leading examples of Early English Gothic design. Built over a relatively short period, some 38 years between 1220 and 1258, it has a unity and coherence that is unusual in medieval English cathedrals. The tower and spire were completed by 1330. The cathedral's spire, at , is the tallest in England.\nThe original cathedral in the district was located at Old Sarum, about north of the present city. In 1197 bishop Herbert Poore determined on a relocation but this was not taken forward until the episcopate of his brother, Richard Poore in the early 13th century. Foundation stones for the new building were laid on 28 April 1220 by the Earl and Countess of Salisbury. By 1258 the nave, transepts and choir were complete. The only major additions were the cloisters, added 1240, the chapter house in 1263, and the tower and spire, which was constructed by 1330. At its completion it was the third highest in England, but the collapse of those at Lincoln Cathedral and Old St Paul's Cathedral in the 16th century saw Salisbury become England's tallest.\nThe cathedral close is Britain's largest, and has many buildings of architectural and/or historical significance. Pevsner describes it as \"the most beautiful of England's closes\". The cathedral contains a clock which is among the oldest working examples in the world. It also holds one of the four surviving original copies of Magna Carta. In 2008, the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration. In 2023, the completion of a programme of external restoration begun in 1985 saw the removal of scaffolding that had stood around the building for some 37 years.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSalisbury became the seat of a bishop in 1075. At the time, the city was at the now-abandoned site of Old Sarum, on a hill about north of the present-day cathedral. Old Sarum Cathedral was built in the years after and was consecrated in 1092.\nIn 1197, bishop Herbert Poore sought permission to re-site the cathedral, possibly due to deteriorating relations between the clergy and the military at Old Sarum. Permission was granted but the move was delayed repeatedly until the tenure of his successor and brother Richard Poore. A legend tells that Bishop Poore shot an arrow in the direction he would build the cathedral; the arrow hit a deer, which died in the place where Salisbury Cathedral is now.\nConstruction was paid for by donations, principally from the canons and vicars of southeast England, who were asked to contribute a fixed annual sum until the building was completed. The foundation stones were laid on 28 April 1220 by William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, and by Ela of Salisbury, 3rd Countess of Salisbury. Much of the freestone for the cathedral came from the Teffont Evias Quarry. As a result of the high water table on the new site, the cathedral was built on foundations only deep. By 1258, the nave, transepts, and choir were complete. As a result of being mostly built in only 38 years, Salisbury has by far the most consistent architectural style of any medieval English cathedral. The style used is known as Early English Gothic or Lancet Gothic, the latter referring to the use of lancet windows which are not divided by tracery.\nThe only major sections begun later were the cloisters, added in 1240, the chapter house in 1263, the tower and spire, which at dominated the skyline from 1330. In total, 70,000 tons of stone, 3,000 tons of timber and 450 tons of lead were used in the construction of the cathedral. Upon completion, it had the highest masonry spire in England and the third highest overall, after Lincoln and St Paul's. The collapse of the latter two spires in the mid-16th century left Salisbury's as the highest overall.\nIn the 17th century, Christopher Wren designed restoration measures to strengthen the central pillars, which by then had visibly deformed under the weight of the tower and spire. Significant changes to the cathedral were made by the architect James Wyatt in 1790, including the replacement of the original rood screen and demolition of a bell tower which stood about northwest of the main building.\n21st century.\nIn 2008, the cathedral celebrated the 750th anniversary of its consecration. In 2023, the completion of a programme of external restoration begun in 1985 saw the removal of scaffolding that had stood around the building for some 37 years.\nThe cathedral previously employed five cathedral constables (known as \"Close Constables\"), whose duties mainly concerned the maintenance of law and order in the cathedral close. They were made redundant in 2010 as part of cost-cutting measures. The constables were first appointed when the cathedral became a liberty in 1611 and survived until the introduction of municipal police forces in 1835 with the Municipal Corporations Act. In 1800 they were given the power, along with the city constables, to execute any justices' or court orders requiring the conveyance of prisoners to or from the county jail (at Fisherton Anger, then outside the city of Salisbury) as if it were the city jail (and, in so doing, they were made immune from any legal action for acting outside their respective jurisdictions). The right of the cathedral, as a liberty, to maintain a separate police force was conclusively terminated by the Local Government Act 1888.\nBetween 1864 and 1953 there were records of peregrine falcons being present at the cathedral. More arrived in 2013 and have been hatching every year since with their nests on the cathedral's tower.\nIn 2016, the cathedral chapter placed Sophie Ryder's sculpture \"The Kiss\" (of a pair of hands) straddling a path in the grounds. It was moved shortly thereafter, due to pedestrians colliding with it while texting. In 2018 there was an attempted theft of the cathedral's copy of Magna Carta; the alarms were triggered and a 45-year-old man was later detained on suspicion of attempted theft, criminal damage and possession of an offensive weapon. The outer layer of a double-layered glass case containing the document was broken, but the document suffered no damage. In January 2020 Mark Royden, from Kent, was found guilty of the attempted theft, which caused \u00a314,466 of damage, and of criminal damage.\nFrom 16 January 2021, while closed to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the cathedral was used to accommodate the vaccination programme in the United Kingdom, a day after Lichfield Cathedral became the first place of worship to become part of the immunisation plan against the pandemic in England. A selection of music was played on the organ as people received their vaccinations. In February 2024, the full exterior of the cathedral could be seen for the first time in 38 years after the removal of scaffolding that had been erected for extensive renovation works.\nBuilding and architecture.\nThe cathedral is described in Pevsner as the \"beau id\u00e9al\" of Early English Gothic design with a unity and coherence unique among English cathedrals.\nWest front.\nThe west front is of the screen-type, clearly deriving from that at Wells. It is composed of a stair turret at each extremity, with two niched buttresses nearer the centre line supporting the large central triple window. The stair turrets are topped with spirelets, and the central section is topped by a gable which contains four lancet windows topped by two round quatrefoil windows surmounted by a mandorla containing Christ in Majesty. At ground level there is a principal door flanked by two smaller doors. The whole is highly decorated with quatrefoil motifs, columns, trefoil motifs and bands of diapering.\nThe west front was almost certainly constructed at the same time as the cathedral. This is apparent from the way in which the windows coincide with the interior spaces. The entire facade is about high and wide. It lacks full-scale towers and/or spires as can be seen, for example at Wells, Lincoln, Lichfield, etc. The fa\u00e7ade was disparaged by Alec Clifton-Taylor, who considered it the least successful of the English screen facades and a travesty of its prototype (Wells). He found the composition to be uncoordinated, and the Victorian statuary \"poor and insipid\".\nThe front accommodates over 130 shallow niches of varying sizes, 73 of which contain a statue. The line of niches extends round the turrets to the north, south and east faces. There are five levels of niches (not including the mandorla) which show, from the top, angels and archangels, Old Testament patriarchs, apostles and evangelists, martyrs, doctors and philosophers and, on the lower level, royalty, priests and worthy people connected with the cathedral. The majority of the statues were placed during the middle of the 19th century, however seven are from the 14th century and several have been installed within the last decade.\nNave.\nSalisbury Cathedral is unusual for its tall and narrow nave, which has visual accentuation from the use of light grey Chilmark stone for the walls and dark polished Purbeck marble for the columns. It has three levels: a tall pointed arcade, an open gallery and a small clerestory. Lined up between the pillars are notable tombs such as that of William Longesp\u00e9e, half brother of King John and the illegitimate son of Henry II, who was the first person to be buried in the cathedral.\nAnother unusual feature of the nave is an unconventional modern font, installed in September 2008. Designed by the water sculptor William Pye, it is the largest working font in any British cathedral, and replaced an earlier portable neo-Gothic Victorian font. The font is cruciform in shape, and has a 10-foot-wide vessel filled to its brim with water, designed so that the water overflows in filaments through each corner into bronze gratings embedded in the cathedral's stone floor. The project cost \u00a3180,000 and was funded entirely by donations. Some parishioners reportedly objected to the new font, considering it 'change for change's sake', although Pye argued that the majority opinion was in favour: \"I would say 90 per cent are in happy anticipation, five per cent are nervously expectant and five per cent are probably apoplectic\".\nTower and spire.\nAlthough the spire is the cathedral's most impressive feature, it has proved troublesome. Together with the tower, it added to the weight of the building. Without the addition of buttresses, bracing arches and anchor irons over the succeeding centuries, it would have suffered the fate of spires on other great ecclesiastical buildings (such as Malmesbury Abbey, 1180 to 1500; Lincoln Cathedral, 1311 to 1548; Old St Paul's Cathedral, London, 1314 to 1561; and Chichester Cathedral, 1402 to 1861) and fallen down; instead, Salisbury became the tallest church spire in the country on the collapse at St Paul's (as the result of a fire) in 1561. The large supporting pillars at the corners of the spire are seen to bend inwards under the stress. The addition of reinforcing tie-beams above the crossing, designed by Christopher Wren in 1668, halted further deformation. The beams were hidden by a false ceiling installed below the lantern stage of the tower.\nThe bell chamber is in the middle level of the tower. The bells strike the hour and quarters and are now operated by a Victorian clock, which is not to be confused with the better-known medieval clock that is on display downstairs. Salisbury is one of only three English cathedrals to lack a ring of bells, the others being Norwich Cathedral and Ely Cathedral.\nVisitors can access the tower by taking the \"Tower Tour\", allowing them to climb as high as the base of the spire. From this level, there is a view of the interior of the hollow spire and the ancient wooden scaffolding inside it. There are 332 steps from ground level to the base of the spire, ascending a height of .\nMaintenance workers have sometimes climbed the spire, including to service the aircraft warning light and weather station at the summit. The first of the spire can be climbed by internal ladders. The remaining requires climbing out of a small door and up the exterior. In 2010, \"Blue Peter\" presenter Helen Skelton climbed the spire to assist in the changing of the lights.\nChapter house and Magna Carta.\nThe chapter house is notable for its octagonal shape, slender central pillar and decorative medieval frieze. It was redecorated in 1855\u20131859 by William Burges. The frieze, which circles the interior above the stalls, depicts scenes and stories from the books of Genesis and Exodus, including Adam and Eve, Noah, the Tower of Babel, and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.\nThe chapter house displays the best-preserved of the four surviving original copies of Magna Carta. This copy came to Salisbury because Elias of Dereham, who was present at Runnymede in 1215, was given the task of distributing some of the original copies. Elias later became a canon of Salisbury and supervised the construction of the cathedral.\nClock.\nThe Salisbury Cathedral clock, which dates from about AD 1386, is supposedly the oldest working modern clock in the world. The clock has no face; all clocks of that date rang out the hours on a bell. It was originally in a bell tower that was demolished in 1792. Following this demolition, the clock was moved to the Cathedral Tower, where it was in operation until 1884. The clock was then placed in storage and forgotten until it was discovered in an attic of the cathedral in 1928. It was repaired and restored to working order in 1956, and is now displayed in the nave. In 2007, remedial work and repairs were carried out.\nCathedral Close.\nThe cathedral close surrounds the cathedral, with the largest area to its western side. The close itself is bounded by Broad Walk and the West Walk, with the larger boundaries comprising North Walk, Bishops Walk, with Exeter Street to its east, and De Vaux Place to the south. The close contains a large number of listed buildings. The size of the close, Britain's largest, and the range of historic buildings within it, make it \"unrivalled in Britain in terms of scale and beauty\". Pevsner describes it as \"the most beautiful of England's closes\". The close has a preservation society dedicated to its protection. Entry is from the High Street through the North Gate, listed at Grade I. The High Street ends at Choristers Square which has seven buildings listed at Grade I: Mompesson House, now owned by the National Trust and operated as a museum, and its fronting wall and gates; the College of Matrons; the walls, gates and piers to Nos. 39 to 46; Hemingsby House; Wren Hall; and Braybrooke House. Grade II* listed buildings on the High Street and in Choristers Square include: Nos. 48, 48A, 50 and 50A, which flank the North Gate; 51, 52 and 53A; Nos. 55 and 55A; a former stable block; and the Hungerford Chantry. Grade II listed buildings on the square include: the walls and gates to No. 54; No. 55; Nos. 56A, B, and C; Nos. 57, 57A and 57B; and No. 58; and a K6 telephone kiosk.\nThe close proper is bounded by the West Walk and the Broad Walk. It contains six Grade I listed buildings; The King's House, which is now home of Salisbury Museum; Myles Place, No. 68, and its fronting walls; the Walton Canonry; the Leaden Hall and the South Gate. There are also six buildings listed Grade II*: The Wardrobe, which houses a military museum; Arundells, the former home of Edward Heath; the North Canonry and Gatehouse; the Old Deanery; Nos. 68A and 73; and De Vaux House. There are 19 Grade II listed buildings in the close. These include: the gates and stables to Arundells; the gates and garden house at The North Canonry, No. 60; the College of Sarum St Michael, and its gates; urns in the garden of No. 68; the gates and walling to No. 69; the lodges, gates and walls to No. 70; Nos. 71, 71A and 71B and their boundary walls; the South Canonry; No. 72 The Close; and Nos. 1-7 De Vaux Place.\nBetween De Vaux Place and the cathedral stands Salisbury Cathedral School, the main building of which, originally the Bishop's Palace, is listed at Grade I. The school lodge, and its adjoining wall, as well as a wall opposite surrounding the cathedral lawn, are all listed at Grade II. Continuing north along Bishop's Walk are five more listed structures; No. 5, The Close, listed II*, and its garden wall and bollards, both listed at Grade II; and the Diocesan Registry, and The Deanery, both listed at Grade II*. The eastern boundary of the close follows Exeter Street, and contains four listed structures, all at Grade I. These are: the boundary wall itself; Bishops Gate and St Anne's Gate; and Malmesbury House.\nThe northern end of the close terminates with the North Walk. This has one Grade I listed building, Sarum College, at No. 19, The Close. There are 23 Grade II* buildings: Nos. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14 and 14A, 16 to 18 inclusive, 20 and 21, 23 to 27 inclusive, 29, 30, 31, 33 to 36 inclusive, and 38. Buildings listed Grade II include: No. 10; the stableyard surface and gates to No. 11; No. 13; the forecourt walls to Malmesbury House; the garden walls and gateway to No. 16, two sets of walls at No. 17, the walls at Nos. 18 and 19, railings and gates at; the stables to Nos. 21 and 21A, its gate piers, its garden wall, and a commemorative arch set into the wall; No. 22; the railings to Nos. 25 and 26; No. 28; the railings to No. 31 and the wall to Nos. 32 and 33; the railings to Nos. 36A and 36B and 37.\nDepictions in art, literature and television.\nThe cathedral is the subject of a famous painting by John Constable. As a gesture of appreciation for John Fisher, Bishop of Salisbury, who commissioned this painting, Constable included the bishop and his wife in the canvas (bottom left). The view depicted in the painting has changed very little in almost two centuries.\nThe cathedral is apparently the inspiration for William Golding's novel \"The Spire\", in which the fictional Dean Jocelin makes the building of a cathedral spire his life's work. The construction of the cathedral is an important plot point in Edward Rutherfurd's historical novel \"Sarum\", which explores the historical settlement of the Salisbury area. The cathedral has been mentioned by the author Ken Follett as one of two models for the fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral in his historical novel \"The Pillars of the Earth\". It was also used for some external shots in the 2010 miniseries based on Follett's book and was shown as it is today in the final scene. Another mention of this cathedral was made by Jonathan Swift in \"Gulliver's Travels\", part II, chapter IV, making a comparison between its spire and the tower of the main temple of Lorbrulgrud, Brobdingnag's capital.\nIn 1990, Channel 4 marked the official launch of its NICAM stereo service with a live broadcast of Mahler's 9th Symphony from the cathedral. The cathedral was the setting for the 2005 BBC television drama \"Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle\", written by Rhidian Brook and directed by Susanna White. Kevin McCloud climbed the cathedral in his programme called \"Don't Look Down!\" in which he climbed high structures to conquer his fear of heights. The cathedral was the subject of a Channel 4 \"Time Team\" programme which was first broadcast on 8 February 2009.\nDiocese, dean and chapter.\nThe cathedral is the mother church of the Diocese of Salisbury and is the seat of the Bishop of Salisbury. The Right Reverend Stephen Lake was installed as bishop in 2022. The Dean is Nicholas Papadopulos, installed in 2018. The Canon Precentor is Anna Macham, installed in 2019, the Canon Chancellor is Ed Probert, installed in 2004 and the Canon Treasurer is Kenneth Padley, installed in 2022.\nBurials.\nNotable burials include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusic.\nOrgan.\nThroughout its history, there have been several organs in the cathedral. Of particular interest are the two fine four-manual instruments, the first by Renatus Harris (c.\u20091652\u20131724), which was replaced at the end of the 18th century, and the current organ, whose present fame has eclipsed the reputation of the former.\nThe four-manual instrument by Harris had been installed in 1710. The abundance of reed stops was typical of Harris' instruments and bears witness to the influence of the classical French organ. The instrument, not only spectacular in style but also of good quality, had remained practically unaltered (beyond occasional repairs) for nearly 80 years, until it was replaced at the same time as the cathedral was \"restored\" by James Wyatt between 1789 and 1792: the Bishop had convinced George III to furnish the cathedral with a new instrument once the work was complete.\nThis organ, by Samuel Green, was presented by the king in 1792 and was installed on top of the stone screen, which, unusually, did not divide the choir from the nave, but rather came from an unknown location in the cathedral. The organ was later taken out and moved to St Thomas's Church. When the new Willis organ was installed, its distinct sound from 55 powerfully-voiced stops, directly in the choir with little casework, was quite a contrast to Green's more gentle 23-stop instrument.\nThe present-day instrument was built in 1877 by Henry Willis &amp; Sons. Walter Alcock, who was organist of the cathedral from 1916, oversaw a strictly faithful restoration of the famous Father Willis organ, completed in 1934, even going to such lengths as to refuse to allow parts of the instrument to leave the cathedral in case any unauthorised tonal alterations were made without his knowledge, while allowing some discrete additions in the original style of the organ (as well as modernisation of the organ's actions) by Henry Willis III, the grandson of Father Willis. The instrument was extensively restored between 2019 and 2020.\nOrganists.\nIt is recorded that in 1463 John Kegewyn was organist of Salisbury Cathedral. Among the notable organists of more recent times have been a number of composers and well-known performers including Bertram Luard-Selby, Charles Frederick South, Walter Alcock, David Valentine Willcocks, Douglas Albert Guest, Christopher Dearnley, Richard Godfrey Seal and the BBC presenter Simon Lole.\nChoir.\nSalisbury Cathedral Choir holds annual auditions for boys and girls aged 7\u20139 years old for scholarships to Salisbury Cathedral School, which housed in the former Bishop's Palace. The boys' choir and the girls' choir (each 16 strong) sing alternate daily Evensong and Sunday Matins and Eucharist services throughout the school year. There are also many additional services during the Christian year particularly during Advent, Christmas, Holy Week, and Easter. The Advent \"From Darkness to Light\" services are the best known. Choristers come from across the country and some board. Six lay vicars (adult men) comprise the rest of the choir, singing tenor, alto and bass parts. In 1993, the cathedral was the venue for the first broadcast of Choral Evensong (the long-running BBC Radio 3 programme) to be sung by a girls' cathedral choir.\nLibrary.\nThe cathedral library holds 193 manuscript books \u2013 60 of them written at the first cathedral at Old Sarum \u2013 and around 12,000 early printed books. There are 43 books (incunabula) from the earliest years of printing, up to the year 1500. Significant collections include works of 16th-century theology from bishop Edmund Gheast, medical and science books from bishop Seth Ward, and 19th-century theology from dean Henry Hamilton.\nIn late 2024, the Friends of the Nations' Libraries raised \u00a390,000 to purchase a 13th-century Bible, illuminated at Salisbury by the Sarum Master, which they donated to the cathedral.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Richard Carlson, Julia Adams, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno, Nestor Paiva, and Whit Bissell. The film's plot follows a group of scientists who encounter a piscine amphibious humanoid in the waters of the Amazon; the Creature, also known as the Gill-man, was played by Ben Chapman on land and by Ricou Browning underwater. Produced and distributed by Universal-International, \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" premiered in Detroit on February 12, 1954, and was released on a regional basis, opening on various dates.\n\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" was filmed in three dimensions (3D) and originally projected by the polarized light method. The audience wore viewers with gray polarizing filters, similar to the viewers most commonly used today. Because the brief 1950s 3D film fad had peaked in mid-1953 and was fading fast in early 1954, many audiences actually saw the film \"flat\", in two dimensions (2D). Typically, the film was shown in 3D in large downtown theaters and flat in smaller neighborhood theaters. In 1975, \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" was released to theaters in the red-and-blue-glasses anaglyph 3D format, which was also used for a 1980 home video release on Beta and VHS videocassettes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nA geology expedition in the Amazon rainforest uncovers fossilized evidence (a skeletal hand with webbed fingers) from the Devonian period that provides a direct link between land and sea animals. Expedition leader Dr. Carl Maia orders his two assistants Luis and Tomas to stay in camp while he visits the marine biology institute.\nCarl reunites with his friend and former student, ichthyologist Dr. David Reed. David works at an aquarium in California, but more recently, he has been a guest at Carl's institute in Brazil to study lungfish. David persuades his boss, the financially minded Dr. Mark Williams, to fund a return expedition to the Amazon to look for the remainder of the skeleton.\nSoon after Carl leaves camp, a piscine amphibious humanoid, a living member of the same species from which the fossil originated, becomes curious about the expedition's camp. When its sudden appearance frightens the assistants, they panic and attack, and in response, the enraged Creature kills them both. \nThe group goes aboard the tramp steamer \"Rita\", captained by crusty Lucas. The expedition consists of David, Carl, Mark, David's girlfriend and colleague Kay Lawrence, and another scientist, Dr. Edwin Thompson. When they arrive at the camp, they discover Carl's assistants have been killed while he was away. Lucas suggests it was likely done by a jaguar, but the others are unsure.\nA further excavation of the area where Carl found the fossil turns up nothing. Mark is ready to give up the search, but David suggests that perhaps thousands of years ago, the part of the embankment containing the rest of the skeleton fell into the water and was washed downriver, broken up by the current. Carl says the tributary empties into a lagoon. Lucas calls it the \"Black Lagoon\", a paradise from which no one has ever returned. The scientists decide to risk it, unaware that the Creature - the amphibious \"Gill-man\" - that killed Carl's assistants has been watching them.\nTaking notice of the beautiful Kay, the Creature follows the \"Rita\" all the way downriver to the Black Lagoon. Once the expedition arrives, David and Mark go diving to collect rock samples from the lagoon floor. After they return, Kay goes swimming and is stalked underwater by the Creature, who then gets briefly caught in one of the ship's drag lines. Although it escapes, the Creature leaves a claw behind in the net, revealing its existence.\nAfter subsequent encounters with the Creature claim the lives of Lucas's crew members, it attacks Kay and attempts to abduct her, but it is captured and locked in a cage aboard the \"Rita\". During the night, it escapes and attacks Edwin, who was guarding it. Edwin smashes the Creature with a lantern, driving it off, but he is severely injured. Following this incident, David decides they should return to civilization. Mark, who is obsessed with capturing (or killing) the Creature, objects.\nAs the \"Rita\" tries to leave, they find the Creature has blocked the lagoon's entrance with fallen logs. While the others attempt to remove the logs, Mark is mauled to death while trying to capture the Creature single-handed underwater. The Creature then climbs aboard the \"Rita\" and approaches Kay from behind. She screams as the Creature grabs her, taking her away to its cavern lair. David, Lucas, and Carl pursue them, rescuing Kay and fatally shooting the Creature in the chest. It meanders aimlessly outside before wading back into the lagoon and attempts to swim away, but dies of its injuries and sinks into the darkness of the water as the group watch.\nProduction.\nProducer William Alland was attending a 1941 dinner party during the filming of \"Citizen Kane\" (in which he played the reporter Thompson) when Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa told him about the myth of a race of half-fish, half-human creatures in the Amazon River. Alland wrote story notes titled \"The Sea Monster\" 10 years later, using \"Beauty and the Beast\" as inspiration. In December 1952, Maurice Zimm expanded this into a treatment, which Harry Essex and Arthur Ross rewrote as \"The Black Lagoon\". Following the success of the 3D film \"House of Wax\" in 1953, Jack Arnold was hired to direct the film in the same format.\nThe designer of the approved Gill-man was Disney animator Milicent Patrick, though her role was deliberately downplayed by make-up artist Bud Westmore, who for half a century received sole credit for the creature's conception. Jack Kevan, who worked on \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) and made prosthetics for amputees during World War II, created the bodysuit, while Chris Mueller Jr. sculpted the head.\nBen Chapman portrayed the Gill-man for the majority of the scenes shot at Universal City, California. The on-water scenes were filmed at Park Lake on the Universal back lot. The costume made sitting impossible for Chapman for the 14 hours of each day that he wore it, and it overheated easily. Due to these difficulties, Chapman often stayed in the studio's back-lot lake, frequently requesting to be hosed down. He also could not see very well while wearing the headpiece, which caused him to scrape Julie Adams' head against the wall when carrying her in the grotto scenes.\nRicou Browning played the Gill-man in the underwater shots, which were filmed by the second unit in Wakulla Springs, Florida. While filming underwater, Browning reportedly held his breath for up to four minutes at a time. In a 2013 interview, Browning clarified: \"If you're not doing anything at all, four minutes is possible, but not if you're moving in the water. If you're swimming fast or fighting, you use up a lot of oxygen, and it cuts it down to, at the most, two minutes.\"\nReception and analysis.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 47 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"A solid, atmospheric creature feature that entertains without attempting to be deeper than it needs.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 68 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating .\nLeonard Maltin awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: \"Archetypal '50s monster movie has been copied so often that some of the edge is gone, but ... is still entertaining, with juicy atmosphere and luminous underwater photography sequences.\" The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nPsychoanalyst Barbara Creed provided a feminist reading of classical movie monsters like the Creature or the Phantom of the Opera, arguing that despite their superficially masculine characterizations, their antagonization of a powerful male hero instead positions them as opponents of the patriarchal social order, thus imbuing them with feminine traits and creating a sympathetic connection between them and the women they victimize.\nIn 2025, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" as having the best stunts of 1954.\nSequels and remakes.\nSequels.\n\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" spawned two sequels: \"Revenge of the Creature\" (1955), which was also filmed and released in 3D in hopes of reviving the format, and \"The Creature Walks Among Us\" (1956), filmed in 2D. A comedic appearance with Abbott and Costello on an episode of \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\" aired prior to the first film's release. The appearance is commonly known as \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Creature from the Black Lagoon\".\nCancelled remakes.\nIn 1982, John Landis wanted Jack Arnold to direct a remake of the film, and Nigel Kneale was commissioned to write the screenplay. Kneale completed the script, which involved a pair of creatures, one destructive and the other calm and sensitive, being persecuted by the United States Navy. A decision to make the film in 3D led to the remake being canceled by producers at Universal, both for budgetary concerns and to avoid a clash with \"Jaws 3-D\".\nIn 1992, John Carpenter was developing the remake at Universal. He originally hired Bill Phillips to write the script, while Rick Baker was hired to create the 3D model of the Creature, but the project never got the green light. Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris wrote a new script, and Universal offered Peter Jackson the director's chair in 1995, but he chose to work instead on \"King Kong\".\nIn February 1996, Ivan Reitman was planning to direct the remake, but it never materialized. With the financial success of \"The Mummy\" remake in May 1999, the development of the \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" remake was revived. In December 2001, Gary Ross signed on to write and produce the remake with his father, Arthur A. Ross, one of the original's writers. He told \"The Hollywood Reporter\": \"The story my father wrote embodies the clash between primitive men and civilized men, and that obviously makes it a fertile area for re-examination\".\nIn August 2002, Guillermo del Toro, a fan of the original feature, was attached to direct a remake. He had hoped to do a story focused more on the Creature's viewpoint while also letting him have a successful romantic liaison. He later went on to turn this idea into the 2017 film \"The Shape of Water\" after Universal rejected the concept. Because of these creative clashes and his commitments to many other projects, Universal dropped del Toro and hired Tedi Sarafian (credited on \"\") to write a script in March 2003.\nIn October 2005, Breck Eisner signed on as director. He said to be a fan of the film: \"As a kid, I remember loving Jack Arnold's original version of this film. What I really want to do is update an iconic image from the '50s and bring in more of the sci-fi sensibility of \"Alien\" or John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982)\". Ross said in March 2007 the Gill-man's origin would be reinvented, with him being the result of a pharmaceutical corporation polluting the Amazon.\nHowever, the production was delayed by the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike; as a result, Eisner instead made \"The Crazies\" (2010), the number-one project on his priority list. His new goal was to finish \"The Crazies\" and then begin filming \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" in Manaus, Brazil, and on the Amazon River in Peru. Eisner was inspired to shoot on location by the film \"Fitzcarraldo\", and the boat set had been built. Eisner continued to rewrite the script, which was to be a summer blockbuster full of \"action and excitement, but [still] scary\". Eisner spent six months designing the new incarnation of the Gill-man with Mark McCreery (\"Jurassic Park\", and Davy Jones' designer). The director said the new design was \"very faithful to the original, but updated\" and that the Gill-man would still remain sympathetic. In 2009, it was reported that Carl Erik Rinsch might direct a remake that would be produced by Marc Abraham, Eric Newman, and Gary Ross; however, a project featuring the ensemble had been abandoned by 2011.\nIn March 2012, Universal announced that a remake was in production and would simply be titled \"The Black Lagoon\" rather than \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" to distinguish between the two versions. In October, the studio hired Dave Kajganich to write the film. The film was expected to hit theaters by May 2014 but was ultimately canceled. In 2020, Universal was considering Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans\nfor a remake.\nUniversal Pictures, beginning as early as 2014, began developing a shared universe of rebooted modern-day versions of their classic Universal Monsters, with the studio having various films in different stages of development. The series began with \"The Mummy\" (2017) and was intended to be followed by the remake of \"Bride of Frankenstein\" in 2019 prior to the critical and commercial failure of \"The Mummy\". \"The Creature from the Black Lagoon\" was a remake also intended to be developed within the reboot with a story written by Jeff Pinkner and a script written by Will Beall. In June, Kurtzman revealed that the Gill-man in this film would be from the Amazon, but on November 8, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan moved on to other projects, leaving the future of the \"Dark Universe\" even further in doubt. In January 2019, the \"Dark Universe\" film series was officially scrapped.\nIn August 2024, it was announced that James Wan was in talks to direct a remake of \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". Sean Tretta was reported to be set to write the screenplay based on a treatment by Wan, Rafael Jordan, and Bryan Coyne.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Each oath taker is from the host nation and takes the oath on behalf of all athletes, officials, or coaches at the Games. The athletes' oath was first introduced for the 1920 Summer Olympic Games, with oaths for the officials and coaches added in 1972 and 2010. The oath is usually said in the language of the nation which is hosting the games; however, in 1994 both the athletes' and officials' oaths were said in English. Until the 1984 games the oath takers swore upon their nation's flag; since then all have taken the oath whilst holding the Olympic Flag. All three of the oaths were combined into one beginning at the 2018 Winter Games.\nThe inspiration for an oath came from the Ancient Olympic Games where competitors swore on a statue of Zeus. An oath for the athletes was first thought of in 1906, following unsportsmanlike incidents. An athletes' oath was introduced for the 1920 games and Victor Boin was the first person to take the oath on behalf of all athletes. Giuliana Minuzzo was the first woman to take the athletes' oath at the winter games in 1956, while Heidi Schuller did likewise at the Summer Olympics in 1972. The first Olympic Champion to take the oath was Rudolf Ismayr, who took it at the 1936 Games. The only occasion where more than one person has said an oath occurred at the 1988 Summer Olympics when Hur Jae and Shon Mi-Na took the athletes' oath together, until 2021 when rules around gender equality decreed that each oath would be taken by a man and a woman. The oath has changed over the years to remove nationalism and to reflect drugs in sport and equality.\nAn oath for the officials was first discussed in the 1950s. It was not, however, until 1970 that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to include an oath of the officials as well as athletes at the Olympic Games. The first oath for the officials was taken by Fumio Asaki at the 1972 Winter Olympic Games. When the Youth Olympics were created the IOC decided to have an oath for coaches as they realised that young athletes look to them particularly. This was introduced into the adult games for the 2012 edition.\nHistory.\nAn oath was an idea taken from the Ancient Olympic Games where competitors swore an oath beside a statue of Zeus. A call for an oath was announced as early as 1906 by International Olympic Committee (IOC) president and founder Pierre de Coubertin in the \"Revue Olympique\" (\"Olympic Review\" in French). This was done in an effort to ensure fairness and impartiality. \nThe Olympic Oath was first taken at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp by the fencer Victor Boin. \nBoin's oath in 1920 was:\n\"We swear. We will take part in the Olympic Games in a spirit of chivalry, for the honour of our country and for the glory of sport.\"\nAt a winter sports week in Chamonix in 1924, which were retrospectively call the Olympic Games in 1926, all the competitors took an Olympic style oath and were led by Camille Mandrillon. Rudolf Ismayr was the first Olympic Champion to take the oath, doing so at the 1936 Games in Berlin. In 1956 Giuliana Chenal-Minuzzo became the first woman to recite the oath.\nIn 1961, \"swear\" was replaced by \"promise\" and \"the honour of our countries\" by \"the honour of our teams\" in an effort to eliminate nationalism at the Olympic Games. Therefore the oath was as follows:\n\"In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules that govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams.\"\nAn oath for the officials had been discussed since the 1950s when the International Amateur Boxing Association asked all its officials to undertake an oath. In 1970 the IOC amended rule 57 of the charter and decreed that a judge from the host nation would also take an oath. The first judges' oath was taken at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo by Fumio Asaki and Heinz Pollay performed the task at that year's summer games in Munich.\nThe Munich games saw Heidi Sch\u00fcller become the first female athlete to take the oath at the Summer Games; women had been competing at the games since 1900. At the 1988 Games the athletes' oath for the first time was undertaken by more than one person, when Hur Jae and Shon Mi-Na took the oath in unison.\nAll persons up until the 1980 Games swore the oath on their country's flag. However, in an attempt to eliminate nationalism from the oath ceremony, all have sworn on the Olympic Flag since the 1984 games. The oaths are usually spoken in the language of the host nation (or athlete's mother tongue \u2013 Bojan Krizaj represented Yugoslavia but spoke Slovenian), but in 1994 both of the oaths were conducted in English rather than Norwegian.\nIn 1999, the IOC created the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in an effort to form a more organized battle against doping. Thus, the Athletes Oath was amended to include references to doping and drugs. In 2010 the IOC recognised that younger athletes, in particular, are influenced by their coaches. At the first Youth Olympic Games, coaches were also required to undertake an oath for this reason. With effect from the 2018 Winter Olympics, the three oaths were combined into one, led by an athlete, although representatives of judges and coaches are still involved in the taking of the oath. In July 2021 the oath was further refined to highlight inclusion and equality. The changes to the wording came from the IOC Athletes\u2019 Commission. In addition the number of oath takers at each games were expanded from three to six, to ensure a member of each gender was represented in each oath as part of a commitment to promote women in sport at all levels and in all structures, as stated in the Olympic Charter.\nAthletes' Oath.\nThe chosen athlete, a representative of all the participating Olympic competitors, recited the following from 2000 until 2016:\n\"In the name of all competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, committing ourselves to a sport without doping and without drugs, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams.\"\nThe Officials' Oath.\nThe judge/official, also from the host nation, likewise held a corner of the flag and said the following:\n\"In the name of all the judges and officials, I promise that we shall officiate in these Olympic Games with complete impartiality, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship.\"\nThe Coaches' Oath.\nAt the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, an additional oath was taken by a coach; this was added to the protocol for the 2012 Games:\n\"In the name of all the coaches and other members of the athletes' entourage, I promise that we shall commit ourselves to ensuring that the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play is fully adhered to and upheld in accordance with the fundamental principles of Olympism.\"\nUnified Oath.\nBeginning in PyeongChang at the 2018 Winter Olympics, there was only one oath.\nA representative for the athletes, judges, and coaches each recites the following lines respectively:\n\"In the name of the athletes.\"\n\"In the name of all judges.\"\n\"In the name of all the coaches and officials.\"\nThe athletes' representative then completes the oath:\n\"We promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play. We all commit ourselves to sport without doping and cheating. We do this, for the glory of sport, for the honour of our teams and in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism.\"\nEquality changes.\nIn July 2021 the oath was updated to include elements around inclusion and equality. The oath from now on would be said by a man and a woman of each discipline.\nThe representatives for the athletes, judges, and coaches each recites the following lines respectively:\n\"In the name of the athletes.\"\n\"In the name of all judges.\"\n\"In the name of all the coaches and officials.\"\nThe athletes' representative then completes the oath:\n\"We promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play, inclusion and equality. Together we stand in solidarity and commit ourselves to sport without doping, without cheating, without any form of discrimination. We do this for the honour of our teams, in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism, and to make the world a better place through sport.\"\nSpeakers.\nThe athletes, judges and coaches that have delivered the Olympic Oath are listed below.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population in 2011 was 7,482, in an area of 487.18\u00a0km2. The town proper had a population of 1,960 in 2001. Nicknamed \"Cidade Museu\" (\"Museum City\") of the Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes region, it is located 86 kilometres from Bragan\u00e7a, preserving many of its medieval and Renaissance-era traditions and architecture. It has a language of its own, Mirandese, which enjoys official status in Portugal, in addition to cultural and historical discontinuity with the rest of the Portuguese state. The town is located on the border with Spain, with the Douro River separating the two countries. The nearest town in Spain is Zamora.\nThe present mayor is Artur Manuel Rodrigues Nunes (Socialist). The municipal holiday is on 10 July.\nHistory.\nThe origin of Miranda do Douro as a populated place is still discussed by historians, but archeologist discoveries give evidence that inhabitants had been living there during the Bronze Age. Around AD 716, the Moors defeated local Visigothic tribes, and occupied some of the lands, calling the area \"Mir-H\u00e2ndul\".\nBy the late 11th century, Le\u00f3n possessed the region as a stepping-stone to Portugal. The settlement of the village of Miranda developed through the initiative of King Denis, in an area that lay between the lateral slopes of the Douro and Fresno Rivers. It was in Miranda that the Treaty of Alcanices was signed between Denis and Ferdinand IV of Castile, setting the border between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Crown of Castile.\nMiranda was founded on 18 December 1286, and immediately elevated to the status of \"vila\" (), with one of its prerequisites declaring that the administrative division would be a Crown fief. From that period forward, Miranda became progressively one of the most important towns that skirted the Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes region.\nThe Castilians occupied Miranda do Douro during the late 14th century, and would remain there until they were expelled by John I of Portugal. On 10 July 1545, King John III elevated \"Miranda do Douro\" to the status of city, at the same time becoming the first diocese in Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes (in a papal bull on 22 May 1545 by Pope Paul III, which segmented a major part of the archdiocese of Braga. Miranda, therefore, became the capital of the Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, seat of the bishopric (that included the residence of the bishop, canons and ecclesiastical authorities), military governorship and civil centre.\nIn 1762, during the Seven Years' War, the army of Charles III of Spain invaded the Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes. During the course of his invasion, the gunpowder magazine (with over 500 barrels of powder) was hit by a cannon, destroying the four towers of the castle and many of the barrios in the vicinity. Approximately a third of the city's population (about 400 residents) were killed, resulting in the ruin of the religious, demographic and urbanized portion of Miranda. It was almost two years later (1764) that friar Aleixo Miranda Henriques (then the twenty-third bishop) would abandon Miranda, moving to Bragan\u00e7a, which had become a rival episcopal seat in the northeast part of Portugal. By 1680, it was the only ecclesiastical seat in the region.\nThe area was served by a narrow gauge railway, the Sabor line \"(Linha do Sabor)\", which ran over 100\u00a0km between Duas Igrejas-Miranda and the southern terminus at Pocinho, where connections could be made to the main line to Porto. The Sabor line closed in 1988.\nGeography.\nPhysical geography.\nMiranda do Douro is located in a region that skirts the border between the Portuguese Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes region, and the Spanish autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n. The relief in this region is influenced by hard quartzite deposits near the border region, making erosion difficult, resulting in high escarpments and cliffs. The soils are composed of schists and granite bedrocks.\nEcoregions/Protected areas.\nThe \"Parque Natural do Douro Internacional\" (), which encompasses the municipalities of Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo, Freixo de Espada \u00e0 Cinta, Miranda do Douro and Mogadouro, includes an area of , along the border portion of the Douro River. It was created on 11 May 1998 to encompass the constituent territories that encompass the Rivers Douro and \u00c1gueda, along the Spain-Portugal border that include similar geological and climatic conditions, and to help support flora and fauna in the region, while allowing appropriate human activities. The creation of the complementary \"Parque Natural de Arribes\" in Spain, allowed the systematic protection of an area that encompassed the larger ecosystem and biome.\nClimate.\nMiranda do Douro has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csb\"). Due to its inland location in the \"Nordeste Transmontano\", the area experiences extreme weather fluctuations. A common saying of the region goes: \"Em Miranda h\u00e1 nove meses de Inverno e tr\u00eas de Inferno (\"In Miranda there are nine months of winter and three months of Hell\")\". Summers tend to be dry and warm; while winters are rigorously cold with some snowfall, having average minimum temperatures hovering around in January, and frequently falling negative, with 70 days of frost per year on average. The summer is completely opposite: hot and dry with maximum temperatures hovering around .\nClimate.\nMiranda do Douro has a hot summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Csa\") with some continental influences due to its long distance from the sea. Its climate is similar to that of Bragan\u00e7a, although it is drier, as it is further from the Atlantic Ocean and consequently less affected by Atlantic depressions.\nSummers are hot, with temperatures exceeding and occasionally . Winters are cool, but cold by Portuguese standards, with temperatures frequently below and on cold nights it can drop below . On average, there are 58 days of frost per year.\nHuman geography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 13 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nMiranda do Douro is twinned with:\nCulture.\nThe city has been isolated from the rest of the country for many centuries, so the ancestral way of life is still vivid in the traditions and even in the language (see below). Apart from the distance, the weather conditions are also an adversary, as it is very cold and snowy in winter, and very dry and hot in summer.\nGastronomy is one of the local hallmarks, well within the tradition of Tr\u00e1s-os Montes. \"Posta \u00e0 Mirandesa\", a heavy, thick steak, is the traditional dish, known and imitated through the rest of the country. The wine from the region has a high alcoholic graduation (17\u201318\u00b0) and matches the regional cuisine well.\nThe city's old quarter, with the cathedral, dates back to the Middle Ages. Most houses are small and one story high. Inside the old city proper lie the town hall and museum, the \"Museu da Terra de Miranda\" (museum of the lands of Miranda), which has displays of archaeological findings, farm life, local clothing, and traditional masks.\nThe city has no industries but depends on commercial activity, mainly the sale of house textiles and cutlery from the village of Pala\u00e7oulo. Spaniards come in great number on holidays and weekends. There are several hotels, among them the Pousada de Santa Catarina, which overlooks the Douro River.\nMirandese language.\nThe surrounding area is home to the speakers of Mirandese (\"Mirand\u00eas\"), a language of the Astur-Leonese family, related to Asturian and Leonese. Mirandese was recognised in 1999 by the Portuguese state as co-official with Portuguese for local matters, and an estimate of between 10,000 and 15,000 people speak the language.\nTourism.\nMiranda do Douro is in the middle of Douro International Natural Park, also known as Parque Natural do Douro Internacional in Portuguese, which is a protected natural area located in northeastern Portugal and northwestern Spain. The natural park promotes the unique ecological and cultural heritage of the region.\nThe park is situated along the Douro River, which forms the border between Portugal and Spain for a significant portion of its course. It covers an area of approximately 85,000 hectares (210,000 acres), with about two-thirds of the park located in Portugal and the remaining third in Spain.\nThe walking trail from Miranda do Douro to S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o das Arribas is a beautiful route in Portugal that offers stunning views of the Douro River and the surrounding landscapes. The trail starts in Miranda do Douro and leads to S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o das Arribas, which is known for its impressive cliffs overlooking the Douro River.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Radioactive decay is the process in which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting ionizing particles and radiation.

Cobalt-60 while widely used for purposes such as food irradiation is not a practicable RTG isotope as most of its decay energy is released by gamma rays, requiring substantial shielding.

As of June 2024[ [update]], the EU has no formal plans to become a federation.\nSince the 1950s, European integration has seen the development of a supranational system of governance, as its institutions move further from the concept of simple intergovernmentalism and more towards a federalised system. However, with the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, new intergovernmental elements have been introduced alongside the more federal systems, making it more difficult to define the EU. The European Union, which operates through a hybrid system\u00a0\u2013 thus often described as \u00a0\u2013 of intergovernmentalism and supranationalism, is not officially a federation or even a confederation, although many contemporary scholars of federalism view it as a federal system.\nHistory.\nA Pan-European movement gained some momentum from the 1920s with the creation of the Paneuropean Union, based on Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi's 1923 manifesto \"Paneuropa\", which presented the idea of a unified European State. This movement, led by Coudenhove-Kalergi and subsequently by Otto von Habsburg, is the oldest European unification movement. His ideas influenced Aristide Briand, who gave a speech in favour of a European Union in the League of Nations on 8 September 1929, and in 1930, who wrote his \"Memorandum on the Organization of a Regime of European Federal Union\" for the Government of France.\nAt the end of World War II, the political climate favoured unity in Western Europe, seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of nationalism which had devastated the continent. \nOne of the first practical and successful proposals for European cooperation came in 1951 with the European Coal and Steel Community. Since then, the European Community has gradually evolved to Union in which a whole range of policy areas where its member states hope to benefit from working together.\nThe process of intergovernmentally pooling powers, harmonising national policies and creating and enforcing supranational institutions, is called European integration. Other than the vague aim of \"ever closer union\" in the 1983 Solemn Declaration on European Union, the Union (meaning its member governments) has no current policy to create a federal state.\nDebate on European unity is often vague as to the boundaries of 'Europe'. The word 'Europe' is widely used as a synonym for the European Union, although most of the European continent's geographical area is not in the EU, and some of the EU is outside of Europe (e.g. French Guiana). Most of Europe's people do, however, live in the EU.\nMulti-speed integration.\nThe multi-speed Europe thesis envisions an alternative type of European integration, where the EU countries that want a more integrated EU can accelerate their own integration, whereas other countries may go at a slower pace or cease further integration altogether. Specific current examples include the Eurozone and the Schengen Area, which not all members have joined.\nPresent situation.\n An Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational European organisations and agreements \nThe European Union (EU) is not legally (\"de jure\") a federation, although various academics have argued that it contains some federal characteristics. About how various scholars approach the issue, R. Daniel Kelemen of Rutgers University said: \"Unencumbered by the prejudice that the EU is \"sui generis\" and incomparable, federalism scholars now regularly treat the EU as a case in their comparative studies (Friedman-Goldstein, 2001; Filippov, Ordeshook, Shevtsova, 2004; Roden, 2005; Bednar, 2006). For the purposes of the present analysis, the EU has the necessary minimal attributes of a federal system and crucially the EU is riven with many of the same tensions that afflict federal systems.\"\nAccording to Joseph H. H. Weiler, \"Europe has charted its own brand of constitutional federalism\". Jean-Michel Josselin and Alain Marciano see the European Court of Justice as being a primary force behind building a federal legal order in the Union with Josselin stating that \"A complete shift from a confederation to a federation would have required to straightforwardly replace the principality of the member states vis-\u00e0-vis the Union by that of the European citizens. \u2026 As a consequence, both confederate and federate features coexist in the judicial landscape.\"\nThomas Risse and Tanja A. B\u00f6rzel wrote: \"The EU only lacks two significant features of a federation. First, the Member States remain the 'masters' of the treaties, i.e., they have the exclusive power to amend or change the constitutive treaties of the EU. Second, the EU lacks a real 'tax and spend' capacity, in other words, there is no fiscal federalism.\"\nOther academics have argued that the EU is unlikely to evolve into a unified federal state. Kelemen has taken this view himself in a paper co-written with Andy Tarrant, arguing that limits placed on the bureaucratic capacity of the European institutions \u2013 such as the relatively small size of the European Commission \u2013 form a barrier to the creation of a federal European state. In their words: \"widespread political opposition to the creation of anything approximating a large, unified executive bureaucracy in Brussels has long-since ended hopes, for the few who harboured them, of creating a European superstate.\" Some common points in this context are that the European budget is very small and does not finance a lot of the economic activity of the European Union; that each member state of the European Union has its own foreign relations and its own military; that it is often the case that European Union member states decide to opt out of agreements which they oppose; and that member states still retain sovereignty over a large number of areas which might be expected to be transferred to a federal authority under a federal system. One important fact is that treaties must be agreed by all member states even if a particular treaty has support among the vast majority of the population of the European Union. Member states may also want legally binding guarantees that a particular treaty will not affect a nation's position on certain issues.\nUse of the word 'federal' is itself the cause of some disagreement. Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing found opposition from the United Kingdom towards including the word \"federal\" in the proposed European Constitution, and hence replaced the word with \"Community\".\nIn November 2021, the incoming German government, the Scholz cabinet, called for European federalism in the coalition agreement and wanted to help achieve this.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town is also the head of its judicial district and the seat of the Bishop of Urgell, one of the co-princes of Andorra. It is the most populated town of the region, with 17.4% of its population. La Seu d'Urgell and Puigcerd\u00e0 together have 30% of the population of the area. It has a population of .\nIt is located at the confluence of the Segre and the Valira rivers. The city is in the local region of Urgellet, a Pyrenean region formed by 16 municipalities of Alt Urgell. Urgellet and Andorra were originally the County of Urgell with its capital in la Seu d'Urgell before the county expansion to the south.\nAlt Urgell is the gateway to the state of Andorra and the proximity to this important population center and economic activity is one of the main reasons for the current vigour of the city of la Seu d'Urgell within Alt Pirineu.\nThe town's patron saints are Saint Ot of Urgell, Saint Sebastian, and the Virgin of Urgell. While the Virgin of N\u00faria and Sant Ermengol are the main patrons of the diocese of Urgell, Sant Ermengol is the most prominent in the city than other patrons. Probably that is why there are various events throughout the year dedicated to Sant Ermengol, such as the Sant Ermengol Fair, one of the oldest in Catalonia, and the altarpiece of Sant Ermengol.\nThe Segre Olympic Park, built in 1992 for the Barcelona Summer Olympic Games, is a pump-driven canoe and kayak sports venue located adjacent to the historical centre of la Seu d'Urgell.\nName origins.\nThe name \"la Seu d'Urgell\", in Latin \"Sedes Urgelli\", is formed by two different words: \"Seu\" from the Latin \"Sedes\", or seat, and \"Urgell\" a pre-Roman name. Catalan linguist Joan Coromines interpreted that the name is related to the presence of water.\nThe Iberian settlement of Arse-durgui (or Arse d'Urgui) was on the hill of Castellciutat. At that time the hill was called \"Puiolo Urgelli\". Where there was the village of Arse-durgui they built the city of Urgell (in Latin \"civitas Orgellia\" and in Catalan \"ciutat d'Urgell\") and here lies the origin of the name Castellciutat. Until the eighteenth century the town was known simply as \"Ciutat\" (City in English) and \"Castell\" (Castle) was added because the existence of an ancient castle that was home of the Counts of Urgell.\nShortly after the destruction of the former Orgellia new neighborhood arose, which became the new home of the Diocese of Urgell. Its name \"vicus Sedes Urgelli\" indicates that the town is the episcopal see of the Bishop of Urgell.\nOver time, \"Sedes Urgelli\" took importance and lost the word \"vicus\" (denotes that it was a district) while \"civitas Orgellia\" lost the word \"Orgellia\" and becomes simply \"Civitas\" until the 18th century.\nLocation.\nThe city is at the confluence of two rivers, the Segre and Gran Valira, located in a plain 7\u00a0km long and 691\u00a0meters high surrounded by high mountains, such as the Cad\u00ed mountain range. The plain is called plana de la Seu and was formed by the Segre river.\nBecause it is located at one of the major crossroads of communication in the Catalan Pyrenees, la Seu d'Urgell has had a unique and historic role in the county of Urgell. The roads to Andorra, Cerdanya and the low Segre all converge on la Seu d'Urgell.\nParallel to the Valira river rises a mountain range, where stand the remains of two great fortresses, the Ciutadella and Ciutat Castle (in Castellciutat), both of historic importance in the town. Small banks or open plains around the Segre are separated by gorges.\nIn the north, La Seu d'Urgell has borders with the municipality of les Valls de Valira, to the west with Montferrer i Castellb\u00f2 where there is La Seu d'Urgell Airport (also known as Andorra-Pirineus airport), to the south-west with Ribera d'Urgellet, to the south-east with Al\u00e0s i Cerc, and to the north-east with Estamariu.\nThe municipality includes a small exclave to the east.\nLa Seu d'Urgell municipality.\nFairs, festivals and markets.\nDespite the low population density of Alt Pirineu i Aran, the area hosts 6.6% of the exhibitions and other civic activities in Catalonia.

A skilled swimmer, he was known for his innovative underwater stunt work, notably in the 1954 film \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", in which he portrayed the titular Gill-man during the film's underwater scenes, and in the 1965 James Bond film \"Thunderball\", for which he was the underwater sequences director. He was also the co-creator of the \"Flipper\" media franchise.\nEarly life.\nRicou Ren Browning was born in Fort Pierce, Florida, on February 16, 1930. He majored in physical education at Florida State University.\nCareer.\nBrowning started a career in water shows, moving on to produce shows. Browning worked at Wakulla Springs in the 1940s and learned to perform in underwater newsreels conceived by Newt Perry, who later took Browning along when he opened Weeki Wachee Springs.\nWhile working at Wakulla Springs in 1953, Browning was asked to show around a film crew scouting for shooting locations. According to Browning, \"Their cameraman asked if I could swim in front of the cameras so they could get the perspective of the size of a human being against the fish and the grass. So I did.\" Days later, the crew offered Browning the role of the titular Gill-man in the film \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" (1954). Browning accepted, and played the Gill-man in the film's underwater scenes, while actor Ben Chapman played the monster on land. During filming, Browning reportedly held his breath underwater for up to four minutes at a time. Browning reprised his role as the underwater Gill-man in two sequels, \"Revenge of the Creature\" (1955) and \"The Creature Walks Among Us\" (1956).\nBrowning continued in movie production and joined Ivan Tors' studios in Florida, where he co-wrote and co-produced the 1963 film \"Flipper\" (about an intelligent bottlenose dolphin) together with Jack Cowden; Browning also directed the second unit underwater scenes for the film. Browning continued writing and directing for the subsequent \"Flipper\" television series that debuted in 1964.\nHe made his feature film directorial debut with \"Salty\" (1973), which he also co-wrote with Cowden, and directed the cult film \"Mr. No Legs\" (1978).\nHe worked as second unit director, stunt coordinator and underwater sequence director on a number of features, including the James Bond films \"Thunderball\" (1965) and \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983), \"Around the World Under the Sea\" (1966), \"Island of the Lost\" (1967), \"Hello Down There\" (1969), and \"Caddyshack\" (1980).\nA Florida native, Browning was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2019, he was inducted into the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards' Monster Kid Hall of Fame.\nPrior to his death, Browning was considered the last surviving original actor to portray any of the Universal Classic Monsters.\nPersonal life and death.\nBrowning had two sons and two daughters.

{"id": "72331", "revid": "50946002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72331", "title": "Karoshi", "text": "Sudden death from overwork\n \n, which can be translated into 'overwork death', is a Japanese term relating to occupation-related sudden death.\nThe most common medical causes of karoshi deaths are heart attacks and strokes due to stress and malnourishment or fasting. Mental stress from the workplace can also cause workers to commit suicide in a phenomenon known as \"kar\u014djisatsu\" ().\nKaroshi is also widespread in other parts of Asia. Generally, deaths from overwork are a worldwide occurrence. For example, over 770 wage labourers die of overwork annually in Sweden, a country with robust labour regulations.\nHistory.\nThe first case of karoshi was reported in 1969 with the stroke-related death of a 29-year-old male worker in the shipping department of Japan's largest newspaper company.\nIn 1988, the Labor Force Survey reported that almost one fourth of the male working employees worked over 60 hours per week (equivalent of two-and-a-half days), which is 50% longer than a typical 40-hour (equivalent of over one-day-and-a-half) weekly working schedule. Realizing the seriousness and widespread nature of this emerging problem, a group of lawyers and doctors set up \"karoshi hotlines\" that are nationally available, dedicated to helping those who seek consultation on karoshi-related issues.\nJapan's rise from the devastation of World War II to economic prominence and the huge war reparations they have paid in the post-war decades have been regarded as the trigger for what has been called a new epidemic. It was recognized that employees cannot work for 12 or more hours a day, 6\u20137 days a week, year after year, without suffering physically as well as mentally.\nIn an April 2013 International Labour Organization article about karoshi, the following four typical cases of karoshi were mentioned:\nAs well as physical pressure, mental stress from the workplace can cause karoshi. People who die by suicide due to mental stress are called \"kar\u014djisatsu\" (). The ILO also lists some causes of overwork or occupational stress that include the following:\nKaroshi Hotline.\nIn a 1988 report published by the Karoshi Hotline Network, the majority of the clients who consulted were not workers, but the wives of the workers who had either died because of karoshi or were at high risk of doing so. This indicated that those who were stressed out by work either did not realize the cause was overwork or were under social pressure to not express it explicitly or to seek help.\nThe Karoshi Hotline received the highest number of calls when it was first established in 1988. From 1988 to 1990, there were a total number of 1806 calls received. From 1990 to 2007, the number of calls received per year was lower, but has not shown a clear trend of further decrease.\nEffects on society.\nSuicide can be induced by overwork-related stress or when people are dismissed. The deceased person's families demand damages when such deaths occur. Life insurance companies started putting one-year exemption clauses in their contracts. They did this so that the person must wait one year to commit suicide in order for the family to receive the money.\nThere is a new movement of Japanese workers, formed as a result of karoshi. Compared to older Japanese people who often work overtime, young Japanese people are preferring part-time work. This is a new style of career choice for the young Japanese people who want to try out different jobs in order to figure out their own potential. These individuals work for \"hourly wages rather than regular salaries,\" and are called \"freeters.\" The number of freeters has increased throughout the years, from 200,000 in the 1980s to about 400,000 in 1997.\nFreeters undergo a special kind of employment, defined by Atsuko Kanai as those who are currently employed and referred to as \"part-time workers or arbeit (temporary workers), who are currently employed but wish to be employed as part time workers, or who are currently not in the labor force and neither doing housework nor attending school but wish to be employed only as part-time workers.\"\nGovernment policies.\nTo provide a strategic plan to decrease the rate of karoshi, the National Institute of Health proposed the establishment of a comprehensive industrial health service program to reduce karoshi and other diseases caused by work-related stress in its 2005 annual report. The program requires communal efforts from the following groups:\nAs a formal response to this proposal, the Industry Safety and Health Act was revised in 2006. The Act established various terms that focus on work-related health issues, including mandatory health checks and consultations with professional medical personnel for employees who work long hours and have a higher probability of having work related illnesses.\nCorporate response.\nMany companies have been making an effort to find a better work\u2013life balance for their employees. Toyota Motor Company generally limits overtime to 360 hours a year (an average of 30 hours monthly), and, at some offices, issues public address announcements every hour after 7 p.m. pointing out the importance of rest and urging workers to go home. Nissan allows for remote work to make it easier to care for children or elderly parents. Dozens of large corporations have also implemented \"no overtime days\", which require employees to leave the office promptly at 5:30\u00a0p.m. In 2007, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust &amp; Banking, a division of Japan's largest banking group, started to allow employees to go home up to 3 hours early to care for children or elderly relatives. As of January 5, 2009, just 34 of the company's 7,000 employees had signed up for the plan.\nIn February 2017, the Japanese government launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday\" asking companies to allow their workers to leave at 3pm on the last Friday of the month. The initiative is part of an attempt to address the punishingly long hours many Japanese are expected to work, prompted by the suicide of a 24-year-old employee at the advertising firm Dentsu who was doing more than 100 hours' overtime in the months before her death. While some major companies, such as Honda, the drink maker Suntory and the confectioner Morinaga &amp; Company, have adopted the optional scheme, others are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a mid-afternoon staff exodus. A survey of 155 big companies by the Nikkei business newspaper showed that 45% had no immediate plans to implement the scheme, with 37% saying they had either decided to enter into the spirit of Premium Friday or had plans to do so.\nMedia attention.\nThe French-German TV channel Arte showed a documentary titled \"Alt in Japan\" (literal translation: \"Old in Japan\") on 6 November 2006 dealing with older workers in Japan. In 2008, karoshi again made headlines: a death back in 2006 of a key Toyota engineer who averaged over 80 hours overtime each month was ruled the result of overwork. His family was awarded benefits after his case was reviewed.\nTaiwanese media have reported a case of karoshi. An engineer had worked for Nanya Technology for 3 years from 2006 to 2009. It was found that he died in front of his computer surrounded by company documents. The prosecution found that the engineer had died of cardiogenic shock. The engineer's parents said that he worked for 16\u201319 hours a day. CNN shows another reported case of karoshi in Taiwan. This short clip called \"The Dangers of Overwork\" shows a man who suffered a stroke and was left for three hours before being taken to the hospital. It was made known that physicians are starting to make people more aware of these health deficits due to overwork. More people have been visiting their doctor, recognizing signs and symptoms of overwork.\nIn other countries.\nThe phenomenon of death by overwork is also widespread in other parts of Asia. 745,194 deaths worldwide were attributable to long working hours in 2016, based on WHO/ILO data.\nChina.\nIn China, the analogous \"death by overwork\" concept is guolaosi (), which in 2014 was reported to be a problem in the country.\nIn Eastern Asian countries, like China, many businessmen work long hours and then feel the pressures of expanding and pleasing their networks. Making these connections is called building guanxi. Connections are a big part of the Chinese business world, and throughout different parts of China, businessmen would meet up in teahouses to take their job outside of the work atmosphere. It was important for businessmen to broaden their guanxi relationships, especially with powerful officials or bosses.\nThere is a lot of pressure to go to these nightclubs almost every night to drink heavily to move up in the business world. It has been shown that this kind of work could lead to health related problems down the line. For example, a businessman named Mr. Pan discussed with John Osburg, an anthropologist who wrote \"Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich,\" about his health and the need to continue working. Mr. Pan, the 'biggest boss in Chengdu,' was in the hospital for 'excessive drinking.' This has happened to him before. Mr. Pan said, \"I can't stop or slow down. I have many people whose livelihoods depend on me (literally 'depend on me to eat'). I've got about fifty employees and even more brothers. Their livelihoods depend on my success. I have to keep going.\"\nA 2012 report by Legal Daily found the leading cause of line of duty deaths among police officers was exhaustion related heart attacks, followed by traffic accidents.\nIndia.\nIndian labour law has, in theory, offered protection to labour rights. However, the average office worker, women and the IT sector are unofficially forced to work overtime without overtime pay. In 2023, Narayana Murthy, co-founder and former CEO of Infosys, stated, \"Somehow our youth have the habit of taking not-so-desirable habits from the West. My request is that our youngsters must say \u2013 'This is my country. I want to work 70 hours a week'. This is exactly what the Germans and Japanese did after the Second World War\". This sparked a national debate with many male CEOs strongly supporting 70-hour workweeks to boost productivity and cover losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A 70-hour workweek translates to working approximately 12 hours a day, for six days a week, a phenomenon unofficially occurring in the IT industry.\nSouth Korea.\nIn South Korea, the term gwarosa (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; alternatively romanised as kwarosa) is also used to refer to death by overworking. South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world, even more so than Japan with the average being 42. This has caused many workers to feel the pressure of their jobs which has taken a toll on both their physical and mental health. Many have died from being overworked and the issue has only begun to gain more national attention due to many government workers having died from \"gwarosa\". In 2018, the South Korean government enacted a law cutting working hours from 68 to 52.\nSweden.\nIn Sweden the deaths due to excessive stress at work is expected to increase from the current level in the future.\nA study conducted with researchers in cooperation with The Swedish work environment authority in 2019 concluded that 720 workers in Sweden already die every year due to stress from engaging in wage labour. This study sparked an increased amount of public debate.\nSee also.\nJapan:\nGeneral:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the last emperor from the prominent Laskarid dynasty and the last to only rule Nicaea before the Reconquest of Constantinople by his successor in 1261.\nBiography.\nJohn was a son of Theodore II Doukas Laskaris, the 3rd Emperor of Nicaea, and Elena of Bulgaria. His maternal grandparents were Emperor Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and his second wife Anna Maria of Hungary. Anna was originally named M\u00e1ria and was the eldest daughter of Andrew II of Hungary and Gertrude of Merania.\nJohn IV was only seven years old when he inherited the throne on the death of his father. The young monarch was the last member of the Laskarid dynasty, which had done much to restore the Byzantine Empire. His regent was originally the bureaucrat George Mouzalon, but Mouzalon was murdered by the nobility, and the nobles' leader Michael Palaiologos usurped the post. Soon, on January 1, 1259, Palaiologos made himself co-emperor as Michael VIII. Michael was, in fact, John's second cousin once removed, since they were both descended from Empress Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera.\nAfter Michael's conquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire on July 25, 1261, John IV was left behind at Nicaea, and was later blinded on Michael's orders on his eleventh birthday, December 25, 1261. This made him ineligible for the throne, and he was exiled and imprisoned in a fortress in Bithynia. This action led to the excommunication of Michael VIII Palaiologos by the Patriarch Arsenius Autoreianus, and a later revolt led by a Pseudo-John IV near Nicaea.\nJohn IV spent the remainder of his life as a monk in Dacibyza. There is a rescript of Charles of Anjou, dated 9 May 1273, which refers to a report that John escaped from his imprisonment and invites him to come to his court. Further documents attest to his arrival and receiving a pension from the Angevin arch-enemy of Michael Palaiologos. However, this contradicts the evidence of the historians George Pachymeres and Nikephoros Gregoras, who record that John remained in Dacibyza until long after Michael's death. In his study of Michael VIII's reign, historian Deno John Geanakoplos discusses the contradictory evidence and comes to the conclusion that the documents of Charles of Anjou were intended to serve as propaganda, \"to attract the support of the legitimist, pro-Lascarid Greeks of the Byzantine Empire, as well as to sway the anti-Angevin sentiment of the still surviving Greek population of Charles' own territories of southern Italy and Sicily.\"\nIn 1290 John was visited by Michael VIII's son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos, who sought forgiveness for his father's blinding three decades earlier. As Donald Nicol notes, \"The occasion must have been embarrassing for both parties, but especially for Andronikos who, after all, was the beneficiary of his father's crimes against John Laskaris.\" The deposed emperor died about 1305 and was eventually recognized as a saint, whose memory was revered in Constantinople in the 14th century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Onan had an older brother Er and a younger brother, Shelah as well. \nOnan was commanded by his father, Judah, to perform his duty as a husband's brother according to the custom of levirate marriage with Er's widow Tamar. Onan refused to perform his duty as a levirate and instead \"spilled his seed on the ground whenever he went in\" because \"the offspring would not be his\", and was thus put to death by Yahweh. This act is detailed as retribution for being \"displeasing in the sight of Lord\". Onan's crime is often misinterpreted as being masturbation, but it is universally agreed among biblical scholars that Onan's death is attributed to his refusal to fulfill his obligation of levirate marriage with Tamar by committing coitus interruptus.\nBiblical account.\nAfter Yahweh slew Onan's oldest brother Er, Onan's father Judah told him to fulfill his duty as a brother-in-law by entering into a levirate marriage with his brother's widow Tamar to give her offspring. Religion professor Tikva Frymer-Kensky has pointed out the economic repercussions of a levirate marriage: any son born to Tamar would be deemed the heir of the deceased Er and could claim the firstborn's double share of an inheritance. However, if Er were childless or only had daughters, Onan would have inherited as the oldest surviving son.\nWhen Onan had sex with Tamar, he withdrew before he ejaculated and \"spilled his seed on the ground\" thus committing \"coitus interuptus\", since any child born would not legally be considered his heir. The next statement in the Bible says that Onan displeased Yahweh, so the Lord slew him. Onan's crime is often misinterpreted to be masturbation but it is universally agreed among biblical scholars that Onan's death is attributed to his refusal to fulfill his obligation of levirate marriage with Tamar by committing \"coitus interruptus.\"\nHowever, Onan\u2018s reluctance to give a child to his sister-in-law may reflect a rejection of this custom already present in society. The regulation of levirate marriage in Deut 25:5\u201310 shows that the custom had encountered some opposition. The law in Deuteronomy allowing a man to refuse his duty was a concession to the reluctance to comply with the custom. Because of Onan's unwillingness to bear a child for his deceased brother, Yahweh was displeased with Onan and slew him also (Gen 38:10).\nInterpretation.\nThe implication from the narrative is that Onan's act as described is what gave rise to divine displeasure.\nEarly Jewish views.\nOne opinion expressed in the Talmud argues that this was where the death penalty's imposition originated. The Talmud also likens emitting semen in vain to shedding blood.\nHowever, the regulations concerning ejaculation in the book of Leviticus, whether as a result of sexual intercourse or not, merely prescribe a ritual washing and becoming ritually impure until the following evening.\nClassical Christian views.\nEarly Christian writers have sometimes focused on the \"spilling seed\", and the sexual act being used for non-procreational purposes. This interpretation was held by several early Christian apologists. Jerome, for example, argued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But I wonder why he the heretic Jovinianus set Judah and Tamar before us for an example, unless perchance even harlots give him pleasure; or Onan, who was slain because he begrudged his brother his seed. Does he imagine that we approve of any sexual intercourse except for the procreation of children?\u2014\u200a\nEpiphanius of Salamis wrote against heretics who used \"coitus interruptus\", calling it the sin of \u039fnan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They soil their bodies, minds and souls with unchastity. Some of them masquerade as monastics, and their woman companions as female monastics. And they are physically corrupted because they satisfy their appetite but, to put it politely, by the act of Onan the son of Judah. For as Onan coupled with Tamar and satisfied his appetite but did not complete the act by planting his seed for the God-given [purpose of] procreation and did himself harm instead, thus, as [he] did the vile thing, so these people have used their supposed [female monastics], committing this infamy. For purity is not their concern, but a hypocritical purity in name. Their concern is limited to ensuring that the woman the seeming [ascetic] has seduced does not get pregnant\u2014either so as not to cause child-bearing, or to escape detection, since they want to be honored for their supposed celibacy. In any case, this is what they do, but others endeavor to get this same filthy satisfaction not with women but by other means, and pollute themselves with their own hands. They too imitate the son of Judah, soil the ground with their forbidden practices and drops of filthy fluid and rub their emissions into the earth with their feet\u2014\u200a\nClement of Alexandria, while not making explicit reference to Onan, similarly reflects an early Christian view of the abhorrence of \"spilling seed\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Because of its divine institution for the propagation of man, the seed is not to be vainly ejaculated, nor is it to be damaged, nor is it to be wasted.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To have coitus other than to procreate children is to do injury to nature.\u2014\u200a\nRoman Catholic views.\nThe papal encyclical \"Casti connubii\" (1930) invokes this Biblical text in support of the teaching of the Catholic Church against contracepted sex by quoting St. Augustine, \"Intercourse even with one's legitimate wife is unlawful and wicked where the conception of the offspring is prevented. Onan, the son of Juda [\"sic\"], did this and the Lord killed him for it.\"\nEarly Protestant views.\nMaking reference to Onan's offense to identify masturbation as sinful, in his \"Commentary on Genesis\", John Calvin wrote that \"the voluntary spilling of semen outside of intercourse between a man and a woman is a monstrous thing. Deliberately to withdraw from coitus in order that semen may fall on the ground is double monstrous.\"\nMethodism founder John Wesley, according to Bryan C. Hodge, \"believed that any waste of the semen in an unproductive sexual act, whether that should be in the form of masturbation or \"coitus interruptus\", as in the case of Onan, destroyed the souls of the individuals who practice it\". He wrote his \"Thoughts on the Sin of Onan\" (1767), which was reproduced as \"A Word to Whom it May Concern\" on 1779, as an attempt to censor a work by Samuel-Auguste Tissot. In that writing, Wesley warned about \"the dangers of self pollution\", the bad physical and mental effects of masturbation, writes many such cases along with the treatment recommendations.\nDisputes.\nAccording to some Bible critics who contextually read this passage, the description of Onan is an origin myth concerning fluctuations in the constituency of the tribe of Judah, with the death of Onan reflecting the dying out of a clan; \"Er\" and \"Onan\" are hence viewed as each being representative of a clan, with Onan possibly representing an Edomite clan named Onam, mentioned by an Edomite genealogy in Genesis.\nBiblical scholars universally agree that the biblical story of Onan is not about masturbation nor about contraception per se or the \"wasting of semen\" but his refusal to fulfill his obligation of levirate-marriage with Tamar by committing \"coitus interruptus\".\nThe text emphasizes the social and legal situation, with Judah explaining what Onan must do and why. A plain reading of the text is that Onan was killed because he refused to follow instructions. Scholars have argued that the secondary purpose of the narrative about Onan and Tamar, of which the description of Onan is a part, was to either assert the institution of levirate marriage or present a myth for its origin; Onan's role in the narrative is, thus, as the brother abusing his obligations by agreeing to sexual intercourse with his dead brother's wife, but refusing to allow her to become pregnant as a result. Emerton regards the evidence for this to be inconclusive, although classical rabbinical writers argued that this narrative describes the origin of levirate marriage.\nJohn M. Riddle argues that \"Epiphanius (fourth century) construed the sin of Onan as \"coitus interruptus\"\". John T. Noonan Jr. says that \"St. Epiphanius gave a plain interpretation of the text as a condemnation of contraception, and he did so only in the context of his anti-Gnostic polemic\".\nBible scholars maintained that the story does not refer to masturbation, but to \"coitus interruptus\". Bible scholars even maintain that the Bible does not claim that masturbation would be sinful.\nAlthough the story of Onan does not involve masturbation, according to Peter Lewis Allen, some theologians found \"a common element\" in both \"coitus interruptus\" (also known as onanism) and masturbation, as well as anal intercourse and other forms of nonmarital and nonvaginal sexual acts, which are considered wrongful acts.\nOnanism.\nThe term \"onanism\" has come to refer to \"masturbation\" in many modern languages \u2013 for example Hebrew (\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea, \"onan\u00fat\"), German (\"Onanie\"), Greek (\u03b1\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, \"avnanism\u00f3s\"), Japanese (\u30aa\u30ca\u30cb\u30fc, \"onan\u012b\"), and Swedish (\"onani\") \u2013 based on an interpretation of the Onan story.\nThe word \"onanism\" is not based on the biblical story of Onan itself but on an interpretation of that biblical story, nor is the word \"onanism\" found in any form in the biblical texts. Thus the etymological connection of onanism (in the sense of masturbation) with Onan's name is misleading.\nThe \"Merriam-Webster\" online dictionary defines onanism as:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over a career spanning more than six decades, Streisand has achieved success in various areas of the entertainment industry, including the attainment of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards.\nStreisand began performing in the early 1960s in nightclubs and Broadway theaters, which led to guest appearances on various television shows. Signing onto Columbia Records, Streisand retained full artistic control of her performances in exchange for accepting lower pay\u2014an arrangement that continued throughout her career. Her studio debut \"The Barbra Streisand Album\" (1963) won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. During her recording career, Streisand has amassed a total of 31 RIAA platinum-certified albums, including \"People\" (1964), \"The Way We Were\" (1974), \"Guilty\" (1980), \"The Broadway Album\" (1985), and \"Higher Ground\" (1997). She was the first woman to score 11 number one albums on the US \"Billboard\" 200\u2014from \"People\" to \"\" (2016)\u2014and remains the only artist to top the chart in six decades. Streisand also topped the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with five singles: \"The Way We Were\", \"Evergreen\", \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\", \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\", and \"Woman in Love\".\nIn the latter 1960s, after having established success as a vocalist, Streisand ventured into film. She starred in the critically acclaimed \"Funny Girl\" (1968), winning the Academy Award for Best Actress. Additional fame on the big screen followed with the extravagant musical \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1969), the screwball comedy \"What's Up, Doc?\" (1972), and the romantic drama \"The Way We Were\" (1973). Streisand won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for writing the love theme from \"A Star Is Born\" (1976), the first woman to be honored as a composer. With the release of \"Yentl\" (1983), Streisand became the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film. The film won an Oscar for Best Original Score and a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical. Streisand also received the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, becoming the first (and for 37 years, the only) woman to win that award. Streisand then produced and directed \"The Prince of Tides\" (1991), and \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" (1996).\nWith sales exceeding 150\u00a0million records worldwide, Streisand is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the second-highest certified female artist in the United States, with 68.5\u00a0million certified album units. \"Billboard\" ranked Streisand as the greatest solo artist on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, as well as the top Adult Contemporary female artist of all time. Her accolades span ten Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Grammy Legend Award; nine Golden Globe Awards; five Emmy Awards; four Peabody Awards; two Academy Awards; the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nEarly life.\nFamily.\nStreisand was born April 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Diana Ida (n\u00e9e Rosen; 1908\u20132002) and Emanuel Streisand (1908\u20131943). Her mother had been a soprano in her youth and considered a career in music, but later became a school secretary. Her father was a high school teacher at the same school, where they first met. Streisand's family is Jewish. Her paternal grandparents emigrated from Galicia (modern-day Poland and Ukraine) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and her maternal grandparents from the Russian Empire, where her grandfather had been a cantor.\nIn August 1943, a few months after Streisand's first birthday, her father died at age 34 from complications from an epileptic seizure, possibly the result of a head injury years earlier. The family fell into near poverty, with her mother working as a low-paid bookkeeper. As an adult, Streisand remembered those early years as always feeling like an \"outcast\", explaining, \"Everybody else's father came home from work at the end of the day. Mine didn't.\" Her mother tried to pay their bills but could not give her daughter the attention she craved: \"When I wanted love from my mother, she gave me food,\" Streisand says.\nStreisand recalled that her mother had a \"great voice\" and sang semi-professionally on occasion. In a 2016 interview with Rosie O'Donnell, Streisand recounted that when she was 13, she and her mother recorded some songs on tape during a visit to the Catskills. That session was the first time Streisand ever asserted herself as an artist, which also became her \"first moment of inspiration.\"\nShe has an older brother, Sheldon, and a younger half-sister, singer Roslyn Kind, from her mother's remarriage to Louis Kind in 1950.\nEducation.\nStreisand began her education at the Jewish Orthodox Yeshiva of Brooklyn when she was five. She was considered bright and inquisitive; however, she lacked discipline, often shouting answers to questions out of turn. She next attended Public School 89 in Brooklyn, and during those early school years began watching television and going to movies. \"I always wanted to be somebody, to be famous... You know, get out of Brooklyn.\"\nStreisand became known by others in the neighborhood for her voice. She remembers sitting on the stoop in front of their apartment building with the other kids and singing: \"I was considered the girl on the block with the good voice.\" That talent became a way for her to gain attention. She would often practice her singing in the hallway of her apartment building, which gave her voice an echoing quality.\nShe made her singing debut at a PTA (Parent\u2014teacher association) assembly, where she became a hit to everyone but her mother, who was mostly critical of her daughter. Streisand was invited to sing at weddings and summer camp, along with having an unsuccessful audition at MGM records when she was nine. By the time she was 13, her mother began supporting her talent, helping her make a four-song demo tape, including \"Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart\" and \"You'll Never Know\".\nBecoming an actress was her main objective. That desire was made stronger when she saw her first Broadway play, \"The Diary of Anne Frank\", when she was 14. The star in the play was Susan Strasberg, whose acting she wanted to emulate. Streisand began spending her spare time in the library, studying the biographies of various stage actresses such as Eleanora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt. In addition, she began reading novels and plays and studying the acting theories of Konstantin Stanislavski and Michael Chekhov.\nIn 1956, she attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, where she became an honor student in modern history, English, and Spanish. She also joined the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, where she sang with another choir member and classmate, Neil Diamond. Diamond recalls, \"We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. We hung out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes.\" The school was near an art movie house, and he recalls that she was always aware of the films they were showing. She had a crush on 15-year-old US Chess Champion and fellow student Bobby Fischer, whom she found to be \"very sexy\".\nDuring the summer of 1957, she landed her first stage experience as a walk-on at the Playhouse, in Malden Bridge, New York. That small part was followed by a role as the kid sister in \"Picnic\" and as a vamp in \"Desk Set\". In her second year, she took a night job at the Cherry Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village, helping backstage. When she was a senior, she rehearsed for a small part in \"Driftwood\", a play staged in a midtown attic space.\nShe graduated from Erasmus Hall in January 1959 at age 16, and despite her mother's pleas that she stay out of show business, she set out trying to get roles on the New York City stage. After renting a small apartment on 48th Street in the heart of the theater district, she accepted any job she could involving the stage, and at every opportunity, she \"made the rounds\" of the casting offices.\nCareer.\nBeginnings.\nLiving on her own at 16, Streisand took various menial jobs to have some income. During one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping at the home of friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around. When desperate, she returned to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother was horrified by her daughter's \"gypsy-like lifestyle\", wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business, but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: \"My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that I \"could\" be a star.\"\nStreisand took a job as an usher at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater for \"The Sound of Music\" early in 1960. During the run of the play, she heard that the casting director was auditioning for more singers, and it marked the first time she sang in pursuit of a job. Although the director felt she was not right for the part, he encouraged her to begin including her talent as a singer on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when looking for other work.\nStreisand asked her boyfriend, Barry Dennen, to tape her singing, copies of which she could then give out to possible employers. Dennen found a guitarist to accompany her:.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We spent the afternoon taping, and the moment I heard the first playback I went insane ... This nutty little kook had one of the most breathtaking voices I'd ever heard ... when she was finished and I turned off the machine, I needed a long moment before I dared look up at her.\nDennen grew enthusiastic and he convinced her to enter a talent contest at the Lion, a gay nightclub in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. She performed two songs, after which there was a \"stunned silence\" from the audience, followed by \"thunderous applause\" when she was pronounced the winner. She was invited back and sang at the club for several weeks. During this time, disliking her name, she changed it from \"Barbara\" to \"Barbra\".\nIn early days of her career, Streisand was repeatedly told she was too ugly to be a star and was advised to get a nose job, which she declined to do.\nNightclub shows.\nStreisand was next asked to audition at the Bon Soir nightclub, after which she was signed up at $125 a week. It became her first professional engagement in September 1960, where she was the opening act for comedian Phyllis Diller. She recalls it was the first time she had been in that kind of upscale environment: \"I'd never been in a nightclub until I sang in one.\"\nDennen now wanted to expose Streisand to his vast record collection of female singers, including Billie Holiday, Mabel Mercer, Ethel Waters, and \u00c9dith Piaf. Streisand realized she could still become an actress by first gaining recognition as a singer. From his collection she drew the song that best defined her mission in singing: \"A Sleepin' Bee\", with music by Harold Arlen and lyrics by Truman Capote for the 1954 musical \"House of Flowers\". \"The lyrics to that song gave me the three acts of a play that I longed for as an actress,\" Streisand said. \"And Harold was one of those writers who could write these magnificent melodies. That gave me what I needed.\" According to biographer Christopher Nickens, hearing other great female singers benefited her style, as she began creating different emotional characters when performing, which gave her singing a greater range.\nStreisand improved her stage presence when speaking to the audience between songs. She discovered that her Brooklyn-bred style of humor was received favorably. During the next six months appearing at the club, some began comparing her singing voice to famous names such as Judy Garland, Lena Horne and Fanny Brice. Her conversational ability to charm an audience with spontaneous humor during performances became more sophisticated and professional. Theater critic Leonard Harris wrote: \"She's twenty; by the time she's thirty she will have rewritten the record books.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Her name is Barbra Streisand. She is 20 years old, she has a three-octave promiscuity of range, she packs more personal dynamic power than anybody I can recall since Libby Holman or Helen Morgan. She can sing as loud as Ethel Merman and as persuasively as Lena or Ella, or as brassy as a Sophie Tucker ... and only Barbra Streisand can turn \"Cry Me a River\" into something comparable to Enrico Caruso having his first bash at Pagliacci. When Streisand cries you a river, you got a river, Sam ... and she will be around 50 years from now if good songs are still written to be sung by good singers.\n \u2014Syndicated columnist Robert Ruark,on her 1963 performances at the Blue Angel.\nEarly theatre roles and Broadway debut.\nStreisand accepted her first role on the New York stage in \"Another Evening with Harry Stoones\", a satirical comedy play in which she acted and sang two solos. The show received terrible reviews and closed the next day. With the help of her new personal manager, Martin Erlichman, she had successful shows in Detroit and St. Louis. Erlichman then booked her at an even more upscale nightclub in Manhattan, the Blue Angel, where she became a bigger hit during the period from 1961 to 1962. Streisand once told Jimmy Fallon, with whom she sang a duet, on the \"Tonight Show\", that Erlichman was a \"fantastic manager\" and still managed her career after 50 years.\nWhile appearing at the Blue Angel, theater director and playwright Arthur Laurents asked her to audition for a new musical comedy he was directing, \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\". She got the part of secretary to the lead actor businessman, played by then unknown Elliott Gould. They fell in love during rehearsals and eventually moved into a small apartment together. The show opened on March 22, 1962, at the Shubert Theater, and received rave reviews. Her performance \"stopped the show cold\", wrote Nickens. Groucho Marx, while hosting the \"Tonight Show\", told her that 20 was an \"extremely young age to be a success on Broadway\". Streisand received a Tony Award nomination and New York Drama Critic's prize for Best Supporting Actress. The show was recorded and made into an album.\nEarly television appearances.\nStreisand's first television appearance was on \"The Tonight Show\", then credited to its regular host, Jack Paar. She was seen during an April 1961 episode on which Orson Bean substituted for Paar. She sang Harold Arlen's \"A Sleepin' Bee\". During her appearance, Phyllis Diller, also a guest on the show, called her \"one of the great singing talents in the world.\"\nLater in 1961, before she was cast in \"Another Evening With Harry Stoones\", Streisand became a semi-regular on \"PM East/PM West\", a talk/variety series hosted by Mike Wallace and Joyce Davidson. Some of Streisand's \"PM East\" segments survive as audio recordings, and still photos survive, but moving images do not.\nIn early 1962, she went into the Columbia Records studio for the cast recording of \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\". Also that spring, she participated in a 25th anniversary studio recording of \"Pins and Needles,\" the classic popular front musical originated in 1937 by the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. Reviews of both albums highlighted Streisand's performances.\nIn May 1962, Streisand appeared on \"The Garry Moore Show\", where she sang \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" for the first time. Her sad, slow version of the 1930s upbeat Democratic Party theme song became her signature song during this early phase of her career.\nJohnny Carson had her on the \"Tonight Show\" half a dozen times in 1962 and 1963, and she became a favorite of his television audience and himself personally. He described her as an \"exciting new singer\". During one show, she joked with Groucho Marx, who liked her style of humor.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nShe did three or four songs, and she was beyond brilliant \u2013 so amazing.\n \u2014Elliott Gould, about their first play together in 1961\nIn December 1962, Streisand made the first of a number of appearances on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". She was later a cohost on \"The Mike Douglas Show\", and also made an impact on a number of Bob Hope specials. Performing with her on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" was Liberace, who became an instant fan of the young singer. Liberace invited her to Las Vegas to perform as his opening act at the Riviera Hotel. He is credited with introducing Streisand to audiences on the West Coast. The following September, during her ongoing shows at Harrah's Hotel in Lake Tahoe, she and Elliott Gould took time off to get married in Carson City, Nevada. With her career and popularity rising so quickly, she saw her marriage to Gould as a \"stabilizing influence\".\nFirst albums.\nAt age 21, Streisand signed a contract with Columbia Records that gave her full creative control, in exchange for less money. Lieberson relented and agreed to sign her. Nearly three decades later, she said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The most important thing about that first contract \u2013 actually, the thing we held out for \u2013 was a unique clause giving me the right to choose my own material. It was the only thing I really cared about. I still received lots of pressure from the label to include some pop hits on my first album, but I held out for the songs that really meant something to me.\nStreisand took advantage of this several times during her career. Columbia wanted to call her first album, in early 1963, \"Sweet and Saucy Streisand\". She used her control to insist that it was called \"The Barbra Streisand Album\", saying \"if you saw me on TV, you could just go [to the record shop] and ask for the Barbra Streisand album.\" It reached the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" chart and won three Grammy Awards. The album made her the best-selling female vocalist in the country. \"The Second Barbra Streisand Album\" followed later that year, which established her as the \"most exciting new personality since Elvis Presley.\" She ended that breakthrough year of 1963 by performing one-night concerts in Indianapolis, San Jose, Chicago, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.\nReturn to the stage.\nStreisand returned to Broadway in 1964 with an acclaimed performance as entertainer Fanny Brice in \"Funny Girl\" at the Winter Garden Theatre. The show introduced two of her signature songs, \"People\" and \"Don't Rain on My Parade\". Because of the musical's overnight success, she appeared on the cover of \"Time\". In 1964, Streisand was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical but lost to Carol Channing in \"Hello, Dolly!\" Streisand received an honorary \"Star of the Decade\" Tony Award in 1970.\nIn 1966, Streisand repeated her success with \"Funny Girl\" in London's West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre. From 1965 to 1968 she appeared in her first four solo television specials, including the Emmy Award\u2013winning \"My Name is Barbra\".\nStardom.\nSinging.\nStreisand has recorded 50 studio albums, almost all with Columbia Records. Her early works in the 1960s (her debut \"The Barbra Streisand Album\", \"The Second Barbra Streisand Album\", \"The Third Album\", \"My Name Is Barbra\", etc.) are considered classic renditions of theatre and cabaret standards, including her pensive version of the normally uptempo \"Happy Days Are Here Again\". She performed this in a duet with Judy Garland on \"The Judy Garland Show\". Garland referred to her on the air as one of the last great belters. They also sang \"There's No Business Like Show Business\", with Ethel Merman joining them.\nBeginning with \"My Name Is Barbra\", her early albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her television specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, but like many talented singers of the day, she found herself out of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album \"Stoney End\" in 1971. The title track, written by Laura Nyro, was a major hit for Streisand.\nDuring the 1970s, she was also highly prominent on the pop charts, with Top 10 recordings such as \"The Way We Were\" (US No. 1); \"Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)\" (US No. 1); \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\" (1979, with Donna Summer), which as of 2010[ [update]] is reportedly still the most commercially successful duet, (US No. 1); \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\" (with Neil Diamond) (US No. 1); and \"The Main Event\" (US No. 3), some of which came from soundtrack recordings of her films. As the 1970s ended, Streisand was named the most successful female singer in the U.S. \u2014 only Elvis Presley and The Beatles had sold more albums. In 1980, she released her best-selling effort to date, the Barry Gibb-produced \"Guilty\". The album contained the hits \"Woman in Love\" (which spent several weeks on top of the pop charts in the fall of 1980), \"Guilty\", and \"What Kind of Fool\".\nAfter years of largely ignoring Broadway and traditional pop music in favor of more contemporary material, Streisand returned to her musical-theater roots. Columbia Records objected that the songs she wanted to sing were not pop songs, but Streisand asserted the full creative control her contract gave her\u2014'I've always had the right to sing what I want'\u2014with 1985's \"The Broadway Album\", which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by Rodgers and Hammerstein, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Stephen Sondheim, who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. \"The Broadway Album\" was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year, and handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album \"One Voice\" in 1986, Streisand was set to release another album of Broadway songs in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of Rupert Holmes, including \"On My Own\" (from \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\"), a medley of \"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\", and \"Heather on the Hill\" (from \"Finian's Rainbow\" and \"Brigadoon\", respectively), \"All I Ask of You\" (from \"The Phantom of the Opera\"), \"Warm All Over\" (from \"The Most Happy Fella\"), and an unusual solo version of \"Make Our Garden Grow\" (from \"Candide\"). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was scrapped. Only \"Warm All Over\" and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of \"All I Ask of You\" were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand's 1988 effort, \"Till I Loved You\". At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, \"Just for the Record\", was released. A compilation spanning Streisand's entire career to date, it featured over 70 tracks of live performances, greatest hits, rarities, and previously unreleased material.\nThe following year, Streisand's concert fundraising events helped propel President Bill Clinton into the spotlight and into office. Streisand later introduced Clinton at his inauguration in 1993. Streisand's music career, however, was largely on hold. A 1992 appearance at an APLA benefit, as well as the aforementioned inaugural performance, hinted that Streisand was becoming more receptive to the idea of live performances. A tour was suggested, though Streisand would not immediately commit to it, citing her well-known stage fright as well as security concerns. During this time, Streisand finally returned to the recording studio and released \"Back to Broadway\" in June 1993. The album was not as universally lauded as its predecessor, but it did debut at No. 1 on the pop charts (a rare feat for an artist of Streisand's age, especially given that it relegated Janet Jackson's \"Janet\" to the No. 2 spot). One of the album's highlights was a medley of \"I Have A Love\" / \"One Hand, One Heart\", a duet with Johnny Mathis, who Streisand said is one of her favorite singers.\nIn 1993, \"The New York Times\" music critic Stephen Holden wrote that Streisand \"enjoys a cultural status that only one other American entertainer, Frank Sinatra, has achieved in the last half century\". In September 1993, Streisand announced her first public concert appearances in 27 years (discounting her Las Vegas nightclub performances between 1969 and 1972). What began as a two-night New Year's event at the MGM Grand Las Vegas led to a multi-city tour in the summer of 1994. Tickets for the tour sold out in under an hour. Streisand also appeared on the covers of major magazines in anticipation of what \"Time magazine\" named \"The Music Event of the Century\". The tour was one of the biggest all-media merchandise parlays in history. Ticket prices ranged from US$50 to US$1,500, making Streisand the highest-paid concert performer in history at the time. \"Barbra Streisand: The Concert\" went on to be the top-grossing concert of the year and earned five Emmy Awards and the Peabody Award, while the taped broadcast on HBO was the highest-rated concert special in HBO's 30-year history. Following the tour's conclusion, Streisand once again kept a low profile musically, instead focusing her efforts on acting and directing duties as well as a burgeoning romance with actor James Brolin.\nIn 1996, Streisand released \"I Finally Found Someone\" as a duet with Canadian singer and songwriter Bryan Adams. The song was nominated for an Oscar, as it was part of the soundtrack of Streisand's self-directed movie \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\". It reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was her first significant hit in almost a decade and her first top 10 hit on the Hot 100 (and first gold single) since 1981.\nIn 1997, she finally returned to the recording studio, releasing \"Higher Ground\", a collection of songs of a loosely inspirational nature that also featured a duet with C\u00e9line Dion. The album received generally favorable reviews and once again debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts. Following her marriage to Brolin in 1998, Streisand recorded \"A Love Like Ours\" the following year. Reviews were mixed, with many critics complaining about the somewhat syrupy sentiments and overly lush arrangements; however, it did produce a modest hit for Streisand in the country-tinged \"If You Ever Leave Me\", a duet with Vince Gill.\nOn New Year's Eve 1999, Streisand returned to the concert stage, selling out in the first few hours, eight months before her return. At the end of the millennium, she was the number one female singer in the U.S., with at least two No. 1 albums in each decade since she began performing. A two-disc live album, \"\", was released in 2000. Streisand performed versions of the \"Timeless\" concert in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in early 2000. In advance of four concerts (two each in Los Angeles and New York) in September 2000, Streisand announced that she was retiring from playing public concerts. Her performance of the song \"People\" was broadcast on the Internet via America Online.\nStreisand's subsequent albums included \"Christmas Memories\" (2001), a somewhat somber collection of holiday songs, and \"The Movie Album\" (2003), featuring famous film themes and backed by a large symphony orchestra. \"Guilty Pleasures\" (called \"Guilty Too\" in the UK), a collaboration with Barry Gibb and a sequel to their \"Guilty\", was released worldwide in 2005.\nIn February 2006, Streisand recorded the song \"Smile\" alongside Tony Bennett at Streisand's Malibu home. The song is included on Bennett's 80th birthday album, \"Duets\". In September 2006, the pair filmed a live performance of the song for \"Tony Bennett: An American Classic\", directed by Rob Marshall. The special aired on NBC on November 21, 2006, and was released on DVD the same day. Streisand's duet with Bennett opened the special.\nThat same year, Streisand announced her intent to tour again, in an effort to raise money and awareness for multiple issues. After four days of rehearsal at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton, New Jersey, the 2006 Streisand concert tour began on October 4 at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, continued with a featured stop in Sunrise, Florida, and concluded at Staples Center in Los Angeles on November 20, 2006. Special guests Il Divo were interwoven throughout the show. Streisand's 20-concert tour set box office records. At the age of 64, she grossed $92,457,062 and set house gross records in 14 of the 16 arenas played on the tour. She set the third-place record for her show of October 9, 2006, at Madison Square Garden, the first- and second-place records, of which are held by her two shows in September 2000. She set the second-place record at MGM Grand Garden Arena, with her December 31, 1999, show being the house record and highest-grossing concert of all time. This led many people to openly criticize Streisand for price gouging, as many tickets sold for upwards of $1,000.\nA collection of performances culled from different stops on this tour, \"Live in Concert 2006\", debuted at No. 7 on the \"Billboard\" 200, making it Streisand's 29th Top 10 album. In the summer of 2007, Streisand gave concerts for the first time in continental Europe. The first concert took place in Z\u00fcrich (June 18), then Vienna (June 22), Paris (June 26), Berlin (June 30), Stockholm (July 4, canceled), Manchester (July 10), and Celbridge, near Dublin (July 14), followed by three concerts in London (July 18, 22 and 25), the only European city where Streisand had performed before 2007. Tickets for the London dates cost between \u00a3100.00 and \u00a31,500.00, and for Ireland, between \u20ac118 and \u20ac500. The Ireland date was marred by issues with serious parking and seating problems, leading to the event's being dubbed a fiasco by \"Hot Press\". The tour included a 58-piece orchestra.\nIn February 2008, \"Forbes\" listed Streisand as the No. 2-earning female musician between June 2006 and June 2007, with earnings of about $60\u00a0million. On November 17, 2008, Streisand returned to the studio to begin recording what would be her 63rd album and it was announced that Diana Krall was producing the album. Streisand is one of the recipients of the 2008 Kennedy Center Honors. On December 7, 2008, she visited the White House as part of the ceremonies.\nOn April 25, 2009, CBS aired Streisand's latest television special, \"Streisand: Live in Concert\", highlighting the featured stop from her 2006 North American tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On September 26, 2009, Streisand performed a one-night-only show at the Village Vanguard in New York City's Greenwich Village. This performance was later released on DVD as \".\" On September 29, 2009, Streisand and Columbia Records released the studio album \"Love is the Answer\", produced by Diana Krall. On October 2, 2009, Streisand made her British television performance debut with an interview on \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\" to promote the album. This album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and registered her biggest weekly sales since 1997, making Streisand the only artist in history to achieve No. 1 albums in five different decades.\nOn February 1, 2010, Streisand joined over 80 other artists in recording a new version of the 1985 charity single \"We Are the World\". Quincy Jones and Lionel Richie planned to release the new version to mark the 25th anniversary of its original recording. These plans changed, however, in view of the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on January 12, 2010, and on February 12, the song, now called \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\", made its debut as a charity single to support relief aid for the island nation.\nStreisand was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year on February 11, 2011, two days prior to the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards. That same year, Streisand sang \"Somewhere\" from the Broadway musical \"West Side Story\", with child prodigy Jackie Evancho, on Evancho's album \"Dream with Me\".\nOn October 11, 2012, Streisand gave a three-hour concert performance before a crowd of 18,000 as part of the ongoing inaugural events of Barclays Center (and part of her current \"Barbra Live\" tour) in Brooklyn (her first-ever public performance in her home borough). Streisand was joined onstage by trumpeter Chris Botti, Italian operatic trio Il Volo, and her son, Jason Gould. The concert included musical tributes by Streisand to Donna Summer and Marvin Hamlisch, both of whom had died earlier in 2012. Confirmed attendees included Barbara Walters, Jimmy Fallon, Sting, Katie Couric, Woody Allen, Michael Douglas, and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as designers Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, and Michael Kors. In June 2013, she gave two concerts in Bloomfield Stadium, Tel Aviv.\nStreisand is one of many singers who use teleprompters during their live performances. Streisand has defended her choice in using teleprompters to display lyrics and, sometimes, banter.\nIn September 2014, she released \"Partners\", a new album of duets that features a song with Elvis Presley as well as collaborations with Andrea Bocelli, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Billy Joel, Babyface, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Josh Groban, John Mayer, John Legend, Blake Shelton, and Jason Gould. This album topped the \"Billboard\" 200, with sales of 196,000 copies in the first week, making Streisand the only recording artist to have a number-one album in each of the last six decades. It was also certified gold in November 2014 and platinum in January 2015, thus becoming Streisand's 52nd gold and 31st Platinum album, more than any other female artist in history.\nIn May 2016, Streisand announced the upcoming album ', to be released in August following a nine-city concert tour, ', including performances in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, and a return to her hometown of Brooklyn. In June 2018, Streisand confirmed she was working on the new studio album \"Walls\", released November 2, 2018, just prior to the U.S. midterm election. The album's lead single, \"Don't Lie to Me\", was written as a criticism of America's political climate amid the presidency of Donald Trump, while the title track alludes to Trump's frequent calls for a wall at the Mexico border.\nStreisand released the single \"Love Will Survive\", from the television series \"The Tattooist of Auschwitz\", on April 25, 2024.\nActing.\nStreisand's first film was a reprise of her Broadway hit \"Funny Girl\" (1968), an artistic and commercial success directed by Hollywood veteran William Wyler. She won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actress for the role, sharing it with Katharine Hepburn (\"The Lion in Winter\"), the only time there has been a tie in this Oscar category. Her next two movies were also based on musicals\u2014Jerry Herman's \"Hello, Dolly!\", directed by Gene Kelly (1969); and Alan Jay Lerner's and Burton Lane's \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\", directed by Vincente Minnelli (1970)\u2014while her fourth film was based on the Broadway play \"The Owl and the Pussycat\" (1970).\nDuring the 1970s, Streisand starred in several screwball comedies, including \"What's Up, Doc?\" (1972) and \"The Main Event\" (1979), both co-starring Ryan O'Neal, and \"For Pete's Sake\" (1974) with Michael Sarrazin. One of her most famous roles during this period was in the drama \"The Way We Were\" (1973) with Robert Redford, for which she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. She earned her second Academy Award for Best Original Song (with lyricist Paul Williams) for the song \"Evergreen\", from \"A Star Is Born\" in 1976, in which she also starred.\nAlong with Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, and later Steve McQueen, Streisand formed First Artists Production Company in 1969 so that actors could secure properties and develop movie projects for themselves. Streisand's initial outing with First Artists was \"Up the Sandbox\" (1972).\nFrom 1969 to 1980, Streisand appeared in Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, the annual motion picture exhibitors poll of Top 10 Box Office attractions a total of 10 times, often as the only woman on the list. After the commercially disappointing \"All Night Long\" in 1981, Streisand's film output decreased considerably, appearing in only eight films since.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n I'm impressed with her choosing \"Yentl\"; it was extraordinary. But for some reason, Hollywood turned against her ... there was a lack of sympathy toward her ... Christ, she could have played \"Cleopatra\" better than Liz Taylor, with her enormous power and the subtlety of her singing ... She is one of the great actresses and she hasn't been well used.\n \u2014Director John Huston, \"Playboy\" interview, 1985\nStreisand produced a number of her own films, setting up Barwood Films in 1972. \"Yentl\" (1983) was turned down by every Hollywood studio at least once when she proposed both directing and starring in the film, until Orion Pictures took on the project and gave the film a budget of $14\u00a0million. For \"Yentl\" (1983), she was producer, director, and star, an experience she repeated for \"The Prince of Tides\" (1991) and \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" (1996). There was controversy when \"Yentl\" received five Academy Award nominations but none for the major categories of Best Picture, Actress, or Director. \"The Prince of Tides\" received even more Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay, although not for director. Upon completion of the film, its screenwriter, Pat Conroy, who also authored the novel, called Streisand \"a goddess who walks upon the earth.\"\nStreisand also co-scripted \"Yentl\" (with Jack Rosenthal), something for which she is not always given credit. According to \"The New York Times\" editor Andrew Rosenthal, in an interview with Allan Wolper, \"The one thing that makes Barbra Streisand crazy is when nobody gives her the credit for having written \"Yentl\".\"\nAfter an eight-year hiatus of screen roles, Streisand returned to film acting for the comedy \"Meet the Fockers\" (2004, a sequel to \"Meet the Parents\"), playing opposite Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller, Blythe Danner, and Robert De Niro.\nIn 2005, Streisand's Barwood Films, Gary Smith, and Sonny Murray purchased the rights to Simon Mawer's book \"Mendel's Dwarf\". In December 2008, she stated that she was considering directing an adaptation of Larry Kramer's play \"The Normal Heart\", a project she has worked on since the mid-1990s.\nStreisand reprised the role of Roz Focker in \"Little Fockers\" (2010, alongside Dustin Hoffman), the third film from the \"Meet the Parents\" trilogy.\nParamount Pictures gave the green light to begin shooting the road trip comedy \"My Mother's Curse\" in early 2011, with Seth Rogen playing Streisand's character's son. Anne Fletcher directed the project, with a script by Dan Fogelman, produced by Lorne Michaels, John Goldwyn, and Evan Goldberg. Executive producers included Streisand, Rogen, Fogelman, and David Ellison, whose Skydance Productions co-financed the road movie. Shooting began in spring 2011 and wrapped in July; the film's title was eventually altered to \"The Guilt Trip\", and the movie was released in December 2012.\nPlans emerged in 2015 for Streisand to direct a feature biopic about the 18th-century Russian empress Catherine the Great, based on the top 2014 Black List script produced by Gil Netter, with Keira Knightley starring. Streisand was also set to star in a film adaptation of the musical \"Gypsy\"\u00a0\u2013 featuring music by Jules Styne, book by Arthur Laurents, and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim\u00a0\u2013 with Richard LaGravenese attached to the project as screenwriter. Streisand was in advanced negotiations to star and produce the film in April 2016, to be directed by Barry Levinson and distributed by STX Entertainment. Two months later, the film's script had been completed and production was scheduled to begin in early 2017. Streisand reportedly exited the project, and both failed to move into production.\nArtistry.\nStreisand possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, which Howard Cohen of the \"Miami Herald\" described as \"peerless\". Whitney Balliett wrote, \"Streisand wows her listeners with her shrewd dynamics (in-your-ear soft here, elbowing-loud there), her bravura climbs, her rolling vibrato, and the singular Streisand-from-Brooklyn nasal quality of her voice \u2013 a voice as immediately recognizable in its way as Louis Armstrong's.\" Music writer Allegra Rossi adds that Streisand creates complete compositions in her head:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Even though she can't read or write music, Barbra hears melodies as completed compositions in her head. She hears a melody and takes it in, learning it quickly. Barbra developed her ability to sustain long notes because she wanted to. She can mold a tune that others cannot; she's able to sing between song and speech, keeping in tune, carrying rhythm and meaning.\nWhile she is predominantly a pop singer, Streisand's voice has been described as \"semi-operatic\" due to its strength and quality of tone. According to Adam Feldman of \"Time Out\", Streisand's \"signature vocal style\" is \"a suspension bridge between old-school belting and microphone pop.\" She is known for her ability to hold relatively high notes, both loud and soft, with great intensity\u2014which led classical pianist Glenn Gould to call himself \"a Streisand freak\"\u2014as well as for her ability to make slight but unobtrusive embellishments on a melodic line.\nSince about 2010 critics and audiences noted that her voice had \"lowered and acquired an occasionally husky edge\". However, \"New York Times\" music critic Stephen Holden noted that her distinctive tone and musical instincts remained, and that she still had \"the gift of conveying a primal human longing in a beautiful sound\". Paul Taylor of \"The Independent \"wrote that Streisand \"has sounded a little scratchy and frayed, though the stout resolve and superb technique with which Streisand manages to hoist it over these difficulties has come to seem morally as well aesthetically impressive.\" Reviewing Streisand's 2014 studio album \"Partners\", Gil Naveh of \"Haaretz \"described Streisand's voice as \"velvety, clear and powerful ... and the passing years have given it a fascinating depth and roughness.\"\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and relationships.\nStreisand has been married twice. Her first husband was actor Elliott Gould, whom she married on September 13, 1963. They announced their separation on February 12, 1969, and divorced on July 6, 1971. They had one child, Jason Gould, who appeared as her on-screen son in \"The Prince of Tides\".\nIn 1969 and 1970, Streisand dated Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.\nShe started a relationship with hairdresser/producer Jon Peters in 1973. He went on to be her manager and producer. They broke up in 1982 during the making of \"Yentl\", but remain friends. She is the godmother of his daughters, Caleigh Peters and Skye Peters.\nStreisand briefly dated film director Michael Cimino in early 1983, though they kept their relationship secret. Cimino had considered her for a role in his planned adaptation of \"The Fountainhead\" by Ayn Rand, which was not made.\nFrom November 1983 to October 1987, Streisand lived with Baskin-Robbins ice cream heir Richard Baskin, who composed the lyrics to \"Here We Are At Last\" on her 1984 album \"Emotion\". They remained friends after the split, and Baskin would accompany Streisand to public events in between her subsequent romances.\nShe dated actor Don Johnson from December 1987 until at least September 1988; they recorded a duet of \"Till I Loved You\".\nIn 1983 and 1989 respectively, Streisand briefly dated actors Richard Gere and Clint Eastwood.\nFrom 1989 to 1991, she was involved with composer James Newton Howard.\nStreisand dated tennis champion Andre Agassi from 1992 to 1993. Writing about the relationship in his 2009 autobiography, Agassi said: \"We agree that we're good for each other, and so what if she's twenty-eight years older? We're simpatico, and the public outcry only adds spice to our connection. It makes our friendship feel forbidden, taboo \u2013 another piece of my overall rebellion. Dating Barbra Streisand is like wearing Hot Lava.\"\nDuring the early-to-mid-1990s, Streisand was in romantic relationships with several high-profile men, including newscaster Peter Jennings, and actors Liam Neeson, Jon Voight and Peter Weller.\nHer second husband is actor James Brolin, whom she married on July 1, 1998. They have no children together. Brolin has two sons from his first marriage, including actor Josh Brolin, and one daughter from his second marriage.\nStreisand has several dogs; she loved her dog Samantha so much that she had her cloned.\nIn March 2019, Streisand apologized for her controversial statements about Michael Jackson's accusers.\nName.\nStreisand changed her name from \"Barbara\" to \"Barbra\" because, she said, \"I hated the name, but I refused to change it.\" Streisand further explained, \"Well, I was 18 and I wanted to be unique, but I didn't want to change my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or something like that. (My middle name is Joan.) And I said, 'No, let's see, if I take out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique.\" A 1967 biography with a concert program said, \"the spelling of her first name is an instance of partial rebellion: she was advised to change her last name and retaliated by dropping an \"a\" from the first instead.\"\nAccording to Streisand, her surname is pronounced with an \"s\" sound \"like sand on the beach,\" not the \"z\" sound often used. The Apple voice digital assistant Siri originally pronounced her surname wrong, prompting Streisand to personally contact Apple CEO Tim Cook to complain about the pronunciation, which Apple soon corrected.\nPolitics.\nIn the early years of her career, Streisand's interest in politics was limited, with the exception of her participation in activities of the anti-nuclear group Women Strike for Peace in 1961 and 1962. In 1968, her political activism increased, and she helped promote the presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy who held an anti\u2013Vietnam War stance. In July 1968, with Harry Belafonte and others, she performed at the Hollywood Bowl in a fundraising concert sponsored by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to benefit the poor.\nStreisand has been an active supporter of the Democratic Party and many of its causes. She was among the celebrities on President Richard Nixon's 1971 list of political enemies. In 1972, she assisted the presidential campaign of anti-war candidate George McGovern by headlining the benefit concert Four for McGovern, organized by actor Warren Beatty and record producer Lou Adler; her concert recording was released as \"Live Concert at the Forum\". The next year, in association with liberal activist Stanley Sheinbaum and the American Civil Liberties Union, Streisand performed a benefit at the mansion of film mogul Jennings Lang to pay for the legal defense of Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers fame. Accompanied by a small combo including Marvin Hamlisch on piano, Streisand took paid song requests from the star-studded audience and by telephone to bring the night's total to $50,000.\nIn 1984, Streisand joined Jane Fonda and ten other television and film industry notables to establish the activist group Hollywood Women's Political Committee (HWPC), the membership eventually growing to 300. The HWPC fought for liberal causes for more than a decade, contributing to the Democratic Party's taking majority control in the 1986 U.S. Senate elections, and in 1992 funding Bill Clinton's presidential election as well as helping to usher in the Year of the Woman by electing more women senators. In 1995 Streisand spoke at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government about the role of the artist as citizen, in support of arts programs and funding.\nStreisand is a supporter of LGBT rights and backed the \"No on 8\" campaign in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat California Proposition 8 of 2008.\nIn 2012, Streisand stated, \"The new laws requiring U.S. citizens to produce photo IDs at the poll are designed to deprive elderly and minority citizens of the precious right to cast their vote.\u00a0These regressive laws are themselves the most dangerous voter fraud threatening American democracy.\" Streisand continued her voter rights advocacy in 2020, tweeting a link to VoteRiders, a nonprofit that assists citizens with obtaining voter ID.\nA longtime supporter of Israel, Streisand helped celebrate the 90th birthday of Shimon Peres at Jerusalem's international convention center in June 2013. She also performed at two other concerts in Tel Aviv that same week, part of her first concert tour of Israel.\nIn January 2017, she participated in 2017 Women's March in Los Angeles. Introduced by Rufus Wainwright, Streisand appeared on stage and made a speech.\nIn an October 2018 interview with Emma Brockes of \"The Guardian\", Streisand discussed the theme of her new album \"Walls\": the danger she believed President Donald Trump posed towards the United States. She said, \"This is a dangerous time in this nation, this republic: a man who is corrupt and indecent and is assaulting our institutions. It's really, really frightening. And I just pray that people who are compassionate and respect the truth will come out and vote. I'm saying more than just vote. Vote for Democrats!\" In November 2023, she praised President Joe Biden, saying \"I like Biden. I think he has done a good job. I think he is compassionate, smart, supports the right things.\"\nPhilanthropy.\nIn 1984, Streisand donated the Emanuel Streisand Building for Jewish Studies to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in the Mount Scopus campus, in memory of her father, an educator and scholar who died when she was young.\nStreisand has personally raised $25\u00a0million for organizations through her live performances. The Streisand Foundation, established in 1986, has contributed over $16\u00a0million through nearly 1,000 grants to \"national organizations working on preservation of the environment, voter education, the protection of civil liberties and civil rights, women's issues and nuclear disarmament\".\nIn 2006, Streisand donated $1\u00a0million to the William J. Clinton Foundation in support of former President Bill Clinton's climate change initiative.\nIn 2009, Streisand gifted $5\u00a0million to endow the Barbra Streisand Women's Cardiovascular Research and Education Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's Women's Heart Center. In September that year, \"Parade\" magazine included Streisand on its Giving Back Fund's second annual Giving Back 30 survey, \"a ranking of the celebrities who have made the largest donations to charity in 2007 according to public records\", as the third most generous celebrity. The Giving Back Fund claimed Streisand donated $11\u00a0million, which The Streisand Foundation distributed. In 2012 she raised $22\u00a0million to support her women's cardiovascular center, bringing her own personal contribution to $10\u00a0million. The program was officially named the Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center.\nAt Julien's Auctions in October 2009, Streisand, a longtime collector of art and furniture, sold 526 items, with all the proceeds going to her foundation. Items included a costume from \"Funny Lady\" and a vintage dental cabinet purchased by the performer at 18 years old. The sale's most valuable lot was a painting by Kees van Dongen.\nIn December 2011, she appeared at a fundraising gala for Israel Defense Forces charities.\nIn June 2020, she gifted George Floyd's daughter, Gianna Floyd, Disney shares.\nOn September 22, 2022, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, invited Streisand to become an ambassador for the UNITED24 platform, focusing on the Medical Aid direction of support. Streisand helped raise $240,000 for medical care.\nLegacy.\nStreisand is regarded as the \"Queen of the Divas\" by various media outlets. \"The New York Times\" called her among the three of America's Most Beloved Divas (alongside Dolly Parton and Patti Labelle). \"Vulture\" honored her enduring legacy saying her works influence \"extends to C\u00e9line Dion, the 1980s output of Lionel Richie and Luther Vandross, and the more maudlin ballads of Mariah Carey, Adele, and Whitney Houston.\" In 2022, \"Forbes\" hailed Streisand as the \"Queen of the Charts\" for her longevity on the \"Billboard\" charts, and she was ranked at number 88 on \"Billboard\"'s 2025 \"Top 100 Women Artists of the 21st Century\" list. The \"Los Angeles Times\" also hailed her as the \"most influential female vocalist\" and the \"most revolutionary of performers\" for being responsible for changing the rules for female performers to come. CNN listed her as one of the most romantic singers of the 20th century. In 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Streisand at number 147 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. In 1997, \"New York\" magazine acknowledged her fashion sense saying \"she embarked on a surreal, chameleonic, personal fashion quest\" that single-handedly began the retro revolution in the 1960s.\nHonors.\nStreisand was presented the Distinguished Merit Award by \"Mademoiselle\" in 1964, and selected as Miss Ziegfeld in 1965.

{"id": "72337", "revid": "43698778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72337", "title": "Michael VIII Palaiologos", "text": "Byzantine emperor (1261\u20131282), founder of the Palaiologos dynasty\nMichael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (; 1224 \u2013 11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine emperor from 1261 until his death in 1282, and previously as the co-emperor of the Empire of Nicaea from 1259 to 1261. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire. His reign saw considerable recovery of Byzantine power, including the enlargement of the Byzantine army and navy. It also included the reconstruction of the city of Constantinople, and the increase of its population. His re-establishment of the University of Constantinople contributed to the Palaeologan Renaissance, a cultural flowering between the 13th and 15th centuries.\nIt was also at this time that the focus of the Byzantine military shifted to the Balkans, against the Bulgarians, leaving the Anatolian frontier neglected. His successors could not compensate for this change of focus, and both the Arsenite schism and two civil wars which occurred from 1321\u20131328 and 1341\u20131347 undermined further efforts toward territorial consolidation and recovery, draining the empire's strength, economy, and resources. Regular conflict between Byzantine successor states such as Trebizond, Epirus, Bulgaria and Serbia resulted in permanent fragmentation of former Byzantine territory and opportunity for increasingly successful conquests of expansive territories by post-Seljuk Anatolian beyliks, most notably that of Osman, later called the Ottoman Empire.\nEarly life.\nMichael VIII Palaiologos was the son of the \"megas domestikos\" Andronikos Doukas Komnenos Palaiologos by Theodora Angelina Palaiologina, the granddaughter of Emperor Alexios III Angelos and Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamaterina. According to Deno John Geanakoplos, Michael's ancestry could be traced back to all three imperial houses that ruled the empire in the centuries before the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 by the Fourth Crusade. His mother does not appear to have played a significant role in his early life; at least for a time, he was brought up by his elder sister Martha, the wife of \"megas domestikos\" Nikephoros Tarchaneiotes, although she was only ten years older than he.\nRise to power.\nMichael rose to distinction at an early age, serving as the governor of the Thracian towns of Melnik and Serres under the command of his father Andronikos. However, in the autumn of 1253, Michael was accused before the Emperor John III Vatatzes of plotting against the throne. The only way Michael was allowed to prove his innocence was through trial by ordeal, holding a red-hot iron. When the Emperor ordered him to take hold of the red-hot metal, the young Michael answered (to use Geanakoplos' words) \"with the astuteness that was to characterize his later career as Emperor\": if the Metropolitan Phokas of Philadelphia, who evidently supported this proposal, could take the iron from the altar with his own hands and place it in Michael's, he would gladly receive it in faith that the truth would be revealed.\nAlthough Michael avoided punishment, and afterwards was married to the Emperor's grandniece and appointed \"megas konostaulos\" of the Latin mercenaries in the employment of the emperors of Nicaea, he was still mistrusted. Following the death of John Vatatzes, Michael crossed the Sangarios River with a few close friends and took service with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. From late 1256 to 1258, he served as commander of the Christian mercenaries fighting for Sultan Kaykaus II; in that later year the Emperor Theodore II Doukas Laskaris recalled Michael, and after both exchanged oaths of loyalty and guarantees of safety, Michael returned to the service of the Emperor.\nA few days after the death of Emperor Theodore Laskaris in 1258, Michael Palaiologos instigated a coup against the influential bureaucrat George Mouzalon, seizing from him the guardianship of the eight-year-old Emperor John IV Doukas Laskaris. Michael was invested with the titles of \"megas doux\" and, on 13 November 1258, of \"despotes\". On 1 January 1259, Michael was formally proclaimed emperor (basileus), most likely without John IV, in Nymphaion.\nConstantinople.\nIn 1259, Michael VIII defeated the alliance of William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea, and Michael II Komnenos Doukas of Epirus at the Battle of Pelagonia. According to Geanakoplos, \"In the period immediately preceding the Nicene reconquest of Constantinople in 1261 no event was of greater importance than Michael Palaeologus' victory at Pelagonia.\" This not only neutralized, for the immediate time, the possibility of an attack from enemies on his Western borders, but also improved Michael's legitimacy by showing him as a competent leader.\nDespite this brilliant victory, only one event could remove the stigma of usurper completely from the eyes of his subjects\u00a0\u2013 recovery of Constantinople itself. In 1260 Michael personally led an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city. Rumors of reinforcements for the beleaguered city forced Michael to sign a one-year truce with the Latin Emperor Baldwin II that August. Realizing that he needed a navy to effectively besiege Constantinople, Michael concluded the Treaty of Nymphaeum with Genoa in March of the following year. Genoese help proved to be unneeded when Michael VIII's general Alexios Strategopoulos captured Constantinople from Baldwin II through treachery on 25 July 1261.\nNews of the captured city first reached Michael's sister Eulogia Palaiologina, who awoke her brother at dawn. He was not convinced until a messenger arrived from Strategopoulos bearing the crown and sword Baldwin had abandoned in his flight from his palace. Michael VIII entered the city on 15 August and had himself crowned emperor. Once in control of Constantinople, Michael abolished all Latin customs and reinstated most Byzantine ceremonies and institutions as they had existed before the Fourth Crusade. He repopulated the capital, building its population from when he took power to by the end of his reign, and restored damaged churches, monasteries, and public buildings. He was acutely aware of the danger posed by the possibility that the Latin West, particularly his neighbors in Italy, would unite against him and attempt the restoration of Latin rule in Constantinople.\nJohn IV had remained at Nicaea, largely eclipsed by Michael. According to Akropolites, the public had never really viewed John as emperor - his name was virtually stricken from government business after the death of his father Theodore II, and he had not featured in Michael\u2019s coronation ceremony as co-ruler. In December 1261, Michael VIII took the final step of having John blinded and relegated to a monastery, rendering him permanently ineligible for the throne. Michael quickly married off John's sisters to two Italians and a Bulgarian noble, so their descendants could not threaten his own children's claim to the imperial succession. Michael tried to keep the blinding of John a secret, keeping up a pretense that the boy\u2019s formal coronation had merely been postponed. Eventually the news leaked out, and Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos excommunicated Michael VIII. This ban was not lifted until six years later (1268) on the appointment of patriarch Joseph I.\nDiplomacy and conquest.\nIn the words of Geanaklopos, \"With the fall of Constantinople, the papacy suffered not only a loss of political prestige but severe damage to its spiritual authority as well. For the Greeks had now effectively reasserted their right to a church divorced from Rome. Thus it became the task of each of the six successive popes of Michael's reign to accomplish the return of the schismatics to the Roman fold.\" Michael was aware of the immense influence the Curia had in the West, so he immediately dispatched an embassy to Pope Urban IV consisting of two envoys; upon reaching Italy, the men were seized and one was flayed alive, while the other succeeded in escaping back to friendlier territories.\nMichael also approached Manfred of Sicily to achieve some kind of accord. In the summer of 1262, Michael offered to divorce his wife Theodora and marry Manfred's sister Anna. This offer failed spectacularly: not only did Anna reject his proposal, Theodora turned to Patriarch Arsenios for help. The Patriarch confronted the emperor and pressured him to abandon his plans. Michael yielded and sent Anna back to her brother with gifts. This gesture helped to secure the release of his general Alexios Strategopoulos.\nIt was around this time that Michael was presented with a dangerous distraction: \u02bfIzz ad-D\u012bn Kayk\u0101w\u016bs, who had been deposed as Sultan of the Seljuk Turks by a coalition led by the Pervane Mu\u2018in al-Din Suleyman, arrived seeking help from his old friend. But as Claude Cahen notes, he \"was to be cruelly disappointed.\" Michael favored the Mongols of Iran, who supported \u02bfIzz ad-D\u012bn's enemy the Pervane, against those of Russia. Further, he could not risk a war on his Asian frontier while Western Europe, infinitely more dangerous, was opposed to him. Cahen believes that either \u02bfIzz ad-D\u012bn became an embarrassment, or perhaps the former Sultan \"indulged in too open of criticism\"; in either case, \u02bfIzz ad-D\u012bn was imprisoned. Mongol troops from Russia eventually freed him, and carried him off to the Crimea where he lived out his life.\nA series of military setbacks followed. In 1263 Michael sent men, including Seljuk mercenaries, to Morea with the goal of conquering the Principality of Achaea, but this expedition failed in a surprise rout at Prinitza. Later that year a mixed fleet of 48 imperial and Genoese ships was defeated by a smaller Venetian force at the Battle of Settepozzi. The following year, the imperial forces in Morea were again defeated at Makryplagi after the Seljuk mercenaries, who had not been paid, changed sides. The nadir of Michael's disasters came in the spring of 1265, when an army of Tatars and Bulgars under Nogai Khan ravaging Thrace ambushed Michael Palaeologos when he was returning to Constantinople accompanied by only a few troops. Deserted by even his own officers, who fled to save their own lives, Michael was able to escape by crossing the Ganos Mountains and reaching the Marmora coast, where he happened upon two Latin ships. He quickly boarded the vessels, and two days later safely arrived at Constantinople. \"Thus did Michael survive one of the narrowest escapes of his career,\" notes Geanakoplos.\nThe military advantages Michael enjoyed after capturing Constantinople had evaporated, but he would demonstrate his diplomatic skills to successfully recover from these drawbacks. After Settepozzi, Michael VIII dismissed the 60 Genoese galleys that he had hired earlier and began a rapprochement with Venice. Michael secretly negotiated a treaty with the Venetians to grant terms similar to those in the case of Nymphaeum, but Doge Raniero Zeno failed to ratify the agreement. He also signed a treaty in 1263 with the Egyptian Mamluk sultan Baibars and Berke, the Mongol Khan of Kipchak Khanate.\nMichael and Charles of Anjou.\nThe Battle of Benevento on 26 February 1266 brought forth a new challenger to Michael, one with whom he would struggle for the rest of his life: Charles of Anjou. Michael, as Geanaklopos emphasizes, \"from 1266 until shortly before his death in 1282 ... was constrained to devote almost complete attention to the defeat of Charles, the fulfillment of whose ambition would have brought about the destruction of the Byzantine Empire and reimposition of Latin rule in Constantinople.\" Charles strengthened his hold on the kingdom of Sicily by defeating Conradin at the Battle of Tagliacozzo on 23 August 1268. And looking for help to restore the Latin Empire, on May 1267, Charles concluded the Treaty of Viterbo with the exiled Emperor Baldwin II and William II Villehardouin under the guidance of Pope Clement IV.\nIn many ways Michael and Charles were alike. Geanakoplos quotes Nicephorus Gregoras's comparison of the two men at length:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Charles, motivated not by small but great ambitions, implanted in his mind like a seed the resolution of taking Constantinople. He dreamed that if he could become the master of it, he would restore the entire monarchy, so to speak, of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He was very able not only in planning what he wished to do but in easily translating his thoughts into action. Clearly he surpassed all his predecessors in the strength of his nature and intelligence... Nevertheless, neither his actions against the Greeks nor those of Michael Palaeologus against the Latins could be brought to a successful conclusion. For the strength of both was for a long time so evenly matched that it was well said (this was the opinion of discerning people) that if at that time such an Emperor had not been directing Greek affairs, the Empire would easily have succumbed to Charles, the King of Italy [\"sic\"]; and, conversely, if such a King had not then been at the helm of Italian affairs, the hegemony of Italy would with little difficulty have passed to Michael Palaeologus.\nMichael was also faced with a challenge on his Asian frontier. Although the peace treaty with the Seljuk Turks continued to be honored by both parties, nomadic Turkmen had begun to infiltrate the Byzantine territories, and because of Michael's preoccupation with his Western foes, there was no organized response to this threat. Speros Vryonis also points out that due to his treatment of John IV Laskaris, \"there resulted an outright alienation from Constantinople of large segments of Greek society in Bithynia and elsewhere.\" In 1269 Michael sent his brother the \"despotes\" John Palaiologos into the southern part of Byzantine Anatolia to clear the Maeander and Cayster valleys of Turkmen; their response was to fall back before the Byzantine army, and when John was eventually recalled to face foes in Europe, the Turkmen pushed back and resumed their conquests and settlement. Thus by 1269, the cities of Trachia Studia and Strobilos on the Carian coast were firmly Turkish possessions.\nMichael's response to the Treaty of Viterbo was to attempt to weaken papal support for it; if the Pope was convinced Charles of Anjou's invasion was a just and holy war, then the forces Michael could call on could not prevent its success. Michael returned to negotiating a union of the churches with Pope Clement IV, which he had agreed to, but the latter's death in November 1268 put an end to this approach. According to Geanakoplos, only a lack of resources prevented Charles from immediately launching an attack against Michael. Looking for some restraint on Charles, Michael made a shrewd appeal to King Louis IX of France, the leading ruler of the West and the elder brother of Charles. Louis was more interested in a crusade against Muslims controlling the Holy Land than attacking a schismatic Christian. So he had Charles join his Tunisian crusade in 1270. When Louis died in Tunisia, Charles took command, negotiated a truce, and sailed to Sicily, planning to attack Byzantium. At this point a miracle saved Michael: a violent storm destroyed Charles' fleet. \"To the Greeks of Byzantium,\" writes Geanakoplos, \"it must have seemed as if the Virgin, their protector, had saved them from disaster.\"\nAfter a three year interregnum, during which Charles of Anjou attempted to sway the election, a new pope was elected, Gregory X. When Michael restarted talks of union, Gregory proved to be less accommodating and negotiated from a position of strength. Michael attempted to reason with Patriarch Joseph and the synod of the importance of agreeing to this union, and that the principle of \"oikonomia\" (which Geanakoplos suggests is best translated here as \"considerations of self-interest\") required them to accede to papal demands. But despite a propaganda campaign over the winter of 1274\u20131275, Michael was forced to depose Patriarch Joseph and replace him with his own supporter John Bekkos in order to obtain a grudging consent to the union.\nCouncil of Lyon and after.\nByzantine envoys presented themselves at the Second Council of Lyon 24 June 1274, where they presented a letter from the Emperor, sealed with the imperial golden bull, and two others from his son Andronikos and the Byzantine clergy. On the fourth session of the Council the formal act of union was performed. The letters were read, and for the first time in two centuries representatives of the major Eastern and Western branches of Christianity were again in communion.\nMichael VIII achieved an important advantage by this union, for now he gained legitimacy both for possessing Constantinople and for his claims to the lands occupied by Western invaders. Further, his antagonist Charles could not rely on the power of the pope calling for a crusade against his realm. Lastly, Pope Gregory was very favorable to Michael's proposal for a crusade against the Turks to restore the ancient Christian cities of Anatolia; however with Gregory's death (January 1276), these plans remained nothing more than talk.\nMore disappointments followed as news of the Council filtered through the former Byzantine territories. While the union was opposed at all levels of society, it was especially opposed by the greater populace, led by the monks and the adherents of the deposed Patriarch Arsenios, known as the Arsenites. One of the chief anti-unionist leaders was Michael's own sister Eulogia, who fled to the court of her daughter Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, Tsarina of the Bulgars, from where she intrigued unsuccessfully against Michael. More serious was the opposition of the sons of Michael of Epirus, Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas and his half-brother John I Doukas: they posed as the defenders of Orthodoxy and gave support to the anti-unionists fleeing Constantinople. Michael at first responded with comparative leniency, hoping to win the anti-unionists through persuasion, but eventually the virulence of the protests led him to resort to force. Many anti-unionists were blinded or exiled. Two prominent monks, Meletios and Ignatios, were punished: the first had his tongue cut out, the second was blinded. Even imperial officials were harshly treated, and the death penalty was decreed even for simply reading or possessing pamphlets directed against the Emperor. \"From the intensity of these disorders, tantamount almost to civil wars,\" concludes Geanakoplos, \"it might appear that too great a price had been paid for the sake of union.\"\nThe religious situation only worsened for Michael. The Arsenite party found widespread support amongst the discontented in the Anatolian provinces, and Michael responded there with similar viciousness: according to Vryonis, \"These elements were either removed from the armies or else, alienated, they deserted to the Turks\". Another attempt to clear the encroaching Turkmen from the Meaender valley in 1278 found limited success, but Antioch on the Maeander was irretrievably lost as were Tralles and Nyssa four years later.\nOn 1 May 1277, John convoked a synod at Neopatras that anathematized the Emperor, Patriarch, and Pope as heretics. In response, a synod was convoked at the Hagia Sophia on 16 July where both Nikephoros and John were anathematized in return. John called a final synod at Neopatras in December 1277, where an anti-unionist council of eight bishops, a few abbots, and one hundred monks, again anathematized the Emperor, Patriarch, and Pope.\nMichael's achievements on the battlefield were more positive, although still mixed. He tried to take advantage of a civil war in Bulgaria in the late 1270s, but the Byzantine armies suffered several major defeats at the hands of the peasant Emperor Ivaylo. The Emperor managed to temporarily impose his son-in-law Ivan Asen III on the Bulgarian throne, but after the Byzantine defeat at Devina he had to flee. However, Michael VIII later managed to conquer the Bulgarian portion of Thrace, while the internal situation of the Bulgarian Empire remained unstable. In 1275, Michael VIII sent an army against Thessaly and fleet of 73 ships to harass the Latin states in Greece. The army was crushingly defeated at the Battle of Neopatras, but the fleet won a similarly comprehensive victory at the Battle of Demetrias.\nLast was his victory over Charles of Anjou in western Greece. Charles' general Hugh of Sully with 8,000 men (including 2,000 cavalry) captured Butrinto in 1280 and besieged Berat. A Byzantine army of relief under Michael Tarchaneiotes arrived in March 1281: Hugh of Sully was ambushed and captured, and his army put to flight. Geanaklopos considers that most scholars do not appreciate fully the importance of this victory: \"this victory marked the complete failure of the attempt to launch a land expedition against the capital. Thus ... Charles had to shift his strategy to a sea attack against Constantinople\".\nSicilian Vespers.\nOn 22 February 1281 a new Pope was selected, Pope Martin IV, a Frenchman Geanaklopos describes as \"blindly subservient\" to Charles of Anjou. Once again, Charles had no clear brake on his ambitions to conquer Constantinople, and he moved swiftly to prepare for this new offensive. One early move was taken by Pope Martin, who on 10 April 1281, excommunicated Michael without any warning or provocation, thus disrupting the union of Lyons.\nCharles had prepared a military force far larger than Michael could muster. According to Marino Sanudo, Charles had 100 ships in Sicily, and 300 more in Naples, Provence, and his Greek territories, which were to carry no fewer than 8,000 cavalrymen. Geanakoplos cites surviving documents that attest to the supplies Charles had accumulated. One Angevin rescript, dated 28 October 1281, lists a collection of tools to be gathered for the expedition, which includes \"two thousand iron mattocks, three thousand iron stakes, sledges for smashing rocks, ropes, iron shovels, axes, and kettles for boiling pitch.\" Another orders the delivery of \"four thousand iron stakes that are under construction in Venice.\" A third consists of instructions to a Pisan merchant for 2,500 shields of various sizes, all to be emblazoned with his royal emblem of lilies. Allied with Charles were a long list of powers. Besides having ties of kinship with the Kings of France and Hungary, the rulers of the Serbs and Bulgars were his allies, as well as the rulers of Epirus and dissidents of the Byzantine Empire, and the leading naval power of Europe, Venice.\nObviously Michael sought allies against Charles of Anjou, but they were few. Donald Nicol lists the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, who would \"loan him ships\", and the Tatars of the Golden Horde in South Russia who \"could keep an eye on the Bulgarians\". His ambassadors visited the court of Roman-German King Rudolph I of Habsburg, but he was aloof. King Peter III of Aragon proved more welcoming, for he had his own reasons to hate Charles. According to Geanakoplos, Peter's wife Constance was the daughter of Manfred, and for this reason Peter considered Charles a usurper and Sicily the rightful property of Constance. Peter welcomed refugees from Sicily, most notably John of Procida, whom he made secretary of the royal chancery. Yet Aragon was at the other end of the Mediterranean, far from Michael.\nBefore Charles of Anjou could start for Constantinople, however, the Sicilian Vespers rebellion struck, on 30 March 1282. Charles sent four ships to handle the revolt, but when the rebels took control of Messina, he ordered the men and materiel assembled for use against Michael to besiege that city; meanwhile seventy Angevin ships at the arsenal of Messina were destroyed. Eventually Charles lifted the siege, and Peter of Aragon landed in Sicily to reclaim the island for his wife. Beginning with Pope Martin's bull dated 18 November 1282, wherein he again excommunicated Michael\u2014as well as Peter of Aragon, John of Procida, and Michael's emissary Benedetto Zaccaria\u2014as the author of the conspiracy that led to the Sicilian Vespers, Michael has been seen as the instigator. Geanakoplos, while admitting that Michael was in contact with the leaders of the revolt beforehand, asserts \"that Michael Palaeologus, on his part, had nothing to do with the incident at the church of Santo Spirito is beyond question.\"\nFurthermore, Michael VIII was instrumental in instigating revolts in Crete against the Venetians, the most famous of which was led by the Hortatzoi brothers Georgios and Theodore of Mesi in Rethymnon, with a duration of six years, causing most significant harm to the Venetian occupants and economic interests of Venice. Michael VIII had aimed to eventually bring Venice, an ally of Charles of Anjou, to the table of negotiations, as he did, at his court in Constantinople.\nDeath and legacy.\nMichael VIII died in Pachomios village, Thrace on 11 December 1282. He was denied burial in Constantinople due to his persecution of the Church in support of union with Rome, so was instead laid to rest in a monastery called Nea Mone in the region of Rhaidestos (modern Tekirda\u011f). Three years later, in 1285, his remains were moved to the monastery of Christ in Selymbria, where in 1260 he had reburied the body of Basil II.\nIn reconstituting the Byzantine Empire Michael VIII restored the old administration without endeavouring to correct its failures. In recovering Constantinople and investing in the defence of his European provinces, Michael VIII began to denude the Anatolian frontier of its troops and was forced to lower their pay or cancel their tax exemptions. This policy led to the gradual collapse of the frontier, which was infiltrated by Turkish bands even before his death. The Palaiologan dynasty he established ruled the Byzantine Empire for almost two centuries, longer than any other in Roman history. Also, during his reign there was a temporary naval revival in which the Byzantine navy consisted of 80 ships.\nFamily.\nIn 1253, Michael VIII Palaiologos married Theodora Palaiologina, a grandniece of John III Doukas Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea. Orphaned in childhood, she was raised by her great-uncle John III, who was said to have \"loved her like a daughter\", and who arranged for her marriage to Michael. Their children were:\nBy a mistress, a Diplovatatzina, Michael VIII also had two illegitimate daughters:\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates.\nBlackberry fruit production is abundant with annual volumes of per possible, making this plant commercially attractive.\n\"Rubus armeniacus\" (\"Himalayan\" or \"Armenian\" blackberry) is considered a noxious weed and invasive species in many regions of the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, where it grows out of control in urban and suburban parks and woodlands.\nDescription.\nThe blackberry looks similar to its raspberry relatives. What distinguishes the blackberry is the connection between the berry and the torus (receptacle or stem). When a raspberry is picked, the torus remains on the vine. This is why there is a hollow core in the raspberry fruit. When a blackberry is picked, the torus stays with the fruit.\nThe term \"bramble\", a word referring to any impenetrable thicket, has in some circles traditionally been applied specifically to the blackberry or its products, though in the United States it applies to all members of the genus \"Rubus\". In the western US, the term \"caneberry\" is used to refer to blackberries and raspberries as a group rather than the term bramble. \"Briar\" or \"brier\" may be used to refer to the dense vines of the plant, though this name is used for other thorny thickets (such as \"Smilax\") as well.\nThe usually black fruit is not a berry in the botanical sense, as it is termed botanically as an aggregate fruit, composed of small drupelets. It is a widespread and well-known group of over 375 species, many of which are closely related apomictic microspecies native throughout Europe, northwestern Africa, temperate western and central Asia and North and South America.\nPlants.\nBlackberries are perennial plants bearing biennial stems (called \"canes\") from their roots.\nIn its first year, a new stem, the \"primocane\", reaches a full length of about trailing on the ground and bearing large palmate compound leaves with 5\u20137 new leaves; it does not produce any flowers. In its second year, the cane is a \"floricane\" with a non-growing stem. The lateral buds open to produce flowering laterals. First- and second-year shoots produce short-curved, sharp thorns. Thornless cultivars have been developed during the early 21st century.\nUnmanaged plants tend to aggregate in a dense tangle of stems and branches, which can be controlled in gardens or farms using trellises. Blackberry shrubs can tolerate poor soils, spreading readily in wasteland, ditches, and roadsides.\nThe flowers bloom in late spring and early summer on the tips of branches. Each flower is about in diameter, with five white-pink petals. Each drupelet develops around an ovule fertilized by a male gamete from a pollen grain. The most likely cause of undeveloped ovules is inadequate pollinator visits. Infection with raspberry bushy dwarf virus sometimes causes no visible symptoms and sometimes causes incomplete drupelet development and crumbly fruit.\nGenetics.\nThe loci controlling the primocane fruiting was mapped in the F Locus, on LG7, whereas thorns/thornlessness was mapped on LG4. Better understanding of the genetics is useful for genetic screening of cross-breds, and for genetic engineering to control for desirable traits.\nEcology.\nBlackberry leaves are food for certain caterpillars; some grazing mammals, especially deer, are also very fond of the leaves. Caterpillars of the concealer moth \"Alabonia geoffrella\" have been found feeding inside dead blackberry shoots. When mature, the berries are eaten and their seeds dispersed by mammals, such as the red fox, American black bear, and the Eurasian badger, as well as by small birds.\nBlackberries grow wild throughout most of Europe. They are an important element in the ecology of many countries, and harvesting the berries is a common pastime. However, their vigorous growth and tendency to grow unchecked if not managed correctly mean that the plants are also considered a weed, sending down roots from branches that touch the ground, and sending up suckers from the roots. In some parts of the world, such as in Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, some blackberry species, particularly \"Rubus armeniacus\" (\"Himalayan\" blackberry) and \"Rubus laciniatus\" (evergreen blackberry), are naturalized and considered an invasive species and a noxious weed.\nBlackberry fruits are red when unripe, leading to an old expression that \"blackberries are red when they're green\".\nCultivation.\nWorldwide, Mexico is the leading producer of blackberries, with nearly the entire crop being produced for export into the off-season fresh markets in North America and Europe. Until 2018, the Mexican market was almost entirely based on the cultivar 'Tupy' (often spelled 'Tupi', but the EMBRAPA program in Brazil from which it was released prefers the 'Tupy' spelling), but Tupy fell out of favor in some Mexican growing regions. In the US, Oregon is the leading commercial blackberry producer, producing on in 2017.\nNumerous cultivars have been selected for commercial and amateur cultivation in Europe and the United States. Since the many species form hybrids easily, there are numerous cultivars with more than one species in their ancestry.\nHistory.\nModern hybridization and cultivar development took place mostly in the US. In 1880, a hybrid blackberry-raspberry named the loganberry was developed in Santa Cruz, California, by an American judge and horticulturalist, James Harvey Logan. One of the first thornless varieties was developed in 1921, but the berries lost much of their flavor. Common thornless cultivars developed from the 1990s to the early 21st century by the US Department of Agriculture enabled efficient machine-harvesting, higher yields, larger and firmer fruit, and improved flavor, including the \"Triple Crown\", \"Black Diamond\", \"Black Pearl\", and \"Nightfall\", a marionberry.\nHybrids.\n'Marion' (marketed as \"marionberry\") is an important cultivar that was selected from seedlings from a cross between 'Chehalem' and 'Olallie' (commonly called \"Olallieberry\") berries. 'Olallie' in turn is a cross between loganberry and youngberry. 'Marion', 'Chehalem' and 'Olallie' are just three of many trailing blackberry cultivars developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) blackberry breeding program at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.\nThe most recent cultivars released from this program are the thornless cultivars 'Black Diamond', 'Black Pearl', and 'Nightfall' as well as the early-ripening 'Obsidian' and 'Metolius'. 'Black Diamond' is now the leading cultivar being planted in the Pacific Northwest. Some of the other cultivars from this program are 'Newberry', 'Waldo', 'Siskiyou', 'Black Butte', 'Kotata', 'Pacific', and 'Cascade'.\nVarieties with good commercial characteristics developed in Arkansas are grown in nurseries in Oklahoma. Such blackberries are easy to grow, and may produce fruit for a decade or more. These varieties have diverse flavors varying from sweet to tart.\nTrailing.\nTrailing blackberries are vigorous and crown-forming, require a trellis for support, and are less cold-hardy than erect or semi-erect blackberries. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, these types do well in similar climates, such as New Zealand, Chile, and the Mediterranean countries.\nThornless.\nSemi-erect, prickle-free blackberries were first developed at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK, and subsequently by the USDA-ARS in Beltsville, Maryland. These are crown-forming and very vigorous and need a trellis for support. Cultivars include 'Black Satin', 'Chester Thornless', 'Dirksen Thornless', 'Hull Thornless', 'Loch Maree', 'Loch Ness', 'Loch Tay', 'Merton Thornless', 'Smoothstem', and 'Triple Crown'. 'Loch Ness' and 'Loch Tay' have gained the RHS's Award of Garden Merit. The cultivar 'Cacanska Bestrna' (also called 'Cacak Thornless') has been developed in Serbia and has been planted on many thousands of hectares there.\nErect.\nThe University of Arkansas has developed cultivars of erect blackberries. These types are less vigorous than the semi-erect types and produce new canes from root initials (therefore they spread underground like raspberries). There are prickly and prickle-free cultivars from this program, including 'Navaho', 'Ouachita', 'Cherokee', 'Apache', 'Arapaho', and 'Kiowa'. They are also responsible for developing the primocane fruiting blackberries such as 'Prime-Jan' and 'Prime-Jim'.\nPrimocane.\nIn raspberries, these types are called primocane fruiting, fall fruiting, or everbearing. 'Prime-Jim' and 'Prime-Jan' were released in 2004 by the University of Arkansas and are the first cultivars of primocane fruiting blackberry. They grow much like the other erect cultivars described above; however, the canes that emerge in the spring will flower in midsummer and fruit in late summer or fall. The fall crop has its highest quality when it ripens in cool mild climates such as in California or the Pacific Northwest.\nMost blackberry plants do not survive temperatures below , but the 'Illini Hardy', a semi-erect prickly cultivar introduced by the University of Illinois, can survive colder temperatures than most cultivars. In comparative study at Urbana, Illinois, it was the only type to survive the 1989\u20131990 winter when temperatures dropped to . It is one of only a couple varieties that is cane hardy in zone 5, where blackberry production has traditionally been problematic since canes often failed to survive the winter.\nMexico and Chile.\nBlackberry production in Mexico expanded considerably in the early 21st century. In 2017, Mexico had 97% of the market share for fresh blackberries imported into the United States, while Chile had 61% of the market share for American imports of frozen blackberries.\nWhile once based on the cultivar 'Brazos', an old erect blackberry cultivar developed in Texas in 1959, the Mexican industry is now dominated by the Brazilian 'Tupy' released in the 1990s. The 'Tupy' has the erect blackberry 'Comanche', and a \"wild Uruguayan blackberry\" as parents. The Uruguayan cultivar is believed to be the widely grown 'Boysenberry', a hybrid of several different species of \"Rubus\". To produce these blackberries in regions of Mexico where there is no winter chilling to stimulate flower bud development, chemical defoliation and application of growth regulators are used to promote blooming.\nDiseases and pests.\nBecause blackberries belong to the same genus as raspberries, they share the same diseases, including anthracnose (a type of canker), which can cause the berry to have uneven ripening. Sap flow may also be slowed. They also share the same remedies, including the Bordeaux mixture, a combination of lime, water and copper(II) sulfate. The rows between blackberry plants must be free of weeds, blackberry suckers and grasses, which may lead to pests or diseases. Fruit growers are selective when planting blackberry bushes because wild blackberries may be infected, and gardeners are recommended to purchase only certified disease-free plants.\nThe spotted-wing drosophila, \"Drosophila suzukii\", is a serious pest of blackberries. Unlike its vinegar fly relatives, which are primarily attracted to rotting or fermented fruit, \"D. suzukii\" attacks fresh, ripe fruit by laying eggs under the soft skin. The larvae hatch and grow in the fruit, destroying the fruit's commercial value.\nAnother pest is \"Amphorophora rubi\", known as the blackberry aphid, which eats not just blackberries but raspberries as well.\n\"Byturus tomentosus\" (raspberry beetle), \"Lampronia corticella\" (raspberry moth) and \"Anthonomus rubi\" (strawberry blossom weevil) are also known to infest blackberries.\nUses.\nNutrients.\nRaw blackberries are 88% water, 10% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and 0.5% fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw blackberries supply 43 calories, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber, manganese (28% DV), and vitamin C (23% DV), with a moderate amount of vitamin K (17% DV) (table).\nSeed composition.\nBlackberries contain numerous large firm seeds containing omega-3 (alpha-linolenic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) fats, protein, dietary fiber, carotenoids, ellagitannins, and ellagic acid.\nCulinary use.\nThe ripe fruit is commonly used in desserts, jams, jelly, wine, and liqueurs. It may be mixed with other berries and fruits for pies and crumbles.\nPhytochemical research.\nBlackberries contain numerous phytochemicals including polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, salicylic acid, ellagic acid, and fiber. Anthocyanins in blackberries are responsible for their rich dark color. One report placed blackberries at the top of more than 1,000 polyphenol-rich foods consumed in the United States, but this concept of a health benefit from consuming dark-colored foods like blackberries remains scientifically unverified and not accepted for health claims on food labels.\nHistorical uses.\nOne of the earliest known instances of blackberry consumption comes from the remains of the Haraldsk\u00e6r Woman, the naturally preserved bog body of a Danish woman dating from approximately 2,500 years ago. Forensic evidence found blackberries in her stomach contents, among other foods. The use of blackberries to make wines and cordials was documented in the London Pharmacopoeia in 1696. In the culinary world, blackberries have long been used alongside other fruits to make pies, jellies, and jams.\nBlackberry plants were used for traditional medicine by Greeks, other European peoples, and aboriginal Americans. A 1771 document described brewing blackberry leaves, stem, and bark for stomach ulcers.\nBlackberry fruit, leaves, and stems have been used to dye fabrics and hair. Native Americans have even been known to use the stems to make rope. The shrubs have also been used for barriers around buildings, crops, and livestock. The wild plants have sharp, thick prickles, which offer some protection against enemies and large animals.\nIn culture.\nFolklore in the United Kingdom and Ireland states that blackberries should not be picked after Old Michaelmas Day (11 October) as the devil (or a P\u00faca) has made them unfit to eat by stepping, spitting or fouling on them. There is some value in this legend as autumn's wetter and cooler weather often allows the fruit to become infected by various molds such as \"Botryotinia\" which give the fruit an unpleasant look and may be toxic. According to some traditions, a blackberry's deep purple color represents Jesus's blood and the crown of thorns was made of brambles, although other thorny plants, such as \"Crataegus\" (hawthorn) and \"Euphorbia milii\" (crown of thorns plant), have been proposed as the material for the crown.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on the eastern shore of Manila Bay, the region lies between the Central Luzon and Calabarzon regions. Encompassing an area of and with a population of as of 2020, it consists of sixteen highly urbanized cities: Manila\u2014the capital city\u2014Caloocan, Las Pi\u00f1as, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Para\u00f1aque, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon City, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela, along with one independent municipality, Pateros. As the second most populous and the most densely populated region in the Philippines, it ranks as the 7th most populous metropolitan area in Asia and the 6th most populous urban area in the world.\nThe region is the center of culture (including arts and entertainment), economy, education, and the government. Designated as a global power city, the region exerts a significant impact on commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment both locally and internationally. It is home to all embassies in the Philippines, making it an important center for international diplomacy in the country. Its economic power establishes the region as the country's premier center for finance and commerce. The region accounts for 36% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Philippines. Greater Manila is the fourth largest ASEAN country subdivision by GDP, after Singapore, and the Jakarta, and Bangkok metropolitan regions.\nIn 1975, in response to the need to sustain and provide integrated services to the growing population, the built-up area centered on Manila was formally recognized as a metropolitan area through Presidential Decree No. 824. A year later, Presidential Decree No. 879 established Metro Manila as an administrative region, retaining its earlier status as a metropolis, and designated it as \"Region IV\", with the remainder of the Southern Tagalog region being designated as Region IV-A. Finally, in 1978, Metro Manila became the National Capital Region (NCR) of the Philippines, discontinuing its numerical designation and reverting Southern Tagalog to its original designation.\nHistory.\nKingdom of Maynila.\nManila, to the extent that it has this placename, was likely founded in the Middle Ages, in the early 16th century due to the Sanskrit origin of the component \"nila\" in its name which refers to \"indigo\", and the prevalence of the placename during the rule of Rajah Matanda, the old king of Maynila, who was born somewhere between the late 15th century to the early 16th century. The earliest evidence of Hinduism and Sanskrit influence in maritime Southeast Asia is in Sanskrit inscriptions from the late 300s in eastern Kalimantan (or Borneo). This analysis of the placename is supported by many other nearby placenames in the Tagalog region with the prefix \"may-\".\nManila has historically been a global city due to its role in international trade. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Manila was a walled and fortified city and was the capital of the Kingdom of Luzon. Its institution, government, and economy were associated with the Tagalogs and the Kapampangans, and the Malay language was extensively used for foreign affairs as customary in much of Southeast Asia at the time. It was also well known in other Southeast Asian kingdoms such as Cebu, Brunei, Melaka, other Malay kingdoms, and Ternate, and its existence as a center of trade was widely known in East Asia as far as China and Japan.\nIn the current territory of Metropolitan Manila, there were several lordships that were either sovereign or tributary such as Tondo (\"Tundun\"), Navotas (\"Nab\u00fatas\"), Tambobong (\"Tamb\u00fabong\"), Taguig (\"Tagiig\"), Para\u00f1aque (\"Palany\u00e1g\") and Cainta (\"Kaint\u00e2\").\nShortly after Rajah Matanda's birth, sometime around the early 16th century while he was \"rajahmuda\" or heir apparent, his father, the King of Luzon, died, leaving his mother as the queen regent of Luzon. By 1511, Luzonians had been carrying out large-scale trade at least within maritime Southeast Asia with Luzonians being hired as officials in Melaka and merchants gaining royal favors in Brunei. It was in Melaka that Luzonians met the Portuguese before their eventual conquest of Melaka in 1511. Rajah Matanda, in 1521, was known in maritime Southeast Asia as the son of the King of Luzon. He married a princess of Brunei and served as an admiral for his grandfather, the Sultan of Brunei, in an attack near Java in exchange for soldiers and a fleet of ships. On the way home, he met and had an encounter with a Castilian fleet.\nSome Luzonians in the 1500s had also been taking part in mercenary work in other kingdoms. The Luzonians' commercial influence also reached as far as Butuan. By the 1570s, the ruling class of Manila together with the international Luzonian merchants were Muslim and Islam was spreading through the freemen and the slaves.\nOn May 24, 1570, the battle of Manila was fought between the Kingdom of Luzon, under the command of the heir apparent Prince Sulayman, and the Kingdom of Spain, under the command of field marshal Martin de Goiti who was aided by some foreign forces. This resulted in the arson and destruction of Manila.\nSpanish rule.\n A map of the province of Manila during Spanish rule\nAfter destroying Manila, the Spanish set up a settlement to secure territory on the same site on the Luzon island for the Spanish ruler. Initially enclosed in wood, much later in stone, a new walled city of Manila became the capital of the Spanish East Indies. After setting up a settlement and consolidating some territorial holdings outwards, the Spanish instituted a province known as Manila.\nLater on, the Manila galleon continually sailed the Pacific from end-to-end, bringing to Mexico Asian merchandise and cultural exchange.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Approximate locations of the towns of the province of Manila\nCaloocan \nLas Pi\u00f1as \nMalibay \nManila \nMariquina \nMontalban \nMuntinlupa \nNavotas \nNovaliches \nPara\u00f1aque \nPasig \nPateros \nPineda \nSan FelipeNeri \nSan Juandel Monte \nSan Mateo \nSan Pedro Macati \nTaguig \nTambobong \nBinondo \nDilao \nErmita \nMalate \nPandacan \nQuiapo \nSampaloc \nSan Miguel \nSanta Ana \nSanta Cruz \nTondo \nBulacan \nCavite \nLaguna \n\"Laguna de Bay\" \n\"Manila Bay\" \nMORONG DISTRICT \nOutside the Walled city of Manila has become the city's suburbs known as Extramuros (Outside the wall) made up of several pueblos, altogether making up the province known as Tondo which was established in January 1571 and would later on, be renamed as the province of Manila in 1859 with the city of Manila (Intramuros) as its capital.\nFirst Philippine Republic.\nIn the First Philippine Republic, the province included the walled city of Manila and 23 other municipalities. Mariquina also served as the provincial capital of Manila from 1898 to 1899. However, despite almost the entirety of the territory being occupied by Philippine forces, the walled city of Manila was occupied by Spanish forces.\nAmerican rule.\nCreation of the province of Rizal.\nDuring American rule, the province was dissolved and most of it was incorporated into the newly created province of Rizal on June 11, 1901, by Act No. 137. In the current territory of Metropolitan Manila, the towns of Caloocan, Las Pi\u00f1as, Mariquina (now Marikina), Pasig, Para\u00f1aque, Malabon, Navotas, San Juan del Monte (now San Juan), San Pedro de Macati (now Makati), San Felipe Neri (now Mandaluyong), Muntinlupa and the Taguig-Pateros area were designated to Rizal, with Pasig being the provincial capital. On the other hand, Polo (now Valenzuela) remained in Bulacan.\nManila in 1901 was composed of Binondo, Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, Manila, Pandacan, Quiapo, Sampaloc, San Fernando de Dilao, San Miguel, San Nicolas, Santa Ana de Sapa, Santa Cruz, and Tondo.\nIn the American rule, the American architect Daniel Burnham was commissioned to propose a Plan of Manila for the Philippine government. \nPhilippine Commonwealth.\nIn 1939, during the Philippine Commonwealth, President Manuel L. Quezon established Quezon City with the objective of replacing Manila as the capital city of the Philippines. A design for Quezon City was completed. The establishment of Quezon City meant the abandonment of Burnham's design for Manila, with funds being diverted for the establishment of the new capital\nJapanese invasion and Second Philippine Republic.\nCreation of the city of Greater Manila.\nIn 1942, during the World War II, President Manuel L. Quezon created the City of Greater Manila as an emergency measure, merging the cities of Manila and Quezon City, along with the municipalities of Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Para\u00f1aque, Pasay, and San Juan. Furthermore, Manila was divided into the districts of Bagumbuhay, Bagumpanahon, Bagumbayan, and Bagungdiwa, while Quezon City was divided into the districts of Diliman and Balintawak. Jorge B. Vargas was appointed as its first mayor. Mayors in the municipalities and heads in the city districts included in the City of Greater Manila served as district chiefs. This was to ensure that Vargas, who was Quezon's principal lieutenant for administrative matters, would have a position of authority recognized under international military law. The City of Greater Manila served as a model for the present-day Metro Manila and the administrative functions of the Governor of Metro Manila that was established during the Marcos administration. \nAfter World War II, in 1945, President Sergio Osme\u00f1a signed Executive Order No. 58, which dissolved the city of Greater Manila instituted by former President Quezon.\nThird Philippine Republic.\nCreation of the National Capital Region.\nWorld War II resulted in the loss of more than 100,000 lives in the battle of Manila in 1945. Most of the developments in Burnham's design were also destroyed. Later on, Quezon City was eventually declared as the national capital in 1948 and later expanded to the areas formerly under the jurisdiction of Caloocan, Marikina, and San Mateo, Rizal. \nReinstitution as Metropolitan Manila under martial law.\nOn February 27, 1975, a referendum was held wherein residents of Greater Manila approved granting President Ferdinand Marcos the authority to restructure the local governments into an integrated system like a manager-commission for under such terms and conditions as he may decide. On November 7, 1975, Metro Manila was formally established through Presidential Decree No. 824. The Metropolitan Manila Commission was also created to manage the region. On June 2, 1978, through Presidential Decree No. 1396, the metropolitan area was declared the National Capital Region of the Philippines. When Metro Manila was established, there were four cities, Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay and the thirteen municipalities of Las Pi\u00f1as, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Para\u00f1aque, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela. At present, all but one of these municipalities have become independent chartered cities; only Pateros still remains as a municipality.\nPresident Marcos appointed his wife, First Lady Imelda Marcos, as the first governor of Metro Manila in 1975, with her holding the position until 1986. As governor, she launched the City of Man campaign, with the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex, Metropolitan Folk Arts Theater, Philippine International Convention Center, Coconut Palace and healthcare facilities such as the Lung Center of the Philippines, Philippine Heart Center, and the Kidney Center of the Philippines all being constructed precisely for this purpose. \nThe capital of the Philippines was re-designated to Manila in 1976 through Presidential Decree No. 940. The decree states that Manila has always been, to the Filipino people and in the eyes of the world, the premier city of the Philippines, being the center of trade, commerce, education, and culture. While the then-newly formed region was designated as the seat of government.\nFourth Philippine Republic.\nPresident Marcos was overthrown in a non-violent revolution along EDSA, which lasted four days in late February 1986. The popular uprising, now known as the People Power Revolution, made international headlines as \"the revolution that surprised the world\".\nFifth Philippine Republic.\nIn 1986, President Corazon Aquino laid down the Executive Order No. 392, reorganizing and changing the structure of the Metropolitan Manila Commission and renamed it to the Metropolitan Manila Authority. Mayors in the metropolis chose from among themselves the chair of the agency. Later on, it was again reorganized in 1995 through Republic Act No. 7924, creating the present-day Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. The chairperson of the agency would be appointed by the President and should not have a concurrent elected position such as mayor. Elfren Cruz was the last to serve as the Officer-In-Charge governor of Metro Manila.\nThroughout 1988, unemployment among the country's regions was highest in Metro Manila, with 20.1% of the region's workforce being jobless according to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the National Statistics Office.\nIn 2014, then-MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino proposed that San Pedro, Laguna be included in Metro Manila as its 18th member city. Tolentino said that in the first meeting of the MMDA Council of mayors in January 2015, he would push for the inclusion of the city to the MMDA. Senator Aquilino \"Koko\" Pimentel III filed Senate Bill No. 3029, which seeks to create San Pedro as a separate legislative district to commence in the next national and local elections if the bill was passed into law.\nIn April 2022, Makati lost the territorial dispute with Taguig regarding the Fort Bonifacio Military Reservation, which was ruled with finality a year later in April 2023. The entire military reservation which includes Bonifacio Global City, and the ten Enlisted Men's Barrios (EMBO) barangays, were declared as part of Taguig. The ten EMBO barangays were reintegrated to Taguig in 2023.\nGeography.\nMetro Manila is located in the southwestern portion of Luzon. The region lies along the flat alluvial lands extending from the mouth of the Pasig River in the west to the higher rugged lands of Marikina Valley in the east. The region is geographically divided into 4 zones: the Coastal Margin, Guadalupe Plateau, Marikina Valley, and the Laguna Lowlands.\nThe Coastal Margin or Lowland is a flat and low plain that faces Manila Bay. Located here is Manila, Navotas, parts of Malabon, and the western part and reclaimed areas of Pasay and Para\u00f1aque, where the ground elevation ranges from zero meters on Manila Bay to at the west side of the cities of Mandaluyong and Makati. The Coastal Lowland possesses resources for offshore fisheries and fishpond development, and various reclamation projects in the area are meant for mixed-use urban development.\nThe Central or Guadalupe Plateau is the most adaptable to urban development activities not only because of its solid geographical foundations but also because of its existing infrastructure links with the rest of Luzon. It is mainly residential and includes the densely populated areas of Metro Manila such San Juan, Makati and Quezon City, as well as most parts of Caloocan and Mandaluyong. The ground elevation ranges from and gradually becomes lower towards its western side, while ground elevation ranges from towards the northwestern side of the plateau. The area becomes narrower along the Pasig River.\nThe Marikina Valley is a floodplain along the Marikina River and a delta along Laguna de Bay. Its elevation ranges from on the Laguna de Bay side to on its north side towards Montalban. It is surrounded by the Central Plateau and mountains of Rizal. It has fertile land suitable for crop cultivation while the Marikina River provides water for industrial uses and discharge.\nThe Laguna Lowlands is not only suitable for agriculture and aquaculture but also for industrial activity.\nNatural hazards.\nMetro Manila is exposed to multiple natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, and typhoons. It is surrounded by active faults including the Marikina Valley Fault System. Other distant faults such as the Philippine Faults, Lubang Faults, Manila Trench and Casiguran Faults, are a threat as well. Flooding is recurrent every year especially in low-lying areas of Valenzuela, Malabon, Caloocan, Navotas, Manila, Pasay, Para\u00f1aque, and Las Pi\u00f1as, where flood are generally linked with the tidal movements in Manila Bay. Meanwhile, Marikina, Pasig, Taguig, and Pateros are areas inland that are also prone to flooding. These areas are located along the Marikina Valley where there is poor soil drainage and a shallow water table due to being in proximity to Laguna Bay's shores. Flood risks are generally lower in cities along the Guadalupe Plateau, including Quezon City, San Juan, Makati, Mandaluyong and Muntinlupa, where volcanic rocks rise up to above sea level. Around five to seven typhoons hit Manila yearly. Manila was ranked as the second riskiest capital city after Tokyo to live in according to Swiss Re.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, there are two climates in Metro Manila. Most of the region has a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw) while the northeastern part of the region that lies on the foothills of Sierra Madre has a tropical monsoon climate. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means that temperatures are hot year-round, rarely going below 15\u00a0\u00b0C or above 39\u00a0\u00b0C. Temperature extremes have ranged from 14.4\u00a0\u00b0C on January 11, 1914, to 38.8\u00a0\u00b0C on April 27, 2024.\nHumidity levels are usually very high all year round. Manila has a distinct dry season from December through April, and a relatively lengthy wet season that covers the remaining period with slightly cooler temperatures. In the wet season, it rarely rains all day, but rainfall is very heavy during short periods. Typhoons usually occur from June to September.\nParks.\nThere are four national parks in Metro Manila. These are the Rizal Park, Paco Park, and Fort Santiago in the City of Manila and Quezon Memorial National Park in Quezon City. Rizal Park and Paco Park are managed by the National Parks and Development Committee (NPDC), while Fort Santiago is managed by the Intramuros Administration. A tripartite agreement between the Quezon City Government, the National Historical Institute and the NPDC transferred the management of Quezon Memorial National Park to the Quezon City Government. The region also has three protected areas, namely the Rizal Park, Ninoy Aquino Parks &amp; Wildlife Center and the Manila Bay Beach Resort.\nRizal Park, also known as Luneta Park, is considered the largest urban park in Asia with an area of . The park along with the historic walled area of Intramuros are designated as flagship destination to become a tourism enterprise zone according to the Tourism Act of 2009. Paco Park is a recreational garden which was once the city's municipal cemetery built by the Dominicans during the Spanish colonial period. Filipino Landscape architect IP Santos, the \"Father of Philippine Landscape Architecture\", was commissioned to do the design of converting the former cemetery into a park.\nManila Zoo is the oldest zoo in Asia, which was founded in 1959. It is the home to more than a thousand animals from 90 different species including the 40-year-old elephant, Mali. The zoo has an average of 4,000 visitors weekly. An estimated 40,000 tourists visit the zoo each month.\nLa Mesa Ecopark is a 33-hectare well-developed sanctuary around the La Mesa Watershed. It was established through a joint partnership between the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, ABS-CBN, and the Quezon City Government. La Mesa Ecopark, along with the Ninoy Aquino Parks &amp; Wildlife Center, are important nature reserves in the Philippines.\nThe Las Pi\u00f1as-Para\u00f1aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area (LPPCHEA) was declared as a critical habitat by the Government of the Philippines in 2007 and was listed by the Ramsar Convention as a Wetland of International Importance in 2013. LPPCHEA is composed of the Freedom Island in Para\u00f1aque and the Long Island in Las Pi\u00f1as that covers 175 hectares and features a mangrove forest of eight species, tidal mudflats, secluded ponds with fringing salt-tolerant vegetation, a coastal lagoon, and a beach.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe framework of government and governance in Metro Manila is based on Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the \"Local Government Code of 1991\". This law outlines the powers and responsibilities of all local government units (LGUS) in the Philippines and thus forms the basis of inter-local governmental relations among the area's constituent local governments. The local government code grants these units significant political and administrative autonomy in accordance with the principles of decentralization and devolution of power. This situation presents a challenge to the coordination of policy and service delivery across the multiple autonomous local government units and is thus the underlying dilemma of metropolitan governance in Metro Manila.\nThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is the agency responsible for the delivery of public services in Metro Manila. Its services are limited to traffic management and garbage collection. Previously Metro Manila was governed by a regional government authority, the Metro Manila Commission and was led by a governor.\nA bill was introduced in 2014 proposing the creation of a new governing body in Metro Manila to be known as the Metropolitan Manila Regional Administration (MMRA). Unlike the MMDA which is limited to being an administrative coordinating body, the proposed MMRA will have police and other typical municipal powers and is more akin to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.\nMetro Manila, the National Capital Region, is the seat of the national government. All the main offices of the executive departments of the country are in Metro Manila. The Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Agriculture, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, National Housing Authority and Philippine Coconut Authority has their main offices based around Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City.\nManila, the capital city of the country, is the home to Malaca\u00f1an Palace, the official residence and office of the President of the Philippines. The city is also the home to the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Other key national institutions based in Manila are the Court of Appeals, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the Departments of Budget and Management, Finance, Health, Justice, Labor and Employment and Public Works and Highways. Meanwhile, the Department of Science and Technology is based in Taguig while the Department of Tourism has its headquarters in Makati. Important economic and financial institutions headquartered in the region are the Asian Development Bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines and the National Economic and Development Authority.\nThe main office of the Government Service Insurance System in Pasay serves as home to the Senate of the Philippines. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives of the Philippines is based in the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City along with the Sandiganbayan. The Coconut Palace once served as the official office and residence of the Vice President of the Philippines in 2010\u20132016 and then the Quezon City Reception House for 2016-2022.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe political and administrative boundaries of the National Capital Region has not changed since its formation in 1975 as a public corporation under Presidential Decree No. 824. They are composed of sixteen independent cities, classified as \"highly urbanized cities\", and one independent municipality: Pateros.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDistricts.\nUnlike other administrative regions in the Philippines, Metro Manila is not composed of provinces. Instead, the region is divided into four geographic areas called \"districts\". The districts have their district centers at the four original cities in the region: the city-district of Manila (Capital District), Quezon City (Eastern Manila), Caloocan (Northern Manila, also informally known as \"Camanava\"), and Pasay (Southern Manila). The districts serve mainly to organize the region's local government units for fiscal and statistical purposes.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nFuture expansion.\nThere is a high demand for the inclusion of San Pedro, Laguna in Metro Manila. Support groups from the local government and non-government organizations are striving to incorporate San Pedro into Metro Manila. San Pedro was looked at as the 18th member of Metro Manila during former MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino's term. Tolentino pushed for the inclusion of San Pedro in the National Capital Region to become its 18th member city.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMetro Manila has a population of according to the 2024 national census. Its total urban area, composed of the urban agglomeration which refers to the continuous urban expansion of Metro Manila into the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Batangas has an estimated population of as of 2015. It is the second most populous (after Calabarzon) and most densely populated region in the Philippines, the 7th most populous metropolitan area in Asia, and the 6th most populous urban area in the world.\nAs of 2024, the most populous cities in Metro Manila are Quezon City (3,084,270), Manila (1,902,590), Caloocan (1,712,945), Taguig (1,308,085), Pasig (853,050), Valenzuela (725,173), Para\u00f1aque (703,245), Las Pi\u00f1as (615,549), Muntinlupa (552,225), and Marikina (471,323).\nPoverty, housing and urban slums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrom the 1980s up to the present, informal settlers (squatters) have accounted for roughly one-third of the Metro Manila population. A majority of informal settlers belong to the middle-class. In 2014, there are an estimated four million slum dwellers living in Metro Manila. Homelessness is also a major problem in Metro Manila. However, these are being addressed by creating in-city relocation housing, and by relocating informal settler families in low-density housing built in the nearby provinces of Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal.\nDuring the American occupation, housing policies in Manila dealt the problem of sanitation and concentration of settlers around business areas. Among those implemented were business codes and sanitation laws in slum areas in the 1930s. During this period and until the 1950s, new communities were opened for relocation. Among these were Projects 1\u20138 in Quezon City and the Vitas tenement houses in Tondo. The government implemented the Public Housing Policy in 1947 that established the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). A few years later, it put up the Slum Clearance Committee which, with the help of the PHHC, relocated thousands of families from Tondo and Quezon City to Sapang Palay in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan in the 1960s.\nDuring the time of President Ferdinand Marcos, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank supported the programs for the \"development of relocation\" and \"on-site development\". Carmona and Dasmari\u00f1as in Cavite and San Pedro in Laguna opened as relocation sites. Along with the establishment of the National Housing Authority (Philippines), Presidential Decree 772 made squatting a crime, making the Philippines one of only two countries (the other is South Africa) where squatting is a crime. The government formulated the National Shelter Program which became the over-all framework for dealing with housing needs of all income classes.\nImelda Marcos held both the position as Governor of Metro Manila and as Minister of Human Settlements and Ecology (MHSE) until the downfall of the dictatorship in 1986. The MHSE, through loans from the World Bank, initiated the Bagong Lipunan Improvement of Sites and Services (BLISS) housing projects not only in Metro Manila but also in other provinces.\nFrom 1960 to 1992, the government transferred some 328,000 families to resettlement sites from Metro Manila. According to the Asian Coalition on Housing Rights, during President Corazon C. Aquino's time, the government would bring some 100,000 persons to relocation sites yearly. During the said period, Sapang Palay and Carmona had a 60% abandonment rate. Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7279 or the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA) in 1992. The law gave a new name for the squatters: informal settlers. Essentially, UDHA gives protection for big private ownership of land in the urban areas, ensuring that these are protected from illegal occupants. The law also widened the scope of private sector participation in the National Shelter Program (NSP).\nIn the middle of the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, infrastructure projects of the government led to the demolition of hundreds of thousands of families (from along railways, C-4 Road, C-5 Road, and from Fort Bonifacio). During the same period, new relocation sites in Bulacan, Valenzuela and Caloocan opened.\nLanguages.\nThe primary mainstream spoken casual vernacular language is Tagalog (Filipino), which is taught in all schools across Metro Manila under Filipino class. The main formal medium of instruction used in schools and the main language (at least primarily in most written contexts) for commerce, industry, and government is English. Meanwhile, Spanish formerly moribund across Metro Manila, besides the rare few families who may privately use it and the Spanish taught in a few schools and universities as a foreign language elective. Among speakers of Hokkien may also occasionally be heard spoken amongst fellow speakers especially within households, schools, churches, temples, businesses who privately use it, while Mandarin (Standard Chinese) is taught in Chinese class in and as a foreign language elective in a few schools and universities. There are also the occasional speaker of other Philippine languages coming from the provinces working, studying, or living in Metro Manila, such as speakers of Cebuano Bisaya, Ilocano, Hiligaynon (Ilonggo), Central Bikolano, Chavacano, Kapampangan, Pangasinense, Waray, etc. There are also the rare that speaks Japanese, that speaks Korean, that speaks Farsi (Persian), that speaks Punjabi or etc. There are also a few Japanese schools teaching Japanese in Japanese class in Metro Manila, such as the Manila Japanese School and of course, a few schools and universities teaching it as a foreign language elective. Other languages also taught as foreign language electives in some universities and schools in Metro Manila besides those aforementioned are those such as, French, Korean, German, Italian, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Portuguese, Russian, etc. Besides Filipino, there are also other newspapers distributed across Metro Manila in languages such as Mandarin (i.e. United Daily News, World News, Chinese Commercial News, etc.), Japanese (i.e. Manila Shimbun), Korean (i.e. Manila Seoul, Weekly Manila, Ilyo Shinmun, etc.) to cater to the aforementioned readers.\nEconomy.\nThe National Capital Region accounts for 31.2% of the gross domestic product of the Philippines in 2024.

Furthermore, the region ranks 3rd for the top business process outsourcing global destinations, next to Bangalore and Mumbai. The region's retail sector remains strong, bolstered by remittances abroad, BPOs, and its tourism sector.\nHistorically, the main business district of the metropolis was Binondo, where commercial trading flourished since the 15th century. By the 1960s, economic activities shifted from Binondo to Makati. It transformed Makati into one of the leading financial centers in Asia. Still, Binondo remained as a cultural and financial center because of the vast Chinese population residing and doing business in the area.\nThe minimum wage of Metro Manila is at \u20b1 ($) per-day for non-agricultural workers and at \u20b1 ($) per-day for those working in the agricultural sector, the highest minimum wage among all the 17 regions of the country. However, an increase of \u20b125 was made and implemented in November 2018.\nNominal wages are what Metro Manila's current minimum wage rates are known as. The Philippine government has set these wage rates at a fixed amount. \nOn the other hand, the amount after inflation is what is considered the real minimum wage. For instance, the non-agricultural employees of NCR typically receive \u20b1428.23 ($) per day as opposed to \u20b1537 ($). The minimum salary for agricultural employees in Manila (including plantation and non-plantation workers) is \u20b1 ($) after accounting for inflation.\nCentral business districts.\nMetro Manila has many central business districts (CBD), which categorizes it under the multiple nuclei model in human geography terms.

The Bases and Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) privatized the property and its income from the sale was intended to be used for the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Upon its privatization, the place was transformed into a business hub featuring numerous tourist attractions such as The Mind Museum, high-end shops, towering office skyscrapers, and luxurious lofts and condominiums. Bonifacio Global City will soon overtake the Makati Central Business District as the premier financial center of the country in the future. One of the reasons for it is that the Philippine Stock Exchange relocated its headquarters in BGC. Also, it has more spaces and land for future developments. It is also the most active business district, generating over 50 percent of the growth in property market and has more available space for rent or lease and sale than Makati.\nOrtigas Center is a central business district located in Mandaluyong and Pasig, with a small portion of it located in Quezon City.

The Villamor Air Base in Ninoy Aquino International Airport is the home to the headquarters of the Philippine Air Force while the headquarters of the Philippine Navy is located at Roxas Boulevard, Malate, Manila.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard is headquartered at Port Area (Manila South Harbor), City of Manila. Its Coast Guard NCR District also has its headquarters in the city and has another Coast Guard Station in Pasig. It also has a base in Taguig and maintains several detachments located in Navotas, Para\u00f1aque, Tangos, Vitas, Manila North Harbor, Manila South Harbor and the Cultural Center of the Philippines.\nIn 2012, the AFP Joint Task Force-National Capital Region was launched to ensure peace and stability in Metro Manila, bearing the same function of the deactivated National Capital Regional Command, although it operates on a much smaller size than its predecessor.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nAccording to the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, public ridership in Metro Manila composes of the following: 46% of the people go around by jeepneys, 32% by private vehicle, 14% by bus, and 8% use the railway system. Transportation development in Metro Manila follows the Metro Manila Dream Plan, which consists of building short-term to long-term infrastructure lasting up to 2030 and addressing its issues on traffic, land use and environment.\nRoads and highways.\nThe roads of Metro Manila are built around the City of Manila. Roads are classified as local, national or subdivision roads. There are ten radial roads branching out from the city. Also there are five circumferential roads forming a series of concentric semi-circular arcs around Manila. The circumferential and radial roads are systems of interconnected roads, bridges and highways. A problem with the circumferential roads are the missing road links. These are the roads that are not yet constructed to give way for development due to Metro Manila's rapid urbanization. The metropolis is resolving this problem through the completion of missing road links or through the construction of connector roads.\nThe radial and circumferential road system are being supplanted by a new numbered highway system implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways, and new signage are being placed with its implementation. Expressways are being assigned numbers with the E prefix. National roads are assigned 1 to 3 digit numbers, except for those classified as tertiary national roads.\nAn important circumferential road is the Circumferential Road 4, with the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue as its major component. It traverses the cities of Pasay, Makati, Mandaluyong, Quezon City and Caloocan. Line 3 follows the alignment of EDSA, from Taft Avenue in Pasay up to TriNoma, terminating before it reaches Caloocan. Circumferential Road 5 serves the people near the regional limits of Metro Manila and also serves as an alternate route for Circumferential Road 4.\nProminent radial roads include the Radial Road 1, composed of Roxas Boulevard and the Manila\u2013Cavite Expressway (Coastal Road) that connects Metro Manila to Cavite, Radial Road 3 or the South Luzon Expressway that connects Metro Manila to Laguna, Radial Road 6, composed of Aurora Boulevard and Marcos Highway that runs up to Rizal and Radial Road 8 or the North Luzon Expressway that serves as the gateway to the north.\nThe Skyway serves as the region's main expressway, directly connecting the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway. It also enables access to Ninoy Aquino International Airport via the NAIA Expressway (NAIAX). The Skyway is the first fully grade-separated highway in the Philippines and one of the longest elevated highways in the world with a total length of approximately . Other expressways such as the Manila\u2013Cavite Expressway and Muntinlupa\u2013Cavite Expressway also connect Metro Manila to its surrounding areas.\nThe development of roads, highways and expressways are based on the Metro Manila Dream Plan. Ongoing projects in the dream plan include the rehabilitation of EDSA, CAVITEX\u2013C-5 Link, NLEX Connector, and the construction of the missing road links for the circumferential roads.\nRailway systems.\nRail transportation in the Greater Manila Area is a major part of the transportation system in Metro Manila and its surrounding areas. It consists of the Manila Light Rail Transit System, Manila Metro Rail Transit System, and the PNR Metro Commuter Line. As of 2021, the three systems and its four operational lines combined has 82 stations, covering a total of . The network makes up the majority of active railways in the country and bear the brunt of providing the metropolis with rail as a faster alternative mode of transport other than buses and jeepneys. However, these systems are currently insufficient for the rapidly expanding metropolis; to address this, new lines and line extensions are under construction, which will extend the system far out into neighboring regions.\nSeveral new railway projects are being undertaken by the national government and the private sector. These include the North\u2013South Commuter Railway, the Metro Manila Subway, and MRT Line 7, all of which are under construction. Line extensions such as the LRT Line 1 Cavite extension and the LRT Line 2 West extension are in the pipeline. The proposed MRT Line 4 was also planned. Other line extensions and railway lines are in the planning stage.\nAir.\nNinoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) is the only airport and the premier gateway in Metro Manila. It is the busiest airport in the Philippines. NAIA has four terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2 (which is exclusively used by Philippine Airlines), Terminal 3 (the newest and largest airport terminal in NAIA) and Terminal 4 (also known as the Manila Domestic passenger Terminal). The other airport that serves Metro Manila is Clark International Airport in Angeles City which is located away.\nBuses.\nBus franchises in the region are regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. The Premium Point-to-Point Bus Service is the express bus system that runs from its dispatch terminal in Fairview up to the central business districts along EDSA. It aims to cut travel time substantially and provide a faster, safer and more convenient bus service to commuters, who are usually caught at the heavy traffic across the metropolis. A second express bus link from SM North EDSA, Trinoma and SM Megamall to Makati opened in December 2015, and by January 2016 was the line on which, for the first time in nearly three decades, a double-decker bus traveled on EDSA, to the delight of motorists, followed by a third link, this time from Robinsons Galleria to the Ayala Center complex in February 2016 and a fourth in March linking the Ayala Center to the Alabang Town Center in Muntinlupa via the Metro Manila Skyway (and later to Ayala Malls South Park). As of the present express buses also link the Market Market mall and Circuit Makati to both the Nuvali residential township and the Pacita Village complex in San Pedro, both in Laguna, in services launched in 2014 and 2017, respectively (plus additional services to the UP Town Mall in Quezon City and SM Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal), while intercity express buses have been in operation since 2015 to alleviate traffic on EDSA. In 2018, additional services from the Makati CBD and from San Lorenzo Place up to Cavite debuted.\nMetro Manila has a bus rapid transit (BRT) system, particularly the EDSA Carousel. Another BRT system will traverse for from Commonwealth Avenue up to the Manila City Hall. The planned BRT system costs \u20b14.9\u00a0billion ($109.5\u00a0million) and will have a fleet of 300 buses and 32 stations.\nFerry.\nThe Pasig River Ferry Service run by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is the principal ferry shuttle system of Metro Manila. It traverses the Pasig River from Barangay Pinagbuhatan in Pasig to Plaza Mexico in Intramuros. Although it was referred to as a ferry, it is more akin to a water bus. It has 17 stations, but only 14 are operational. Another ferry route called the Manila-Bataan Ferry was launched on May 10, 2017, and traverses Manila Bay from the Bay Terminal at CCP Complex in Manila to Orion, Bataan. A new ferry route known as the Cavite-Manila Ferry Service that runs between Noveleta, Cavite and Intramuros was launched in January 2018.\nElectricity and water.\nMeralco is the sole electric distributor of Metro Manila. It generates its power from the National Power Corporation and other independent power producers in Luzon. The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) was responsible for the supply and delivery of potable water and the sewerage system in Metro Manila. It was privatized in 1997 and the region and its immediate surrounding areas were split into the east and west concession. The winning corporations provide the same function of MWSS.\nThe Maynilad Water Services took over the west zone, which is composed of Manila (excluding the southeastern part of the city), Caloocan, Las Pi\u00f1as, Malabon, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Para\u00f1aque, Pasay and Valenzuela. It also operates in some parts of Makati and Quezon City. Manila Water operates on the east zone, comprising the cities of Mandaluyong, Marikina, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan and Taguig. It also operates in large areas of Makati and Quezon City and the southeastern part of Manila, which was excluded from the west zone.\nFor garbage hauling, the region spent \u20b14.221\u00a0billion ($93.855\u00a0million) in 2013. Quezon City spent the most at \u20b1994.59\u00a0million ($22.115\u00a0million) while Pateros, the region's only municipality, spent the least money on garbage at \u20b19.478\u00a0million ($210,747).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also known as the Little Apocalypse because it includes the use of apocalyptic language, and it includes Jesus's warning to his followers that they will suffer tribulation and persecution before the ultimate triumph of the Kingdom of God. The Olivet discourse is the last of the Five Discourses of Matthew and occurs just before the narrative of Jesus's passion beginning with the anointing of Jesus.\nIn all three synoptic Gospels this episode includes the Parable of the Budding Fig Tree.\nIt is unclear whether the tribulation Jesus describes is a now past, present, or future event. Preterists believe the passage largely refers to events surrounding the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and as such is used to date the Gospel of Mark around the year 70. Futurists believe the prophecy is broken into different parts, and partly \u201crefers to events that are still yet to come\u201d.\nSetting.\nThe discourse is widely believed by scholars to contain material delivered on a variety of occasions.\nIn the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark, Jesus spoke this discourse to his disciples privately on the Mount of Olives, opposite Herod's Temple. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus taught over a period of time in the Temple and stayed at night on the Mount of Olives.\nBiblical narrative.\nAccording to the narrative of the synoptic Gospels, an anonymous disciple remarks on the greatness of Herod's Temple. Jesus responds that not one of those stones would remain intact in the building, and the whole thing would be reduced to rubble.\nThe disciples asked Jesus, \"When will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\" Jesus first warns them about things that would happen:\nThen Jesus identifies \"the beginnings of birth pains\":\nNext he described more birth pains which would lead to the coming Kingdom:\nJesus then warned the disciples about the abomination of desolation \"standing where it does not belong\".\nAfter Jesus described the \"abomination that causes desolation\", he warns that the people of Judea should flee to the mountains as a matter of such urgency that they shouldn't even return to get things from their homes. Jesus also warned that if it happened in winter or on the Sabbath fleeing would be even more difficult. Jesus described this as a time of \"Great Tribulation\" worse than anything that had gone before.\nJesus then states that immediately after the time of tribulation people would see a sign, \"the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken\".\nThe statements about the Sun and Moon turning dark sound quite apocalyptic, as it appears to be a quote from the Book of Isaiah. The description of the Sun, Moon and stars going dark is also used elsewhere in the Old Testament. Joel wrote that this would be a sign before the great and dreadful Day of the Lord. The Book of Revelation also mentions the Sun and Moon turning dark during the sixth seal of the seven seals, but the passage adds more detail than the previous verses mentioned.\nJesus states that after the time of tribulation and the sign of the Sun, Moon, and stars going dark the Son of Man would be seen arriving in the clouds with power and great glory. The Son of Man would be accompanied by the angels and at the trumpet call the angels would \"gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other\".()\nThose who subscribe to the doctrine of the \"rapture\" (a view popular in American Evangelicalism) find support in this verse, reading this as meaning that people would be gathered from Earth and taken \"to\" heaven. This directly relates to a quotation from the Book of Zechariah in which God (and the contents of heaven in general) will come to Earth and live among \"the elect\", who by necessity are gathered together for this purpose.\nImminence.\nIn the Olivet Discourse, Jesus was reported to have told his disciples,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Truly I tell you, this generation [greek: \"genea\"] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\"\nThere is considerable debate about the correct translation of the word \"genea\". The most common English translation is currently \"generation\", which seem to suggest that the author of the olivet discourse expected Jesus' second coming to be witnessed by Jesus' contemporaries. In most German Bibles however, \"genea\" is instead translated as \"family/lineage\" (). Likewise for Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (, and , respectively). The Danish linguist Iver Larsen argues that the word \"generation\" as it was used in the English King James Version of the Bible (1611) had a much wider meaning than it has today, and that the correct \"current\" translation of \"genea\" (in the specific context of the second coming story) should be \"kind of people.\" (specifically the \"good\" kind of people; the disciple's kind of people, who, like the words of Jesus, will endure through all the tribulations). In Psalm 14, the King James version clearly uses \"generation\" in this now outdated sense, when it declares that \"God is in the generation of the righteous.\" According to Larsen, the \"Oxford Universal Dictionary\" states that the latest attested use of \"genea\" in the sense of \"class, kind or set of persons\" took place in 1727. Larsen concludes that the meaning of \"generation\" in the English language has narrowed considerably since then.\nBible scholar Philip La Grange du Toit argues that \"genea\" is mostly used to describe a timeless and spiritual family/lineage of good or bad people in The New Testament, and that this is the case also for the second coming discourse in Matthew 24. In contrast to Larsen however, he argues that the word \"genea\" here denotes the \"bad\" kind of people,\" because Jesus had used the word in that pejorative sense in the preceding context (chapter 23.) He also lists the main competing translation alternatives, and some of the scholars that support the different views:\nIn the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul envisages that he and the Christians to whom he was writing would see the resurrection of the dead within their own lifetimes: \"For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. (ESV)\", though he would consider the possibility of his death prior to Jesus\u2019 return later in life. The Gospel of John however seems to downplay a rumor that one disciple (John) would live to see the second coming:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, 'If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?'\"\nChristian eschatology.\nThere are four quite different Christian eschatological views.\nPreterism is the belief that all of these predictions were fulfilled by the time Jerusalem fell in 70\u00a0CE. Preterism considers that most, if not all, prophecy has been fulfilled already, usually in relation to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70\u00a0CE.\nHistoricism considers that most prophecy has been or will be fulfilled during the present church age. It was the chief view of Protestants from the Reformation until the mid-19th century. Only among Seventh-day Adventists is historicism applied to current conservative Christian interpretation of Tribulation understanding.\nFuturism is the belief that the future Jesus predicted is the unfolding of events from trends that are already at work in contemporary human society.\nFuturism typically holds that all major unfulfilled prophecies will be fulfilled during a global time of catastrophe and war known as the Great Tribulation, in which many other prophecies will be fulfilled during or after the Millennium Reign of Jesus Christ. According to many futurists, many predictions are currently being fulfilled during the Church Age, in which lawlessness and apostasy are currently plaguing secular society. This is seen as a major sign of the approaching fulfillment of all other prophecies during the Tribulation. Within evangelical Christianity over the past 150 years, futurism has come to be the dominant view of prophecy. However, around the 1970s evangelical preterism\u2014the polar opposite of futurism\u2014was seen as a new challenge to the dominance of futurism, particularly within the Reformed tradition. Yet, futurism continues as the prevalent view for the time being.\nFuturists anticipate many coming events that will fulfill all eschatological prophecy: the seven-year period of tribulation, the Antichrist's global government the Battle of Armageddon, the Second Coming of Jesus, the millennial reign of Christ, the eternal state, and the two resurrections.\nIn his popular book, \"The Late Great Planet Earth, \"first published in 1970, evangelical Christian author Hal Lindsey argued that prophetical information in Matthew 24 indicates that the \"generation\" witnessing the \"rebirth of Israel\" is the same generation that will observe the fulfillment of the \"signs\" referred to in \u2014and that would be consummated by the second coming of Christ in approximately 1988. He dated it from the \"rebirth of Israel\" in 1948, and took a generation to be \"something like forty years.\" Lindsey later stretched his forty-year timetable to as long as one hundred years, writing that he was no longer certain that the terminal \"generation\" commenced with the rebirth of Israel.\nAnother detailed analysis, one written by evangelical pastor Ray Stedman, calls it the \"Olivet Prophecy: The most detailed prediction in the Bible\". According to Stedman: \"There are many predictive passages in both the Old and New Testaments, but none is clearer or more detailed than the message Jesus delivered from the Mount of Olives. This message was given during the turbulent events of the Lord's last week before the cross\".\nThe Idealist sees the prophecy as pertaining to the entirerty of the interadvental period rather than a specific event. Idealists see prophetic passages as being of great value in teaching truths about God to be applied to present life. Many idealists see the destruction of the temple as typological of the entire Church Age that will culminate in the Second Coming of Christ and the Judgment of the whole created order.\nWithin conservative, evangelical Christian thought, two opposite viewpoints of the Great Tribulation have been expressed in a debate between theologians Kenneth L. Gentry and Thomas Ice.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72346", "revid": "3492060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72346", "title": "Kohen", "text": "Hereditary priest in Judaism\nKohen (, ; pl. , ) is the Hebrew word for \"priest\", used in reference to the Aaronic priesthood, also called Aaronites or Aaronides. They are traditionally believed, and halakhically required, to be of direct patrilineal descent from the biblical Aaron (also \"Aharon\"), brother of Moses, and thus belong to the Tribe of Levi.\nDuring the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem (and previously the Tabernacle), \"kohanim\" performed the Temple sacrificial offerings, which were only permitted to be offered by them. Following its destruction, it seems that most of them joined the Synagogal Jewish movement before adopting gradually Rabbinic Judaism, other types of Judaism, Christianity or Islam. Today, \"kohanim\" retain a lesser though distinct status within Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism, including certain honors and restrictions.\nIn the Samaritan community, the kohanim have remained the primary religious leaders. Ethiopian Jewish religious leaders are called \"kahen,\" and do similar works to the kohanim.\nName.\nThe word \"kohen\" originally derives from a Semitic root common at least to the Central Semitic languages. In the ancient polytheistic religion of Phoenicia, the word for priest was \"khn\" (\ud802\udd0a\ud802\udd04\ud802\udd0d\u200e). The cognate Arabic word (\"k\u0101hin\") means \"priest\".\nThe noun \"kohen\" is used in the Bible to refer to priests, whether Jewish or pagan (such as the \"kohanim\" of Baal or Dagon), although Christian priests are referred to in modern Hebrew by the term \"komer\" (). \"Kohanim\" can also refer to the Jewish nation as a whole, as in , where the whole of Israel is addressed as a \"priestly kingdom (or: kingdom of priests) and a holy nation\".\nIn Targum Yonatan, interpretive translations of the word \"kohen\" include \"friend\", \"master\", and \"servant\". Other interpretations include \"minister\" (Mechilta to Parshah Jethro, Exodus 18:1\u201320:23).\nIndividuals and history.\nThe early books of the Bible mention several pagan priests, such as Potipherah, the other priests of Egypt, and Jethro.\nThe non-Jewish priest Melchitzedek, however, is described as worshipping the same God as Abraham. Later Jewish sources even discuss the possibility that Melchitzedek's family could have served as priests for the future Jewish nation, though in the end this did not happen.\nJewish priests are first mentioned in . Here God offered the entire Jewish people the opportunity to become a symbolic \"kingdom of priests and a holy nation\". More practically, though, in this chapter \"the priests who approach the Lord\" were warned to stay away from Mount Sinai during the revelation of the Ten Commandments. The identity of these priests is not specified. According to many later Jewish sources, the firstborn son in each family served as priests, starting in the period of the patriarchs.\nNevertheless, shortly after the Sinai revelation, Aaron and his sons were chosen to be the priests. The exclusive possession of the priesthood by Aaron's descendants was known as the priestly covenant. Many commentators assert that the firstborns lost their status due to their participation in the golden calf sin. A number of reasons have been suggested for why Aaron and his descendants were chosen instead:\nMoses, too, performed sacrificial services before the completion of Aaron's consecration, and arguably is once called a \"priest\" in the Bible, but his descendants were not priests.\nSince Aaron was a descendant of the Tribe of Levi, priests are sometimes included in the term Levites, by direct patrilineal descent. However, not all Levites are priests.\nDuring the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness and until the Holy Temple was built in Jerusalem, the priests performed their priestly service in the portable Tabernacle.\nAncient roles.\nLaws and duties.\nPriestly duties involved offering the Temple sacrifices, and delivering the Priestly Blessing. When the Temple existed, most sacrifices and offerings could only be conducted by priests. Non-priest Levites (i.e. those who descended from Levi but not from Aaron) performed a variety of other Temple roles, including ritual slaughter of sacrificial animals, song service by use of voice and musical instruments, and various tasks in assisting the priests in performing their service.\nThe kohanim were not granted any ancestral land to own. Instead, they were compensated for their service to the nation and in the Temple through the twenty-four kohanic gifts. Most of these gifts are related to Temple sacrifices, or else the agricultural produce of the Land of Israel (such as terumah). A notable gift which is given even in the Jewish diaspora is the five shekels of the \"pidyon haben\" ceremony.\nVestments.\nThe Torah provides for specific vestments to be worn by the priests when they are ministering in the Tabernacle: \"And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for dignity and for beauty\". These garments are described in , and . The high priest wore eight holy garments (\"bigdei kodesh\"). Of these, four were of the same type worn by all priests and four were unique to the high priest.\nThose vestments which were common to all priests were:\nThe vestments that were unique to the high priest were:\nIn addition to the above \"golden garments\", the high priest also had a set of white \"linen garments\" (\"bigdei ha-bad\") which he wore only for the Yom Kippur Temple service. The linen garments were only four in number, corresponding to the garments worn by all priests (undergarments, tunic, sash and turban), but made only of white linen, with no embroidery. They could be worn only once, new sets being made each year.\nA priest would serve barefoot in the Temple, and would immerse in a mikvah before vesting, and wash his hands and his feet before performing any sacred act. The Talmud teaches that priests were only fit to perform their duties when wearing their priestly vestments, and that the vestments achieve atonement for sin, just as sacrifices do.\nAccording to the Talmud, the wearing of the Priestly golden head plate atoned for the sin of arrogance on the part of the Children of Israel (B.Zevachim 88b) and she also symbolizes that the high priest bears the lack of all the offerings and gifts of the sons of Israel. And it must be constantly on his head for the good pleasure of God towards them ().\nTorah instruction.\nNumerous Biblical passages attest to the role of the priests in teaching Torah to the people and in issuing judgment. Later rabbinic statements elaborate on these roles. However, the priest's religious authority is not automatic: even a bastard who is a scholar takes precedence over an ignorant high priest.\nHigh Priest.\nIn every generation when the Temple was standing, one kohen would be singled out to perform the functions of the High Priest (Hebrew \"kohen gadol\"). His primary task was the Day of Atonement service. Another unique task of the high priest was the offering of a daily meal sacrifice; he also held the prerogative to supersede any priest and offer any offering he chose. Although the Torah retains a procedure to select a High Priest when needed, in the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem, there is no High Priest in Judaism today.\nTwenty-four kohanic divisions.\nAccording to , King David divided the priests into 24 priestly divisions (Heb. \u05de\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, \"mishmarot\"). Each division would perform the Temple service for one week in a 24-week cycle, with all divisions eligible to serve on holidays. According to the Talmud, this was an expansion of a previous division, by Moses, into 8 (or 16) divisions.\nFollowing the destruction of the Second Temple, and the displacement to the Galilee of the bulk of the remaining Jewish population after the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jewish tradition in the Talmud and poems from the period record that the descendants of each priestly watch established a separate residential seat in towns and villages of the Galilee, and maintained this residential pattern for at least several centuries in anticipation of the reconstruction of the Temple and reinstitution of the cycle of priestly courses. In subsequent years, there was a custom of publicly recalling every Shabbat in the synagogues the courses of the priests, a practice that reinforced the prestige of the priests' lineage. Following this destruction, it seems that most of them joined the Synagogal Jewish movement; before being gradually converted towards Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity.\nQualifications and disqualifications.\nAlthough kohanim may assume their duties once they reached physical maturity, the fraternity of kohanim generally would not allow young kohanim to begin service until they reached the age of twenty or thirty. There was no mandatory retirement age. Only when a kohen became physically infirm could he no longer serve.\nA kohen may become disqualified from performing his service for a host of reasons, including ritual impurity, prohibited marriages, and certain physical blemishes. The kohen is never permanently disqualified from service, but may return to his normal duties once the disqualification ceases.\nModern practice.\nSince the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Jewish priests have not performed sacrificial services. However, they have retained a formal and public ceremonial role in synagogue prayer services, along with certain unique religious duties and privileges. Following the First Jewish\u2013Roman War, the priestly class relocated to Galilee and various diaspora communities, with their new places of residence recorded in inscriptions from the period. Drawing on their knowledge of the Torah and Temple worship, they contributed to the development of synagogue liturgy and may have played a role in the preparation of biblical translations.\nThese special roles have been maintained in Orthodox Judaism, and sometimes in Conservative Judaism. Reform Judaism does not afford any special status or recognition to kohanim.\nSynagogue \"aliyah\".\nWhen the Torah reading is performed in synagogue, it is divided into a number of sections. Traditionally, a kohen (if one is present) is called for the first section (\"aliyah\"), a Levite for the second reading, and an \"Israelite\" (non-kohen, non-levite) for all succeeding portions. If no Levite is present, the kohen is called for the second aliyah as well. The Maftir portion may be given to someone from any of the three groups.\nPriestly blessing.\nThe kohanim participating in an Orthodox and some other styles of traditional Jewish prayer service also deliver the priestly blessing during the repetition of the Amidah prayer. They perform this service by standing and facing the crowd in the front of the congregation, with their arms held outwards and their hands and fingers in a specific formation, with a Jewish prayer shawl or Talit covering their heads and outstretched hands so that their fingers cannot be seen. Kohanim living in Israel and many Sephardic Jews living in areas outside Israel deliver the priestly blessing daily; Ashkenazi Jews living outside Israel deliver it only on major Jewish holidays.\nPidyon haben (redemption of the firstborn).\nOutside the synagogue, the kohen leads the \"pidyon haben\" ceremony. This redemption of the first born son is based on the Torah commandment, \"all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem\".\nMarital restrictions.\n prohibits marriage between a kohen and certain classes of women. According to rabbinic law, these classes include divorcees, non-Jews, converts (who were previously non-Jews), and women who have previously engaged in certain forbidden sexual relationships (even if involuntary, i. e., rape). If a kohen did have relations with any of these women, the offspring are described as \"profaned\" (male: \"challal\", female: \"challalah\"); their status is nearly identical to a normal Jew, while the \"challalah\" herself is one of the categories which a kohen may not marry.\nRape poses an especially poignant problem. The pain experienced by the families of kohanim who were required to divorce their wives as the result of the rapes accompanying the capture of Jerusalem is alluded to in this Mishnah:\nIf a woman were imprisoned by non-Jews concerning money affairs, she is permitted to her husband, but if for some capital offense, she is forbidden to her husband. If a town were overcome by besieging troops, all women of priestly stock found in it are ineligible [to be married to priests or to remain married to priests], but if they had witnesses, even a male or female slave, these may be believed. But no man may be believed for himself. Rabbi Zechariah ben Hakatsab said, \"By this Temple, her hand did not stir from my hand from the time the non-Jews entered Jerusalem until they went out.\" They said to him: No man may give evidence of himself.\nOrthodox Judaism recognizes these rules as still binding, and Orthodox rabbis will not perform a marriage between a kohen and a divorced woman. This is the attitude of the Israeli rabbinate, with the result that a kohen cannot legally marry a divorced or converted woman in the State of Israel. (However, if such a marriage were performed outside Israel, it would be recognized as a valid marriage by the Israeli state.)\nConservative Judaism has issued an emergency \"takanah\" (rabbinical edict) temporarily suspending the application of the rules in their entirety, on the grounds that the high intermarriage rate threatens the survival of Judaism, and, hence, that any marriage between Jews is welcomed. The \"takanah\" declares that the offspring of such marriages are to be regarded as kohanim.\nOther laws.\nTo this day, kohanim keep the prohibition () against becoming ritually impure through proximity to a corpse (within the same room, at a cemetery, and elsewhere), except when the deceased is his immediate family member. Some Jewish cemeteries have special facilities to permit kohanim to participate in funerals or visit graves without becoming impure.\nThe presumption of priestly descent is used to help identify kohanim.\nOther Jews are commanded to respect the priesthood in certain ways. One of these ways is that priests (and in their absence, occasionally Levites) are the first offered the opportunity to lead Birkat Hamazon. Unlike the general rule for aliyot, this offer - which is only a requirement according to some Rabbinic opinions - may be declined. There are other rules regarding the honoring of kohanim, even in the absence of the Temple, but generally these are waived (if they are even offered) by the kohen.\nBat kohen.\n\"Kohen\" is a status that traditionally refers to men, passed from father to son. However, a \"bat kohen\" (the daughter of a priest) holds a special status in the Hebrew Bible and rabbinical texts. She is entitled to a number of rights and is encouraged to abide by specified requirements, for example, entitlement to consume some of the priestly gifts, and an increased value for her ketubah.\nIn modern times, Orthodox and many Conservative rabbis maintain the position that only a man can act as a kohen, and that a daughter of a kohen is recognized as a \"bat kohen\" only in those limited ways that have been identified in the past. Accordingly, in Orthodox Judaism only men can perform the Priestly Blessing and receive the first \"aliyah\" during the public Torah reading.\nHowever, some Conservative rabbis give the kohen's daughter equal priestly status to a (male) kohen. As a result, some Conservative synagogues permit a kohen's daughter to perform the Priestly Blessing and the Pidyon HaBen ceremony, and to receive the first \"aliyah\" during the Torah reading.\nBecause most Reform and Reconstructionist temples have abolished traditional tribal distinctions, roles, and identities on grounds of egalitarianism, a special status for a \"bat kohen\" has very little significance in these movements.\nGenetics.\nSince the Y chromosome is inherited only from one's father (biological females have no Y chromosome), all direct male lineages share a common haplotype. Thus, if \"kohanim\" share a direct male lineage to Aaron, one would expect to see a high level of commonality among their Y chromosomes.\nSince 1997, a number of genetic studies have been done on this topic, using testing data from across sectors of the Jewish and non-Jewish populations. The results of these studies have been interpreted by various parties as either confirming or disproving the traditions of uniform descent.\nSurnames.\nAs both kohen status and (in many societies) last names are patrilineal, there is often a relationship between the two. But this is not always the case: although descendants of kohanim often bear surnames that reflect their genealogy, many families with the surname Cohen (or a variation) are not kohanim, nor even Jewish. Conversely, many kohanim do not have Cohen as a surname.\nNames often associated with kohanim include:\nIn contemporary Israel, \"Moshe Cohen\" is the equivalent of \"John Smith\" in English-speaking countries \u2013 i.e., proverbially the most common of names.\nOutside Judaism.\nAccording to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, either \"literal descendants of Aaron\", or worthy Melchizedek priesthood holders have the legal right to constitute the Presiding Bishopric under the authority of the First Presidency (). To date, all men who have served on the Presiding Bishopric have been Melchizedek priesthood holders, and none have been publicly identified as descendants of Aaron. See also Mormonism and Judaism.\nIn popular culture.\nThe positioning of the kohen's hands during the Priestly Blessing was Leonard Nimoy's inspiration for Mr. Spock's Vulcan salute in the . Nimoy, raised an Orthodox Jew (but not a kohen), used the salute when saying, \"Live long and prosper.\"\nThe Priestly Blessing was used by Leonard Cohen in his farewell blessing during \"Whither Thou Goest\", the closing song on his concerts. Leonard Cohen himself was from a kohen family. He also used the drawing of the Priestly Blessing as one of his logos.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 69,698, up from 67,531 at the 2010 census. Its county seat is Lake City. Columbia County comprises the Lake City, FL Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Gainesville-Lake City, FL Combined Statistical Area. Osceola National Forest is partially in Columbia County.\nHistory.\nAfter Florida became a territory of the United States in 1821, pioneer and immigrant settlers from the United States formed their own settlement adjacent to a Seminole village called Alligator Village, and called it Alligator. Following the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the residents of Alligator village relocated to the banks of Peace Creek in the newly established Seminole reservation, leaving Alligator Town on its own.\nWhen Columbia County was formed in 1832 from Duval and Alachua counties, Alligator Town was designated as the seat of the county government. It was renamed as Columbia, the poetic form for the United States. The county was developed for agriculture and the timber industry, with products such as turpentine, lumber, and plywood. From 1832 to 1839, the county seat was Newnansville, but that town and area were returned to Alachua County.\nIn November 1858 a railroad was completed connecting Jacksonville to Alligator, which opened the town to more commerce and passenger traffic. Alligator Town was incorporated and its name changed to Lake City in 1859; M. Whit Smith was elected as the town's first mayor. According to an urban legend, the name was changed because the mayor's wife Martha Jane, who had recently moved to the town, refused to hang her lace curtains in a town named Alligator.\nDuring the American Civil War, the railroad between Lake City and Jacksonville was used to send beef and salt to Confederate soldiers. In February 1864 Union troops under Truman Seymour advanced west from Jacksonville. His objective was to disrupt Confederate supplies, and obtain African-American recruits and supplies. Confederate General Joseph Finnegan assembled troops and called for reinforcements from P. G. T. Beauregard in response to the Union threat. On February 11, 1864, Finnegan's troops defeated a Union cavalry raid in Lake City. After the Union cavalry was repulsed, Finnegan moved his forces to Olustee Station about ten miles east of Lake City (in Baker County). The Confederate presence at Olustee Station was reinforced to prepare for the Union troops coming from Jacksonville.\nUnion forces engaged the Confederates at the Battle of Olustee on February 20, 1864, near the Olustee Station. It was the only major battle in Florida during the war. Union casualties were 1,861 men killed, wounded or missing; Confederate casualties were 946 killed, wounded or missing. The Confederate dead were buried in Lake City. In 1928 a memorial for the Battle of Olustee was established in downtown Lake City.\nLake City's first newspaper was published in 1874, called the \"Lake City Reporter\". Charles H. Thompson, an African American minister, represented Columbia County in the Florida House of Representatives and served as a county commissioner in 1874 and 1875. In 1876 the Bigelow Building was completed; it later was adapted for use as the City Hall. The first fire department was established in 1883 to complement the police department. In 1891 Lake City became the first city in Florida to have electric lights from a local power and light company.\nWhite violence rose against blacks in the late 19th century in a regionwide effort to establish and maintain white supremacy as Southern states disenfranchised most blacks and imposed Jim Crow. Whites lynched 20 African Americans in Columbia County from 1877 to 1950, mostly in the decades near the turn of the 20th century. It was tied with Polk County for the second-highest total of lynchings of any county in the state.\nAmong these murders was the mass lynching on May 21, 1911, of six black men who were taken from the jail by a white mob in Lake City. They were being held on charges of murdering one white sawmill worker and wounding another in Leon County, after whites had attacked them at a private house following an earlier altercation between two men. A group of a dozen white men, reportedly from Tallahassee, tricked the white youth guarding the jail by posing as officials and gained release of the suspects. They took the men outside town and shot them repeatedly to death.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. Osceola National Forest is partially within the county.\nColumbia County is coterminous with the Lake City, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area (\u03bcSA). The \u03bcSA was first defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in 2003. It was added to the Gainesville-Lake City, Florida Combined Statistical Area in 2020.\nAdjacent counties.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 69,698 people, 25,205 households, and 15,740 families residing in the county.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 56,513 people, 20,925 households, and 14,919 families residing in the county.

Lake City (Amtrak station) was Columbia County's only active railroad station until that point. Until 1971, Lake City was a stop on the Louisville and Nashville and Seaboard Coast Line's \"Gulf Wind\" (New Orleans - Jacksonville). The Seaboard Air Line operated this and another passenger train in each direction through Lake City until 1966 or 1967.

In 2020 the municipality of Deventer had a population of 100,913. The city is largely situated on the east bank of the river IJssel, but it also has a small part of its territory on the west bank. In 2005 the municipality of Bathmen (with a population of about 5,000 people) was merged with Deventer as part of a national effort to reduce bureaucracy in the country.\nDeventer is one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands. The place is mentioned in 9th-century sources from the Diocese of Utrecht. A charter from 877 AD mentions seven farmsteads in \"Daventre portu\" (the Deventer harbor). In 952 AD, Deventer is mentioned as a city in a gift certificate from King Otto I. After the place had acquired more and more rights and privileges over time, it received the municipal lands from Emperor Henry V in 1123. This is considered by historians to be the moment of Deventer obtaining the city rights by the inhabitants. The city has the oldest stone house, the oldest walking park and with the Athenaeum library also the oldest scientific library in the Netherlands.\nHistory.\nFoundation and development in the Middle Ages.\nDeventer was probably founded around 768 AD by the English missionary Lebuinus, who built a wooden church on the east bank of the river IJssel. In January 772 AD the sack and burning of this church by a Saxon expedition was the cause for the first punitive war waged by Charlemagne to the Saxons, in which, in retribution, the Irminsul (the Saxon sacred tree, probably near modern Paderborn) was destroyed. This was not the first human settlement at the location; between 1981 and 2006, remains of a late Roman Iron Age settlement (dated to c.300 AD) were excavated at Colmschate, 4\u00a0km east of the current city.\nThe village of Deventer, already important because of a trading road crossing the river IJssel, was looted and burnt down by the Vikings in 882. It was immediately rebuilt and fortified with an earthen wall (in the street \"Stenen Wal\" remains of this wall have been excavated and restored).\nDeventer received city rights in 956, after which fortifications were built or replaced by stone walls around the city for defense. Between 1000 and 1500, Deventer grew to be a flourishing trade city because of its harbour on the river IJssel, which was capable of accommodating large ships. The city eventually joined the Hanseatic League.\nOne of the commodities it traded in, dried haddock and cod from Norway, gave the citizens the nickname they carry to this day: \"Deventer Stokvis\". In the 15th century, Deventer had a common mint, where coins for the three IJssel cities Deventer, Zwolle, and Kampen were made.\nDeventer is the birthplace of Geert Groote and home to his Brethren of the Common Life, a school of religious thought that influenced Thomas a Kempis and Erasmus in later times. Together with Haarlem it was among the first cities to have printing presses, dating back to as early as 1477. From around 1300, it also housed a Latin School, which became internationally renowned, and remained in service in changing forms until 1971. Its most well-known student was the scholar Desiderius Erasmus, who was born in 1466 and attended the school from 1475 to 1484.\n16th\u201318th centuries.\nBetween 1500 and 1800, the volume of water flowing through the IJssel decreased, decreasing the importance of Deventer's harbour. The competition with trade centres in Holland, as well as the religious war between 1568 and 1648, brought a decline in the city's economy.\nIn the 18th century, the iron industry came to Deventer. East of the town, so-called \"oer\", river sand containing iron, was found as early as 900. From this material, ore was produced and brought to town. The main road of the villages Okkenbroek, Lettele and Schalkhaar is still named Oerdijk (Ore Dyke).\nModern times.\nIn the 19th century, Deventer became an industrial town. Bicycles (Burgers), carpets (Koninklijke Deventer Tapijtfabriek), tins and cans for food and drinks (Thomassen &amp; Drijver), cigars (Horst &amp; Maas en Bijdendijk &amp; Ten Hove), foundry and heavy machinery (Nering B\u00f6gel), and textiles (Ankersmit) were produced until the mid to late 20th century. Some of these industries are still thriving today, such as beds and accessories (Auping) and publishing (Wolters Kluwer, now headquartered in Alphen aan den Rijn).\nThe city's trade and industry are still of some importance. The city is host to a factory producing central heating systems, as well as Wolters Kluwer, a global information services and publishing company.\nThe Deventer honey cake (Bussink Deventer Koek), produced in Deventer for over 500 years, is still manufactured locally and sold all over the Netherlands and beyond.\nWorld War II.\nDeventer has seen few military engagements throughout its long history, although it was a garrison city of the Dutch cavalry. The IJssel bridge area and harbour were bombed heavily during World War II. The city centre has been largely spared, but many Allied bombs, meant to shell the IJssel railway bridge, came down on buildings in the city centre. The Deventer railway bridge was considered strategically important, being a part of the main railway connection between Amsterdam and the German city of Osnabr\u00fcck, leading from there to either Berlin, Hamburg or Bremen. The railway bridge, constructed of steel, was difficult to hit. Many bombs were bounced down into the river or its banks, exploding in the areas around the bridge or failing to explode at all. The three heaviest of about 15 attacks were on October 28, 1944 causing 35 fatalities; on December 15, 1944 killing 33 people; and on February 6, 1945 causing the death of 61 people. In the aftermath of this last bombardment, the German occupying forces committed a war crime. The German army used a cool warehouse in Deventer for its military food supplies. In the city centre, the retirement home of the \"United Foundations\", originally dating back as far as the 13th century, caught fire by the shellings, as well as the army food warehouse. The Germans allowed local fire fighters only to extinguish the fire in the cool warehouse. The retirement home burnt down as good as totally. Over twenty of the elderly living there perished in the flames.\nThe Jewish poet and writer Etty Hillesum lived in Deventer during the war before being deported to Auschwitz.\nIn Schalkhaar, a village only 2\u00a0km northeast of the city centre, barracks were used by the German occupying forces to train Nazi policemen. The compound is now a centre for asylum seekers.\nIn a forested area between Lettele and Okkenbroek, about 10 kilometres east of Deventer, the Germans operated a V-1 flying bomb launching ramp. It was used from December, 1944, until March, 1945. Some of the 400 V-1 missiles launched there hit already liberated Belgium, including the city of Antwerp, killing many people. A war monument in the village of Lettele consists of concrete blocks from this launching site, that is a war monument itself as well.\nDeventer has been somewhat popular with the film industry. During the production of the 1977 film \"A Bridge Too Far\", all of the scenes taking place in nearby Arnhem were filmed in Deventer - as Arnhem itself had lost its historic centre.\nBy the end of the 1950s, the buildings had reached the boundaries of the municipality. In 1960, for further expansion, the part of the municipality of Diepenveen was annexed that now covers the Keizerslanden, Borgele and Platvoet districts, all three realized in the 1960s; all together roughly the area up to (west of) the Zandwetering.\nAfter a plan to expand the city across the IJssel, the so-called Double City Plan, was deemed unfeasible at the end of the 1960s, Deventer turned its attention to the east again: in 1974 part of Diepenveen was once again annexed. On January 1, 1999, the municipality of Diepenveen was dissolved and added to Deventer. The same happened with the municipality of Bathmen on 1 January 2005.\nDemographics.\nDeventer has 101.378 Inhabitants on 1 July 2021. \nGeography.\nAssociated hamlets at second level\nThe population centres in the municipality are:\nClimate.\nDeventer is in the northern hemisphere. Summer here starts at the end of June and ends in September. Deventer experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfb\") similar to almost all of the Netherlands.\nWater.\nThe Deventer settlement was founded on a river dune on the IJssel. This river has played a major role for the city over the centuries, because of the trade that this waterway brought with it. In 1241 the city had received the Katentol on long lease from the Elten stift. This toll, which is named after the Katerveer under Zwolle, had to be paid in the Deventer toll house near the Zandpoort, and generated a lot of money in the Middle Ages.\nThe IJssel has also caused many problems over the centuries, because it often overflowed its banks. Nowadays Deventer has a flood defence, but the Welle ('wal', the name of the street over the quay) is still regularly under water during high water. Dike breaches of the IJssel have created many gullies in and around the city , such as the Douwelerkolk and the Klinkenbeltskolk.\nIn addition to the IJssel, Deventer has a number of smaller rivers. The Schipbeek is a stream partly dug on behalf of the city that rises in Germany and flows into the IJssel near Deventer. In the past, the stream was navigable, so that wood and Bentheimer sandstone could be brought in, among other things. Another waterway that was built for shipping and which flows into the IJssel in Deventer is a branch of the Overijssels canal, through which Deventer was connected to a large system of canals through Overijssel. It was dug in the mid-19th century and opened in 1858.\nCulture.\nSports.\nDeventer is the home of professional Football club Go Ahead Eagles, who are housed in stadium De Adelaarshorst. De Adelaarshorst is situated in a 1930s neighbourhood and one of the oldest stadiums still in use today. The club was founded in 1902 as Be Quick, although the name was soon changed to Go Ahead at the request of the Dutch Football Association. The suffix Eagles was added in 1971, following a suggestion from the then coach, Barry Hughes. Go Ahead Eagles has been the club of Marc Overmars, Paul Bosvelt, and Bert van Marwijk, whilst providing Henk ten Cate and Leo Beenhakker with their first experience of management.\nThe 1992 founded skating rink De Scheg, which is semi-indoor since 2011, is in the top 10 of fastest skating tracks of the Netherlands. It has been the training accommodation of skaters including Olympic champion Mark Tuitert and the retired former world champion sprint Erben Wennemars.\nDeventer also houses a number of watersports clubs, due to its situation on the banks of the river IJssel.\nGovernment.\nCity council.\nIn the redivision elections of November 17, 2004, a municipal executive was elected for the period 2005-2010. This municipal election was earlier than in the rest of the Netherlands, because the municipality of Deventer was merged with the then municipality of Bathmen. The March 2006 elections were therefore skipped.\nAn issue that has occupied the municipal council and public opinion in Deventer since 2006 was the housing of municipal officials and public services in a (new) municipal office adjacent to the old town hall of Deventer. In 2009, the college fell over it. At the end of January 2012, the Municipal Executive approved an adapted design for the new city office by architect Michiel Riedijk. However, a 'popular poll' by telephone two weeks later would have shown that only 13% of the population of Deventer supported the plans. On March 21 that year, a large majority of the city council voted in favor of the municipal office. In October 2013, the Council of State ruled positive about the arrival of the municipal office, after objections were raised. On December 6 of that year, the official opening act for construction was performed. In December 2015, the complex was completed and municipal staff moved in. In November 2017, the architect received the Abe Bonnema Prize for the design.\nEducation.\nDeventer is also home to one of the three campuses of Saxion University of Applied Sciences (\"Saxion Hogeschool\"), a polytechnical school offering internationally recognized Bachelor's degrees and Master's degrees in a wide range of fields, including engineering, economics, social work, investigations and health care. The other campuses are located in Enschede and Apeldoorn.\nIn 1912 the Secondary Colonial Agricultural School was founded, which grew out of the National Agricultural School Wageningen. After decolonization took effect, the name was changed into Tropical Agricultural School. In 1957 the school was transformed into the National Higher School for Tropical Agriculture. After a merger with study programs from Boskoop, Wageningen and Velp, it became the International Agricultural College Larenstein. The school was located at the Ceintuurbaan/Brinkgreverweg intersection. The building was given a residential destination in 2018.\nTransport.\nRail.\nSince 1989, Deventer has two train stations, Deventer railway station and Deventer Colmschate station. Previously, Deventer has known several so-called stopping points. Most of them closed around 1920. In addition to the current rail connections from Deventer train station, over the Arnhem\u2013Leeuwarden railway, Apeldoorn\u2013Deventer railway, and Deventer\u2013Almelo railway lines, a train connection existed from 1910 to 1935 on the Deventer\u2013Ommen railway line. This was operated by the Overijsselsche Lokaalspoorweg-Maatschappij Deventer - Ommen (OLDO), but had to stop the train service due to competition from the bus.\nPublic transport.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Deventer was connected to the extensive tram network of the Achterhoek. The tram line between Deventer and Borculo was operated from 1885 to 1944 by the Geldersch-Overijsselsche Stoomtram Maatschappij (GOSM) and its successors. Another tram company, the \"Tramweg Maatschappij Zutphen-Emmerik\", operated the tram line between Deventer and Zutphen. The tram station of Deventer stood on the Pothoofd. It was not combined with Deventer train station because the trams were too heavy to drive over two intermediate bridges. It seemed unprofitable for the tram company to reinforce two bridges, so they used the Pothoofd as a terminal station. After the Second World War, the tram lines were dismantled.\nSince the end of 2020, bus transport has been provided by Keolis Nederland under the name \"RRReis\", with the exception of the lines from the Achterhoek, which are provided by Arriva.\nInternational relations.\nDeventer is twinned with four cities:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 33,976. Its county seat is Arcadia. DeSoto County comprises the Arcadia, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the North Port-Bradenton, Florida Combined Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nPrior to the arrival of the Spanish, what is now DeSoto County was within the territory of the Native American Calusa tribe.\nIn 1513, Ponce De Leon sailed into present-day Charlotte Harbor near the mouth of the Peace River to put in for repairs and maintenance on his ships. While there the Spanish encountered Calusa and soon after an argument broke out and several died on both sides. Then the Spanish kidnapped several Calusa and departed Charlotte Harbor and sailed S.W. away from the west coast of Florida. This occurred within the original boundaries of DeSoto County.\nIn 1521, Ponce De Leon attempted to establish a colony at or near Charlotte Harbor but again was turned away by the Calusa who wounded him. Shortly after, he died and was buried in Puerto Rico.\nIn 1528 the Spanish Conquistadors Panfilo De Narvaez and Cabeza De Vaca came to present-day Arcadia where they captured several Calusa Indians who told them of great quantities of gold located to the north and offered to guide them there.\nIn 1539 the Spanish Explorer Hernando DeSoto, for whom the county is named, anchored in Charlotte Harbor and set about to explore the region with mixed results. Eventually, he made his way up the coast to present-day Manatee County and went inland from there.\nWhile Florida was claimed by Spain the moment it was discovered, the territory of La Florida was not formalized until 1565 with the founding of St. Augustine. At that point, what is now DeSoto County became part of La Florida. In 1763, the region became part of East Florida under British Rule. In 1783, East Florida was returned to Spain at which point today's DeSoto county was once again Spanish territory. In 1821 it became U.S. Territory.\nIn 1841 Camp Ogden, later Fort Ogden was built as a staging area for the U.S. Army during the 2nd Seminole War, in the southwestern part of present-day DeSoto County.\nIn 1870, the Joshua Creek Church and neighboring cemetery was founded.\nIn the 1870s John W. Whidden, a Confederate veteran and former Manatee county clerk, settled along the Joshua Creek where he founded a cattle ranch raising thousands of head of cattle. Also in the 1870s, Union veteran Robert C. Hendry took up cattle ranching on the Joshua Creek in the now-defunct settlement of Davidson.\nIn 1876 the Fort Ogden Post Office was founded and remains the oldest post office in the county.\nDeSoto County was created in 1887 from Manatee County.

As of the 2020 census, its population was 995,567, making it the sixth-most populous county in Florida. Its county seat is Jacksonville, with which the Duval County government has been consolidated since 1968. Duval County was established in 1822 and is named for William Pope Duval, Governor of Florida Territory from 1822 to 1834. Duval County is the central county of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nThe area was settled by varying cultures of indigenous peoples for thousands of years before European contact. Within the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in Jacksonville, archeologists excavated remains of some of the oldest pottery in the United States, dating to 2500 BCE. Prior to European contact, the area was inhabited by the Mocama, a Timucuan-speaking group who lived throughout the coastal areas of northern Florida. At the time Europeans arrived, much of what is now Duval County was controlled by the Saturiwa, one of the region's most powerful tribes. The area that became Duval County was home to the 16th-century French colony of Fort Caroline and saw increased European settlement in the 18th century with the establishment of Cowford, later renamed Jacksonville.\nDuval County was created in 1822 from St. Johns County. It was named for William Pope Duval, Governor of Florida Territory from 1822 to 1834. When Duval County was created, it covered a massive area, from the Suwannee River on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east, north of a line from the mouth of the Suwannee River to Jacksonville on the St. Johns River. Alachua and Nassau counties were created out of parts of Duval County in 1824. Clay County was created from part of Duval County in 1858. Part of St. Johns County south and east of the lower reaches of the St. Johns River was transferred to Duval County in the 1840s.\nGovernment.\nOn October 1, 1968, the government of Duval County was consolidated with the government of the city of Jacksonville. The Duval County cities of Atlantic Beach, Jacksonville Beach, and Neptune Beach, and the town of Baldwin are not included in the corporate limits of Jacksonville and maintain their own municipal governments. The city of Jacksonville provides all services that a county government would normally provide. The Mayor of Jacksonville serves as the chief administrator over all of Duval County.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (17.0%) is water.

The county has only supported a Democrat for president three times since 1952, in 1960, 1976, and 2020.\nHowever, the Republican edge in Duval has lessened somewhat in recent years. It swung from a 16-point win for George W. Bush in 2004 to only a three-point win for John McCain in 2008. Mitt Romney won an equally narrow margin in 2012 and in 2016, Donald Trump only won the county by fewer than 6,000 votes even as he narrowly carried Florida. In 2020, Joe Biden, despite losing statewide, broke the 44-year Democratic drought in Duval County, winning by less than four points. In 2024, the county reverted back to the GOP and Trump won it by less than 2 points.\nIn 2018, Andrew Gillum, despite losing the election, won Duval by four points, the first time a Democrat had won the county in a gubernatorial election since Steve Pajcic's losing bid in 1986. Four years later, however, Duval rebounded to vote for Ron DeSantis by over 10 points. In the Senate elections, Bill Nelson only failed to carry the county in his first bid in 2000, and Lawton Chiles and Bob Graham carried the county in all three of their respective bids. In 2022, Ron DeSantis won the county in his reelection bid by 12 points.\nEducation.\nDuval County Public Schools operates public schools in the county.\nDuval County is served by the Jacksonville Public Library.\nTransportation.\nPublic transportation.\nPublic transportation is provided by the Jacksonville Transportation Authority.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Light double lines in perimeter walls indicate glazed windows. Dashed lines show the ribs of the vaulting overhead. By convention, ecclesiastical floorplans are shown map-fashion, with north to the top and the liturgical east end to the right.\nMany abbey churches have floorplans that are comparable to cathedrals, though sometimes with more emphasis on the sanctuary and choir spaces that are reserved for the religious community. Smaller churches are similarly planned, with simplifications.\nDesign.\nCathedral floorplans are designed to provide for the liturgical rites of the church. Before the legalization of Christianity by Emperor Constantine, Christians worshiped in private homes or in secretive locations. Once legally able to publicly worship, the local congregations adapted the available Roman designs to their needs. Unlike the Roman and Greek religions, where priests performed rituals without public participation, Christian worship involved the believers. Thus, the limited spaces typically used in pagan temples were not suitable to Christian worship.\nRoman civic buildings were designed for the participation of the citizens of the city, and thus the Roman Basilica was adopted for Christian purposes. This included an entry on one end of a long narrow, covered space with a raised dais at the other end. Upon the dais, public officials would hear legal cases, or expound on some matter of public interest.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 321,905. The county seat and largest city is Pensacola. Escambia County is included within the Pensacola Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county population has steadily increased as the City of Pensacola and its surrounding bedroom communities continue to grow with residential and commercial development. The county is part of the Northwest Florida region of the state.\nHistory.\nThe area had been inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous peoples of varying cultures. Historic American Indian tribes at the time of European-American settlement were the Pensacola and Muscogee, known among the English as the Creek.\nEscambia County had been part of Spanish colonial settlement before the United States acquired it in 1818. The county was organized by European-Americans on July 21, 1821; it was named for the Escambia River. The name \"Escambia\" may have been derived from the Creek name \"Shambia\", meaning \"clear water\", or the Choctaw word for \"cane-brake\" or \"reed-brake\". The Choctaw were another major tribe in the Southeast.\nCreated on the same date, Escambia and St. Johns Counties were Florida's two original counties, covering the entire territory within modern state boundaries. The Suwannee River was the border between them, following a winding path from the northern border of the state to the Gulf of Mexico. Essentially, the Escambia county government had jurisdiction over the \"panhandle\" and \"big bend\" areas, and St. Johns over the remainder of the entire state.\nAs population increased in the frontier territory, 21 counties were later organized from Escambia county directly or indirectly. They include Jackson (1821), Gadsden (created from Jackson)(1823), Leon (1824), Walton (1824), Washington (created from Jackson and Walton)(1825), Hamilton (1827), Jefferson (1827), Madison (created from Jefferson) (1827), Franklin (1832), Calhoun (1838), Santa Rosa (1842), Wakulla (created from Leon) (1843), Holmes (created from Jackson and Walton) (1848), Liberty (created from Gadsden) (1855), Lafayette and Taylor (created from Madison) (1856), Bay (created from Washington) (1913), Okaloosa (created from Santa Rosa and Walton) (1915), Dixie (created from Lafayette) (1921), and Gulf (created from Calhoun) (1925).

The sheriff of Escambia County is Chip Simmons, elected in 2020.\nThe fire protection arm of the Escambia County is the Escambia County Fire Rescue (Florida).\nBoard of County Commissioners.\nEscambia County is divided into five districts. One county commissioner is elected from each district to serve a four-year term. Commissioners are chosen in partisan elections by voters from the districts in which they live. The board appoints a county administrator to be chief administrative officer of the county, responsible to the commission for the orderly operations of matters within the board's jurisdiction. The current office holders are,\nCounty jail.\nIn 2011, the US Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division issued a letter detailing the results of its investigation into conditions at Escambia County Jail, which houses roughly 1,300 prisoners. The department found that, although Sheriff David Morgan had recently implemented a series of reforms, conditions at the jail still routinely violated prisoners' constitutional rights.\nSpecifically, the department concluded that known systemic deficiencies, stemming mainly from staffing shortages, subjected prisoners to excessive risk of assault by other prisoners and to inadequate mental health care. Additionally, the department found that, until recently, the jail had an informal policy and practice of segregating its housing units, reserving one for African-American prisoners. According to the Department of Justice, this race-based segregation stigmatized and discriminated against many of the prisoners, and aggravated racial tensions in the jail. Between April 2012 and March 2013, the prison recorded 176 inmate-on-inmate assaults, including 20 serious head wounds.\nThe investigation released a letter of findings:\nThe Department of Justice concluded from these facts that Escambia County Jail's practices violated the fourteenth amendment's due process protections for pre-trial detainees, as well as the eighth amendment's protections for those convicted of a criminal offense. Jail officials must refrain from showing deliberate indifference to conditions of confinement posing an excessive risk of harm to prisoners.\nRoy L. Austin Jr., deputy assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, commended Sheriff Morgan for his willingness to remedy problems identified during the course of the investigation. The department conducted this investigation under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) to enforce constitutional mandates. The department's investigation was broad-based.\nThe investigation was conducted by Special Litigation Counsel Avner Shapiro and Senior Trial Attorney David Deutsch of the Civil Rights Division's Special Litigation Section. The findings letter is available on the department's website.\nCommunities.\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther unincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics.\nVoter registration.\nAccording to the secretary of state's office, Republicans constitute a plurality of registered voters in Escambia County.\nStatewide elections.\nEscambia County is very conservative for an urban county. Before 1994, the area traditionally voted Democratic in local elections and sent Democrats to the U.S. House of Representatives and the state legislature, like most of the Western Panhandle. This was particularly the case in the decades of the 20th century when most African Americans were disenfranchised by the state constitution until the federal Voting Rights Act passed.\nIn 1994 incumbent representative Earl Hutto declined to run for reelection. That year, Republican Joe Scarborough was elected to the House of Representatives.\nVoters of the county have not supported a Democratic presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy in 1960. In 1964, a majority of the county's voters supported Republican nominee Barry Goldwater. In 1968, third-party candidate George Wallace won Escambia County with 54% of the vote. In 1972, Republican Richard Nixon received 80% of the vote. Since 1972, Republican nominees in every presidential election have won an absolute majority in Escambia County, but in recent years, the Democratic Party has increased its share of the presidential vote. In 2020, Joe Biden was the first Democratic presidential nominee to win over 40% of the county's vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Growth in the Pensacola suburbs as well as the sizable black population has made Escambia County the least Republican-leaning of the Western Panhandle counties. In the 2025 1st district special election Gay Valimont won it by 3 points.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources incorporated into this article.\n\u00a0This article incorporates public domain material from \n\u00a0This article incorporates public domain material from "}

It was the first face-to-face agreement between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nNegotiations concerning the agreement, an outgrowth of the Madrid Conference of 1991, were conducted secretly in Oslo, Norway, hosted by the Fafo institute, and completed on 20 August 1993; the Oslo Accords were subsequently officially signed at a public ceremony in Washington, D.C., on 13 September 1993, in the presence of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The documents themselves were signed by Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO, foreign Minister Shimon Peres for Israel, U.S.\u00a0Secretary of State Warren Christopher for the United States and foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev for Russia.\nThe Accord provided for the creation of a Palestinian interim self-government, the Palestinian National Authority\u00a0(PNA). The Palestinian Authority would have responsibility for the administration of the territory under its control. The Accords also called for the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces\u00a0(IDF) from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.\nIt was anticipated that this arrangement would last for a five-year interim period during which a permanent agreement would be negotiated (beginning no later than May 1996). Remaining issues such as the status of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, security and borders would be part of the \"permanent status negotiations\" during this period.\nIn August 1993, the delegations had reached an agreement, which was signed in secrecy by Peres while visiting Oslo. In the Letters of Mutual Recognition, the PLO acknowledged the State of Israel and pledged to reject violence, and Israel recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and as partner in negotiations. Yasser Arafat was allowed to return to the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In 1995, the Oslo I Accord was followed by Oslo II.\nPrinciples of the Accords.\nIn essence, the accords called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, and affirmed a Palestinian right of self-government within those areas through the creation of a Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority. Palestinian rule was to last for a five-year interim period during which \"permanent status negotiations\" would commence in order to reach a final agreement.\nThe negotiations would cover major issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, and security and borders were to be decided at these permanent status negotiations (Article\u00a0V). Israel was to grant interim self-government to the Palestinians in phases.\nAlong with the principles, the two groups signed Letters of Mutual Recognition\u2014the Israeli government recognized the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, while the PLO recognized the right of the state of Israel to exist and renounced terrorism as well as other violence, and its desire for the destruction of the Israeli state.\nThe aim of Israeli\u2013Palestinian negotiations was to establish a Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority, an elected Council, for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, for a transitional period not exceeding five years, leading to a permanent settlement based on UN\u00a0Security Council Resolutions\u00a0242 and 338, an integral part of the whole peace process.\nIn order that the Palestinians govern themselves according to democratic principles, free and general political elections would be held for the council.\nJurisdiction of the Palestinian Council would cover the West Bank and Gaza Strip, except for issues that would be finalized in the permanent status negotiations. The two sides viewed the West Bank and Gaza as a single territorial unit.\nThe permanent status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians would start \"not later than the beginning of the third year of the interim period\"; the interim period would \"begin upon the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area\". That withdrawal began with the signing of the Gaza\u2013Jericho Agreement on 4 May 1994, thus the interim period would end on 4 May 1999.\nThe five-year transitional period would commence with Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. There would be a transfer of authority from the Israel Defense Forces to the authorized Palestinians, concerning education and culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation, and tourism. The council would establish a strong police force, while Israel would continue to carry the responsibility for defending against external threats.\nAn Israeli\u2013Palestinian Economic Cooperation Committee would be established in order to develop and implement in a cooperative manner the programs identified in the protocols.\nThe Declaration of Principles would enter into force one month after its signing. All protocols annexed to the Declaration of Principles and the Agreed Minutes pertaining to it were to be regarded as a part of it.\nContent of the Oslo I Accord.\nMain articles.\nThe Oslo I Accord contains 17 articles.\nAnnexes.\nThe Oslo I Accord contains four annexes:\nAnnex 1: Conditions of Palestinian Elections.\nThis annex covered election agreements, a system of elections, rules and regulations regarding election campaigns, including agreed arrangements for the organizing of mass media, and the possibility of licensing a TV\u00a0station.\nAnnex 2: Withdrawal of Israeli forces.\nAn agreement on the withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. This agreement will include comprehensive arrangements to apply in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area subsequent to the Israeli withdrawal. Internal security and public order by the Palestinian police force consisting of police officers recruited locally and from abroad (holding Jordanian passports and Palestinian documents issued by Egypt). Those who will participate in the Palestinian police force coming from abroad should be trained as police and police officers.\nAnnex 3: Economic cooperation.\nThe two sides agree to establish an Israeli\u2013Palestinian continuing Committee for economic cooperation, focusing, among other things, on the following:\nAnnex 4: Regional development.\nThe two sides will cooperate in the context of the multilateral peace efforts in promoting a Development Program for the region, including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, to be initiated by the G7 countries.\nAgreed Minutes.\nThe Oslo I Accord contains some explanations of a number of articles in the Accord, with understandings the parties had agreed on:\nGeneral understandings.\nAny powers and responsibilities transferred to the Palestinians through the Declaration of Principles prior to the inauguration of the council will be subject to the same principles pertaining to Article\u00a0IV, as set out in the agreed minutes below.\nSpecific understandings.\nIt was to be understood that: Jurisdiction of the council would cover West Bank and Gaza Strip territory, except for issues that would be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations.\nIt was understood that several issues were postponed to permanent status negotiations, including: Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, security arrangements, borders, relations and co-operation with other neighbours, and other issues of common interest. The outcome of these permanent status negotiations should not be prejudiced or pre-empted by the parties.\nIt was agreed that the transfer of authority would be as follows: The Palestinians would inform the Israelis of the names of the authorized Palestinians who would assume the powers, authorities and responsibilities that would be transferred to the Palestinians according to the Declaration of Principles in the following fields: education and culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation, tourism, and any other authorities agreed upon.\nThe Interim Agreement would also include arrangements for coordination and cooperation.\nThe withdrawal of the military government would not prevent Israel from exercising the powers and responsibilities not transferred to the council.\nIt was understood that the Interim Agreement would include arrangements for cooperation and coordination. It was also agreed that the transfer of powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian police would be accomplished in a phased manner. The accord stipulated that Israeli and Palestinian police would do joint patrols.\nIt was agreed that the Israeli and Palestinian delegations would exchange the names of the individuals designated by them as members of the Joint Israeli\u2013Palestinian Liaison Committee which would reach decisions by agreement.\nIt was understood that, subsequent to the Israeli withdrawal, Israel would continue to be responsible for external security, and for internal security and public order of settlements and Israelis. Israeli military forces and civilians would be allowed to continue using roads freely within the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area.\nReactions.\nIn Israel.\nIn Israel, a strong debate over the accords took place; the left wing supported them, while the right wing opposed them. After a two-day discussion in the Knesset on the government proclamation in the issue of the accord and the exchange of the letters, on 23 September 1993, a vote of confidence was held in which 61\u00a0Knesset members voted for the decision, 50 voted against and 8 abstained.\nOn both sides (Israel and Palestine), there were fears of the other side's intentions. Israelis suspected that the Palestinians were entering into a tactical peace agreement, and that they were not sincere about wanting to reach peace and coexistence with Israel. They saw it as part of the PLO's Ten Point Program which calls for a national authority \"over every part of Palestinian territory that is liberated\" until \"the liberation of all Palestinian territory\" and understood it as an attempt to justify the signing of the accords as a step to reach a final goal.\nJerusalem's new mayor and later Prime Minister Ehud Olmert opposed the agreement and called it a \"dark cloud over the city\". He favored to bring more Jews to East Jerusalem and expand Jerusalem to the east.\nIn Palestine.\nPalestinian reactions were also divided. Fatah, the group that represented the Palestinians in the negotiations, accepted the accords. But Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine objected to the accords.\nOn both sides (Israel and Palestine), there were fears of the other side's intentions. Many Palestinians feared that Israel was not serious about dismantling their settlements in the West Bank, especially around Jerusalem. They feared they might even accelerate their settlement program in the long run, by building more settlements and expanding existing ones.\nIn Lebanon.\nOn 13 September 1993 the Lebanese Army opened fire on an anti-Oslo demonstration in south Beirut organised by Hizbollah killing nine people and wounding thirty.\nNobel Peace Prize.\nIn 1994 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize following the signing on the Oslo Accords, \"for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East\". The Accords have not resulted in peace to date.\nRemarks from Benjamin Netanyahu.\nIn a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: \"They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo accords]... I said I would, but [that] I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67\u00a0borders. How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\" Netanyahu then explained how he conditioned his signing of the 1997 Hebron agreement on American consent that there be no withdrawals from \"specified military locations\", and insisted he be allowed to specify which areas constituted a \"military location\"\u2014such as the whole of the Jordan Valley. \"Why is that important? Because from that moment on I stopped the Oslo Accords\", Netanyahu affirmed.\nHowever, this is clearly consistent with Yitzhak Rabin's October 1995 statement to the Knesset on the ratification of the interim Oslo agreement: \"B. The security border of the State of Israel will be located in the Jordan Valley, in the broadest meaning of that term.\"\nAdditional agreements.\nIn addition to the first accord, the parties concluded:\nAfter 1995, a number of additional agreements were concluded to implement the Oslo Accords.\nConsequences of the accord.\nIn 2013 the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation stated, \"The Oslo Accord divided the metropolis of Hebron\u2014in two. In a small, fortified area of its old city quarters\u2014a small group of Israeli settlers reside, surrounded by more than 120,000 Palestinians\".\nSee also.\nPeople\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a key figure in the Devotio Moderna movement.\nBiography.\nBirth and education.\nHe was born in the Hanseatic city Deventer in the Bishopric of Utrecht, where his father held a good civic position. He studied at Aachen, then went to the University of Paris when only fifteen. Here he studied scholastic philosophy and theology at the Sorbonne under a pupil of William of Occam's, from whom he imbibed the nominalist conception of philosophy; in addition he studied Canon law, medicine, astronomy and even magic, and apparently some Hebrew. After a brilliant course he graduated in 1358. In 1362 he was appointed teacher at the Deventer chapter school. \nReligious life.\nSoon after, Groote settled in Cologne, teaching philosophy and theology, and was granted a prebend in Utrecht and another in Aachen. In 1366 his countrymen sent him to Avignon on a secret mission to Pope Urban V. The life of the brilliant young scholar was rapidly becoming luxurious, secular and selfish, when a great spiritual change passed over him which resulted in a final renunciation of every worldly enjoyment. This conversion, which took place in 1374, appears to have been due partly to the effects of a dangerous illness and partly to the influence of a fellow student, Henry de Calcar, the learned and pious prior of the Charterhouse at Munnikhuizen (Monnikenhuizen) near Arnhem, who had remonstrated with him on the vanity of his life.\nIn 1374 Groote turned his family home in Deventer into a shelter for poor women and lived for several years as a guest of the Carthusian monastery. In 1379, having received ordination as a deacon, he became a missionary preacher throughout the diocese of Utrecht. The success which followed his labours not only in the city of Utrecht, but also in Zwolle, Deventer, Kampen, Amsterdam, Haarlem, Gouda, Leiden, Delft, Zutphen and elsewhere, was immense; according to Thomas \u00e0 Kempis the people left their business and their meals to hear his sermons, so that the churches could not hold the crowds that flocked together wherever he came.\nThe bishop of Utrecht supported him warmly, and got him to preach against concubinage in the presence of the clergy assembled in synod. The impartiality of his censures, which he directed not only against the prevailing sins of the laity, but also against heresy, simony, avarice, and impurity among the secular and regular clergy, provoked the hostility of the clergy, and accusations of heterodoxy were brought against him. It was in vain that Groote emitted a \"Publica Protestatio\", in which he declared that Jesus was the great subject of his discourses, that in all of them he believed himself to be in harmony with Catholic doctrine, and that he willingly subjected them to the candid judgment of the Church.\nThe bishop was induced to issue an edict which prohibited from preaching all who were not in priestly orders, and an appeal by Groote to Pope Urban VI was without effect. There is a difficulty as to the date of this prohibition; either it was only a few months before Groote's death, or else it must have been removed by the bishop, for Groote seems to have preached in public in the last year of his life.\nAt some period (perhaps 1381, perhaps earlier) he paid a visit of some days' duration to the famous mystic John Ruysbroeck, prior of the Augustinian canons at Groenendaal near Brussels; during this visit was formed Groote's attraction for the rule and life of the Augustinian canons which was destined to bear notable fruit. At the close of his life he was asked by some of the clerics who attached themselves to him to form them into a religious order and Groote resolved that they should be Canons Regular of St. Augustine. No time was lost in the effort to carry out the project, but Groote died before a foundation could be made.\nThe initiation of this movement was the great achievement of Groote's life; he lived to preside over the birth and first days of his other creation, the society of Brethren of the Common Life. He died of the plague at Deventer, which he had contracted while nursing the sick, in 1384 at the age of 44. Geert Groote was also a famous writer, who made an important Middle Dutch translation of a book of hours. His translation was used innumerable times throughout the following centuries.\nThe Brethren of the Common Life.\nYoung men especially flocked to him in great numbers. Some of these he sent to his schools, others he occupied at transcribing good books, to all he taught thorough Christian piety. Groote and Florence Radewyns, his favourite disciple, founded at Zwolle the Brethren of the Common Life. In 1387 a site was secured at Windesheim, some north of Deventer, and here was established the monastery that became the cradle of the Windesheim Congregation of canons regular embracing in course of time nearly one hundred houses, and leading the way in the series of reforms undertaken during the 15th century by all the religious orders in Germany. Henceforth his communities, which were spreading rapidly through the Netherlands, Lower Germany, and Westphalia, claimed and received all his attention. He contemplated organizing his clerics into a community of canons regular, but it was left to Radewyns, his successor, to realize this plan at Windesheim two years later.\nDevotio Moderna.\nA movement known as the Modern Devotion (Devotio Moderna) was founded in the Netherlands by Groote and Florens Radewyns, in the late fourteenth century. For Groote the pivotal point is the search for inner peace, which results from the denial of one's own self and is to be achieved by \"ardour\" and \"silence\". This is the heart of the \"New Devotion\", or the \"Devotio moderna\". Solitary meditation on Christ\u2019s Passion and redemption, on one\u2019s own death, the Last Judgment, heaven, and hell was essential.\nIn the course of the 15th century, the Modern Devotion found adherents throughout the Netherlands and Germany. Its precepts were further disseminated in texts such as \"The Imitation of Christ\" by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, which reached an increasingly literate public. In this context small works of art such as diptychs that provided a focus for private worship enjoyed wide popularity.\nLegacy.\nGeert Groote College is located in Amsterdam.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nAn account, based on the \"Britannica\" sources, is in S. Kettlewell, \"Thomas \u00e0 Kempis and the Brothers of Common Life\" (1882), i. c. 5; and a shorter account in F. R. Cruise, \"Thomas \u00e0 Kempis\", 1887, pt. ii. A sketch, with an account of Groote's writings, is given by L. Schulze in Herzog-Hauck, \"Realencyklop\u00e4die\" (ed. 3); he insists on the fact that Groote's theological and ecclesiastical ideas were those commonly current in his day, and that the attempts to make him a \"reformer before the Reformation\" are unhistorical."}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,126, making it the fourth-least populous county in Florida. Its county seat is Moore Haven. Glades County is in the Clewiston micropolitan area, a Micropolitan statistical area (\u03bcSA) which also includes Hendry County. These two counties, along with the Cape Coral-Fort Myers (Lee County) MSA and the Naples-Marco Island (Collier County) MSA, constitute the Cape Coral-Fort Myers-Naples Combined Statistical Area (CSA).\nHistory.\nIndigenous people lived in this area for thousands of years. Due to warfare and exposure to infectious diseases after European contact, native tribes became depopulated. In the eighteenth century, when the area was under Spanish rule, Native American peoples of Creek and other tribes migrated into present-day Florida from Georgia. Africans and African Americans who escaped from slavery and shipwrecks also migrated to the area, where they created maroon communities. Some were given freedom by the Spanish in exchange for serving with their militias. Gradually the Seminole nation formed out of these multi-ethnic people. Some African-descended people set up communities near the Seminole and became known as Black Seminole. In the nineteenth century, most of the Seminole and many blacks were removed to Indian Territory after the Seminole Wars, a result of pressure from increasing Anglo-American settlement.\nGlades County was created, in 1921, from Desoto County. It was named for the Florida Everglades, though most of the county is prairie and pinelands.\nIt is one of five counties surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail.\nGlades County sponsors one of Florida's oldest recurring festivals. \"Chalo Nitka\" Festival is a celebration of local history and culture, similar to a county fair. The festival also draws attention to the long and friendly relationship between the local Seminole groups and Glades County settlers. Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation is located in the county.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (18.3%) is water.\nFisheating Creek is a stream that flows into Lake Okeechobee in Florida.

The CDP had a population of 916 at the 2020 census. The community is located within Au Sable Township and Oscoda Township at the mouth of the Au Sable River along Lake Huron.\nHistory.\nThe area was first settled as early as 1867 when the firm of Smith, Kelley, &amp; Dwight purchased land here and platted the community. A post office under the name Au Sable served the area until the Oscoda post office was established on July 1, 1875. The name Oscoda is believed to come from Henry Schoolcraft, who used a shortened form of ossin and muscoda, which means a pebbly prairie.\nThe Lumberman's Monument is located nearby and was dedicated in 1932 in honor of the early lumberjacks that first populated the area. The state of Michigan designated Oscoda as the official home of Paul Bunyan due to early documented publications in the \"Oscoda Press\" on August 10, 1906, by James MacGillivray. The article was later revised and published in \"The Detroit News\" in 1910.\nWurtsmith Air Force Base was a United States Air Force commissioned in 1923 in Oscoda. During the Cold War, it was one of the state's three Strategic Air Command bases that housed Boeing B-52 Stratofortress jets. The air base was decommissioned in 1993. The area is now an ongoing Superfund site due to extensive groundwater contamination. Parts of the defunct air base now serve as the Oscoda\u2013Wurtsmith Airport with no future plans for the rest of the facility.\nOscoda was featured in the 2002 documentary film \"Bowling for Columbine\", in which director Michael Moore interviewed two young residents. Eric Harris, one of the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre, spent some of his early years in Oscoda while his father served in the U.S. Air Force.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (8.42%) is water.\nThe community is located on the northside of the Au Sable River at its river mouth at Lake Huron.

Au Sable is served by Oscoda Area Schools.\nThe Shore to Shore Riding &amp; Hiking Trail, which is a network of trails, has its eastern terminus in Oscoda.\nClimate.\nThis climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,327. Its county seat is Wauchula. Hardee County comprises the Wauchula, Florida, Micropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nHardee County was created by an act of April 23, 1921 in which the Florida Legislature divided \"old DeSoto County\" into five parts, forming the Counties of Hardee, DeSoto, Charlotte, Highlands and Glades.\nThe county is named after Cary A. Hardee, the Governor of Florida who served from 1921 to 1925 and who signed the act creating the county.\nThe settlement of what is now Hardee County, Florida, began with the establishment of the Kennedy\u2013Darling Indian-trading post on Paynes Creek in April 1849. The enterprise came to an end on July 17, 1849, when two of the clerks, George Payne and Dempsey Whidden, were killed by Indians. A third clerk, William McCullough, and his wife Nancy were also wounded, and the post was burned down.\nReports of the attack motivated the U.S. Army to establish a chain of fortifications across Florida, and construction began on Fort Chokonikla on October 26, 1849.\u00a0The fort was subsequently abandoned in July 1850 due to an outbreak of sickness and never reoccupied.\nDuring the Seminole Wars, Fort Green and Fort Hartsuff were both garrisoned in the area. Fort Hartstuff would later become the settlement and county seat of Wauchula.\nThe Florida Southern Railway arrived in 1886 and ushered in a new era of increased settlement for what is now Hardee County, with many new settlers finding employment working with the railroad, tending stores, farming, ranching and teaching.\nAt the dawn of the 20th century, the county seat Wauchula was incorporated in 1902, and the first bank was opened in 1904.\nA community group of activists referred to as \"Divisionists\" first began lobbying for the creation of new counties with the area of \"old DeSoto County\" in 1907, and after a 15-year campaign, the Florida Legislature separated Desoto into five parts, creating the 638-square mile Hardee County.\nOn August 13, 2004, Hurricane Charley went directly through Hardee County. Maximum sustained winds in downtown Wauchula were clocked at with higher gusts. Most buildings in the county sustained damage, and many were totally destroyed.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.1%) is water.\nHardee County is located in a region colloquially referred to as \"Bone Valley.\" The region contains most of North America's phosphate deposits and a large portion of the world's accessible deposits. CommercialPhosphate mining in the region that is now the county has been ongoing since the late 19th century.\nThe Mosaic Company currently operates the only mines in the county with around 10,000 acres near Fort Green and 16,778 acres near Ona, FL.\nThere is controversy over the mining practice and the rezoning and conversion of agricultural land into open pit mines. Land is reclaimed after mining and leaves artificially-created lakes and wetlands.\nReclamation standards for phosphate lands include contouring to safe slopes, providing for acceptable water quality and quantity, revegetation, and the return of wetlands to pre-mining type, nature, function and acreage.\nOpponents of mining say converting agricultural land to phosphate mining is harmful to the environment, increasing background radiation levels, harming water quality and rendering some areas poorly suited for agriculture.\nSupporters of mining say it is critical to America's food supply and economy, and that reclaimed mine land is better for the environment than agricultural land.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 25,327 people, 7,991 households, and 5,838 families residing in the county.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 26,938 people, 8,166 households, and 6,255 families residing in the county.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 39,619, a 1.2% increase from 39,140 at the 2010 census. The county is majority-Hispanic or Latino. Its county seat is LaBelle. Hendry County is in the Clewiston micropolitan area, a Micropolitan statistical area (\u03bcSA) which also includes Glades County. These two counties, along with the Cape Coral-Fort Myers (Lee County) MSA and the Naples-Marco Island (Collier County) MSA, constitute the Cape Coral-Fort Myers-Naples Combined Statistical Area (CSA).\nHistory.\nIndigenous peoples migrated into Florida around 10000 B.C.E., while the Glades culture existed in southern Florida from approximately 500 B.C.E. to 1500 C.E. Archaeological sites attesting to the presence of the Glades culture in modern-day Hendry County include Clewiston Mounds, Maple Mound, South Lake Mounds, and Tony's Mound. When Europeans arrived in Florida in the 16th century, the Calusa and Mayaimi tribes resided in Southwest Florida and around Lake Okeechobee.\nIn the early 1800s, French trader Pierre Denaud established a trading post in the modern-day LaBelle area. During the Seminole Wars, United States troops built a fort along the Caloosahatchee River in 1838, named Fort Denaud in his honor. About three years later, Fort Thompson was established. These military posts became the first permanent settlements in modern-day Hendry County. Originally, the area now comprising Hendry County remained relatively inaccessible, as the Florida Everglades covered more than half of the county's present-day boundaries. Further, nearly the entire area became submerged with water seasonally; thus, only cattle-grazing was a suitable industry. However, by 1881, the Atlantic and Gulf Coast and Okeechobee Land Company began draining the land after entering into a contract with the trustees of the internal improvement fund. The county's first post office was established at Fort Thomson in 1884. The state of Florida established Lee County in 1887, which included land now part of Hendry County. Settlement in LaBelle began around 1889 or 1890, after the town was platted by Francis A. Hendry, a cattle rancher, politician, and officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, commercial fishermen began building fishing camps along Lake Okeechobee at Sand Point, later renamed Clewiston, though the city was not permanently settled until about 1920. In 1911, LaBelle became the oldest municipality in modern-day Hendry County after officially incorporating. That same year, the United States government established the Big Cypress Indian Reservation in present-day Hendry County via executive order by President William Howard Taft. By the early 1920s, residents in the eastern Lee County communities of Clewiston, Felda, Fort Denaud, and LaBelle began campaigning for the creation of a new county. Among their reasons for supporting the establishment of a new county was dissatisfaction with the distance between eastern Lee County settlements and the county seat, Fort Myers. Around that time, the \"Caloosahatchee Current\" was established to prove that the area could sustain a newspaper publication.\nOn May\u00a011, 1923, just three days after neighboring Collier County was also created and partitioned from Lee County, the Florida Legislature voted to establish Hendry County, named after Francis A. Hendry. The first county commissioners were M.F. Boisclaire, M.E. Forrey, Thomas O'Brien, R.H. Magill, and L.N. Thomas. The town of LaBelle (chartered as a city in 1925) was designated as the county seat. A temporary jail was erected at a city park in LaBelle, while E.E. Goodno, who owned the Everett Hotel, allowed rooms and office space in the building to be used as a temporary courthouse.\nResidents voted by a wide margin in favor of a $530,000 bond issue in November\u00a01924, with $430,000 to be allotted towards improvement of roads and $100,000 for construction of a courthouse. The courthouse was finished in 1927, and has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1990. In 1925, the only other incorporated municipality in Hendry County, Clewiston, became a city. In mid-1926, a cross-state highway (initially designated as State Road 25, but later renumbered 80) linking Fort Myers to Palm Beach was completed and passed through Hendry County. Around this time, the Gulf Atlantic Transportation, based in LaBelle, began providing transportation from Fort Myers to West Palm Beach. Another improvement to transportation occurred when the Seaboard\u2013All Florida Railway started its rail service from LaBelle to Fort Myers in mid-1927. The 1926 Miami hurricane and 1928 Okeechobee hurricane both impacted Hendry County, though damage and loss of life was significantly less than in other areas around Lake Okeechobee.\nThe Number 5 British Flying Training School was operated at Riddle Field in Clewiston during World War II, with more than 1,800\u00a0Royal Air Force pilots trained there. Upon completion of the Herbert Hoover Dike in 1961, a dedication ceremony was held in Clewiston, which included a speech by former president Herbert Hoover.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.1%) is water. The county borders Lake Okeechobee; the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail runs through Hendry County.

There is also a tribal school affiliated with the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), Ahfachkee School at the Big Cypress Indian Reservation.\nThe Clewiston Public Library in Clewiston, the Harlem Library, also in Clewiston and the Barron Library in Labelle, all make up the Hendry County Library Cooperative. The Clewiston Public Library, now known as the Harry T. Vaughn Library, came about in 1941 when the mayor at the time, asked the Garden Club to organize a library. They enlisted the help of a librarian from the Moore Haven High School to cataloged all the books and then prepared to open the library to the public. In 1967, the library moved to its permanent location, and in 1992, it was added to through funding from state and federal grants, the City of Clewiston, Hendry County, $100,000 from U.S. Sugar, and $57,510 from private donations. The mission of the cooperative, as taken from their website, is this: \"The mission of the Hendry County Library Cooperative is to provide its citizens with access to materials and information for work, school, and personal life that are both educational and entertaining\".\nFew post-secondary institutions exist in Hendry County. Florida SouthWestern State College has an outreach program campus in LaBelle. Neighboring Collier and Lee counties have several colleges and universities, including Ave Maria University in Ave Maria and campuses of Barry University, Florida SouthWestern State College, Keiser University, and Rasmussen University in Fort Myers.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 194,515. Its county seat is Brooksville, and its largest community is Spring Hill. Hernando County is included in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is also part of the Nature Coast of Florida. \nHistory.\nIn 1767, a group of Upper Creeks from Eufaula, Alabama, migrated to the Tampa Bay region and settled in what is now Hernando County. They would eventually become a part of the Muskogee speaking Seminole.\nEarly European Pioneers and Founding.\nRoughly 100 settlers and over 50 slaves arrived in what would become Hernando County in February 1842. Fort DeSoto was soon established in the northeast edge of present-day Brooksville to protect these settlers in the area from Native Americans. The fort became a small community center, trading post, and way station on the route to Tampa. Further settlements started to grow near the fort beginning around 1845; two towns developed, Melendez and Pierceville, which would later merge to create Brooksville in 1856.\nThen encompassing a significantly larger area of west central Florida than it does today, Hernando County was officially established on February 27, 1843, two years prior to Florida's admission into the Union. It was created from portions of Alachua, Hillsborough and Orange Counties and included all of present-day Citrus and Pasco Counties. Named for Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, whose name has also been honored in DeSoto County, Hernando County was briefly renamed Benton County in 1844 for Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, a strong supporter of territorial expansion who aided in the county's creation. However, Benton fell out of favor with the county's residents later in the decade due to his decision to support the Missouri Compromise and the overall reversal of his stance on slavery, and the county's name reverted in 1850.\nIn December 1854, the legislature designated the small port town of Bayport the county seat. Residents living in the eastern section of the county instead desired a more central place for the county government, and by 1855, voters had selected an inland site within of the center of the county at the town of Melendez. In 1856, the citizens of Hernando County chose to rename the town, their new County Seat, Brooksville in honor of South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks, who in the same year beat fierce abolitionist Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner with a cane in the Senate chambers, winning the Congressman great renown in the South.\nIn 1855, town founder Joseph Hale donated land for a county courthouse in the center of present-day Brooksville. Soon thereafter, the structure was completed.\nAmerican Civil War.\nDuring the Civil War, Hernando County primarily contributed foodstuffs, cotton, and lumber to the Confederacy. Although Union ships imposed a blockade on the port of Bayport, runners enjoyed a great deal of success\u2014enough to lead the Union in June 1864 to order some 150\u2013250 troop to destroy Confederate stockpiles in the county. In early July, the expeditions, including 2 companies from the 2nd U.S. Florida Cavalry, marched northward from Anclote River to Brooksville, meeting some resistance from assembled Confederate troops hastily organized to protect the city. The Federal troops won this engagement (known locally as the Brooksville Raid and marched to Bayport, where they and an auxiliary force landing from gunboats sacked Rebel operations. The skirmish between Union raiders and local Confederates is reenacted annually in the county.\nAt least one unit that fought in the Civil War was mustered in Hernando County. The Hernando County \"Wildcats,\" formed Company C of 3rd Florida Infantry Regiment. The unit was captained by Walter Terry Saxon who was reportedly well liked by his men. He was paid roughly $20,000 for work surveying the Everglades. He used most of this money to arm and equip the Wildcats.\nReconstruction.\nDespite many citizens', including new immigrants, attempts at making Hernando an open and welcoming place, the county became one of the many Florida plantation counties that was a hotbed for Ku Klux Klan activity. Arthur St. Clair, a minister, was lynched in Hernando County, Florida, in 1877 for performing the wedding of a black man and white woman.\nThe county courthouse was destroyed by a fire on September 29, 1877. On June 2, 1887, the Florida State Legislature divided Hernando County into three independent counties: Pasco County to the south, Citrus County to the north, and Hernando County in the middle. Since then, Hernando County's borders have remained unchanged.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (19.8%) is water.

In the 2020 census, the population was 1,459,762, making it the fourth-most populous county in Florida and the most populous county outside the Miami metropolitan area. An estimate in 2021 shows the population of Hillsborough County at 1,512,070 people with a yearly growth rate of 1.34%, which itself is greater than the populations of 12 states according to their 2019 population estimates. Its county seat and largest city is Tampa. Hillsborough County is part of the Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg\u2013Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nHillsborough County was created on January 25, 1834, from Alachua and Monroe Counties, during the U.S. territorial period (1822\u20131845). The new county was named for Wills Hill, the Earl of Hillsborough, who served as British Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1768 to 1772. The County was created through efforts by Augustus Steele.\nThe county's 1834 area was much larger and included eight other present-day counties: Charlotte County, DeSoto, Hardee, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, and Sarasota.\nThe last significant change in Hillsborough County's borders was the separation of its western section to create Pinellas County in 1911.\nOn New Year's Day in 1914, the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line initiated the first scheduled commercial airline service in the world, from St. Petersburg to Tampa.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (19.4%) are covered by water. About of shoreline are on Tampa Bay.\nThe county's unincorporated area is around , more than 84% of the total land area. Municipalities account for . The modern boundaries of the county place it midway along the west coast of Florida.\nA narrow portion of Hillsborough County to the south, consisting almost exclusively of water, extends west to the Gulf of Mexico roughly along the Tampa Port Shipping Channel. This has the effect of keeping Hillsborough County from being technically landlocked. The central portion of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is in Hillsborough County. So is Egmont Key, at the entrance to Tampa Bay; this narrow strip of land separates Pinellas County from Manatee County. The northernmost tip of a spoil island just west of Port Manatee also lies in Hillsborough County.\nHillsborough is home to Alafia River State Park and Hillsborough River state parks, and to the C. W. Bill Young Regional Reservoir and Lithia Springs, one of the largest natural springs in Florida.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 Census.\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,459,762 people, 539,919 households, and 338,683 families residing in the county.\n2010 Census.\nU.S. Census Bureau 2010 Ethnic/Race Demographics:\nIn 2010, 6.0% of the Hillsborough's population considered themselves to be of only American ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity.)\nOf the 536,092 households, 29.74% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.25% were married couples living together, 14.76% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.69% were not families.

It is part of the politically important I-4 Corridor between Tampa Bay and Orlando, an area that historically decides most elections in Florida. Hillsborough was considered a bellwether county, voting for the statewide winner in every presidential election from 1964\u20132012. It has also voted for the winner of the presidency in every election since 1928 except twice, voting for the loser only in 1992 and 2016. The southern portion of the county, around Tampa, is powerfully Democratic, while the northern and eastern portions are heavily Republican.\nOn the statewide level, the county also tends to lean Democratic with Democrats Bill Nelson for senator and Andrew Gillum for governor both winning the county in the 2018 elections. However, Republican senator Marco Rubio did win the county in his 2010, 2016 and 2022 senatorial campaigns and Republican Governor Ron Desantis won it in his 2022 gubernatorial campaign after the county supported Democrats for the previous three gubernatorial elections since 2010.\nIn 2008, Barack Obama won the county by seven points, the first Democrat to capture the county since Bill Clinton's re-election victory in 1996. Obama won Hillsborough again in 2012 over Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney by roughly the same margin.\nIn 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 to win a presidential election without carrying the county.\nDonald Trump broke the Democratic streak in the county in 2024, when he carried the county by 3.05%. This reflects the general trend in Florida towards the Republican Party in recent elections.\nBoard of County Commissioners.\nA home rule charter for Hillsborough County was approved by voters in a county-wide referendum held in September 1983, and the first county commissioners elected under this new charter took office on May 28, 1985.\nUnder a charter ordinance that went into effect May 1985, seven county commissioners are directed to perform legislative functions of government by developing policy for the management of Hillsborough County. The county administrator, a professional appointed by the board, and the administrative staff are responsible for the implementation of these policies.\nThe board also serves as the Environmental Protection Commission. Individual board members serve on various other boards, authorities, and commissions such as the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, Tampa Bay Water, Aviation Authority, Expressway Authority, Sports Authority, Port Authority, Arts Council of Hillsborough County, Children's Board, Metropolitan Planning Organization, and Council of Governments.\nThe charter divides the power of county government between legislative and executive branches. The Board of County Commissioners, which composes the legislative branch, sets overall policy by means of ordinances, resolutions, and motions.\nThe executive powers of county government are vested in the county administrator, appointed by county commissioners and charged by the charter to faithfully implement the powers of the board. The charter provides for a county attorney, to be hired by the county administrator with the advice and consent of the county commissioners. The charter contains a provision for a charter review board appointed by County Commissioners every five years to conduct a study of county government and propose amendments to the charter. These amendments must be presented to voters for approval. One amendment was approved in November 2002, adding the position of County Internal Performance Auditor to the government structure. This position reports directly to the County Commission.\nThe current administrator is Bonnie M. Wise, who took office on July 1, 2020, replacing Mike Merrill, who had served as administrator since 2010. Wise previously served as the county's deputy administrator and Tampa's chief financial officer.\nOf the seven members of the Board of County Commissioners for Hillsborough County, four are elected from single-member districts, and three are elected county-wide. The board approves the county's operating and capital budgets and the county's capital-improvement program. It may take action on any programs for the improvement of the county and the welfare of its residents.\nAs of 2025, The members of the Board are as follows:\nGovernment officials.\nThese five countywide elected positions have specific responsibilities under the county charter:\nTaxes.\nHillsborough County's discretionary sales tax rate increased from 1% to 2.5% in January 2019. When combined with the state of Florida's 6%, the rate is 8.5%, the highest in Florida. The rate includes two surcharges approved by voter referendum in November 2018, 1% for transportation and 1/2% for schools. It is only collected on the first $5000 of any large purchase.\nEconomy.\nIn the early 20th century, Hillsborough's economy was predominantly based on cigar-making and agriculture. In 2012, Hillsborough had the second-largest agricultural output among Florida's counties. As of 2010, the average annual employment in Hillsborough County was 563,292.

In 2012 and 2013, all 27 public high schools were included on the \"Washington Post's \"list of the 2000 most challenging schools in America.\nMuseums and libraries.\nLibraries.\nThe Tampa Public Library opened in 1917. The following notable libraries are part of the Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative:\nLocal agencies.\nSeveral agencies provide law enforcement to the residents of Hillsborough County. They are all accredited and fully certified law enforcement agencies by the FDLE.\nHillsborough County Fire Rescue.\nHillsborough County Fire Rescue serves the unincorporated areas of Hillsborough County. Fire service began in the 1950s as an all-volunteer force consisting of about a dozen loosely associated community-based organizations. The first full-time career firefighters were hired in 1973. The department now has 1,019 career uniformed and support personnel who continue to set the pace in fire and emergency medical response, making it the fourth-largest department in the state. Since the 1997 consolidation of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue and Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the department has placed paramedics on each career, front-line apparatus. The department operates 35 ALS transport ambulances, 46 Engine Companies, 5 Truck Companies, 2 Heavy Rescue's, 1 Hazardous Incident Unit, 1 Fire Boat and 1 Rescue Boat. These units operate out of 44 Fire Rescue stations located strategically throughout Hillsborough County. As of summer 2021, 2 additional stations are being constructed to bring that number up to 46. As nearly 85% of the department's more than 137,000 (2021) emergency responses require some level of medical care, having paramedics assigned to each unit assures that the citizens of Hillsborough County are receiving rapid advanced life-support care.\nHillsborough County Fire Rescue and the Board of County Commissioners have implemented a plan to continue placing new fire rescue stations in areas where growth is occurring or gaps in coverage may exist. Fire Chief Dennis Jones leads a senior staff of two deputy chiefs (operations and administrative branches), the fire marshal, and the emergency manager. All fiscal functions, facilities maintenance and supply, apparatus/equipment procurement, emergency dispatch manager, personnel chief, and training chief are under the direction of the deputy chief of administration. The three Shift Commanders, as well as the Rescue Chief and the Special Operations Chief, report directly to the Deputy Chief of Operations. The Operations Chief is responsible for the overall response readiness of all front line personnel. The Emergency Manager oversees all Office of Emergency Management (OEM) planning and operations of the EOC.\nHillsborough County Fire Rescue Office of Emergency Management.\nThe Office of Emergency Management is a division of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue that is directly responsible for planning and coordinating the evacuation and sheltering of all county residents in the event of a natural or manmade disaster. This agency is also responsible for planning, orchestrating and coordinating response actions and continuity of government in the aftermath of a major disaster. Preston Cook has been the Emergency Manager since 2011.\nThe Hurricane Evacuation Assessment Tool has been created to assist residents of Hillsborough County by providing evacuation and sheltering information in the event of a hurricane or other natural disaster. This interactive program was designed to assist the public in easily determining if they are in one of the five evacuation zones. It also provides information on shelters, hospitals, fire stations, and sandbag locations.\nThe Office of Emergency Management also provides information to the public on: Hurricane information, procedures for hazardous-materials spills, and flooding, tornado, wildfire, and terrorism preparedness.\nTransportation.\nPublic transportation.\nHillsborough County is served by Hillsborough Area Regional Transit, also known as HART.

Holmes Creek \u2013 the county's eastern boundary \u2013 bore that name before the county was created, but it was originally named \"Weekaywehatchee\" (a Muscogee name meaning \"spring creek\"). One claim is that the county was named for Thomas J. Holmes, who came from North Carolina to settle in the area about 1830.

Few facts are known about their origins, and little has been published about them.\nPolitics.\nHolmes County is an archetypically \"Solid South\" county in Florida. It gave the fifth-highest percentage of the vote for segregationist George Wallace of any county in the country during the 1968 election, and apart from Deep South native Jimmy Carter, no Democrat since 1964 has obtained as much as thirty-four percent of the county's vote in any Presidential election.\nHolmes County once had more registered Democrats than Republicans, but many were descendants of Dixiecrats, Southerners who registered as Democrats due to tradition but voted Republican in most elections. Barack Obama earned only 15.2% of the vote in 2012. Hillary Clinton earned less than 10% of the vote in 2016. In 2024, Holmes was the most Republican county in the state of Florida, when it gave just under 90% of its vote to Donald Trump.\nMedia.\nThe Holmes County Times-Advertiser is now owned by Halifax Media. The weekly newspaper publishes each Wednesday.\nEducation.\nHolmes District School Board operates public schools. Holmes County High School and Ponce de Leon High School are its public high schools. Poplar Springs High School is a K-12 Combination School in Northeastern Holmes County and Bethlehem High School is a K-12 Combination School in the Bethlehem Community.\nThe http:// is the county's library system. It is located at 303 North J. Harvey Etheridge Street, Bonifay, Florida 32425. The library is open Tuesday-Friday 8:00am\u20135:00pm, and Saturday 8:00am\u201312:00pm and offers public computers with internet access, free wi-fi, programming for all ages, and access to e-books, e-audiobooks, and numerous online databases and resources.\nHolmes County is also a part of the https://. PPLCS also includes Calhoun and Jackson counties.\nTransportation.\nRailroads.\nHolmes County has one railroad line. The primary one is the CSX P&amp;A Subdivision, a line formerly owned by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad that served Amtrak's Sunset Limited. This service formerly went to New Orleans, but in 2005 service was truncated by the extensive damage in the Gulf area due to Hurricane Katrina. Another former L&amp;N line existed within the northeastern corner of the county. The Georgiana Branch entered the state and county from Highnote, Alabama then ran through Esto and later Eleanor before crossing SR 2 and leaving the county towards Graceville and Campbellton, where it had a junction with the Bay Line Railroad. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has about 1,200 species of beetles in four subfamilies. Some species grow to over , but most to about .\nOverview.\nThe English name is derived from the large and distinctive mandibles found on the males of most species, which resemble the antlers of stags.\nA well-known species in much of Europe is \"Lucanus cervus\", referred to in some European countries (including the United Kingdom) as \"the\" stag beetle; it is the largest terrestrial insect in Europe. Pliny the Elder noted that Nigidius called the beetle \"lucanus\" after the Italian region of Lucania where they were used as amulets. The scientific name of \"Lucanus cervus\" adds \"cervus\", deer.\nMale stag beetles are known for their oversized mandibles that are used to wrestle each other for favoured mating sites in a way that parallels how stags fight over females. Fights may also be over food, such as tree sap and decaying fruits. During a battle between two males, a stag beetle's main objective is to dislodge its opponent's tarsal claws with its mandible, thus disrupting their balance. Despite their often fearsome appearance, they are not typically aggressive to humans. Because its mandibles are capable of exceeding its own body size, stag beetles are generally inefficient runners and are very slow, typically feeling the need to fly from one location to another.\nFemale stag beetles are usually smaller than the males, with smaller mandibles that are much more powerful than the males'. As larvae, females are distinguished by their cream-coloured fat ovaries visible through the skin around two-thirds of the way down their back.\nThe larvae feed for several years on rotting wood, growing through three larval stages until eventually pupating inside a pupal cell constructed from surrounding wood pieces and soil particles. In the final larval stage, \"L3\", the surviving grubs of larger species, such as \"Prosopocoilus giraffa\", may be the size of a human finger.\nIn England's New Forest, it was once believed that the stag beetle, dubbed the \"devil's imp\", was sent to do some evil to the corn crops. The superstition led to stoning the insects on sight, as observed by a writer in the \"Notes and Queries\". \nAlong with rhinoceros beetles, stag beetles are often bought as pets in South Korea and Japan.\nEvolution.\nThe oldest known fossil of the group is \"Juraesalus\" from the late Middle Jurassic (Callovian) Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia, China. While initially interpreted as a member of Aesalinae, it was later interpreted to be a basal member of the family. \"Litholamprima\", the only genus in the subfamily Litholampriminae, is known from the Lower Cretaceous of Yixian Formation, China.\nMandible allometry.\nLucanid males have large mandibles. Their size often varies among individuals. Such variation is termed a scaling relationship or static allometry. Environmental conditions and genetic factors affect mandible size.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72382", "revid": "44719641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72382", "title": "Constantijn Huygens", "text": "Dutch poet and composer (1596\u20131687)\nSir Constantijn Huygens, Lord of Zuilichem ( , , ; 4 September 1596\u00a0\u2013 28 March 1687), was a Dutch Golden Age poet and composer. He was also secretary to two Princes of Orange: Frederick Henry and William\u00a0II, and the father of the scientist Christiaan Huygens.\nBiography.\nConstantijn Huygens was born in The Hague, the second son of Christiaan Huygens (senior), secretary of the Council of State, and Susanna Hoefnagel, niece of the Antwerp painter Joris Hoefnagel.\nEducation.\nConstantijn was a gifted child. His brother Maurits and he were educated partly by their father and partly by carefully instructed governors. When he was five years old, Constantijn and his brother received their first musical education.\nMusic education.\nThey started with singing lessons, and they learned their notes using gold-coloured buttons on their jackets. It is striking that Christiaan senior imparted the \"modern\" system of 7 note names to the boys, instead of the traditional, but much more complicated hexachord system. Two years later the first lessons on the viol started, followed by the lute and the harpsichord. Constantijn showed a particular acumen for the lute. At the age of eleven he was already asked to play for ensembles, and later\u2014during his diplomatic travels\u2014his lute playing was in demand; he was asked to play at the Danish Court and for James I of England, although they were not known for their musical patronage. In later years he also learnt the more modern guitar. In 1647 he published in Paris his \"Pathodia sacra et profana\" with his compositions of airs de cour in French, madrigals in Italian and Psalms in Latin.\nArt instruction.\nThey were also schooled in art through their parents' art collection, but also their connection to the magnificent collection of paintings in the Antwerp house of diamond and jewellery dealer, Gaspar Duarte (1584\u20131653), who was a Portuguese Jewish exile.\nLanguage lessons.\nConstantijn also had a talent for languages. He learned French, Latin and Greek, and at a later age Italian, German and English. He learned by practice, the modern way of learning techniques. Constantijn received education in maths, law and logic and he learned how to handle a pike and a musket.\nIn 1614 Constantijn wrote his first Dutch poem, inspired by the French poet Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas, in which he praises rural life. In his early 20s, he fell in love with Dorothea; however, their relationship did not last and Dorothea met someone else.\nIn 1616, Maurits and Constantijn started studies at Leiden University. Studying in Leiden was primarily seen as a way to build a social network. Shortly after, Maurits was called home to assist his father. Constantijn finished his studies in 1617 and returned home. This was followed by six weeks of training with Antonis de Hubert, a lawyer in Zierikzee. De Hubert was committed to the study of language and writing, having held consultations with Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, Laurens Reael and Joost van den Vondel concerning language and orthography in 1623.\nEarly career.\nIn the Spring of 1618 Constantijn found employment with Sir Dudley Carleton, the English envoy at the Court in The Hague. In the summer, he stayed in London in the house of the Dutch ambassador, No\u00ebl de Caron. During his time in London his social circle widened and he also learned to speak English. In 1620, towards the end of the Twelve Years' Truce, he travelled as a secretary of ambassador Fran\u00e7ois van Aerssen to Venice, to gain support against the threat of renewed war. He was the only member of the legation who could speak Italian.\nLondon.\nIn January 1621, he traveled to England as the secretary of six envoys of the United Provinces with the object of persuading James I to support the German Protestant Union. They lodged in Lombard Street and were taken by coach to Whitehall Palace to King James and then to Prince Charles at St James's Palace where they realised they had delivered the letters for the prince to the king, and Huygens made an excuse of the poor light. On Shrove-Tuesday they saw a masque at Whitehall presented by the gentlemen of the Middle Temple. They returned in April of that year, Huygens with the king's gift of a gold chain worth \u00a345. In December 1621 he left with another delegation, this time with the aim of requesting support for the United Provinces, returning after a year and two months in February 1623. There was yet another trip to England in 1624.\nMuiderkring.\nHe is often considered a member of what is known as the Muiderkring, a group of leading intellectuals gathered around the poet Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, who met regularly at the castle of Muiden near Amsterdam. In 1619 Constantijn came into contact with Anna Roemers Visscher and with Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Huygens exchanged many poems with Anna. In 1621 a poetic exchange with Hooft also starts. Both would always try to exceed the other. In October of that year Huygens sent Jacob Cats a large poem in Dutch, entitled \" 't Voorhout\", about a woodland near the Hague. In December he started writing \" 't Kostelick Mal\", a satirical treatment of the nonsense of the current vogue. \nIn 1623, Huygens wrote his \"Printen\", a description of several characteristics of people. This satirical, moralising work was one of the most difficult of Huygens' poems. In the same year Maria Tesselschade and Allard Crombalch were married. For this occasion verses were written by Huygens, Hooft and Vondel. During the festival, Constantijn flirted with Machteld of Camps. As a result of this he wrote the poem \"Vier en Vlam\". In 1625 the work \"Otia\", or \"Ledige Uren\", was published. This work showcased his collected poems.\nEnglish knighthood and marriage.\nIn 1622, when Constantijn stayed as a diplomat for more than one year in England, he was knighted by King James I. This marked the end of Constantijn's formative years, and of his youth. During his time in England, in December 1622, he was robbed of his papers and \u00a3200 in gold from his coach as he set out on the way to Newmarket.\nHuygens was employed as a secretary to Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, who\u2014after the death of Maurits of Orange\u2014was appointed as \"stadtholder.\" In 1626 Constantijn fell in love with Suzanna van Baerle after earlier courtship by the Huygens family to win her for his brother Maurits had failed. Constantijn wrote several sonnets for her, in which he calls her \"Sterre\" (Star). They wed on 6 April 1627.\nHuygens describes their marriage in \"Dagh-werck\", a description of one day. He worked on this piece, which contains almost 2000 lines, during the entire time they were married. In one of the preserved manuscripts of this work it appears Suzanna transcribed (or wrote herself) a substantial portion of the work, suggesting a close collaboration between husband and wife.\nThe couple had five children: in 1628 their first son, Constantijn Jr., in 1629 Christiaan, in 1631 Lodewijk and in 1633 Philips. In 1637 their daughter Suzanna was born; shortly after her birth their mother died.\nEducation of his sons and the new royal Prince.\nIn 1645, his sons Constantijn Jr. and Christiaan began their studies in Leiden. In these years Prince Frederick Henry of Orange, Huygens' confidante and protector, became increasingly ill, and died in 1647. The new stadtholder, William II of Orange, greatly appreciated Huygens and gave him the estate of Zeelhem, but he died too in 1650.\nThe emphasis of Huygens' activities moved more and more to his presidency of the Council of the house of Orange, which was in the hands of the young Prince inheritor, a small baby. He traveled frequently during that time, in connection with his work. There were however strong disagreements between the baby's widowed grandmother Amalia van Solms, and its widowed mother (her daughter in law) Mary, Princess Royal, (4 November 1631 \u2013 24 December 1660, aged 29) on even the name for christening the Dutch-English Royal newborn.\nIn 1657, his son Philips died after a short sickness during his Grand Tour while in Prussia. In that same year Huygens became seriously ill, but healed in a miraculous manner.\nIn 1680, Constantijn Jr. moved with his family out of the house of his father. To stop the gossiping that started shortly afterwards, Huygens wrote the poem \"Cluijs-werck\", in which he shows a glimpse of the latter stages of his life.\nLater career and French knighthood.\nHuygens started a successful career despite his grief over the death of his wife (1638). In 1630 he was appointed to the Council and Exchequer, managing the estate of the Orange family. This job provided him with an income of about 1000 florins a year. In that same year he bought the heerlijkheid Zuilichem and became known as Lord of Zuilichem (in Dutch: Heer van Zuilichem). In 1632, Louis XIII of France - the protector of the famous exiled jurist Hugo Grotius - appointed him as Knight of the Order of Saint-Michel. In 1643 Huygens was granted the honor of displaying a golden lily on a blue field in his coat of arms.\nIn 1634 Huygens received from Prince Frederick Henry a piece of property in The Hague on the north side of the Binnenhof. The land was near the property of a good friend of Huygens, Count Johan Maurits of Nassau-Siegen, who built his house, the Mauritshuis, around the same time and using the same architect, Huygens' friend Jacob van Campen.\nCorrespondence.\nAside from his \"membership\" in the Muiderkring (which was not as formerly supposed, an official club), at the start of the 1630s he was also in touch with Ren\u00e9 Descartes, with Rembrandt, and the painter Jan Lievens. He became friends with John Donne, and translated his poems into Dutch. He was unable to write poetry for months because of his anguish over his wife's death, but eventually he composed, inspired by Petrarch, the sonnet \"Op de dood van Sterre\" (On the death of Sterre), which was well received. He added the poem to his \"Dagh-werck\", which he left unfinished: the day he has described has not ended yet, but his Sterre is already dead. After sending the unfinished work to different friends for approval, he eventually published it in 1658 as part of his \"Koren-bloemen\".\nHuygens also corresponded with Margaret Croft and Elizabeth Dudley, Countess of L\u00f6wenstein, ladies in waiting to Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, and Mary Woodhouse, a friend made in London in 1622.\nHofwijck.\nAfter a couple of years as a widower, Huygens bought a piece of land in Voorburg and commissioned the building of Hofwijck. Hofwijck was inaugurated in 1642 in the company of friends and relatives. Here Huygens hoped to escape the stress at court in The Hague, forming his own \"court\", indicated by the name of the house which has a double meaning: Hof (=Court or courtyard) Wijck (=avoid or township). In that same year, his brother Maurits died. Due to his grief Huygens wrote little Dutch poetry, but he continued to write epigrams in Latin. Shortly afterwards, he began writing Dutch pun poems, which are very playful by nature. In 1644 and 1645 Huygens began more serious work. As a new year's present for Leonore Hellemans, he composed the \"Heilige Daghen\", a series of sonnets on the Christian holidays. In 1644, a garlanded portrait of Huygens was painted by Daniel Seghers and Jan Cossiers: it is now in the Mauritshuis. In 1647 he published another work, in which play and seriousness are united, \"Ooghentroost\", addressed to Lucretia of Trello, who was losing her sight and who was already half-blind. The poem was offered as consolation.\nFrom 1650 to 1652 Huygens wrote the poem \"Hofwijck\" in which he described the joys of living outside the city. It is thought that Huygens wrote his poetry as a testament to himself, a \"memento mori\", because Huygens lost so many dear friends and family during this time: Hooft (1647), Barlaeus (1648), Maria Tesschelschade (1649) and Descartes (1650).\nWriting.\nHe still tried to find time to publish more of his work. In 1647 a number of Huygens' musical creations, \"Pathodia sacra et profana,\" was published in Paris. It contained vocal compositions in Latin (Psalms), French, and Italian (secular texts). The work was dedicated to Utricia Ogle, a niece of an English diplomat.\nIn 1648 Huygens wrote \"Twee ongepaerde handen\" for harpsichord. This work was dedicated to Marietje Casembroot, a twenty-five-year-old harpsichord player, with whom he shared his love of music.\nIn 1657 the collected work of his Dutch poems, the \"Koren-bloemen\" appears. Some of its contents contain: \"Heilighe Daghen\" (1645), \"Ooghen-troost\" (1647), \"Hofwijck\" (1653) and \"Trijntje Cornelis\" (1653). This last work, \"Trijntje Cornelis\", is an explosion of Huygens' creativity. It testifies to the rare language - and expressive capacity - of the author. Considering that the piece was written in a rather short time, it can be considered work of an enormous performance. Since his mother Suzanna was from Antwerp, he visited there often and \"Trijntje Cornelis\" takes place in Antwerp.\nIn 1660 his daughter Suzanna married her cousin, Philips Doublet, son of Huygens' sister Geertruijd. In 1661, a grandfather by now, Huygens was sent to France by the circle of tutors of William III, to recover possession of the county of Orange. The county was returned to the family of Orange-Nassau in 1665 and Huygens returned to the Netherlands.\nOn his return, Huygens designed the new sand road in The Hague, running through the dunes to Scheveningen. He had already planned this road in 1653, and wrote about it in his work the \"Zee-straet\". The road was made according to Huygens' design.\nIn 1676 the second edition of the \"Koren-bloemen\" appeared, a collected work containing 27 books. New in this edition were the \"Zee-straet\", the \"Mengelingh\" (a section of serious poems written after 1657) and seven books with \"snel-dichten\" (quick poems). As he was older now, Huygens found refuge in music. He wrote around 769 compositions during his lifetime.\nLegacy.\nConstantijn Huygens died in The Hague on Good Friday, 28 March 1687 at the age of 90. A week later he was buried in the Grote Kerk in the Hague. His son, the scientist Christiaan Huygens was later buried with his father.\nIn 1947 a literary award was created, the Constantijn Huygens Prize, to honor his legacy.\nConstantijn Huygens in fiction.\nConstantijn Huygens plays a major part in Brian Howell's novel, \"The Curious Case of Jan Torrentius\" (Zagava, D\u00fcsseldorf, 2017), an expanded edition of his previous collection of novellas, \"The Stream and The Torrent: Jan Torrentius and The Followers of the Rosy Cross: Vol.1\" (Zagava/Les \u00c9ditions de L'Oubli, 2014)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The MSA was first defined as the Vero Beach, Florida MSA in 2003. It was renamed Sebastian-Vero Beach, Florida MSA in 2005, and Sebastian-Vero Beach-West Vero Corridor, Florida MSA in 2023. The MSA is included in the Miami-Port St. Lucie-Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Combined Statistical Area.\nOn November 16\u201317, 2023, northern Indian River County was severely impacted by flooding after 14\u201d of rain fell in less than 24 hours.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1821, the area of Indian River County was part of the Spanish colony of East Florida. In 1822, this area became part of St. Johns County, and in 1824 it became part of Mosquito County (original name of Orange County).\nThe Second Seminole War was fought in 1835 and from 1838 to 1839. Fort Vinton was built for this purpose near the intersection of present-day Florida State Road 60 and 122nd Avenue.\nIn 1844, the county's portion of Mosquito County became part of newly created St. Lucia County. In 1855, St. Lucia County was renamed Brevard County. In 1905, St. Lucie County was formed from the southern portion of Brevard County; in 1925 Indian River County was formed from the northern portion of St. Lucie County. It was named for the Indian River, which runs through the eastern portion of the county. In 2025, Indian River County celebrated its centennial for turning 100 years old.\n2023 Floods in North County.\nOn November 16 and 17, 2023, extreme rainfall struck northern Indian River County, causing severe flooding.

An F1 tornado touched down in West Vero Corridor causing $34,000 (2025 USD) in damage.\nA staggering $3.4 billion+ (2025 USD) of damage was inflicted on Indian River County alone, easily making the storm the costliest and most destructive hurricane in Indian River County history.\n2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season.\nOn November 10, 2022, Hurricane Nicole made landfall near Vero Beach as a Category 1 hurricane. Mostly minor damage was reported, however, the iconic Jaycee Beach and Humiston Beach boardwalks sustained significant damage.\nHurricane Milton.\nOn October 9, 2024, as Hurricane Milton approached Florida, Indian River County was part of a prolific tornado outbreak spawned by Milton. \nSeveral strong tornadoes hit the county including the Lakewood Park - Vero Beach EF3 tornado. Severe damage occurred in the Bethel Creek neighborhood of Vero Beach with homes sustaining heavy damage. Numerous other tornadoes also touched down in the county, with two EF1 tornadoes hitting Downtown Vero Beach within the span of 20 minutes, causing extensive damage. An EF2 tornado touched down farther west near Blue Cypress Lake. In total, six tornadoes struck the county. \nFlooding from Hurricane Milton.\nTorrential rainfall also occurred from Milton, causing flash flooding in the county.

Due to County population increases in the early and mid 2000s, Indian River County devised a series of bus routes from Barefoot Bay in southern Brevard County to the south end of Vero Beach. In 2006, GoLine (formerly known as Indian River Transit) was introduced with more stops along and through the Treasure Coast. By 2010, the GoLine system had a total of 14 stops with an additional four stops planned for 2011/2012. Riders pay no fare or fee to board the bus. In 2010 the buses operated between 8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. weekdays and from 9:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. on Saturdays.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 47,319. Its county seat is Marianna.\nHistory.\nJackson County was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 out of Escambia County, at the same time that Duval County was organized from land of St. Johns County, making them the third and fourth counties in the Territory. The county was named for Andrew Jackson, a General of the War of 1812, who had served as Florida's first military governor for six months in 1821. Jackson County originally extended from the Choctawhatchee River on the west to the Suwannee River on the east. By 1840 the county had been reduced close to its present boundaries through the creation of new counties from its original territory, following an increase of population in these areas. Minor adjustments to the county boundaries continued through most of the 19th century, however.\nThere were no towns in Jackson County when it was formed. The first county court met at what was called \"Robinson's Big Spring\" (later called Blue Springs) in 1822 and then at the \"Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee\" in 1823. The following year the county court met at \"Chipola Settlement\", which is also known as Waddell's Mill Pond.\nThe forced labor of enslaved African Americans allowed European Americans to develop this area of Florida as part of the plantation belt in the antebellum years. Cotton was cultivated as a commodity crop by large workgangs, and Florida became a slave society.\nGradually towns were developed. In January 1821, Webbville was established as the first town in Jackson County. It was the first designated as the county seat.\nMarianna was founded in September 1821 by Robert Beveridge, a native of Scotland. It developed about southeast of Webbville. About 1828, Beveridge and other Marianna settlers went to Tallahassee to lobby the state legislature to move the county seat to Marianna.\nThey enticed the Florida Legislature with offers of free land, and to pay locally to construct a county courthouse and develop a related public square. They donated an additional $500 to purchase a quarter section of land to be sold at public auction as a way to finance the new government, if the county seat was moved to Marianna.\nBeveridge and his supporters succeeded in their civic bribe. Marianna became the \"de facto\" county seat of the county justice and civil authority, although it was never officially proclaimed as such. Marianna began to grow and prosper when the county government moved into the new courthouse in 1829. It became the market and court town for the rural county.\nWebbville's prominent citizens moved to Marianna to follow the courts, as did numerous businesses. When the L&amp;N Railroad decided to bypass putting a station at Webbville, the town declined further and became defunct. \nJackson County war.\nAfter the Civil War, the county was convulsed by violence as Confederate veterans and their allies attacked and intimidated freedmen and their sympathizers. The county faced the worst economic conditions in the state, as it had been most extensively developed for cotton plantations before the war, and was adversely affected by the international decline in the market.\nWhite planters resisted dealing with freedmen as free workers. Insurgent Confederate veterans formed a Ku Klux Klan chapter and carried out masked violence to exert power, intimidate freedmen and white sympathizers, suppress their voting, and restore white supremacy.\nPlanters were defaulting on tax payments due to the poor economic conditions, and Republican county officials began to sell thousands of acres in tax sales. In addition the two representatives of the Freedmen's Bureau, Charles Memorial Hamilton and William J. Purman, worked to break the cycle of black labor exploitation. Planters would throw sharecroppers off the land at the end of the season with no payment, claiming infractions that the Bureau deemed minor. The Bureau agents worked to enforce labor contracts.\nTensions broke out into violence and in 1869 Jackson County became the center of a guerrilla war that extended through 1871; it became known as the Jackson County War. The local Ku Klux Klan, insurgent Confederate Army veterans, directed their violence at eradicating the Republican Party in the county, assassinating more than 150 Republican Party leaders and other prominent African Americans as part of a successful campaign to retain white Democratic power in the county. Another source says that in Jackson County, 200 \"leading Republicans\" were assassinated in 1869 and 1870 alone; no one was arrested or brought to trial for these crimes.\nIn testimony to Congressional hearings about the KKK, state senator Charles H. Pearce, minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, said, \"Satan has his seat; he reigns in Jackson County.\"\nPost-Reconstruction era to present.\nViolence by whites against blacks in the county continued after Reconstruction. Nine African Americans were lynched here after Reconstruction, most around the turn of the 20th century. But notorious lynchings of individual men also took place later.\nIn 1934, Claude Neal, an African-American suspect in the murder of a young white woman, was tortured, shot and hanged in a spectacle lynching that was announced beforehand on the radio and in a local paper. It was covered by national newspapers, arousing condemnation.\nIn addition, Neal's lynching was followed by a white riot in Marianna, in which whites attacked the black section of town and blacks on the street, injuring 200, including two police officers, and causing much property damage. Howard Kester, a prominent Southern evangelical minister who tried to improve conditions, assessed the economic and class issues related to the racial violence.\nIn 1943 the last known lynching in the county took place. Cellos Harrison, an African-American man, had been twice convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. He was taken from the county jail in Marianna by a white mob and hanged while his case was being appealed.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.9%) is water. Jackson County is the only county in Florida that borders both Georgia and Alabama and is the closest Florida county to the Tripoint. Jackson County is in the Central Standard Time Zone.

The Chattahoochee River forms the northeast boundary between Jackson County and Seminole County, Georgia. It flows into Lake Seminole. The Lake was formed by the Jim Woodruff Dam, which was completed in 1952.\nThe outflow at the dam becomes the Apalachicola River, which is the eastern boundary of Jackson county with Gadsden county.\nThe Chipola River is formed in north central Jackson county from the confluences of Black Creek and Cowarts Creek. It continues south through the county and becomes a part of the border between Jackson county and the west side of the northern section of Calhoun county.\nHolmes Creek forms the northern portion of the western border of Jackson county with Holmes County.\nBlue Springs is a Jackson county recreation area east of Marianna located near the site of former Florida Governor John Milton's Sylvania plantation.\nTwo other notable water bodies in the county are Compass Lake in the southwest and Ocheesee Pond in the southeast.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nThe 2020 United States census counted 47,319 people, 17,083 households, and 11,179 families in Jackson County, Florida.

In 2020, Trump expanded his margin of victory. Jefferson County consistently backed Democratic candidates in statewide races, but in 2018, Ron DeSantis became the first Republican gubernatorial nominee to win Jefferson County since 1884.

Rising in the Northern Lower Peninsula, the river flows in a generally southeasterly direction to its mouth at Lake Huron at the communities of Au Sable and Oscoda. Like the nearby Manistee River, it is regarded as a premier brown trout fishery east of the Rockies and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has designated it a blue ribbon trout stream. A map from 1795 located in the United States Gazetteer calls it the Beauais River. In French, the river is called the , literally \"Sand River\".\nHistory.\nLocals, including native Americans used the river for hunting, fishing and as an inland link for trapping, trading, and transiting between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. In the late 1800s, the river was used for transporting logs downstream to sawmills and shipping yards in the towns of AuGres and Oscoda. After logging, hydroelectric dams were built during the 1920s to generate power. Today, recreation is the most popular utilization of the river.\nDescription.\nThe main stream of the river is formed at in Frederic Township in Crawford County by the confluence of Kolke and Bradford Creeks, which both rise in Otsego County. The river flows south then turns east through Grayling, where it is joined by the East Branch Au Sable River at . The East Branch rises in Lovells Township, Crawford County at .\nThe Au Sable continues eastward and is joined by the South Branch Au Sable River at in South Branch Township. The South Branch rises out of Lake St. Helen in Richfield Township, Roscommon County at and flows northwest into Roscommon then northeast to the main branch of the Au Sable. The North Branch Au Sable River joins within approximately in eastern Crawford County at \nnear the boundary with Oscoda County. The North Branch rises in Bagley Township, Otsego County, near Lake Otsego.\nThe Au Sable then flows mostly east through Oscoda County, then south and east through Alcona County and Iosco County. The river's watershed also drains portions of Montmorency County and Ogemaw County.\nMost of the main branch of the Au Sable flows through or adjacent to the Huron-Manistee National Forest. of the river, from the Mio Pond downstream to the Alcona Pond, was designated as a National Wild and Scenic River on October 4, 1984. The watershed provides habitat for bald eagle and the endangered Kirtland's warbler. Five percent of the land in the watershed is National Forest and 29% is state forest.\nGrayling.\nThe grayling species of fish was once abundant in the Au Sable River, although the species has been extirpated in Michigan since 1936.\nBrook trout were released into the river in the 1880s and proved stronger than the grayling.\nThere have been many attempts to bring the grayling back to the area, but none have been successful. The city of Grayling, Michigan was named after the once plentiful fish. Brown trout is the current main catch.\nRecreation.\nActivities include paddle sports (kayaking and canoeing), fishing, primitive camping, backpacking and hiking. There are several \"developed\" campgrounds as well as primitive campgrounds. \nIt is a designated trout stream, and many canoe liveries exist along the river, which offer paddling trips from a few hours to as long as a week. Impoundments of five of the six dams on the Au Sable create lakes that are used for power boating, water skiing and sail boating.\nIn addition to brown, rainbow and brook trout in the river, there are perch, muskellunge and walleye, large and smallmouth bass, northern pike and bluegill in the dam ponds. Salmon and steelhead trout are popular during spring and fall spawning migrations. \nHoly waters.\nThe nine-mile section of the Au Sable River main branch from Burtons Landing to Wakeley Bridge is called the \"Holy Waters\" due to the frequent insect hatches, abundance of trout, and ease of wading. The section is regulated year-round as catch and release and limited to fly fishing only (no live bait). The river flows through scenic woodlands where the ecosystem supports dozens of species of birds and other wildlife including deer, rabbit, muskrat, otter, mink, fox, squirrel, chipmonk, skunk and turtle.\nLodges.\nFor serious fly-fishing anglers, several locations offer accommodations on the Au Sable River.\n\"WaWa Sum Lodge\"' at Whirlpool Road is owned and operated by Michigan State University as a research facility and conference center. The main lodge was constructed in 1922 and the property includes 251 Acres on the Au Sable. There are seven dorm style bedrooms, each with three or four single beds. You must bring your own bedding or sleeping bags and towels. Sleeping capacity is 28. A great room and fireplace is there for socializing as is a screened-in porch. A separate building has a dining room that seats 16 and kitchen facilities.\n\"AuSable Riverview Resort\" at McMasters Bridge has several options. The \"Big Cabin\" has 8 bedrooms that sleep up to 20 guests, a chef\u2019s kitchen and game room, dry sauna and fire pit. The \"Cottage\" sleeps 10 and has two separate sleeping quarters that are connected by a kitchen/dining room with a large sliding door patio. Four smaller \"Cabins\" accommodate 2-4 persons.\n\"Gates Au Sable Lodge\", located at Stephan Bridge, has been a local landmark for more than 50 years catering to fly fishing. Their restaurant and Fly Shop is open to the public. Professional fly fishermen offer instruction and guided fishing trips on all branches of the Au Sable and Manistee Rivers using the unique Au Sable riverboats and wading trips. A daily fishing report is produced for their guests that includes the current insect hatch status.\nOrganizations.\nThe Trout Unlimited organization was begun in 1959 by 16 Michigan fishermen on the AuSable River.\nAverage water temperature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Bar chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRiver valley attractions and events.\nDocuseries.\nA three-part documentary entitled, \"Au Sable\" was released in 2024 on YouTube and aired on local public-access TV stations. It was subtitled, \"The River. The Race. The Legends.\" Narrated by George Blaha, voice of the Detroit Pistons and Michigan State Spartans, it was created by Justin Garant and Darren Cleavenger-Grimsley, two employees of Consumers Energy, primary sponsor of the ARCM since 2012. The Production Team from Consumers Energy provided assistance, as did the volunteers from the AuSable River Canoe Marathon staff.\nOn June 15, 2024, the project won an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Sports Documentary\" from the Michigan chapter of the organization.\nDrainage basin.\nThe Au Sable has a drainage basin of and an average flow of 1,100\u00a0ft3/s (31 m3/s) at its mouth. The river drops from its source at the junction of the Bradford and Kolka Creeks\nand drains land in the following counties:\nRiver dams.\nOrdered from upriver to downriver, all belonging to the power company Consumers Energy:\nHistorical markers.\nThe river has five historical markers on it:\nRiver access.\nA Michigan \"Recreation Passport\" is required for motor vehicles to access state parks, recreation areas, boating access, campgrounds and trails. Parks and recreation areas are mostly self-supporting, and the Recreation Passport is separate from camping, lodging, harbor and shelter fees.\nThe Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) maintains over 20 \"Public Access Sites\" on the Au Sable River for fishing and boating egress and ingress. Many have vault toilets and Hand pumps for potable water. Some allow camping but all require a current Recreation Passport.\nThe United States Forest Service (USFS) maintains numerous camping and public access sites in the Huron-Manistee National Forests. All dams on the AuSable River are owned and operated by Consumers Energy (CE).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72398", "revid": "49634828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72398", "title": "The Man Who Would Be King", "text": "1888 short story by Rudyard Kipling\n\"The Man Who Would Be King\" is an 1888 short story by Rudyard Kipling about two British adventurers in British India who become kings of Kafiristan, a remote part of Afghanistan. The story was first published in \"The Phantom 'Rickshaw and Other Tales\" (1888); it also appeared in \"Wee Willie Winkie and Other Child Stories\" (1895) and numerous later editions of that collection. It has been adapted for other media a number of times.\nPlot summary.\nThe narrator of the story is a Victorian journalist, correspondent of \"The Northern Star\" in India during the British Raj: Kipling himself, in all but name. Whilst on a tour of some Indian native states, in 1886, he meets two scruffy adventurers, Daniel Dravot and Peachey Tolliver Carnehan. Softened by their stories, he agrees to help them in a small errand, but later he regrets this and informs the authorities about them, which prevents them from blackmailing a minor rajah. A few months later, the pair appear at the narrator's newspaper office in Lahore, where they tell him of a plan they have hatched. They declare that, after years of trying their hands at all manner of things, they have decided that India is not big enough for them, so they intend to go to Kafiristan and set themselves up as kings. Dravot, disguised as a priest, and Carnehan, as his servant, will go to the unexplored region armed with twenty Martini-Henry rifles and their British military knowledge. Once there, they plan to find a king or chief and help him defeat his enemies before taking over for themselves. They ask the narrator to see books, encyclopedias, and maps about the area as a favour, both because they are fellow Freemasons and because he spoiled their blackmail scheme. In an attempt to prove that they are not crazy, they show the narrator a contract they have drawn up between themselves which swears loyalty between the pair and total abstinence from women and alcohol until they are kings.\nTwo years later, on a scorching hot summer night, Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags who has trouble staying focused, but he tells an amazing story: he says he and Dravot succeeded in becoming kings. They traversed treacherous mountains, found the Kafirs, mustered an army, and took over villages, all the while dreaming of building a unified nation or even an empire. The Kafirs were impressed by the rifles and Dravot's lack of fear of their pagan idols, and they soon began to acclaim him as a god and descendant of Alexander the Great; they exhibited a whiter complexion than the natives of the surrounding areas (\"so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends\"), implying an ancient lineage going back to Alexander and some of his troops themselves. Dravot and Carnehan were shocked to discover that the Kafirs practiced a form of Masonic ritual, and their reputations were cemented when they showed knowledge of Masonic secrets beyond those known by even the highest of the Kafir priests and chiefs.\nThe schemes of Dravot and Carnehan were dashed, however, when Dravot, against the advice of Carnehan, decided it was time to marry a Kafir girl\u2014kingship going to his head, he decided he needed a queen to give him a royal son. Terrified by the idea of marrying a god, the girl bit Dravot when he tried to kiss her during the wedding ceremony. Seeing him bleed, the priests cried that he was \"Neither God nor Devil but a man!\" and most of the Kafirs turned against Dravot and Carnehan. A few of their men remained loyal, but the army defected and the two kings were captured. Dravot, wearing his crown, stood on a rope bridge over a gorge while the Kafirs cut the ropes, and he fell to his death. Carnehan was crucified between two pine trees, but, when he survived this torture for a whole day, the Kafirs considered it a miracle and let him go. He then slowly begged his way back to India over the course of a year.\nAs proof of his tale, Carnehan shows the narrator Dravot's severed head and golden crown before he leaves, taking the head and crown, which he swears never to sell, with him. The following day, the narrator sees Carnehan crawling along the road in the noon sun with his hat off. He has gone mad, so the narrator sends him to the local asylum. When he inquires two days later, he learns that Carnehan has died of sunstroke. No belongings were found with him.\nAcknowledged sources.\nKafiristan was recognized as a real place by at least one early Kipling scholar, Arley Munson, who in 1915 called it \"a small tract of land in the northeastern part of Afghanistan,\" though she wrongly thought the \"only source of information is the account of the Mahomedan traders who have entered the country.\" By then, Kafiristan had been literally wiped off the map and renamed \"Nuristan\" in Amir Abdur Rahman Khan's 1895 conquest, and it was soon forgotten by literary critics who, under the sway of the New Criticism, read the story as an allegory of the British Raj. The disappearance of Kafiristan was so complete that a 1995 \"New York Times\" article referred to it as \"the mythical, remote kingdom at the center of the Kipling story.\"\nAs the New Historicism replaced the New Criticism, scholars rediscovered the story's historical Kafiristan, aided by the trail of sources left in it by Kipling himself, in the form of the publications the narrator supplies to Dravot and Carnehan: \nPossible models.\nIn addition to Kipling's acknowledged sources, a number of individuals have been proposed as possible models for the story's main characters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located in the central part of the archipelago, it consists of several islands, primarily surrounding the Visayan Sea, although the Visayas are also considered the northeast extremity of the entire Sulu Sea. Its inhabitants are predominantly the Visayan peoples.\nThe major islands of the Visayas are Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Leyte and Samar. The region may also include the provinces of Palawan, Romblon, and Masbate, whose populations identify as Visayan and whose languages are more closely related to other Visayan languages than to the major languages of Luzon.\nThere are four administrative regions in the Visayas: Western Visayas (pop. 4.73 million), Negros Island Region (pop. 4.76 million), Central Visayas (6.54 million) and Eastern Visayas (4.5 million).\nEtymology.\nPre-colonial etymology.\nFrom the 1950s to 1960s there were spurious claims by various authors that \"Bisaya\" is derived from the historical empire of \"Sri Vijaya\" which came from the Sanskrit term \"\u015ar\u012bvijaya\" (\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f), arguing that the Visayans were either settlers from Sri Vijaya or were subjects of it.

But as the linguist Eugene Verstraelen pointed out, \"Vijaya\" would evolve into \"Bidaya\" or \"Biraya\", not \"Bisaya\", based on how other Sanskrit-derived loanwords become integrated into Philippine languages.\nThe name has also been hypothesized to be related to the Bisaya ethnic group of Borneo, the latter incidentally recounted in the controversial \"Maragtas\" epic as the alleged origins of the ancestral settlers in Panay. However historical, archeological, and linguistic evidence for this are still paltry. The languages of the Bisaya of Borneo and of the Bisaya of the Philippines do not show any special correlation, apart from the fact that they all belong to the same Austronesian family. This is contested by Historian Robert Nicholl who implied that the Srivijayans of Sumatra, Vijayans of Vijayapura at Brunei and the Visayans in the Philippines were all related and connected to each other since they form one contiguous area. On a similar note, according to an early Spanish missionary and historian P. Francisco Colin, S.J. in the Philippines, the inhabitants of Panay Island were originally from north Sumatra. Similarly there are claims that it was the name of a folk hero (allegedly \"Sri Visaya\") or that it originated from the exclamation \"Bisai-yah!\" (\"How beautiful!\") by the Sultan of Brunei who was visiting Visayas for the first time. All these claims have been challenged and remain as mere speculations and folk etymologies.\nColonial etymology.\nThe exact meaning and origin of the name of the Visayas is unknown. The first documented use of the name is possibly by Song-era Chinese maritime official Zhao Rugua as the \"Pi-sho-ye\", who raided the coasts of Fujian and Penghu during the late 12th century using iron javelins attached to ropes as their weapons.\nVisayans were first referred to by the general term \"Pintados\" (\"the painted ones\") by the Spanish, in reference to the prominent practice of full-body tattooing (batok). The word \"Bisaya\", on the other hand, was first documented in Spanish sources in reference to the non-Ati inhabitants of the island of Panay. However, it is likely that the name was already used as a general endonym by Visayans long before Spanish colonization, as evidenced by at least once instance of a place named \"Bisaya\" in coastal eastern Mindanao as reported by the Loaisa (c.1526), Saavedra (c.1528), and the Villalobos (c.1543) expeditions. It is likely that the reason the Spanish did not use the term generally until the later decades of the 1500s is due to the fact that people were more likely to identify themselves with more specific ethnic names like \"Sugbuanon\".\nIn \"Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas\" (1609) by Antonio de Morga, he specifies that the name \"Bi\u00e7aya\" is synonymous with \"Pintados\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"South of this district lie the islands of Bi\u00e7ayas, or, as they are also called, Pintados. They are many in number, thickly populated with natives. Those of most renown are Leite, Ybabao, \u00c7amar, Bohol, island of Negros, Sebu, Panay, Cuyo, and the Calamianes. All the natives of these islands, both men and women, are well-featured, of a good disposition, and of better nature, and more noble in their actions than the inhabitants of the islands of Luzon and its vicinity.\nThey differ from them in their hair, which the men wear cut in a cue, like the ancient style in Espa\u00f1a. Their bodies are tattooed with many designs, but the face is not touched. They wear large earrings of gold and ivory in their ears, and bracelets of the same; certain scarfs wrapped round the head, very showy, which resemble turbans, and knotted very gracefully and edged with gold. They wear also a loose collarless jacket with tight sleeves, whose skirts reach half way down the leg. These garments are fastened in front and are made of medri\u00f1aque and colored silks. They wear no shirts or drawers, but bahaques of many wrappings, which cover their privy parts, when they remove their skirts and jackets. The women are good-looking and graceful. They are very neat, and walk slowly. Their hair is black, long, and drawn into a knot on the head. Their robes are wrapped about the waist and fall downward. These are made of all colors, and they wear collarless jackets of the same material. Both men and women go naked and without any coverings, and barefoot, and with many gold chains, earrings, and wrought bracelets.\nTheir weapons consist of large knives curved like cutlasses, spears, and cara\u00e7as. They employ the same kinds of boats as the inhabitants of Luzon. They have the same occupations, products, and means of gain as the inhabitants of all the other islands. These Visayans are a race less inclined to agriculture, and are skilful in navigation, and eager for war and raids for pillage and booty, which they call mangubas. This means \"to go out for plunder.\"\nThe language of all the Pintados and Bi\u00e7ayas is one and the same, by which they understand one another when talking, or when writing with the letters and characters of their own which they possess. These resemble those of the Arabs. The common manner of writing among the natives is on leaves of trees, and on bamboo bark. \nHistory.\nAmong the Chinese, especially during the Ming era, the Visayans are called Peshiye.\nThe areas known as Pisheye were probably located in lowland coastal regions with minimal agricultural activity, a description that primarily fit the Rajahnate of Cebu and secondarily, the neighboring kingdoms: Dapitan, Madja-as, and Butuan; fit well.\nThe Visayans, known for their seafaring prowess, frequently conducted raids on the southern coasts of China. Their targets included major cities such as Quanzhou, along with smaller towns like Shui'ao and Weito. These attacks were launched from their operational base located in Eastern Taiwan.\nWang's account of the locals' appearance aligns with descriptions of the Pintados people. He noted that both men and women gathered their hair into topknots (\u7537\u5973\u64ae\u9afb, nan n\u00fc cuo ji) and used ink to tattoo their bodies up to the neck (\u4ee5\u58a8\u6c41\u523a\u8eab\u81f3\u982d\u9838, yi mo zhi ci shen zhi tou jing).\nAfter the defeat of the Magellan expedition at the Battle of Mactan by Lapu-Lapu, King Philip II of Spain sent Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi in 1543 and 1565 to colonize the islands for Spain. Subsequently, the Visayas region and many kingdoms began converting to Christianity and adopting western culture. By the 18th and 19th centuries, the effects of colonization on various ethnic groups turned sour and revolutions such as those of Francisco Dagohoy began to emerge.\nVarious personalities who fought against the Spanish colonial government arose within the archipelago. Among the notable ones are Teresa Magbanua, Graciano Lopez Jaena and Martin Delgado from Iloilo, Aniceto Lacson, Le\u00f3n Kilat and Diego de la Vi\u00f1a from Negros, Venancio Jakosalem Fernandez from Cebu, and two personalities from Bohol by the name of Tamblot, who led the Tamblot Uprising in 1621 to 1622 and Francisco Dagohoy, the leader of the Bohol Rebellion that lasted from 1744 to 1829. Negros briefly stood as an independent nation in the Visayas in the form of the Cantonal Republic of Negros, before it was absorbed back to the Philippines because of the American takeover of the archipelago.\nThe short-lived Federal State of the Visayas was established as a revolutionary state during the Philippine Revolution. It designated Iloilo City as the Visayas capital and was composed of three governments: the Provisional Government of the District of Visayas (Panay), the Cantonal Government of Negros, the Cantonal Government of Bohol, and the island of Cebu, which was under revolutionary control.\nOn May 23, 2005, Palawan (including its highly urbanized capital city of Puerto Princesa) was transferred from Mimaropa (Region IV-B) to Western Visayas (Region VI) under \"Executive Order No. 429\", signed by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who was the president at that year. However, Palawe\u00f1os criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa and all Palawan municipalities but one, preferring to stay in Mimaropa (Region IV-B). Consequently, \"Administrative Order No. 129\" was issued on August 19, 2005, that the implementation of \"E.O. 429\" be held in abeyance, pending approval by the president of its Implementation Plan. The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results. As of 2011[ [update]], the abeyance was still in effect, with Palawan and its capital city remaining under Mimaropa (Region IV-B).\nOn May 29, 2015, the twin provinces of Negros Occidental (including its highly urbanized capital city, Bacolod) and Negros Oriental were joined to form the Negros Island Region under \"Executive Order No. 183\", signed by President Benigno Aquino III. It separated both, the former province and its capital city from Western Visayas and the latter province from Central Visayas.\nOn August 9, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed \"Executive Order No. 38\", revoking the \"Executive Order No. 183\" signed by his predecessor, President Benigno Aquino III, on May 29, 2015, due to the reason of the lack of funds to fully establish the NIR according to Benjamin Diokno, the Secretary of Budget and Management.\nOn June 13, 2024, the Negros Island Region was re-established, with the inclusion of Siquijor.\nMythical allusions and hypotheses.\nHistorical documents written in 1907 by Visayan historian Pedro Alc\u00e1ntara Monteclaro in his book \"Maragtas\" tell the story of the ten leaders (Datus) who escaped from the tyranny of Rajah Makatunaw from Borneo and came to the islands of Panay. The chiefs and followers were said to be the ancestors (from the collapsing empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit) of the Visayan people. The documents were accepted by Filipino historians and found their way into the history of the Philippines. As a result, the arrival of Bornean tribal groups in the Visayas (From Vijayapura a Srivijayan vassal state in Borneo) is celebrated in the festivals of the Dinagyang in Iloilo City, Ati-Atihan in Kalibo, Aklan, and Binirayan in San Jose de Buenavista, Antique. Foreign historians such as William Henry Scott maintains that the book contains a Visayan folk tradition.A contemporary theory based on a study of genetic markers in present-day populations is that Austronesian peoples from Taiwan populated the larger island of Luzon and headed south to the Visayas and Mindanao, and then to Indonesia and Malaysia, then to Pacific Islands and finally to the island of Madagascar, at the west of the Indian Ocean. The study, though, may not explain inter-island migrations, which are also possible, such as Filipinos migrating to any other Philippine provinces. There has even been backmigration to the island of Taiwan, as the historian Efren B. Isorena, through analysis of historical accounts and wind currents in the Pacific side of East and Southeast Asia, concluded that the Pisheye of Taiwan and the Bisaya of the Visayas islands in the Philippines, were closely related people as Visayans were recorded to have travelled to Taiwan from the Philippines via the northward windcurrents before they raided China and returned south after the southwards monsoon during summer.\nGeography.\nVisayas region is located in central Philippines, with a total land area of . It consists of seven large and several hundred smaller islands, including Samar, Negros, Panay, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol, Guimaras, Biliran, Siquijor, Panaon and Bantayan. Some of the largest cities in the region include Cebu City (population 1,024,945 in 2023), Bacolod City (population 648,773 in 2023), and Iloilo City (population 491,641 in 2023).\nList of islands by population.\nThe following numbers are derived from the 2015 Philippine census.\nCulture and festivals.\nVisayans are recognized as hospitable, religious, fun, and robust people. They love to party and celebrate birthdays, graduations, baptisms, weddings, and holidays. Visayans like to sing (Karaoke) while drinking and dancing during these celebrations. They love to cook traditional foods like Suman, Sapin- Sapin, and Bibingka made with sticky rice during Halloween. They visited their dead loved ones at the cemetery. Aside from celebrations, Visayas has sweet and delicious mangoes that you can find in Guimaras near Iloilo City. White Beach Resort is called Boracay. It is a well-known beautiful beach located in Western Visayas at Caticlan Province. Many foreign people love to visit this beach, which is full of fun summer activities and beachside restaurants, bars, and souvenir shops. You can also find the Seafood Capital of the Philippines, located at Roxas, City Province of Capiz. You can taste fresh seafood daily, like shrimp, crabs, prawns, seashells, and fish.\nVisayans honor their traditions and culture by celebrating festivals as they are known to be Roman Catholic or Christian in religion. These festivals are celebrated in tribute to their saints, to share peace and happiness, to give thanks for the abundant harvest, and to advertise their products. Visayans are known for their different festivals celebrated in other cities of Visayan Island.\nSinulog Festival is celebrated every third Sunday in January in Cebu City. This festival is a tribute to their saint, Senior Santo Nino de Cebu. The Sinulog festival includes parades, fluvial processions, dances, Cebu beauty pageants, and sometimes arts contests. Some other parts of Cebu provinces participate in the celebration by performing traditional dances and decorating a float, or Higantes, to represent their patron.Ati-Atihan Festival is celebrated every third Sunday in January, like Sinulog Festival. It is held in Kalibo, Aklan, on Panay Island, where the first indigenous people settled, called Aestas, or Ati's. This festival devotes to the mystery of baby Jesus and Indigenous people. The people who participate paint their bodies and face and wear indigenous costumes and props. The festival included music, drums, and parades for several days.\nDinagyang Festival is celebrated in Iloilo City on the fourth Sunday of January.\u00a0 This festival marks the baby Jesus Senior Sto. Nino. At Ati-Atihan Festival in Aklan, Dinagyang also has Ati's dancing to celebrate the entry of Malay in Panay Island, colorful costumes, and a Pageant for Miss Iloilo; Sadsad is a procession with a decorated float. Schools and businesses in Barangays in this city participate in dancing competitions at this festival.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAdministratively, the Visayas is divided into 4 regions, namely Western Visayas, Negros Island Region, Central Visayas, and Eastern Visayas.\nThe Visayas is composed of 16 provinces, each headed by a Governor. A governor is elected by popular vote and can serve a maximum of three terms consisting of three years each.\nWestern Visayas (Region VI).\nWestern Visayas consists of the islands of Panay and Guimaras. The regional center is Iloilo City. Its provinces are:\nNegros Island Region (NIR).\nNegros Island Region consists of the islands of Negros and Siquijor. The interim regional centers are Bacolod and Dumaguete. Its provinces are:\nCentral Visayas (Region VII).\nCentral Visayas includes the islands of Cebu and Bohol. The regional center is Cebu City. Its provinces are:\nEastern Visayas (Region VIII).\nEastern Visayas consists of the islands of Leyte, Samar and Biliran. The regional center is Tacloban City. Its provinces are:\nScholars have argued that the region of Mimaropa and the province of Masbate are all part of the Visayas in line with the non-centric view. This is contested by a few politicians in line with the Manila-centric view.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLanguages.\nLanguages spoken at home are primarily Visayan languages despite the usual misconception that these are dialects of a single macrolanguage. Cebuano is the largest native language spoken on Visayas Island, where approximately 20 million natives speak it. Major languages include Hiligaynon or Ilonggo in Western Visayas, Cebuano in Central Visayas, and Waray in Eastern Visayas. Other dominant languages are Aklanon, Kinaray-a, and Capiznon. Filipino, the 'national language' based on Tagalog, is widely understood but occasionally used. English, another official language, is more widely known and is preferred as the second language most especially among urbanized Visayans. For instance, English rather than Tagalog is frequently used in schools, public signs, and mass media.\n\"Cebuano\" versus \"Bisaya\".\nThere has been ongoing contention regarding the use of the word Bisaya among speakers of Visayan languages. The term \"Bisaya\" broadly refers to the people of the Visayas region in the Philippines, as well as those who have migrated to other parts of the country, including Luzon and Mindanao. The Visayas region encompasses several ethnolinguistic groups and languages, including Hiligaynon, Cebuano, Waray, and others, which are distinct and not mutually intelligible, despite belonging to the same language family.\nOver the years, \"Bisaya\" has often been used interchangeably with Cebuano in many parts of the country, though this practice is context-dependent and varies across regions. Cebuano-speaking settlers in Mindanao and other areas outside Cebu frequently refer to themselves and their language as Bisaya to distinguish themselves from the people of Cebu and their dialect. To address this ambiguity, some propose using the term Sinugbuanong Binisaya (which has been the term used in basic education) to specify Cebuano, while others suggest Binisaya as a broader term. Surveys, such as those conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), often separate Bisaya and Cebuano, despite the two being mutually intelligible. Ethnologue, however, only lists Cebuano as a language. In Western Visayas, \"Bisaya\" may refer to Hiligaynon or Kinaray-a speakers, whereas in Eastern Visayas, it may denote Waray speakers.\nIn Mindanao, migrant ethnic groups from Luzon and indigenous peoples have assimilated into predominantly Cebuano-speaking societies (or Hiligaynon-speaking communities in the case of Soccsksargen) over the years. Many of these individuals now identify as Visayans after learning Cebuano, though they often retain knowledge of their non-Visayan roots and may still speak their ancestral languages fluently as a second or third language.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its area is 682\u00a0km2, and its population is 167,901 (2022).\nIt is situated at the tip of the gulf with the same name (Gulf of Edremit), with its town centre a few kilometres inland, and is an important centre of trade, along with the other towns that are situated on the same gulf (namely Ayval\u0131k, G\u00f6me\u00e7, Burhaniye and Havran). It is also one of the largest district centres of Bal\u0131kesir Province. The district of Edremit, especially around Kazda\u011f\u0131, is largely covered with forests. The mayor of Edremit municipality is Selman Hasan Arslan.\nHistory.\nThe modern city of Edremit is named after the ancient Greek city of Adramyttion () or Adramytteion (\u1f08\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03cd\u03c4\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), a city of Asia Minor on the coast of Aeolis which is near the modern city of Burhaniye.\nTahtac\u0131 Turkmen, descendants of the army of Shah Ismail I, settled in the mountains near Edremit after their defeat in the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514.\nBy 1819, Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn recorded that Edremit was only populated by \"a few Greek fishermen\". In 1912, the town had 6200 inhabitants, 1200 of which were Greeks. At this time, the district had 19 Greek schools and roughly 600 pupils.\nIn May 1914, thousands of Muslim refugees who had fled from the Balkans arrived in the town of Edremit and proceeded to ransack the shops and homes of the town's Greek community. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, the Ottoman government armed and organised the refugees. Many Greek refugees found refuge in the town church before fleeing to the harbour where they were then granted passage to the nearby Greek island of Lesbos. Turks continued to massacre or expel Greeks in the following months in surrounding villages as part of the wider Greek genocide throughout Turkey.\nAmidst the Greek Summer Offensive of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922, Edremit was seized by the Army of Asia Minor on 19 June 1920 and a Turkish Nationalist counterattack near the town was repelled. It remained under Greek control until their withdrawal in late August 1922, following which the entire region was recaptured by the Turks and all remaining Greeks fled or were killed by the Turkish army.\nComposition.\nThere are 47 neighbourhoods in Edremit District:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nEdremit has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\"), with hot, dry summers, and cool, wet winters.\nTwin towns \u2014 sister cities.\nEdremit is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

As a botanist and cartographer, he gave his name to several seaweeds, plants and shrubs and to places such as d'Urville Island in New Zealand.\nEarly life and education.\nDumont was born at Cond\u00e9-sur-Noireau in Lower Normandy. His father, Gabriel Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumont, sieur d'Urville (1728\u20131796), Bailiff of Cond\u00e9-sur-Noireau, was, like his ancestors, responsible to the court of Cond\u00e9.\nHis mother Jeanne Fran\u00e7oise Victoire Julie (1754\u20131832) came from Croisilles, Calvados, and was a rigid and formal woman from an ancient family of the rural nobility of Lower Normandy. The child was weak and often sickly.\nAfter the death of his father when he was six, his mother's brother, the Abbot of Croisilles, played the part of his father and from 1798 took charge of his education. The Abbot taught him Latin, Greek, rhetoric and philosophy. From 1804 Dumont studied at the \"lyc\u00e9e Imp\u00e9rial\" in Caen.\nIn the library of Caen, he read the Encyclop\u00e9distes and the reports of travel of Bougainville, Cook and Anson, and he became passionate about these matters.\nAt the age of 17 years he failed the physical tests of the entrance exam to the \u00c9cole polytechnique and he therefore decided to enlist in the navy.\nMilitary career.\nIn 1807, Dumont was admitted to the \u00c9cole navale at Brest where he presented himself as a timid young man, very serious and studious, little interested in amusements and much more interested in studies than in military matters. In 1808, he obtained the grade of first-class candidate.\nAt the time the neglected French navy was of a much lower quality than Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e, and its ships were blockaded in their ports by the absolute domination of the British Royal Navy. Dumont was confined to land like his colleagues and spent the first years in the navy studying foreign languages.\nIn 1812, after having been promoted to ensign and finding himself bored with port life and disapproving of the dissolute behaviour of the other young officers, he asked to be transferred to Toulon on board the \"Suffren\"; but this ship was also blockaded in port.\nDuring this period, Dumont built on his already substantial cultural knowledge. He already spoke, in addition to Latin and Greek, English, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese and Hebrew. During his later travels in the Pacific, thanks to his prodigious memory, he would acquire some knowledge of an immense number of dialects of Polynesia and Melanesia. Meanwhile, ashore at Toulon, he learnt about botany and entomology in long excursions in the hills of Provence and he studied in the nearby naval observatory.\nFinally in 1814, when Napoleon had been exiled to Elba, Dumont undertook his first short navigation of the Mediterranean Sea. In 1815, he married Ad\u00e8le P\u00e9pin, daughter of a clockmaker from Toulon. who was openly disliked by Dumont's mother, who thought her inappropriate for her son and refused to meet her.\nIn the Aegean Sea.\nIn 1819, Dumont d'Urville sailed on board \"Chevrette\", under the command of Captain Gauttier-Duparc, to carry out a hydrographic survey of the islands of the Greek archipelago. During a pause near the island of Milos, the local French representative brought to Dumont's attention the rediscovery of a marble statue a few days before (8 April 1820) by a local peasant. The statue, now known as the \"Venus de Milo\", dates from around the year 130 BC.\nDumont recognised its value and would have acquired it immediately, but the ship's commander pointed out that there was not enough space on board for an object of its size. Moreover, the expedition was likely to proceed through stormy seas that could damage it. Dumont then wrote to the French ambassador to Constantinople about its discovery. \"Chevrette\" arrived in Constantinople on 22 April and Dumont succeeded in convincing the ambassador to acquire the statue.\nMeanwhile, the peasant had sold the statue to a priest, Macario Verghis, who wished to present it as a gift to an interpreter for the Sultan in Constantinople. The French ambassador's representative arrived just as the statue was being loaded aboard a ship bound for Constantinople and persuaded the island's primates (chief citizens) to annul the sale and honour the first offer. This earned Dumont the title of \"Chevalier\" (knight) of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, the attention of the French Academy of Sciences and promotion to lieutenant; and France gained a new, magnificent statue for the Louvre in Paris.\nVoyage of \"Coquille\".\nOn his return from the voyage of \"Chevrette\", Dumont was sent to the naval archive, where he encountered Lieutenant Louis-Isidore Duperrey, a past acquaintance. The two began to plan an expedition of exploration in the Pacific, an area out of which France had been forced during the Napoleonic Wars. France considered it might be able to regain some of its losses by taking over part of New South Wales. On 11 August 1822, the ship \"Coquille\" sailed from Toulon with the objective of collecting as much scientific and strategic information as possible on the area to which it was dispatched. Duperrey was named Commander of the expedition because he was four years older than Dumont. On the second voyage of the \"Astrolabe\" in 1840, Dumont discovered the Ad\u00e9lie penguin, which is named after his wife.\nRen\u00e9-Primev\u00e8re Lesson travelled on \"Coquille\" as a naval doctor and naturalist. On the return to France in March 1825, Lesson and Dumont brought an imposing collection of animals and plants collected on the Falkland Islands, on the coasts of Chile and Peru, in the archipelagos of the Pacific and New Zealand, New Guinea, and Australia. Dumont was now 35 and in poor health. On board \"Coquille\", he had behaved as a competent official, but disinclined to military discipline and subordination. On the return to France, Duperrey and Dumont were promoted to commander.\nCollection.\nOn \"Coquille\", Dumont tried to reconcile his responsibilities as second in command with his need to carry out scientific work. He was in charge of carrying out research in the fields of botany and entomology. \"La Coquille\" brought back to France specimens of more than 3,000 species of plants, 400 of which were previously unknown, enriching moreover the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris with more than 1,200 specimens of insects, covering 1,100 insect species (including 300 previously unknown species). The scientists Georges Cuvier and Fran\u00e7ois Arago analysed the results of his searches and praised Dumont.\nAs a botanist and cartographer, Dumont d'Urville left his mark on New Zealand. He gave his name to the genus of seaweeds \"Durvillaea\", which includes southern bull-kelp; the seaweed \"Grateloupia urvilleana\"; the species of grass tree \"Dracophyllum urvilleanum\"; the shrub \"Hebe urvilleana\" and the buttercup \"Ranunculus urvilleanus\".\nFirst voyage of \"Astrolabe\".\nTwo months after Dumont d'Urville returned on \"La Coquille\", he presented to the Navy Ministry a plan for a new expedition, which he hoped to command, as his relationship with Duperrey had deteriorated. The proposal was accepted and \"La Coquille\" was renamed the in honour of one of the ships of La P\u00e9rouse, and sailed from Toulon on 22 April 1826, towards the Pacific Ocean, for a circumnavigation of the world that was destined to last nearly three years.\nThe new \"Astrolabe\" skirted the coast of southern Australia, carried out new relief maps of the South Island of New Zealand, including improved surveys of the Marlborough Sounds in which he navigated through the narrow and treacherous French Pass and mapped d'Urville Island, which James Cook had mapped as being part of the mainland.\n\"Astrolabe\" sailed up the east coast of the North Island, creating comprehensive coastline maps of New Zealand. The ship spent six days in the Bay of Islands taking on food and water before sailing for Tonga.\n\"Astrolabe\" visited Fiji, then Dumont executed the first relief maps of the Loyalty Islands (part of French New Caledonia) and explored the coasts of New Guinea. He identified the site of La P\u00e9rouse's shipwreck in Vanikoro (one of the Santa Cruz Islands, part of the archipelago of the Solomon Islands) and collected numerous remains of his boats. The voyage continued with the mapping of part of the Caroline Islands and the Moluccas. \"Astrolabe\" returned to Marseille on 25 March 1829, with an impressive load of hydrographical papers and collections of zoological, botanical and mineralogical reports, which were destined to strongly influence the scientific analysis of those regions. Following this expedition, he invented the terms Malaisia, \"Micronesia\" and \"Melanesia\", distinguishing these Pacific cultures and island groups from Polynesia.\nDumont's health was by now weakened by years of a poor diet. He suffered from kidney and stomach problems and from intense attacks of gout. During the first thirteen years of their marriage, half of which passed far apart, Ad\u00e9lie and Jules had two sons. The first one died at a young age while his father was aboard \"La Coquille\" and the second, also called Jules, on the return of his father after four years away.\nDumont d'Urville passed a short period with his family before returning to Paris, where he was promoted to captain and he was put in charge of writing the report of his travels. The five volumes were published at the expense of the French government between 1832 and 1834. During these years d'Urville, who was already a poor diplomat, became more irascible and rancorous as a result of his gout, and lost the sympathy of the naval leadership. In his report, he criticised harshly the military structures, his colleagues, the French Academy of Sciences and even the King \u2013 none of whom, in his opinion, had given the voyage of \"Astrolabe\" due acknowledgment.\nIn 1835, Dumont was directed to return to Toulon to engage in \"down to earth\" work and spent two years, marked by mournful events (notably the loss of a daughter from cholera) and happy events (notably the birth of another son, \u00c9mile) but with the constant and nearly obsessive thought of a third expedition to the Pacific, analogous to James Cook's third voyage. He looked again at \"Astrolabe\"'s travel notes, and found a gap in the exploration of Oceania and, in January 1837, he wrote to the Navy Ministry suggesting the opportunity for a new expedition to the Pacific.\nSecond voyage of \"Astrolabe\".\nKing Louis Philippe approved the plan, but he ordered that the expedition aim for the South Magnetic Pole and to claim it for France; if that was not possible, Dumont's expedition was asked to equal the most southerly latitude of 74\u00b034'S achieved in 1823 by James Weddell. Thus France became part of the international competition for polar exploration, along with the United States and the United Kingdom.\nDumont was initially unhappy with the modifications made to his proposal. He had little interest in polar exploration and preferred tropical routes. But soon his vanity took over and he saw the opportunity for achieving a prestigious objective. The two ships, \"Astrolabe\" and \"Z\u00e9l\u00e9e\" were prepared for the voyage at Toulon. The Astrolabe was commanded by Dumont d'Urville, and Gaston de Roquemaurel as second, and La Z\u00e9l\u00e9e by Charles Hector Jacquinot. In the course of the preparation Dumont also went to London to acquire documentation and instrumentation, meeting the British Admiralty's oceanographer, Francis Beaufort and the President of the Royal Geographical Society, John Washington, both strong supporters of the British expeditions to the South Pole.\nFirst contact with Antarctica.\n\"Astrolabe\" and \"Z\u00e9l\u00e9e\" sailed from Toulon on 7 September 1837, after three weeks of delay compared to Dumont's plans. His objectives were to reach the most southerly point possible at this time in the Weddell Sea; to pass through the Strait of Magellan; to travel up the coast of Chile in order to head for Oceania with the objective of inspecting the new British colonies in Western Australia; to sail to Hobart; and to sail to New Zealand to find opportunities for French whalers and to examine places where a penal colony might be established. After passing through the East Indies, the mission would have to round the Cape of Good Hope and return to France.\nEarly in the voyage, part of the crew was involved in a drunken brawl and arrested in Tenerife. A short pause was made in Rio de Janeiro to disembark a sick official. During the first part of the voyage there were also problems of provisioning, particularly rotten meat, which affected the health of the crew. At the end of November, the ships reached the Strait of Magellan. Dumont thought there was sufficient time to explore the strait for three weeks, taking into account the precise maps drawn by Phillip Parker King in between 1826 and 1830, before heading south again.\nIn the Strait of Magellan Dummont surveyed the coast trying to find out the ruins of Ciudad Rey Don Felipe, a city founded in 1584 as part of a failed Spanish colonization attempt to control the passage through the strait. An expedition report recommended that a French colony be established at the strait to support future traffic along the route. The strait was eventually settled by Chile in 1843.\nTwo weeks after seeing their first iceberg, \"Astrolabe\" and \"Z\u00e9l\u00e9e\" found themselves entangled again in a mass of ice on 1 January 1838. The same night the pack ice prevented the ships from continuing to the south. In the next two months Dumont led increasingly desperate attempts to find a passage through the ice so that he could reach the desired latitude. For a while the ships managed to keep to an ice-free channel, but shortly afterwards they became trapped again, after a wind change. Five days of continuous work were necessary in order to open a corridor in the pack ice to free them.\nAfter reaching the South Orkney Islands, the expedition headed directly to the South Shetland Islands and the Bransfield Strait separating them from Antarctica. In spite of thick fog they located some land only sketched on the maps, which Dumont named \"Terre de Louis-Philippe\" (now called Graham Land), the Joinville Island group and \"Rosamel Island\" (now called Andersson Island). Conditions on board had rapidly deteriorated: most of the crew had obvious symptoms of scurvy and the main decks were covered by smoke from the ships' fires and bad smells and became unbearable. At the end of February 1838, Dumont accepted that he was not able to continue further south, and he continued to doubt the actual latitude reached by Weddell. He therefore directed the two ships towards Talcahuano, in Chile, where he established a temporary hospital for the crew members affected by scurvy.\nPacific.\nDuring months of exploration in the Pacific, the ship visited many islands in Polynesia. On their arrival in the Marquesas Islands, the crews found ways \"to socialise\" with the islanders. Dumont's moral conduct was irreproachable, but he provided a highly summarised description of some incidents of their stay in Nuku Hiva in his reports. During the voyage from the East Indies to Tasmania some of the crew were lost to tropical fevers and dysentery (14 men and 3 officials); but for Dumont the worst moment during the expedition was at Valpara\u00edso, where he received a letter from his wife that informed him of the death of his second son from cholera. Ad\u00e9lie's sorrowful demand that he return home coincided with a deterioration in his health: Dumont was more and more often hit by attacks of gout and stomach pains.\nOn 12 December 1839 the two corvettes landed at Hobart, where the sick and the dying were treated. Dumont was received by John Franklin, Governor of Tasmania and an Arctic explorer who later perished on the infamous Franklin Expedition, from whom he learned that the ships of the American expedition led by Charles Wilkes were berthed in Sydney waiting to sail south.\nSeeing the consistent reduction of the crews, decimated by misfortunes, Dumont expressed his intention to leave this time for the Antarctic with \"Astrolabe\" only, in order to attempt to reach the South Magnetic Pole around longitude 140\u00b0. A deeply wounded Captain Jacquinot urged the hiring of a number of replacements (generally deserters from a French whaler anchored in Hobart) and convinced him to reconsider his intentions; \"Astrolabe\" and \"Zel\u00e9e\" both left Hobart on 1 January 1840. Dumont's plan was very simple: to head south, wind conditions permitting.\nTurning south.\nThe first days of the voyage mainly involved the crossing of twenty degrees and a westerly current; on board there were further misfortunes, including the loss of a man. Crossing the 50\u00b0S parallel, they experienced unexpected falls in the air and water temperatures. After completing the crossing of the Antarctic Convergence, on 16 January 1840, at 60\u00b0S they sighted the first iceberg and two days later the ships found themselves in the middle of a mass of ice. On 20 January the expedition crossed the Antarctic Circle, with celebrations similar to crossing of the Equator ceremonies, and they sighted land the same afternoon.\nThe two ships slowly sailed to the West, skirting walls of ice, and on 22 January, just before 9 in the evening, some members of the crew disembarked on the north-westernmost and highest islet of the rocky group of Dumoulin Islands, at 500\u2013600 m from the icy coast of the Astrolabe Glacier Tongue of the time, today about 4\u00a0km north from the glacier extremity near Cape G\u00e9od\u00e9sie, and hoisted the French tricolour. Dumont named the archipelago Pointe G\u00e9ologie and the land beyond, Terre Ad\u00e9lie The map of the coast drawn under sail by the hydrographer Cl\u00e9ment Adrien Vincendon-Dumoulin is remarkably accurate given the means of the time.\nIn the following days the expedition followed the coast westward then led for the first time some experiments to determine the approximate position of the South magnetic pole. They sighted the American schooner \"Porpoise\" of the United States Exploring Expedition commanded by Charles Wilkes on 30 January 1840, but failed to communicate due to a misunderstanding. On 1 February, Dumont decided to turn to the north heading for Hobart, which the two ships reached 17 days later. They were present for the arrival of the two ships of James Ross's expedition to Antarctica, HMS \"Terror\" and HMS \"Erebus\".\nOn 25 February, the schooners sailed towards the Auckland Islands, where they carried out magnetic measurements and they left a commemorative plate of their visit (as had the commander of \"Porpoise\" previously), in which they announced the discovery of the South Magnetic Pole. They returned via New Zealand, the Torres Strait, Timor, R\u00e9union, Saint Helena and finally Toulon, returning on 6 November 1840, the last French expedition of exploration to sail.\nReturn to France.\nOn his return Dumont d'Urville was promoted to rear admiral and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie (Geographical Society of Paris), later becoming its president. He then took over the writing of the report of the expedition, \"Voyage au p\u00f4le Sud et dans l'Oc\u00e9anie sur les corvettes l'Astrolabe et la Z\u00e9l\u00e9e 1837\u20131840\", which was published between 1841 and 1854 in 24 volumes, plus seven more volumes with illustrations and maps.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn 8 May 1842, Dumont and his family boarded a train from Versailles to Paris after seeing water games celebrating the king. Near Meudon the train's locomotive derailed, the wagons rolled and the tender's coal ended up on the front of the train and caught fire. Dumont's whole family died in the flames of the first French railway disaster, generally known as the Versailles rail accident. Dumont's remains were identified by Pierre-Marie Alexandre Dumoutier, a doctor on board the \"Astrolabe\" and a phrenologist.\nDumont was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. This tragedy led to the end of the practice in France of locking passengers in their train compartments.\nHe is the author of \"The New Zealanders: A story of Austral lands\" \u2013 likely to be the first novel written about fictional Maori characters. Later, in honour of his many valuable chartings, the D'Urville Sea off Antarctica; D'Urville Island in the Joinville Island group in Antarctica; D'Urville Wall on the David Glacier in Antarctica, Cape d'Urville, Irian Jaya, Indonesia; Mount D'Urville, Auckland Island; and D'Urville Island in New Zealand were named after him. The Dumont d'Urville Station on Antarctica is also named after him, as is the Rue Dumont d'Urville, a street near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, and the Lyc\u00e9e Dumont D'Urville in Caen.\nDumont d'Urville himself named Pepin Island in New Zealand and Ad\u00e9lie Land in Antarctica after his wife, and Croisilles Harbour for his mother's family.\nA French naval transport ship employed in French Polynesia is named after him; as was a 1931 sloop which served in World War II.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Botanist/styles.css\"/&gt;The standard author abbreviation d'Urv. is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\nSources and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In many versions he is considered the first king of Dahomey even though the kingdom was founded after his death. Very little is known about Do-Aklin and most of it is connected to folklore, but it is generally claimed that he settled a large group of Aja people from Allada on the Abomey plateau amongst the local inhabitants in \"c.\" 1620. His son Dakodonu would eventually build a palace on the plateau and began forming the Kingdom of Dahomey.\nSymbols and motto.\nGangnihessou had a bird, a drum and a club as his symbol. His motto was that he was the biggest bird and sonorous drum, that nobody can prevent him.\nSettled in Abomey.\nAccording to oral tradition, the Aja were led to Allada by King Agassu from the city of Tado. Agassu was the son of a Tado princess and a leopard (or in some versions a brave Yoruba hunter). When Agassu tried to take over Tado he was defeated and so instead moved with his followers to found the city of Allada.\nAround 1600, three brothers (two in some versions) in the lineage of Agassu fought over the succession to the throne and it was decided that each would settle a new territory. The agreement was reached at Hou\u00e9gbo that Teagbanlin would found a state at what is now Porto-Novo, another son would take control in Allada, and Do-Aklin would settle on the Abomey plateau to the north. It is said that Do-Aklin brought significant gifts for the local population and so was allowed to live amongst them, and the mixing of the local population with the Aja from Allada created the new ethnic group, the Fon.\nDo-Aklin's son (or grandson in some versions) Dakodonu became the founder of the palace and the kingdom of Dahomey around 1640 by defeating a local chieftain. Anthropologist J. Cameron Monroe contends that the lineage connections to royalty at Allada is probably a later creation used by Dahomey legitimize its conquest of Allada (since according to the legend, the kings of Dahomey were also legitimate successors to the throne of Allada) and other aspects like its rivalry with Porto-Novo (brotherly rivalry, since according to the legend, the founders of Dahomey and Porto Novo were supposed to be brothers).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1850 he moved to Paris where he enrolled in the small Paris School of Drawing, where he studied with Louis-Alexandre P\u00e9ron and Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, an innovative and non-traditional instructor who developed his own teaching method based on painting and drawing from memory.\nHe entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, in Paris, in 1854, where he had for classmates, Edgar Degas, Alphonse Legros and Jean-Charles Cazin. After studying there, he spent long time copying the works of the old masters in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. Although Fantin-Latour befriended several of the young artists who would later be associated with Impressionism, including Whistler and Manet, his own work remained conservative in style.\nIn 1861, he briefly frequented the studio of Gustave Courbet. A painting from this period represents him with the painter and caricaturist Oulevay.\nAt the start of his career, between 1854 and 1861, he produced a large number of self-portraits in chalk, charcoal and oil. He had one of them refused at the Salon of 1859. He participated again with \"La Liseuse\" in 1861.\nA member of the so-called C\u00e9nacle des Batignolles, or group of 1863, from where from Impressionism originated, he was, according to Gustave Kahn, a kind of the link between their painters and romantic painting.\nIn 1862, one of his still lifes was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. It was the first of a long series, for thereafter he presented several almost every year and which invariably occupied a prominent place in the exhibition building. During his third trip to England, from July to October 1864, he once again painted still lifes there. He had commercial success.\nThe 1860s and his still lifes.\nEncouraged by American painter James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), whom he met in 1858 at the Louvre, he made several stays in London from 1859 to 1881. In the 1860s, he cultivated the genre of the still life, who would play a capital role in his career. Fantin-Latour would find recognition in England for his compositions of flowers and fruits, at a time when French Impressionist painting was still not very widely there. It was said that his still lifes were \"practically unknown in France during his lifetime\". Thanks to Whistler he met his brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden and the engraver Edwin Edwards, and it was in London that he learned engraving.\nHis decision to make still lifes may seem surprising at the time of Impressionism, however, the choice of such a subject wasn't innocent. In the hierarchy of genres enacted by the Academy of Fine Arts since the 17th century, the still life of fruit or flowers was considered a minor category. By ignoring any literary, religious or historical context, supposed to confer value and nobility on the work, he adopted the opposite stance of academicism. Edwin and Ruth Edwards, his English patrons and merchants, recommended that he always used simple vases and table tops in order to exhibit his great talent in rendering texture and color.\nFantin-Latour still lifes were also very appreciated in the Netherlands at his time. At the Living Masters Exhibition in Amsterdam, in 1889, one of his still lifes with roses sold by 2,000 guilders, a considerable sum back then. Dutch art dealers from Amsterdam regularly sold works by Fantin-Latour well into the 1930s. Many of these works would end in Dutch museums such as the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam, and the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, in Otterlo.\nArtistic universe.\nAfter his first Salon submissions were rejected in 1859, Fantin-Latour began exhibiting with his friend \u00c9douard Manet and the future Impressionists Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet. In 1865, he wrote to Edwin Edwards : \u201cWe form a group and make noise because there are many painters and one is easily forgotten. When we come together... we grow in numbers and become more adventurous. I thought it could last, it was my mistake\u201d.\nIn 1867, he was also one of the nine members of the Japanese Jinglar Society, along with Carolus-Duran, who painted his portrait twice in 1861, and the ceramists Bracquemond and Solon, who they met at dinner in the Japanese style. \u201cOne always felt when approaching him, a small feeling of fear, because of these rough manners which the artists of his generation often affected as inseparable from a noble independence,\u201d said Jacques-\u00c9mile Blanche, a painter friend of the following generation.\nFantin-Latour renovated the collective portraiture with paintings that served as large manifestos: \"Homage to Delacroix\" (1864); \"A Studio at Les Batignolles\" (1870), a tribute to Manet; \"The Corner of the Table\" (1872), a homage to the Parnassian poets, including Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud; and \"Around the Piano\" (1885), a tribute to musicians and musicologists of his time.\nIn \"A Studio at Les Batignolles\", Manet is depicted at the center in the act of painting, surrounded by several important painters and writers, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Zacharie Astruc, Emile Zola, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille and Claude Monet. This canvas testifies to the links he maintained with the artistic and literary avant-garde of the time and to Manet in particular; it also seems to be an echo of Zola's opinion of Manet: \"Around the painter reviled by the public, a common front has been created of painters and writers claiming him as a master\".\nIn addition to his realistic paintings, Fantin-Latour created imaginative lithographs inspired by the music of some of the great classical composers. In 1876, Fantin-Latour attended a performance of the \"Ring\" cycle at Bayreuth, which he found particularly moving. He later published lithographs inspired by Richard Wagner in \"La revue wagn\u00e9rienne\", which helped solidify his reputation among Paris' avant-garde as an anti-naturalist painter.\nIn 1876, Fantin-Latour married a fellow painter, Victoria Dubourg, whom he met when both were copying the same painting at the Louvre. He spent his summers on the country estate of his wife's family at Bur\u00e9, Orne in Lower Normandy, where he died on 25 August 1904.\nLike many painters of his time, he became interested in photography, taking pictures for his work. He was also a big collector of erotic photographs; his estate lists more than 1,400 which are kept in the Museum of Grenoble.\nHe was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse, Paris, France.\nLegacy.\nMarcel Proust mentions Fantin-Latour's work in \"In Search of Lost Time\":\n\"Many young women's hands would be incapable of doing what I see there,\" said the Prince, pointing to Mme de Villeparisis's unfinished watercolours. And he asked her whether she had seen the flower painting by Fantin-Latour which had recently been exhibited. (\"The Guermantes Way\")\nHis first major UK gallery exhibition in 40 years took place at the Bowes Museum in April 2011. Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg presented a retrospective exhibition of his work in 2016\u20132017 entitled \"\u00c0 fleur de peau\".\nA reproduction of the painting \"A Basket of Roses\" was used as the cover of New Order's album \"Power, Corruption &amp; Lies\" by Peter Saville in 1983.\nNine artworks by Fantin-Latour are listed concerning their Nazi-era provenance on the Lost Art Foundation website.\nPublic collections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Oral tradition recounts that Dakodonu was the son (or grandson) of Do-Aklin, the founder of the royal dynasty of Dahomey, and the father to Houegbadja, often considered the founder of the Kingdom of Dahomey. In addition, it is said that Dakodonu killed a local chieftain and founded the capital city upon the site. However, some recent historical analysis contends that Dakodonu was added into the royal line in the 18th century to legitimize the ruling dynasty over the indigenous inhabitants of the Abomey plateau.\nName.\nOne legend tells that Dakodonou's original name was Dako but he adopted his new name Dakodonou after killing Donou (who was either a farmer or an indigo painter) in a pot of indigo and rolling his corpse around its blue tomb.\nFounding of Abomey Kingdom.\nOral tradition holds that a succession struggle in Allada resulted in Do-Aklin moving a large population onto the Abomey plateau, an area settled by the Gedevi. When Do-Aklin died (or in some versions was deposed), Dakodonu became the leader of the group and was given permission by the Gedevi chiefs to settle on the plateau. Dakodonu requested additional land for settlement from a prominent Gedevi chief named Dan (or Da). In Gbe languages, Da or Dan means snake . To this request, the chief responded \"Should I open up my belly and build you a house in it.\" The tradition contends that Dakodonu killed Dan on the spot and ordered that his new palace be built on the site and derived the kingdom's name from the incident: Dan=chief, xo=Belly, me=Inside of. From this beginning, Dakodonu began establishing the basic structure of the Dahomey kingdom and is reported to have conquered two additional villages. Oral tradition of the ruling lineage of the kingdom says that Dakodonu's son Houegbadja, often considered the first king of Dahomey, took over after Dakodonu's reign.\nDakodonu and legitimation of the royal lineage.\nDahomey historian Edna Bay argues that Dakodonu was actually himself a Gedevi, the local population of the area, and that he was added into the royal lineage story by Agaja in order to establish the legitimate rule of the Kingdom over the local population. Evidence of this is suggested through the fact that the head priest of the kingdom, the \"agasunon\" in Fon, was always from the lineage of Dakodonu. In addition, oral tradition of lineages not associated with the ruling group claim that Houegbadja was an adopted son of Dakodonu. Dakodonu's inclusion in royal lists then was a means of creating recognition for the local population in a powerful position (the head priest) and legitimating the rule of the Fon kingdom over the territory. In addition, Monroe contends that the story of the founding, the killing of Dan, is likely not based on a single incident and Bay contends that Dahomey meaning \"In the belly of Dan\" is likely a false etymology.\nConstructions by Dakodonu.\nAs an early king of Dahomey, the reign of Dakodonu coincided with some significant construction projects including the start of the Royal Palaces of Abomey, although the structures were probably replaced by construction by Houegbadja, and Agongointo-Zoungoudo Underground Town.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, \"de facto\" expelled from mid-August 1945, he was a special bishop for the homeland-expellees until his death.\nEarly life.\nKaller was born in Beuthen (Bytom), Prussian Silesia, into a merchant family, the second of eight children. With the population of Beuthen being of German and Polish ethnicity he grew up bilingual in German and Polish. He graduated from the \"Gymnasium\" in 1899 with \"Abitur\" and started theological studies in Breslau (today's Wroc\u0142aw) at the episcopal see of his then home Prince-Bishopric of Breslau. There he was consecrated a priest in 1903.\nHe was the chaplain in the parish of Gro\u00df Strehlitz (today's Strzelce Opolskie) in the Breslau diocese. Between 1905 and 1917, he practised as a missionary priest at St. Boniface parish in Bergen on R\u00fcgen Island in the Hither Pomeranian Catholic diaspora within Breslau's Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania. He raised the necessary donations to erect St. Boniface Church there in 1912. From 1917, he was the priest at Berlin's second oldest Catholic Church, Saint Michael's Garrison Church.\nCareer as prelate and bishop.\nIn 1926, he succeeded Robert Weimann (1870\u20131925) as Apostolic Administrator of Schneidem\u00fchl (today's Pi\u0142a). Kaller's jurisdiction comprised Catholic parishes of the dioceses of Che\u0142mno and of Gniezno-Pozna\u0144, which had been separated from their episcopal sees by the new Polish border in 1918 and 1920, respectively. On Kaller's instigation, the seat of the apostolic administration had been moved from T\u00fctz (Tuczno) to Schneidem\u00fchl on 1 July 1926.\nFollowing the Prussian Concordat () of 1929, some Catholic dioceses and jurisdictions in Northern, Middle and Eastern Germany had been reorganised. In 1930, the Apostolic Administration of T\u00fctz was reconstituted as the Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl (, , existing until 1972, and from 1945 under apostolic administrators) with Kaller being promoted to prelate.\nOn 2 September 1930, Kaller was invested as bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ermland (an archdiocese since 1992) by Pope Pius XI and consecrated in Schneidem\u00fchl, afterwards taking the episcopal see in Frauenburg (today's Frombork). Franz Hartz succeeded Kaller as Prelate of Schneidem\u00fchl.\nFrom 1925, Ermland diocese comprised all of the Prussian Province of East Prussia in its borders of 1938. In the year of Kaller's investiture, his diocese, which had turned exempt in 1566 when its original metropolitan Archbishopric of Riga, had become Lutheran and was \"de jure\" dissolved, became again suffragan to an archdiocese. Ermland diocese, together with the new Berlin diocese and Schneidem\u00fchl prelature joined the new Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province () under the newly elevated Metropolitan Archbishop Adolf Bertram of Breslau.\nIn 1932, Kaller consecrated the new diocesan seminary for priests in Braunsberg in East Prussia (today's Braniewo). Under his jurisdiction, Ermland diocese issued a new diocesan hymnal and a diocesan ritual (cf. Rituale Romanum) in Latin and the three native languages of the diocesan parishioners (German, Lithuanian and Polish). Kaller was also appointed apostolic visitator to the then 8,000 Catholic faithful in Memelland, a Lithuanian-annexed formerly East Prussian area, whose then four Catholic parishes had been seceded from Ermland diocese and subsequently formed part of the Territorial Prelature of Memel (Klaip\u0117da)]], ; ; ) existing between 1926 and 1991.\nKaller and other members of the German Catholic and Protestant Churches formulated their opposition to the policy of Nazi mysticism early on (cf. Struggle of the churches). German clergy who opposed Adolf Hitler or supported refugees were strongly persecuted under the Nazi dictatorship. On 10 June 1939, Pope Pius XII appointed Kaller apostolic administrator of the Territorial Prelature of Memel, after Lithuania had ceded Memelland under German pressure to Nazi Germany in March the same year. In 1942, Kaller applied to Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo to resign from episcopate in order to administer services at Theresienstadt, but his wish was not granted.\nOn 7 February 1945, during World War II, the Nazi Schutzstaffel forced Kaller out of his episcopal office while the Soviet Red Army was overrunning Ermland diocese. Kaller had appointed Frauenburg's Cathedral dean Aloys Marquardt (1891\u20131972) as vicar general to the see.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter World War II, most Germans were expelled to Allied-occupied Germany, including Marquardt who had to leave in July. Frauenburg's cathedral chapter then elected the aged Canon Johannes (Jan) Hanowski, a German of Polish ethnicity and long-term archpriest of Allenstein (today's Olsztyn), as capitular vicar, i.e. provisional head of the see, on 28 July 1945.\nKaller, who had been stranded by the end of the war in Halle upon Saale, made his -long way back to his see and arrived on one of the first nights of August 1945 in Allenstein/Olsztyn, taking on the jurisdiction from Hanowski. He started to develop new plans for his diocese especially aiming at overcoming the nationalist antagonism between Catholics of the German and Polish languages, reshaping the diocese in the spirit of German-Polish reconciliation. He appointed Franciszek Borowiec, his close collaborator, as new vicar general for the Diocesan area under Polish occupation and Paul Hoppe (1900\u20131988), K\u00f6nigsberg in Prussia (today's Kaliningrad), as vicar general for the diocesan area under Soviet occupation.\nKaller further appointed an ethnic Pole as new cathedral provost, since his predecessor provost, Franz Xaver Sander (also official), and five more fellow cathedral canons had been killed by the invading Soviets. (The other killed canons were Andreas Hinzmann, Dr. Franz Heyduschka, Dr. Wladislaus Switalski, Anton Krause and Dr. Bruno Gross.) Addressing the Polish authorities in the annexed area of his diocese, Kaller declared that he wanted to continue his episcopate within Poland, but officials said it was for neither him nor them, but Warsaw to decide that. Kaller chose four ethnic Poles as canon candidates to replenish the chapter so that ethnic Poles and Germans would each have half the seats. With these activities and plans Kaller was unique among the German bishops in the eastern territories.\nOn 14 August, he received a telegramme from August Hlond for the expelled Marquardt. Polish Primate Hlond had invited the vicar general for a meeting on the diocesan future to Pelplin, not knowing that the Polish authorities had expelled him, let alone that the deported Kaller had managed to return. A Polish government car was provided and Kaller and Borowiec travelled the next day to Pelplin. When, on coming for the general vicar, the Polish government representatives learned the bishop himself was coming, they sent an advance party to Pelplin in order to inform Hlond.\nAs Pelplin's canon and chancellor, Franciszek Kurland recalled, Kaller was not welcomed in priestly fraternity. It was difficult enough to urge a general vicar to resign, but the papally-invested bishop was another task. In fluent Polish, Kaller and Hlond, his chaplain Boles\u0142aw Filipiak, his brother Antoni Hlond SDB, Leon Koz\u0142owski (Che\u0142mno's vicar general) and Kurland conversed while taking lunch, discussing the situation. Kaller explained that he wanted to stay with his diocese in Poland and talked about his plans. Hlond replied that Kaller was no Polish citizen and thus unacceptable as bishop in the Polish area, avoiding the term \"state\", since Ermland diocese was only Polish-occupied German territory. Afterwards, in a private conversation, Hlond urged Kaller to resign which he did for the jurisdiction in the Polish-occupied diocesan area, but retained the office of Bishop of Ermland, which rather turned quite void, especially since in the Soviet-occupied diocesan area no Catholic ecclesiastical activity whatsoever was tolerated. Later in Pozna\u0144, Hlond praised Kaller for how he had complied with the demanded resignation from jurisdiction.\nOn his way back, accompanied by Borowiec, Kaller cried and told him that the jurisdiction in the Polish-occupied diocesan area would be passed on to Teodor Bensch, a German-born naturalised Pole, who would arrive within days officiating as apostolic administrator. They returned home in the evening on 16 August. Kaller could not appoint the four new canons for the chapter any more but was expelled the next day, transferred by lorry to Warsaw, accompanied by Borowiec, who also joined him on the train to Pozna\u0144 on 18 August. Then Borowiec, who had not been expelled, returned to the diocese, while Kaller had to leave via Stettin for Allied-occupied Germany.\nKaller's last years.\nKaller found asylum in what became Bizone in 1947. On 26 September 1946, Pius XII appointed him Papal Special Commissioner for the homeland-expelled Germans (). In November 1946, Pius XII invited Kaller to Rome. Both were personally acquainted since their common time in Berlin (Pius as Nuncio to Germany and Kaller as priest), and the latter reported to the pope on the destitute situation of the expellees from eastern Europe. On 7 July 1947, Kaller died suddenly of a heart attack in Frankfurt am Main and was buried besides St. Mary's Church in K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus.\nSuccession of Kaller until 1972.\nOn 11 July 1947, the Ermland chapter, residing in the Allied Bizone, then elected Provost Arthur Kather (1883\u20131957), officiating before his exile at St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Elbing (today's Elbl\u0105g), capitular vicar, as provided by canon law in case of \"sede vacante\". The Holy See later confirmed him and thereafter Kather represented Ermland diocese in the Fulda Conference of Bishops until his death. \nOn 29 July 1957, the Ermland chapter, with the surviving capitulars living in what had become West Germany, elected Hoppe as capitular vicar, who had been expelled from the Soviet-occupied Ermland diocesan area (Kaliningrad Oblast) in 1947. Hoppe held that post until Pope Paul VI terminated the apostolic administration of Ermland diocese and finally appointed again a bishop to the see on 28 June 1972, then named Warmia (Polish for Ermland), however, not comprising the former diocesan area within the Soviet Union. Paul VI then elevated Hoppe to Apostolic Visitator of Ermland taking care of Ermland's diocesans living in Germany.\nLegacy.\nIn July 1979, Kaller's successor, Warmia's Bishop J\u00f3zef Glemp, visited Straelen, where he had earlier improved his German. On his way to Nuremberg, Glemp stopped in K\u00f6nigstein to visit Kaller's grave. On 10 October 1980, Kaller's 100th birthday, Glemp celebrated a pontifical requiem in honour of Kaller in Frombork's Archcathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Andrew, Frombork, commemorating in his preaching Kaller's personality as priest and his benedictory work for the diocese. In 1997, Archbishop Edmund Micha\u0142 Piszcz of Warmia and the community of Ermlanders in western Germany commemorated Kaller and placed busts of him in Germany and Poland. On 4 May 2003, the procedure for his beatification started.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Houegbadja followed his father Dakodonou to the throne and formed much of the administration and religious practices for the Kingdom of Dahomey. Because of this he is often credited as the First King of Dahomey.\nRise to power.\nThe rise of Houegbadja to the throne is a story based largely on oral traditions. The primary oral tradition claims that Houegbadja was the son (or in some adopted son) of Dakodonu and that a Gedevi woman (the Gedevi were the native people of the Abomey Plateau) named Adanon was betrothed to Dakodonu. Although the woman was betrothed to his father, Houegbdaja got the woman pregnant and the result was that Dakodonu disinherited him. Houegbadja and Dakodonu only reconciled when Houegbadja killed a strong rival of Dakodonu, and Houegbadja was then named the heir apparent. With the death of Dakodonu, Houegbadja became the King of Dahomey.\nAdministration.\nHouegbadja plays a primary role in the ceremonies of the Kingdom of Dahomey and as such is often attributed with many administrative developments that he is unlikely to have solely created. However, various oral traditions hold that Houegbadja established the current Royal Palaces of Abomey, the general structure of the royal administration, poll taxes, death taxes, and made it so that the King's sacrifices to ancestors were primary within the kingdom. Militarily, Houegbadja is often credited with the first expansions of the kingdom outside of the Abomey Plateau and is sometimes credited with creating the Dahomey Amazons (although this claim is considered unlikely).\nLegacy.\nHouegbadja is often considered the first king of Dahomey because of the establishment of the palace and creation of many rules that defined the administration of the kingdom. During the Annual Customs of Dahomey, a ceremony centered on tributes given to royal ancestors, Houegbadja was the first king recognized. He named his oldest son Akaba as his heir and upon his death around 1685, Akaba came to power.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She held 34 world records and was the first woman to run 100 metres within 11 seconds.\nBiography.\nBorn as Renate Mei\u00dfner, she was a very talented athlete, also competing in the high jump and pentathlon. She debuted internationally at the 1969 European Championships, where she \u2013 as a last minute substitute \u2013 won a silver medal in the 200 m and a gold in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay.\nIn 1970 she was the World Student Games Champion in both the 100 and 200 metres.\nRenate won five national 100m titles 1970-75. She also won the 200 on 4 occasions.\nAt the next European Championships, in 1971, she won both the 100 and 200 m and the silver in the relay. At that time, she was already competing as Renate Stecher, having married hurdler Gerd Stecher the previous year.\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics, Stecher repeated that performance. She won the 100 m in time of 11.07, which was only in 1976 recognised as world record, which had been measured in tenths of seconds before (the times in tenths were later corrected). She also equalled the world record in the 200 meters with a time of 22.40. The following year, Stecher set (hand timed) world records in both sprint events, also becoming the first woman to beat 11 seconds. She clocked 10.9 and 10.8 for the 100 metres and 22.1 for the 200 metres.\nStecher also won the 200 m. Wilma van den Berg of the Netherlands had qualified for the semifinals, and the 23.22 that she ran in the quarterfinals was faster than the time in the quarterfinals of Stecher. However, after the killing of 11 Israeli athletes in the Munich Massacre, and the Olympics not being cancelled, van den Berg withdrew from the competition in sympathy with the Israeli victims. She said that she was leaving in protest of the \"obscene\" decision to continue with the Olympic Games.\nIn Rome at the 1974 European Championships she was defeated in both the 100 m and 200 m, by Irena Szewi\u0144ska of Poland and had to settle for silver in both distances. However the GDR 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team, in which Stecher ran the second leg, won the gold medal in a world record time.\nAt the 1976 Summer Olympics, Stecher again competed in the three sprint events, winning medals in all three once again. She was beaten for the 100 m title by Annegret Richter, and came third in a 200 m race with five German women in the first five positions. With the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team they beat West Germany, taking revenge for the race four years earlier.\nRetirement.\nFollowing the release of East German secret service files, it was revealed that many of the country's athletes were involved with a state-sponsored drug program. The files document that Stecher had wanted to step down her drug use after the 1972 Olympics, so that she could safely have children. Raelene Boyle, who had finished second to Stecher in both the 100 and 200\u00a0metres at the Olympics, stated that she felt cheated, as she believed it unlikely that Stecher would have beaten her without the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\nIn 2011 Stecher was inducted into the Germany's Sports Hall of Fame.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

King Houegbadja had created the basic structure of the kingdom on the Abomey plateau. His first children were the twins of Akaba and Hangbe and they were followed by another son of Houegbadja who would become King Agaja. As the oldest son, Akaba became the king upon Houegbadja's death and ruled until 1716 when he died during battle in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River Valley, either of small pox or in battle. When he died his sister, Hangbe, became the ruler and began preparing Akaba's oldest son, Agbo Sassa, for the throne. In 1718, Agaja, the next oldest son after Akaba from Houegbadja, fought with Agbo Sassa and Hangbe and became the next King of Dahomey.\nSymbol.\nThe chameleon symbolized his adaptability of policies.It was also a symbol of his patience to wait to ascend to the throne (as he ascended the throne in such an old age), inspired from the quote \"The chameleon walks slowly but can go far, and he will never break even the finest branch he walks on the bombax tree\".The king was also symbolized by a boar.\nKing of Dahomey.\nOral tradition records that Akaba was the eldest born child of Houegbadja with a twin sister named Hangbe. In addition, Houegbadja also had a younger son named Dosu (the traditional name for the first male born after twins in Fon) who would later take the name Agaja. As the oldest son, Houegbadja named Akaba his heir before he died and Akaba assumed the throne in 1685 upon his father's deaths. In some versions, Akaba is the king who kills the chieftain \"Dan\" to establish the dominance of the Dahomey Kingdom over the Abomey plateau, rather than Houegbadja.\nAkaba's administration continued military expansion off the Abomey plateau and increasing centralization of the kingdom over the region. Some of his most significant military activity was in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River valley. During this campaign in around 1715\u20131716, Akaba died either of smallpox, poisoning, or in battle. Because his death was quite sudden, and his heir was still young, Edna Bay contends that his twin sister Hangbe became the regent until Agaja forcibly replaced her and the oldest son of Akaba, Agbo Sassa, to take over the throne.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The comic book spans four volumes, an original graphic novel, and a spin-off trilogy of graphic novellas. \"Volume I\" and \"Volume II\" (released as two six-issue limited series) and the graphic novel ' were published by the America's Best Comics imprint of DC Comics. After leaving the America's Best imprint, the series moved to Top Shelf and Knockabout Comics, which published ' (released as three graphic novellas), the ' (a spin-off of three graphic novellas centered on the character of Nemo), and ' (originally released as a six-issue limited series). According to Moore, the concept behind the series was initially a \"Justice League of Victorian England\" but he quickly developed it as an opportunity to merge elements from numerous works of fiction into one world, in a matter akin to the shared fictional universes of Marvel and DC Comics.\nElements of \"Volume I\" were used in a loosely adapted feature film of the same name, released in 2003 and starring Sean Connery in his last live-action role.\nPlot.\nThe year is 1898, and Mina Murray is recruited by Campion Bond on behalf of British Intelligence and asked to assemble a league of other extraordinary individuals to protect the interests of the Empire: Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, Dr. Jekyll, and Hawley Griffin the Invisible Man. They help stop a gang war between Fu Manchu and Professor Moriarty, nemesis of Sherlock Holmes. Following this they take part in the events of H. G. Wells's \"The War of the Worlds\". Two members of the League (Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain) achieve immortality, and are next seen in an adventure in 1958. This follows events that take place after the fall of the Big Brother government from George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\nFollowing this, Mina and Allan team up with fellow immortal Orlando and are shown in an adventure which spans a century, from 1910 to 2009, concerning a plot by evil magicians to create a Moonchild that might well turn out to be the Antichrist. During this adventure Captain Nemo's daughter Janni Dakkar is introduced, and some of her adventures are chronicled subsequently. The final volume of the series ends with an immortal Mina escaping an Earth dominated by magical entities and various alien invasions to live out her immortal life on a space station with Orlando, Jack Nemo (great-grandson of Captain Nemo) and a clone of Mr. Hyde.\nCharacters.\nAll characters within the series are either pre-existing characters, or are in some way related to one.\nThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNemo trilogy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOverview of the series.\nIn a 1997 interview with Andy Diggle for the now defunct Comics World website, Alan Moore gave the title of the work as \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlefolk\". Moore changed the name to \"Gentlemen\" to better reflect the Victorian era. Simon Bisley was originally going to be the artist for the series before being replaced by Kevin O'Neill.\nThe Victorian setting allowed Moore and O'Neill to insert \"in-jokes\" and cameos from many works of Victorian fiction, while also making contemporary references and jibes. The works bear numerous steampunk influences. In the first issue, for example, there is a half-finished bridge to link Britain and France, referencing problems constructing the Channel Tunnel.\nMost characters in the series, from the dominatrix schoolmistress Rosa Coote to minor characters such as Inspector Dick Donovan, are either established characters from existing works of fiction or ancestors of the same, to the extent that individuals depicted in crowd scenes in Volume I have been said (both by Moore, and in annotations by Jess Nevins) to be visually designed as the ancestors of the cast of the British soap opera \"EastEnders\". This has lent the series considerable popularity with fans of esoteric Victoriana, who have delighted in attempting to place every character who makes an appearance.\nMoore said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The planet of the imagination is as old as we are. It has been humanity's constant companion with all of its fictional locations, like Mount Olympus and the gods, and since we first came down from the trees, basically. It seems very important, otherwise, we wouldn't have it.\nPublisher change.\nMoore's longstanding, outspoken criticism of DC Comics (stemming in large part from what he perceives as mistreatment at their hands over the rights to \"Watchmen\") made his position with DC-owned subsidiary WildStorm Comics (of which \"LoEG\" publisher America's Best Comics is an imprint) tenuous from the start. Moore's initial agreement was with WildStorm owner Jim Lee, who sold his studio to DC after dealing with Moore, but before any of the ABC projects were published. Moore agreed to honor his contracts with Lee, but made it clear that he wished to continue to have no dealings with DC directly.\nThe fifth issue of the first volume contained an authentic vintage advertisement for a douche with the brand name Marvel Douche. The entire initial print run was destroyed and reprinted because the publisher felt that this could be perceived as an attack on Marvel Comics, DC's main competition.\nAfter several additional complaints over DC interference, Moore decided to wind up his ABC projects, intending to only continue with \"League\" (the only title he, with O'Neill, actually owned). He subsequently took offense at inaccurate comments made by the producer of the film version of his \"V for Vendetta\", which stated that the author\u2014who had distanced himself completely from film adaptations of his work, particularly after \"LXG\"\u2014had commented favorably on a draft of the script. Moore requested that someone involved with the film's production company\u2014and DC Comics parent company, Warner Bros.\u2014officially retract the comments and apologize. He also claims that his lack of support from DC regarding a minor lawsuit related to the film adaptation of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" was instrumental in his departure.\nWhen no such apology was forthcoming, both Moore and O'Neill decided to withdraw future volumes of the \"League\" from DC in protest. Since the duo was still working on the ' at the time, it was agreed that it would become the last \"League\" project published by DC/WildStorm, with subsequent projects published jointly by Top Shelf Productions and Knockabout Comics in the US and UK respectively, who published both ', and the ', as graphic novella trilogies. Top Shelf and Knockabout later released ' first as a six-issue limited series. Reprints of \"Volumes I-II\" and the \"Dossier\" were published by Vertigo until its shutdown in January 2020.\nWorld of the \"League\".\nVolume II has an extensive appendix, most of which is filled with an imaginary travelers' account of the alternate universe the \"League\" is set in, called \"The New Traveller's Almanac\". This Almanac provides background information, much of which is taken from the pre-existing literary works or mythology and may be difficult to fully appreciate without an esoteric knowledge of literature. It shows the plot of the comic to be just a small section of a world inhabited by what appears to be the entirety of all fiction ever created.\nHistory of the League.\nMoore's work includes references to previous leagues and suggests there will be others subsequently. In much the same way that the \"New Traveller's Almanac\", an appendix to the trade paperback collection of \"The League Vol. 2\", detailed much of the geography of the League's world, the third volume, \"The Black Dossier\", set out an extensive history of the world of the League and each of its various incarnations, threading together hundreds of disparate works of fiction into a cohesive timeline.\nAwards and recognition.\n\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" won the 1999 UK National Comics Award for Best New Comic (International).\nVolume I won the 2000 Bram Stoker Award for Best Illustrated Narrative. \nVolume II was nominated for the 2003 award, but lost to \"\".

He came to the throne after his brother King Akaba. During his reign, Dahomey expanded significantly and took control of key trade routes for the Atlantic slave trade by conquering Allada (1724) and Whydah (1727). Wars with the powerful Oyo Empire to the east of Dahomey resulted in Agaja accepting tributary status to that empire and providing yearly gifts. After this, Agaja attempted to control the new territory of the kingdom of Dahomey through militarily suppressing revolts and creating administrative and ceremonial systems. Agaja died in 1740 after another war with the Oyo Empire and his son Tegbessou became the new king. Agaja is credited with creating many of the key government structures of Dahomey, including the \"\" and the \"Mehu\".\nThe motivations of Agaja and his involvement with the slave trade remain an active dispute among historians of Dahomey with some arguing that he was resistant to the slave trade but agreed to it because of the need to defend his kingdom, while others argue that no such motivation existed and the wars against Allada and Whydah were simply for economic control.\nHistory.\nAgaja served a crucial role in the early development of the Kingdom of Dahomey. The kingdom had been founded by Agaja's father Houegbadja who ruled from 1645 until 1685 on the Abomey plateau. Although there were some limited military operations outside of the plateau, the kingdom did not significantly expand before the eighteenth century.\nRise to power.\nOral tradition says that Agaja was born around 1673, the second oldest son to Houegbadja. Houegbadja's first two children were the twins Akaba and Hangbe. Agaja was originally called Dosu, a traditional Fon name for the first son born after twins. When Houegbadja died, Akaba became the king and ruled from 1685 until about 1716. Akaba died during a war in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River valley and since his oldest son, Agbo Sassa, was a minor, his twin sister Hangbe may have ruled for a brief period of time (alternatively given as either three months or three years). Hangbe supported a faction that wanted Agbo Sassa to be the next king, but Agaja contested this and became the ruler in 1718 after a brief, violent struggle.\nConquest of Allada and Whydah.\nAgaja led the most important expansions of the kingdom in the 1720s with the conquest of the Kingdom of Allada in 1724 and the Kingdom of Whydah in 1727. Allada and Whydah, both Aja kingdoms, had become important coastal trading centers in the early 1700s, with trade connections to multiple European countries. The two powers made a 1705 agreement where both agreed not to interfere in the trade of the other kingdom. The King of Whydah, Huffon, grew increasingly connected through trade with the British Royal African Company while the king of Allada, Soso, made his ports outposts for the Dutch West India Company. In 1712, a British ship attacked a Dutch ship in the harbor at Allada, triggering economic warfare between Allada and Whydah that lasted until 1720. Upon coming to the throne, Agaja and Soso made an agreement to attack Whydah and remove Huffon from power; however, this plan was halted for unknown reasons.\nIn 1724, Soso died and a contest for the throne in Allada followed. On March 30, 1724, Agaja's army entered Allada in support of the defeated candidate, named Hussar. After a three-day battle Agaja's army killed the king and set the palace on fire. Rather than place Hussar on the throne, though, Agaja drove him out of the city after establishing his own power. Agaja then turned his forces against the other Aja kingdoms. In April 1724, Agaja conquered the town of Godomey and in 1726 the King of Gom\u00e8 transferred his allegiance from the King of Whydah to Agaja.\nAgaja planned his attack on Whydah in February 1727. He conspired with his daughter, Na Gueze, who was married to Huffon, to pour water on the gunpowder stores in Whydah. He also sent a letter to all of the European traders in the port of Whydah encouraging them to remain neutral in the conflict, in return for which he would provide favorable trade relations at the conclusion of the war. On February 26, 1727, Agaja attacked Whydah and burned the palace, causing the royal family to flee from the city. During the five-day battle, reports say that five thousand people in Whydah were killed and ten to eleven thousand were captured. In April, he burned all of the European factories in the Whydah capital.\nIn the three years between 1724 and 1727, Agaja had more than doubled the territory of Dahomey, had secured access to the Atlantic coast, and had made Dahomey a prominent power along the Slave Coast.\nWars with the Oyo Empire.\nThe Aja kingdoms had been tributaries to the Oyo Empire since the 1680s. After Agaja had conquered Allada, it appears that he sent a smaller tribute and so on April 14, 1726, the Oyo Empire sent its army against Dahomey. The Oyo conquered Abomey and burned the city while Agaja and his troops escaped into the marshes and hid until the Oyo armies returned home.\nAgaja rebuilt Abomey and when he conquered Whydah the next year he provided many gifts to the King of Oyo. Despite these gifts, tributary terms acceptable to Oyo were not agreed to and so the Oyo Empire returned on March 22, 1728. As part of a strategy, Agaja buried his treasure, burned food resources, and made all the residents of Abomey abandon the city. The Oyo army found it difficult to remain in that situation and so they returned to Oyo in April. This strategy was repeated in 1729 and 1730, with Oyo sending increasingly larger armies and Agaja and his troops retreating into the marshes. The 1730 invasion was particularly devastating as the Oyo feigned acceptance of gifts from Agaja but then ambushed Dahomey's forces when they returned to Abomey. With the regular destruction of Abomey, Agaja moved the capital to Allada and ruled from there (his son Tegbessou would later move the capital back to Abomey while appointing a puppet king in Allada).\nAfter the 1730 attack by the Oyo Empire, Agaja's forces were particularly depleted. Huffon and the deposed royal family of Whydah, with support from the British and the French, attempted to reconquer the city. With depleted forces, Agaja created a special unit of women dressed in war armor to assemble at the back of his remaining army to make his forces look larger. The ploy worked as the Whydah forces saw a huge force marching toward the city and fled before any fighting happened. After this attack, Agaja asked the Portuguese leader in the area to negotiate a peace agreement between Dahomey and Oyo. The agreement set the boundaries between Oyo and Dahomey at the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and made Dahomey a tributary state of Oyo, a status which would remain until 1832. As a guarantee, Agaja had to send a son, Tegbessou, to Oyo.\nCentralization.\nFor the last ten years of his reign, from 1730 until 1740, Agaja worked on consolidating his kingdom and increasing trade with Europeans.\nHaving come to terms with the Oyo empire, Agaja sought to militarily destroy other rivals in the region. This started in 1731 with a successful war against the Mahi people to the north of Abomey for supplying the Oyo with food and support during the wars. Attempts by the Portuguese and the Dutch to establish forts in Godomey, which Agaja had conquered in 1724 but whose leader had recently renounced his allegiance to Dahomey, caused a large war in 1732 in which Agaja burned the town and took thousands of people captive. In addition, regular warfare continued between Agaja and the exiled Whydah population under Huffon. In July 1733 Huffon died and a civil war broke out in the exiled community. A defeated prince went to Agaja to ask for assistance and seeing the opportunity, Agaja agreed to support the prince against the leadership of Whydah and allowed the prince to resettle after the war was successful. The other Whydah faction was defeated by Agaja in 1734 with assistance of the French.\nAgaja also undertook significant administrative reforms to govern the newly conquered areas. Many of the chiefs and officers in Allada were retained, while Agaja dispatched his trade officers and kept active military control over Whydah. The old chiefs, retained for necessity, often caused problems for Agaja by resisting his rule or even revolting. Agaja also appointed three different trade directors, one to manage relations with each different European power (Britain, France, and Portugal). When the Europeans complained about these directors in 1733, Agaja replaced them with one person, thus creating the important position of \"Yovogan\". The Dutch, in contrast, were held in high contempt by Agaja and he spent much of this period trying to destroy their interests in the region. This led the Dutch to organize a significant army of many tribes to the west of Dahomey which destroyed Agaja's forces in 1737 but did not destroy the kingdom.\nStarting in 1730 but becoming formal in 1733 all slaves could only be sold through representatives of the king. This royal monopoly led to some revolts by important chiefs who were not receiving full prices for their goods and Agaja crushed multiple rebellions between 1733 and 1740. The royal monopoly proved unpopular and, following the defeat of Agaja's forces in 1737, he was forced to allow the free trade of slaves through Dahomey.\nAs part of his efforts against the Dutch, Agaja organized a war against Badagry in 1737. This war, while marginally successful, was possibly considered by the Oyo Empire to be against the terms of the 1730 agreement. Conversely, it is possible that Agaja simply refused to continue paying the tribute to Oyo. Whatever the reason, war between Oyo and Dahomey resumed in 1739 and Agaja repeated his earlier strategy of withdrawing into the wild to wait for the Oyo troops to leave.\nContacts with Europeans.\nAgaja was the first king of Dahomey to have significant contact with European traders. Although Dahomey had been known to European traders in the 1600s, largely as a source for slaves, because it was an inland kingdom contact was limited. When Agaja expanded the kingdom, he came into contact with the Dutch, British, French, and Portuguese traders. Agaja opposed the Dutch and largely excluded them from trade along the coast after he had conquered it. However, he created direct officers to manage contacts with the other European powers.\nOne important contact began in 1726 when Agaja sent Bulfinch Lambe (a British trader captured in the 1724 attack on Godomey) and a Dahomey ambassador known as Adomo Tomo or Captain Tom on a mission to Britain. Lambe was meant to deliver a \"Scheme of Trade\" to King George I. The \"Scheme of Trade\" outlined a plan for King George I to work with King Agaja in the creation of a plantation in Dahomey, exporting goods such as sugar, cotton, and indigo. However, Lambe was aware that the English had already abandoned plans to set up a plantation in Dahomey; he left Dahomey with no intention of following through on Agaja's plan. Lambe initially sold Adomo Tomo into slavery in Maryland, but after a few years came back to free Tomo and bring him to England. Lambe and Tomo carried a letter claimed to be from Agaja and received an audience with King George II. The letter from Agaja was dismissed as a fraud and Tomo was returned to Dahomey where Agaja appointed him the assistant to the chief of trade with the British.\nDeath.\nAgaja died in Allada a few months after returning following the war with Oyo in 1740. Oral traditions say that Tegbessou, who was the fifth oldest son of Agaja, was told by Agaja earlier that because he had saved Dahomey from the Oyo Empire he was going to be the king rather than any of his older brothers, although that tradition may have been created by Tegbessou to legitimize his rule. Regardless, the result was a contest between him and his brothers upon Agaja's death. In the end, Tegbessou was victorious and became the new king of Dahomey.\nAgaja and the slave trade.\nAgaja's motivations for taking over Allada and Whydah and his involvement in the slave trade have been a topic for debate among historians. The debate centers largely around Agaja's conquest of Allada and Whydah and an observed decrease in the slave trade in the area after this conquest. Complicating attempts to discern motivation is that Agaja's administration ended by creating a significant infrastructure for the slave trade and participated actively in it during the last few years of his reign.\nThe debate over Agaja's motivations goes back to John Atkins' 1735 publication of \"A Voyage to Guinea, Brazil, and the West Indies\". In that book, Atkins argued that Allada and Whydah were known for regular slave raiding on the Abomey plateau and that Agaja's attacks on those kingdoms were primarily to release some of his people who had been captured. A key piece of evidence for Atkins was a letter purported to be from Agaja and carried by Bulfinch Lambe to England in 1731 which expressed the willingness of Agaja to establish agricultural exports to Great Britain as an alternative to the slave trade. The authenticity of this letter is disputed and it was widely used in abolition debates in Great Britain as a letter by a purported indigenous African abolitionist.\nLater historians have continued this debate about the role of Agaja in the slave trade, but with the need to account for the fact that in the last years of Agaja's life (and after Atkins' book was published) the Kingdom of Dahomey was a major participant in the Atlantic slave trade.\nRobert W. Harms writes that Agaja's participation in the slave trade was a self-perpetuated necessity. Agaja had increasingly made his kingdom more and more dependent on foreign wares that could only be paid for by slaves. He writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He noted that by converting his army from bows and arrows to guns, he needed a steady supply of gunpowder from the Europeans. He also described the fine clothing of his wives and the opulence of his royal court, implying that he needed a reliable supply of imported cloth and other luxury goods in order to maintain the court lifestyle. Finally, he noted that, as king of Dahomey, he had an obligation to distribute cowry shells and other common goods periodically among the common people. The cowry shells for the common people, like the silk cloth for the royal wives and the gunpowder for the army, could be obtained only through the slave trade.\nBasil Davidson contended that Dahomey was drawn into the slave trade only as a means of self-defense against slave raiding by the Oyo Empire and the kingdoms of Allada and Whydah. He argued that Agaja took over the coastal cities to secure access to European firearms to protect the Fon from slave raiding. He writes: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dahomey emerged \"at the beginning of the seventeenth century, or about 1625, when the Fon people of the country behind the Slave Coast drew together in self-defense against the slave-raiding of their eastern neighbor, the Yoruba of Oyo. No doubt the Fon were interested in defending themselves from coastal raiders too...But the new state of Dahomey could defend itself effectively only if it could lay hold on adequate supplies of firearms and ammunition. And these it could obtain only by trade with Ardra [Allada] and Ouidah [Whydah] -- and, of course, only in exchange for slaves...In the end, Dahomey found their exactions intolerable. They refused to allow Dahomey to sell its captives to the Europeans except through them, and this was the immediate reason why the fourth king of Dahomey, Agaja, waged successful war on them in 1727 and seized their towns.\"\nI.A. Akinjogbin has pushed the argument the farthest arguing that Agaja's primary motivation was to end the slave trade in the region. He writes that although Agaja participated in the slave trade, this was primarily a means of self-defense and that his original motives were to end the slave trade. The Bulfinch Lambe letter plays a prominent role in Akinjogbin's analysis as a declaration of Agaja's willingness to stop the slave trade. Akinjogbin writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It immediately becomes clear that Agaja had very little sympathy for the slave trade when he invaded the Aja coast [Allada and Whydah]. His first motive appears to have been to sweep away the traditional political system, which had completely broken down and was no longer capable of providing basic security and justice...The second motive would appear to have been to restrict and eventually stop the slave trade, which had been the cause of the breakdown of the traditional system in Aja, and to substitute other 'legitimate' items of trade between Europe and the new kingdom of Dahomey.\nHistorian Robin Law, in contrast, argues that there is no clear evidence of motivation by Agaja opposing the slave trade and that the conquests of Allada and Whydah may have been simply done to improve Agaja's access to economic trade. Law contends that the disruption in slave trade that followed the rise of Dahomey was not necessarily related to any efforts on their part to slow the slave trade, but was simply due to the disruption caused by their conquests. Law believes in the authenticity of the Bulfinch Lambe letter, but contends that Atkins misinterprets it. In addition, Law doubts the self-defense motivation highlighted by Davidson and Akinjogbin, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is true that the kings of Dahomey subsequently claimed credit for having freed the Dahomey area from the threat of invasion by neighbouring states, but there is no suggestion that this was a motive for either the original foundation or the subsequent expansion of the kingdom, or indeed that such invasions were seen (to any greater degree than Dahomey's own wars) as slave raids.\nSimilarly, David Henige and Marion Johnson question Akinjogbin's argument. While agreeing with the evidence from Akinjogbin that trade did slow after Agaja's rise, they find that the evidence does not support any altruistic or moral opposition to the slave trade as the reason for this. In terms of the Bulfinch Lambe letter, they maintain that its authenticity remains \"not proven\" but that since Lambe was provided 80 slaves when he was released, it is unlikely that Agaja's motivations were clear. Instead, they argue that the evidence supports Agaja trying to get involved in the slave trade but being unable to do so because of war with the exiled royal family of Whydah and the Oyo Empire. They write:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Agaja's actions, insofar as we know them, suggest a willingness to participate in the external trade\u2014be it slaves, goods, or gold\u2014in a way that suited the perceived needs of Dahomey. At the same time, he was unable to implement this opportunity immediately because of the persistent warfare that threatened the existence of his state. During such a transitional and troubled period, trade inevitably languished. Such a view may not necessarily be correct, but it has the clear advantage of being both plausible and congenial to the available evidence.\nEdna Bay assesses the debate by writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Though the possibility that an African monarch tried to put an end to the slave trade is obviously attractive in the twentieth century, historians who have closely considered the evidence from Dahomey suggest, as did the eighteenth-century slave traders, that Dahomey's motive was a desire to trade directly with Europe, and that the kingdom was willing to provide the product most desired by European traders, human beings. Akinjogbin's thesis therefore is not likely. However, both Atkin's idea that Dahomey wanted to stop raids on its own people \"and\" the argument that the Dahomeans were seeking direct overseas commerce in slaves are conceivable.\nLegacy.\nAgaja is credited with introducing many features of the Dahomey state that became defining characteristics for future kings. It is often said that Agaja created the \"Mehu\" (a prime minister), the \"Yovogan\" (chief to deal with Europeans), and other administrative positions. However, oral traditions sometimes ascribe these developments to other kings. In addition, Agaja is sometimes credited as the king who created the Dahomey Amazons, a military unit composed entirely of women. Multiple histories account that Agaja did have armed female bodyguards in his palace and that he did dress women in armor in order to attack Whydah in 1728; however, historian Stanley Alpern believes that the Amazons were not likely fully organized during his reign.\nAgaja also had a large impact on the religion of Dahomey, largely by increasing the centrality of the Annual Customs (\"xwetanu\" or \"huetanu\" in Fon). Although the Annual Customs already existed and each family had similar celebrations, Agaja transformed this by making the royal Annual Customs the central religious ceremony in the kingdom. Family celebrations could not occur until after the royal Annual Customs had occurred.\nAgaja is often considered one of the great kings in Dahomey history and is remembered as the \"great warrior\". His expansions of Dahomey and connections with European traders led to his depiction in Dahomey art as a European caravel boat.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While not the oldest son of King Agaja (1718-1740), he became king after Agaja's death following a succession struggle with a brother.\nRise to power.\nOral traditions hold that Tegbesu was the son of Agaja and Hwanjile, a woman reported to have brought \"Vodun\" to the kingdom. King Agaja had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Dahomey during his reign, notably conquering Allada in 1724 and Whydah in 1727. This increased the size of the kingdom and increased both domestic dissent (with the royal aristocrats of both Allada and Whydah opposing Dahomey from fortified islands off the coast) and regional opposition (mainly with semi-regular warfare between Dahomey and the Oyo Empire). According to one oral tradition, as part of the tribute owed by Dahomey to Oyo, Agaja had to give to Oyo one of his sons. The story claims that only Hwanjile of all of Agaja's wives was willing to allow her son to go to Oyo. This act of sacrifice, according to the oral tradition made Tegbesu favored by Agaja. Agaja reportedly tells Tegbesu that he is the future king, but his brother Zinga is still the official heir.\nOne oral history contends that with the death of Agaja, Tegbesu's brothers quickly plot to kill him. His brothers surrounded his house to prevent him from reaching the Palace and claiming the throne, but he miraculously escapes and reaches the palace. Despite challenges, the Great Council appoints Tegbesu the new king. Historian Edna Bay notes that oral histories disagree about precisely \"who\" appointed Tegbesu as the new king.\nAdministration.\nTegbesu ruled over Dahomey at a point where it needed to increase its legitimacy over those who it had recently conquered. As a result, Tegbesu is often credited with a number of administrative changes in the kingdom in order to establish the legitimacy of the kingdom.\nSince he had spent significant time during his youth in Oyo, much of the kingdom was fashioned along administrative aspects of that empire. Tegbesu returned the capital from Allada to Abomey, while creating a puppet king to rule in Allada. He increased the number of wives of the king in order to establish wide family connections throughout the kingdom. The Palace complex was styled along those of Oyo and a number of administrative positions were created that had existed in Oyo. Most notably, Tegbesu had multiple traitors in Ouidah put to death and replaced with individuals loyal to him. In addition, instead of having different administrative positions to deal with each different European power, he created the \"Yevogan\" in 1745, a central bureaucrat to deal with all European trade.\nIn addition, Tegbesu's rule is the one with the first significant \"kpojito\" or \"mother of the leopard\" with Hwanjile in that role. The \"kpojito\" became a prominently important person in Dahomey royalty. Hwanjile, in particular, is said to have changed dramatically the religious practices of Dahomey by creating two new deities and more closely tying worship to that of the king.\nThe slave trade increased significantly during Tegbesu's reign and begun to provide the largest part of the income for the king, reportedly earning him \u00a3250,000 per year (over \u00a356 million adjusted for inflation as of 2020 according to the Bank of England Inflation Calculator).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72444", "revid": "2308770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72444", "title": "Kpengla", "text": "King of Dahomey from 1774 to 1789\nKpengla was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1774 until 1789. Kpengla followed his father Tegbessou to the throne and much of his administration was defined by the increasing Atlantic slave trade and regional rivalry over the profits from this trade. His attempts to control the slave trade generally failed, and when he died of smallpox in 1789, his son Agonglo came to the throne and ended many of his policies.\nRise to power.\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey had increased significantly in power since the 1720s. King Agaja (1718-1740) had expanded the kingdom to the key Atlantic ports of Whydah and Allada. Agaja's son King Tegbessou (1740-1774) had similarly expanded the kingdom. However, the kingdom remained a tributary to the Oyo Empire, owing yearly gifts to the Oyo Empire. The slave trade had increased substantially along the coast with European traders. During the last years of Tegbessou's reign, the Oyo Empire began restricting the slave trade through Dahomey and channeling slaves to other ports or to charge high prices through Dahomey. The shortage became so problematic that Tegbessou was forced to sell his own slaves to keep the trade going.\nIt is not entirely clear whether Kpengla was the named heir of Tegbessou; regardless, upon Tegbessou's death, he rushed with armed companions to the Royal Palace to make a claim to the throne. Large scale fighting occurred in the palace and it is reported that 285 women in the palace fighting died. Following this struggle, Kpengla was named king. Kpengla made attempts to improve relations with the Ashanti Empire. Diplomatic missions were exchanged between Asantehene Osei Kwadwo and Kpengla. It may have been through these missions that the Togo hills became recognized as the neutral zone between both states.\nSlave trade policy.\nKpengla became king at a particularly difficult period of history for the kingdom. The slave trade was the major economic resource for the kingdom and the king's personal finances, but Oyo and other inland traders had begun raising rates and playing port cities against one another. Kpengla had the opportunity to either improve the kingdom's position as middleman or to start slave raiding which would cause anger by Oyo and others. At Kpengla's coronation, he vowed to free Dahomey from the Oyo Empire in terms of both ending the tributary status of Dahomey to Oyo and breaking their control over the slave trade.\nKpengla initially attempted to negotiate a situation with the Oyo Empire that would cement the position of Dahomey as middleman between Oyo and the Europeans. The proposal was that Dahomey would destroy eastern slave ports which were taking trade away from Dahomey and Oyo ports, forcing the Europeans to trade with their ports. Kpengla believed that this situation would result in the Oyo moving their trade from rival ports like Porto-Novo into the Dahomey port of Whydah. As a result, Kpengla destroyed Epe in 1782 and Badagry in 1784. Having fulfilled his part of the agreement, Kpengla grew angry when Oyo and Porto-Novo continued to trade actively as a rival port to Whydah.\nAs a result, Kpengla reformed trade policy to ban all trade in slaves with Oyo in 1786. The next year, he created a royal monopoly over trade at Whydah, controlling all English and French imports (except for Brazilian tobacco). In addition, he set price controls significantly decreasing the price of slaves into the kingdom. Traders who attempted to work around the price controls were executed or sold as slaves themselves. Traders resisted this and decided not to sell slaves at all. Kpengla responded by forcing sale by the traders. These policies resulted in significant movement of trade away from Dahomey and to other ports and so in 1788, he began slave raiding once again.\nConstruction.\nKpengla was crucial in significant amount of construction in Abomey and the kingdom. Kpengla may have been the king to establish the royal road of Dahomey, a wide road from Whydah to Cana and then to Abomey. This width of this road and its maintenance were unique in West Africa for the time and the Cana to Abomey stretch was maintained and impressed European visitors for the next century. Lionel Abson, head of the English fort at Whydah, first reported of the project in the 18th century. According to Abson, in 1779 the king;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;ordered all his subjects to set about clearing the paths, giving each caboceer (chief) a string, measuring ten yards, the intended width of roads. Thus a spacious communication was opened, not only between each town and the capital, but all the way down to the beach [at Why-dah]. With incredible labour and fatigue, a passage was cut through the wood at Apoy; the gullies were filled up, and the hurdle bridges, over the swamps, were widened. When this work was completed, the King said, with a vainglorious air, If any one be desirous of paying me a visit, he shall not have it to say, that thorns or briars impede his march...\nDeath.\nKpengla died in 1789 from smallpox and his son Agonglo became the new king after a violent struggle in the palace that resulted in hundreds of deaths. Agonglo largely ended Kpengla's slave trade restrictions and allowed slave traders to set their own rate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Agonglo took over from his father King Kpengla in 1789 and inherited many of the economic problems that developed during Kpengla's reign. Because of the poor economy, Agonglo was often constrained by domestic opposition. As a response, he reformed many of the economic policies (lowered taxes and removed constrains on the slave trade) and did military expeditions to try to increase the supply for the Atlantic slave trade. Many of these efforts were unsuccessful and European traders became less active in the ports of the kingdom. As a final effort, Agonglo accepted two Portuguese Catholic missionaries which resulted in a large outcry in royal circles and resulted in his assassination on May 1, 1797. Adandozan, his second oldest son, was named the new king.\nRise to power.\nAgonglo was the oldest son of King Kpengla (ruled 1774\u20131789), who had ruled over a long-term economic crisis in Dahomey. The Oyo empire still had suzerainty over the kingdom and in the time of Kpengla this power of Oyo over the kingdom had resulted in decreased slave trading by Dahomey. Kpengla responded in a variety of ways: first trying to defeat common competitors of both Oyo and Dahomey, then when this failed he ended slave trade with Oyo entirely, raised harsh taxes on slave traders through Dahomey, and resumed slave raiding. These policies largely did not work and the slave trade, which had become the primary trade for Dahomey, slowed significantly.\nPolitical factions were also developing in Dahomey under Kpengla. When Tegbessou (ruled 1740\u20131774) became king in a contentious selection, two older sons of King Agaja were passed over for selection. The heirs of these two other brothers had slowly increased their power into a distinct rival claim to the throne at Dahomey.\nWhen Kpengla died in 1789, four rival claimants came to the throne: two younger brothers of Kpengla, Fraku or Don Jeronimo (the son of one of the older sons of Agaja), and Agonglo (the oldest son of Kpengla. The Migan and Mehu of Dahomey, who were tasked with selecting the new king, choose Agonglo, but there remained significant political opposition to Agonglo. The selection of Agonglo resulted in such widespread opposition that the political functions of the kingdom largely halted for a year. Agonglo then did a series of conciliatory moves to try to end the opposition: promised to give citizens back some rights, ended constraints on slave traders, reduced taxes, reassigned some of the aggressive tax collectors into the army, and recognized other powerful individuals.\nAdministration.\nAs king, Agonglo attempted a variety of efforts to get the Dahomey economy started but was often constrained by domestic opposition and a major smallpox epidemic. The Oyo empire which had exercised power over Dahomey since 1730 had grown significantly weak in the early 1790s. This culminated in the suicide of the king of Oyo in 1796, which provided Agonglo with the ability to end the tributary status of Dahomey to Oyo. However, while Agonglo was able to act independently, domestic dissent prevented him from directly challenging Oyo power.\nAlthough he reduced many of the restrictions on slave traders that Kpengla had created, he still followed some of the other policies of Kpengla: including slave raiding and attacking rival ports. However, these were generally not successful with multiple unsuccessful raids against the Mahi people to the north and unsuccessful attacks on Little Popo and Porto-Novo. However, in 1795 he was able to lead a successful slave raid against the Mahi, largely by rewarding soldiers with wives before the war, and allied with Grand-Popo was able to successfully disrupt Little Popo's slave trade.\nUnfortunately these efforts to improve the domestic supply of slaves were of limited impact because of developments impacting the different European countries involved in the slave trade. The British commander in the port city of Whydah had become very slow and unresponsive to British regional efforts and so the British had slowed their trade in the port. At the same time, the French Revolution resulted in France banning the trade on slaves in 1794 (to be restored in 1802) and began an active effort to stop the trade by other countries. In November 1794, the French seized all Portuguese slave ships in the port of Whydah and would continue this practice for the next few years. The result was that Whydah no longer was a safe harbor for the trade and Portuguese slowed their trade.\nAgonglo responded by sending three ambassadors to Maria I of Portugal to try to convince her to resume trade with Dahomey. Instead of resuming the trade, Maria sent two Catholic missionaries to Agonglo and encouraged him to convert for continued trade relations. Agonglo accepted the missionaries and expressed a willingness to be converted which caused a significant uproar amongst different factions within the kingdom. It is unknown whether he was sincere in his willingness to be converted or whether it was merely to appease the Portuguese. Agonglo did know about Catholicism, having married the former wife of the commander of the French fort in Whydah, a Dutch-African woman named Sophie who had introduced a Christian shrine into the pantheon of deities worshiped.\nRegardless, the willingness for conversion resulted in Dogan, a brother of Agonglo, starting serious efforts to remove Agonglo from power. Lengthy debates in the palace followed and when these efforts failed, on May 1, 1797, Dogan and a woman named Na Wanjile assassinated Agonglo in the palace. According to Akingjogbin, she shot and killed Agonglo, but Edna Bay says that the assassination happened through poisoning. Dogan and Na Wanjile were buried alive for the assassination.\nSuccession.\nWith the execution of Dogan, the Migan and Mehu of Dahomey named Adandozan, the second oldest son of Agonglo, as the new king. Although Adandozan was quite young, he started his reign by punishing all members of the faction that had killed his father executing hundreds and selling the rest into slavery. Those sold into slavery included the future mother of King Ghezo who would replace Adandozan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72447", "revid": "313186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72447", "title": "Jean-Pierre Rampal", "text": "French flautist (1922\u20132000)\nJean-Pierre Louis Rampal (7 January 1922 \u2013 20 May 2000) was a French flautist. Rampal popularised the flute in the post\u2013World\u00a0War\u00a0II years, recovering flute compositions from the Baroque era, and spurring contemporary composers, such as Francis Poulenc, to create new works that have become modern standards in the flautist's repertoire.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Marseille, the only child of Andr\u00e9e (n\u00e9e Roggero) and flautist Joseph Rampal. His father Joseph was taught by Hennebains, who also taught Rene le Roy and Marcel Moyse. \nUnder the tutelage of his father, Rampal began playing the flute at the age of 12. He studied the Alt\u00e8s method at the Conservatoire, where he won first prize in the school's annual flute competition in 1937 at age 16. This was also the year of his first public recital at the Salle Mazenod in Marseille. By then, Rampal was playing second flute alongside his father in the Orchestre des Concerts Classiques de Marseille.\nHis career in music began without the full encouragement of his parents. Rampal's mother and father encouraged him to become a doctor or surgeon as they felt those professions were more reliable than becoming a professional musician. At the beginning of the Second World War, Rampal duly entered medical school in Marseille, studying there for three years. In 1943, authorities of the Nazi Occupation of France drafted him for forced labour in Germany. To avoid this, he fled to Paris, where it was easier to avoid detection, by frequently changing his lodgings.\nWhile in Paris, Rampal auditioned to study flute at the Paris Conservatoire, where he was taught by Gaston Crunelle from January 1944. Years later, he succeeded Crunelle as flute professor at the Conservatoire. After four months, Rampal's performance of Jolivet's \"Le chant de Linos\" won him the coveted first prize in the conservatory's annual flute competition.\nPost-war success.\nIn 1945, following the liberation of Paris, Rampal was invited by the composer Henri Tomasi\u2014then conductor of the Orchestre National de France\u2014to perform the Flute Concerto by Jacques Ibert, written for Marcel Moyse in 1934, live on French National Radio. It launched his concert career and was the first of many such broadcasts.\nWith the war over, Rampal embarked on a series of performances: at first, within France; and then, in 1947, in Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. Almost from the beginning, he was accompanied by pianist and harpsichordist Robert Veyron-Lacroix, whom he had met at the Paris Conservatoire in 1946. By contrast with, as Rampal saw it, his own somewhat emotional Proven\u00e7al temperament, Veyron-Lacroix was a more refined character (a \"true upper class Parisian\"), but each found with the other a balanced musical partnership. The appearance of this duo after the war has been described as a \"complete novelty\", allowing them to make a rapid impact on the music-going public in France and elsewhere. In March 1949, in the face of some scepticism, they hired the Salle Gaveau in Paris to perform what then seemed the radical idea of a recital programme made up solely of chamber music for flute. It was one of the first flute/piano recitals the city had seen, and caused a \"sensation\". The success encouraged Rampal to continue along that track. The recital was repeated the following year in Paris. Throughout the early 1950s, the duo made regular radio broadcasts and gave concerts within France and elsewhere in Europe. Their first international tour came in 1953: an island-hopping journey through Indonesia to ex-pat audiences. From 1954 onwards came his first concerts in eastern Europe\u2014most significantly in Prague, where he premiered Jindrich Feld's \"Flute Concerto\" in 1956. In the same year, he appeared in Canada\u2014where, at the Menton festival, he played for the first time in concert with violinist Isaac Stern, who not only became a lifelong friend but also proved a considerable influence on Rampal's own approach to musical expression.\nOn 14 February 1958, Rampal and Veyron-Lacroix made their US debut with a recital of Poulenc, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Prokofiev in Washington, D.C. at the Library of Congress. In 1959, Rampal gave his first concert in New York City, at the Town Hall. Rampal's successful partnership with Veyron-Lacroix produced their 1962 double LP of the complete Bach flute sonatas. They performed and toured together for some 35 years, until the early 1980s, when Veyron-Lacroix was forced to retire owing to ill-health. Rampal then formed a new and also long-running musical partnership with American pianist John Steele Ritter.\nWhile he pursued his career as a soloist, Rampal remained a ensemble player throughout his life. In 1946, he and oboist Pierre Pierlot founded the Quintette a Vent Francais (French Wind Quintet), formed of a group of musical friends who had made their way through the war: Rampal, Pierlot, clarinetist Jacques Lancelot, bassoonist Paul Hongne, and horn-player Gilbert Coursier. Early in 1944, they had played together, broadcasting at night from a secret \"cave\" radio station at the Club d\u2019essai in rue de Bec, Paris\u2014a programme of music outlawed by the Nazis, including works with Jewish links by composers such as Hindemith, Schoenberg and Milhaud. The Quintet remained active until the 1960s.\nBetween 1955 and 1962, Rampal took up the post of Principal Flute at the Paris Opera, traditionally the most prestigious orchestral position open to a French flautist. Having been married in 1947 and now a father of two, the post offered him a regular income.\nRecovering the Baroque.\nRampal's first commercial recording, made in 1946 for the Boite a Musique label in Montparnasse, Paris, was of Mozart's Flute Quartet in D, with the Trio Pasquier. A key element in Rampal's success in the years immediately after World\u00a0War\u00a0II\u2014aside from his evident ability\u2014was his passion for the music of the Baroque era. Aside from a few works by Bach and Vivaldi, Baroque music was still largely unrecognised when Rampal started out. He was well aware that his determination to promote the flute as a prominent solo instrument required a wide and flexible repertoire to support the endeavour. Accordingly, he seems to have been clear in his own mind from the beginning about the importance, as a ready-made resource, of the so-called \"Golden Age of the Flute\", as the Baroque era had become known. Hundreds of concertos and chamber works written for the flute in the 18th century had fallen into obscurity, and he recognised that the sheer abundance of this early material might offer long-term possibilities for an aspiring soloist.\nEven before World\u00a0War\u00a0II, he had begun collecting obscure sheet music from the Baroque\u2014making himself familiar with original publishers and catalogues, even though very few published editions were then available. He went on to research in libraries and archives in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Turin, and every other major city he performed in, and corresponded with others across the musical world. From original sources, he developed a detailed understanding of the Baroque style. He studied Quantz and his famous treatise \"On Playing The Flute\" (1752), and later acquired an original copy of it. For Rampal, the Baroque legacy was fuel to set alight a renewed interest in the flute, and it was his energy in pursuing this goal that set him apart from his forebears. Whereas Le Roy, Laurent and Barr\u00e8re had all recorded two or three of Bach's flute sonatas between 1929 and 1939, between 1947 and 1950 Rampal recorded all of them for Bo\u00eete \u00e0 Musique, and was beginning to regularly perform the complete Bach sonatas in recital, organising them across two evenings. As early as 1950\u201351 he became the first to record all six of Vivaldi's Op.10 concertos, an exercise he was to repeat several times in later years.\nIn an interview with \"The New York Times\", he offered one explanation for the appeal of Baroque music after the war: \"With all this bad mess we had in Europe during the war, people were looking for something quieter, more structured, more well balanced than Romantic music.\"\nIn the process of excavating forgotten works for performance, Rampal also had to discover new ways of playing that era's music. He applied his own bright tone and the liveliness and freedom of his style to the original texts, developing along the way a very individual approach to interpretation and, after the Baroque style, to improvised ornamentation. Throughout, Rampal was never tempted to perform on a period instrument; the movement that championed \"authentic\" instruments for \"true\" performance of Baroque music had not yet emerged. Instead, he drew on the full range of effects offered by the modern flute to reveal fresh elegance and nuance to Baroque compositions. It was this modernity\u2013the richness and clarity of his sound and the freedom and personality in his expression\u2013combined with a sense of hidden treasures being shared that caught the attention of a wider musical public. \"Enchantment is the best possible word to describe this concert\", said one Canadian reviewer for \"Le Devoir\" in 1956; \"Rampal's playing struck me through its variety, its flexibility, its colour and above all its liveliness.\" This striking effect can be heard on his earliest recordings, between 1946 and 1950. During this period, Rampal quickly benefited from the birth of the long-playing gramophone record. Before 1950, all of his recordings were on 78\u00a0rpm discs. After 1950, the 33\u2153\u00a0rpm long-playing era allowed much greater freedom to accommodate the rate at which he was committing performances to record. At the same time, the birth of the television age ensured Rampal a wider prominence in France than any previous flute-player, through his many concert and recital appearances in the late 1950s and beyond.\nA great deal of the material Rampal performed and recorded he also published, supervising sheet music collections in both Europe and the US. In his autobiography, he remarked that he had felt it part of his \"duty\" to expand as much as possible the repertoire for fellow flautists as well as for himself. In trying to keep the flute before the musical public in the widest sense possible, Rampal also played in as many groups and combinations as he could, a habit he continued for the rest of his life.\nIn 1952 he founded the Ensemble Baroque de Paris, featuring Rampal himself, Veyron-Lacroix, Pierlot, Hongne, and violinist Robert Gendre. Remaining together over almost three decades, the ensemble proved one of the first musical groups to bring to light the chamber repertoire of the 18th century.\nCollaborations.\nThrough his recordings for labels including L'Oiseau-Lyre and, from the mid-1950s, Erato, Rampal continued to give new currency to many \"lost\" concertos by Italian composers such as Tartini, Cimarosa, Sammartini, and Pergolesi (often collaborating with Claudio Scimone and I Solisti Veneti), and French composers including Devienne, Leclair, and Loeillet, as well as other works from the Potsdam court of the flute-playing king Frederick the Great. His 1955 collaboration in Prague with Czech flautist, composer, and conductor Milan Munclinger resulted in a recording of flute concertos by Benda and Richter. In 1956, with Louis Froment, he recorded concertos in A minor and G major by C.P.E. Bach. Other composers of the era, such as Haydn, Handel, Stamitz, and Quantz, also figured significantly in his repertoire. He was open to experimentation; once, through laborious over-dubbing, he played all five parts in an early recording of a flute quintet by Boismortier. Rampal was the first flautist to record most, if not all, of the flute works by Bach, Handel, Telemann, Vivaldi, and other composers who now comprise the core repertoire for flute players.\nRampal extended his researches into the Classical and Romantic eras in order to establish some continuity to the repertoire of his instrument. For example, his first \"recital\" LP, released in both America and Europe, featured music from Bach, Beethoven, Hindemith, Honegger, and Dukas. Aside from recording familiar composers such as Mozart, Schumann, and Schubert, Rampal also helped bring the works of composers such as Reinecke, Gianella, and Mercadante back into view. From the start, his recital programmes included modern compositions as well. In 1948, as part of his debut recital in Paris, Rampal gave the first Western performance of Prokofiev's Sonata for Flute and Piano in D, which in the 1940s was in danger of being co-opted for the violin despite originally having been written for flute. Later, when preparing a new sheet music edition published by the International Music Company of New York, Rampal consulted Russian violinist David Oistrakh to achieve the best result; the piece has since become established as a flute favourite. Over his career, he performed all of the flute masterpieces that were composed in the first half of the 20th century, including works by Debussy, Ravel, Roussel, Ibert, Milhaud, Martin\u016f, Hindemith, Honegger, Dukas, Fran\u00e7aix, Damase, and Feld.\nAs a chamber musician, he continued to collaborate with numerous other soloists, forming collaborations with violinist Isaac Stern and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. A number of composers wrote especially for Rampal, including Henri Tomasi (\"Sonatine pour fl\u00fbte seule\", 1949), Jean Fran\u00e7aix (\"Divertimento\", 1953), Andr\u00e9 Jolivet (\"Concerto\", 1949), Jind\u0159ich Feld (\"Sonata\", 1957), and Jean Martinon (\"Sonatine\"). Others included Jean Rivier, Antoine Tisn\u00e9, Serge Nigg, Charles Chaynes, and Maurice Ohana. In addition, he premiered a works by contemporary composers such as Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, Ezra Laderman, David Diamond, and Krzysztof Penderecki. His transcribing in 1968, at the composer's own suggestion, of Aram Khachaturian's Violin Concerto (recorded 1970) showed Rampal's willingness to broaden the flute repertoire further by borrowing from other instruments. In 1978, the Armenian-American composer Alan Hovhaness wrote his Symphony No. 36, which contained a melodic flute part tailored especially for Rampal, who gave the premiere performance of the work in concert with the National Symphony Orchestra.\nThe only piece dedicated to Rampal that he never publicly performed was the \"Sonatine\" (1946) by Pierre Boulez, which\u2014with its spiky, explosive figures and extravagant use of flutter-tonguing\u2014he found too abstract for his taste. Elsewhere, when sometimes criticised for not playing enough contemporary avant-garde work\u2014\"Avant garde of what?\" he would ask\u2014Rampal confirmed his aversion to music that looked \"like the blueprints for a plumber... pieces that go tweak, twonk, thump, snort\u2014this doesn't inspire me.\"\nOne piece in particular, written with Rampal in mind, has since become a modern standard in the essential flute repertoire. Rampal's compatriot Francis Poulenc was commissioned by the Coolidge Foundation of America in 1957 to write a new flute piece. The composer consulted with Rampal regularly on shaping the flute part, and the result, in Rampal's own words, is \"a pearl of the flute literature\". The official world premiere of Poulenc's Sonata for Flute and Piano was performed on 17 June 1957 by Rampal, accompanied by the composer, at the Strasbourg Festival. Unofficially, however, they had performed it a day or two earlier to a distinguished audience of one: the pianist Artur Rubinstein, a friend of Poulenc's, was unable to stay in Strasbourg for the evening of the concert itself, and so the duo obliged him with a private performance. Poulenc was then unable to travel to Washington for the US premiere on 14 February 1958, so Veyron-Lacroix took his place, and the sonata became a key offering in Rampal's US recital debut, helping launch his long-lived trans-Atlantic career.\n\"L'homme \u00e0 la fl\u00fbte d'or\".\nRampal was the owner of the only solid gold flute (No. 1375) made, in 1869, by the great French craftsman Louis Lot. Rumours of the survival of the 18-carat gold Lot had been circulating in France for years before the Second\u00a0World\u00a0War, but no one knew where the piece had gone. In 1948, almost by chance, Rampal acquired the instrument from an antiques dealer who had wanted to melt the instrument down for the gold\u2014evidently unaware that he was in possession of the flute equivalent of a Stradivarius. With family help, Rampal raised enough funds to rescue the instrument, and went on to perform and record with it for 11 years. In interviews, Rampal said he thought the gold\u2014by contrast with silver\u2014made his naturally bright, sparkling sound \"a little darker; the colour is a little warmer, I like it\". Only in 1958, when presented during his debut US tour with a 14-carat gold instrument made after the Lot pattern by the William S. Haynes Flute Company of Boston, did Rampal stop using the 1869 original. After one final recording in London, he consigned the golden Lot to the safety of a bank vault in France, and thereafter made the Haynes his concert instrument of choice.\nCelebrity.\nThroughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Rampal remained especially popular in the US and Japan (where he had first toured in 1964). He toured America annually and was a regular presence at the Mostly Mozart Festival at the Lincoln Center in New York. At his busiest, he performed between 150 and 200 concerts a year.\nHis range extended well beyond the orthodox: alongside the classical recordings, he recorded Catalan and Scottish folk songs, Indian music with sitarist Ravi Shankar, and, accompanied by the French harpist Lily Laskine, an album of Japanese folk melodies that was named album of the year in Japan. He also recorded Scott Joplin rags and Gershwin, and collaborated with French jazz pianist Claude Bolling. The Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano (1975), written by Bolling especially for Rampal, topped the US \"Billboard\" charts and remained there for ten years. This raised his profile with the American public even further and led, in January 1981, to a TV appearance on Jim Henson's \"The Muppet Show\", where he played \"Lo, Hear the Gentle Lark\" with Miss Piggy\u2014and, suitably attired, \"Ease on Down the Road\" in a scene loosely based on the folktale of the Pied Piper.\nBack on the classical stage, he was not afraid to be, as he put it, \"a bit of a ham\"; when performing Scott Joplin's \"Ragtime Dance and Stomp\" as a concert hall encore, for example, he provided extra percussion by stamping his feet rhythmically on stage in time to the music.\nMeanwhile, Bolling and Rampal came together again for Bolling's \"Picnic Suite\" (1980) with guitarist Alexander Lagoya, the \"Suite No. 2 for Flute and Jazz Piano\" (1987), and also to perform the instrumental theme song \"Goodbye For Now\" by Stephen Sondheim for \"Reds\", Warren Beatty's 1981 movie about the Communist revolution in Russia. His reputation as a celebrity soloist in America became such that, as \"Esquire\" reported, one critic dubbed him \"the Alexander of the flute, with no new worlds to conquer.\" Following a performance of Mozart's Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra with the New York Philharmonic in 1976, \"New York Times\" critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote \"Mr. Rampal, with his effortless long line, his sweet and pure tone and his sensitive musicianship, is of course one of the great flutists in history.\" Throughout these years of mounting celebrity, Rampal continued to research and edit sheet-music editions of flute works for publishing houses including Georges Billaudot in Paris and the International Music Company in the US.\nAchievement.\nOf the primal appeal of the flute, Rampal once told the \"Chicago Tribune\": \"For me, the flute is really the sound of humanity, the sound of man flowing, completely free from his body almost without an intermediary[...] Playing the flute is not as direct as singing, but it's nearly the same.\"\nCalling Rampal \"an indisputably major artist\", \"The New York Times\" said \"Rampal's popularity was grounded in qualities that won him consistent praise from critics and musicians in the first decades of his career: solid musicianship, technical command, uncanny breath control, and a distinctive tone that eschewed Romantic richness and warm vibrato in favor of clarity, radiance, focus and a wide palette of colorings. Younger flutists assiduously studied and tried to copy his approaches to tonguing, fingering, embouchure (the position of the lips on the mouthpiece) and breathing.\"\nThroughout the busiest years of his concert career, Rampal continued to find time to teach others, encouraging his students to listen not only to other flute players, but also to take inspiration from other great musical interpreters\u2014be they pianists, violinists, or singers. He maintained a clear opinion about the right balance between \"virtuosity\" and aspiring to real musical expressiveness. \"Of course,\" he said, \"you have to master all the problems of technique to be free to express yourself through your instrument. You can have a big imagination and a big heart but you cannot express it without technique. But the first quality you must have to be good, to be inspiring, is the sound. Without the sound you cannot achieve anything. The tone, the sound, the sonorit\u00e9 is most important. Otherwise, with the fingers alone it is not enough... everyone these days has the fingers, the virtuosity... but the sound, the tone, that's not so easy.\"\nFollowing the foundation of the Nice Summer Academy in 1959, Rampal held classes there annually until 1977. In 1969, he succeeded Gaston Crunelle as flute professor at the Paris Conservatoire, a position he held until 1981. William Bennett, too, has commented on Rampal's infectious enthusiasm for music-making: \"his repute came more from his musical sparkle and the happy personality which radiated to the audience\". Bennett had also sought Rampal out for lessons in Paris and was \"instantly delighted with him\u2014his humour, and his generosity\u2014especially for his sharing my enthusiasm for other great players such as Moyse, Dufrene &amp; Crunelle\".\nRampal's principal American students include concert and recording artist Robert Stallman and Ransom Wilson, who has followed in his mentor's footsteps as conductor as well as flautist.\nFamily life.\nRampal and his harpist wife Fran\u00e7oise, n\u00e9e Bacqueryrisse, were married on 7 June 1947. They made their home in Paris, living in the Avenue Mozart. They had two children, Isabelle and Jean-Jacques. Each year, they holidayed at their house on Corsica, where Jean-Pierre was able to indulge his passion for boating, fishing and photography. Well known for his love of good food, he liked to maintain a private rule wherever he went on tour that he would eat \"only the cuisine of the country\" he was in and he looked forward to his post-concert dinners with relish. He developed a particular fondness for Japanese cuisine, and in 1981 wrote an introduction to \"The Book of Sushi\" written by a chef and a master sushi teacher.\nRampal's autobiography \"Music, My Love\" appeared in 1989 (published by Random House).\nLeaving the stage.\nIn later years, Rampal took up the conductor's baton with more frequency but he continued to play well into his late 70s. The last work of importance dedicated to him was Krzysztof Penderecki's Flute Concerto which he premiered in Switzerland in 1992, followed by its first performance in America at Lincoln Center. Rampal's last public recital was held at the Theatre Villamarta in Jerez de la Frontera (Spain) in November 1999, when he was 77; he performed works by Bach, Mozart, Kuhlau and Mendelssohn. His last recording was made with the Pasquier Trio and flautist Claudi Arimany (trio and quartets by Mozart and Hoffmeister) in Paris in December 1999.\nAfter Rampal died in Paris of heart failure in May 2000 at age 78, French President Jacques Chirac led the tributes, saying \"his flute spoke to the heart. A light in the musical world has just flickered out.\" Flautist Eugenia Zukerman observed: \"He played with such a rich palette of color in a way that few people had done before and no one since. He had an ability to imbue sound with texture and clarity and emotional content. He was a dazzling virtuoso, but more than anything he was a supreme poet.\" The trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall in New York, where Rampal had performed 45 times over a 29-year period, hailed him as \"one of the greatest flutists of the 20th Century and one of the greatest musical spirits of our time.\" The obituary in \"Le Monde\" claimed him to be no less than \"L'inventeur de la flute\" and celebrated all the musical characteristics that charmed audiences worldwide: \"la sonorite sublime, la vivacite des phrases, la virtuosite laissaient une impression de bonheur, de joie a ses auditeurs\".\nJames Galway, Rampal's globally known successor as \"The Man with the Golden Flute\", dedicated performances to him and recalled elsewhere how as a teenager he had been captivated by the sound of Rampal's \"fluid technique\" and \"the beauty of his tone\". For a young musician in the 1960s, he said, listening to Rampal's recordings \"was a step into the stars as far as flute playing was concerned.\" He recalled also the generous encouragement Rampal gave him following their meetings in Paris. Of the passing of his \"hero\", Galway added: \"He was the first major influence in my life and I am still grateful for everything he ever did for me. He was a great influence on the flute world and the musical world in general, bringing to ordinary folk through his music making a charm which enhanced their everyday lives.\"\nAt Rampal's funeral, fellow flautists played the Adagio from Boismortier's Second Flute Concerto in A Minor in recognition of his lifelong passion for Baroque music in general and Boismortier in particular.\nJean-Pierre Rampal is buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse, Paris.\nHonours.\nRampal's honours include his Grand Prix du Disques from l'Acad\u00e9mie Charles Cros which included awards for his recording of Vivaldi's Op. 10 flute concertos (1954), his recording of concertos by Benda and Richter (1955) with the Chamber Orchestra of Prague (Milan Munclinger), and in 1976 the Grand Prix ad honorem du Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique for his overall recording career to date. He also received the \"R\u00e9alit\u00e9\" Oscar du Premier Virtuose Francais (1964), the Edison Prize; the Prix Mondial du Disque; the 1978 Leonie Sonning Prize (Denmark), the 1980 Prix d\u2019Honneur of the 13th Montreux World Recording Prize for all his recordings; and the Lotos Club Medal of Merit for his lifetime's achievement. In 1988, he was created President d\u2019honneur of the French Flute Association \"La Traversi\u00e8re\", while in 1991 the National Flute Association of America gave him its inaugural Lifetime Achievement award.\nState honours included being made Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur (1966) and Officier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur (1979). He was also made a Commandeur de l\u2019Ordre National du M\u00e9rite (1982) and Commandeur de l\u2019Ordre des Arts et Lettres (1989). The City of Paris presented him with the Grande M\u00e9daille de la Ville Paris (1987), and in 1994 he received the Troph\u00e9e des Arts from the Franco-American French Institute Alliance Fran\u00e7aise \"for bridging French and American Cultures through his magnificent music\". In 1994 the Ambassador of Japan presented Rampal with the Order du Tr\u00e9asor Sacre, the highest distinction presented by the Japanese government, in recognition of having inspired a new generation of aspiring flute-players in that country. Strangely, with his enduring international fame assured, Rampal himself came to feel in later years that his own reputation within his native France had in some way diminished. It was \"curious\", he wrote in \"Le Monde\" in 1990, that no French music critics appeared to take any notice of his latest recordings: \"Everything continues as if I didn't exist\", he said; \"This doesn't matter; I still play to full houses.\"\nBut after his death, there was no shortage of public accolades to reflect the fact that he was indeed a source of national pride.\nThe Jean-Pierre Rampal Flute Competition, begun in his honour in 1980 and open to flautists of all nationalities born after 8 November 1971, is held tri-annually as part of the Concours internationaux de la Ville de Paris.\nIn June 2005, the Association Jean-Pierre Rampal was founded in France to perpetuate the study and appreciation of Rampal's contribution to the art of flute-playing. Among other projects, which include maintaining the Jean-Pierre Rampal Archive, the association has collaborated in the re-release on the Premier Horizons label of a number of early Rampal performances on CD.\nDiscography.\nThroughout his life Rampal was prolific when it came to committing performances to record. He recorded for a wide range of labels in Europe, America and Japan. In his autobiography (\"Music My Love\", 1989) Rampal admitted that he himself found it difficult to keep track of the number of recordings he had made over his lifetime. In its obituary of Rampal (June Emerson, 24 May 2000), \"The Guardian\" newspaper offered up the customary claim that Rampal \u201cbecame one of the world's most recorded artists, with more than 400 records spanning the essential flute repertoire, quantities of new discoveries and first recordings of hitherto unknown works\u201d. The \"New York Times\" obituary (Anthony Tommasini, 21 May 2000) agreed, pronouncing him \u201cone of the most-recorded and best-selling classical instrumentalists in history.\u201d Rampal's last record label, Sony Classical, went a little further, describing the flutist as perhaps the world's single most-recorded classical musician of all.\nRampal's earliest recordings, 1946\u20131950, were on 78\u00a0rpm discs, many for the Parisian \"Boite a Musique\" label. With the opening of the 33\u00a0rpm LP era, he recorded for over 20 different labels between 1950 and 1970. Among the most significant of these was the French Erato label, founded in 1953, for whom he made approximately 100 recordings (several issued in the US on the RCA Red Seal label). In 1964 alone he recorded 17 albums, including three complete sets of flute pieces by Mozart, Handel, and Beethoven, in addition to concertos and other works. In 1978, with Ensemble Lunaire, he recorded \"Japanese Folk Melodies\", which included three folk songs transcribed by Akio Yashiro but primarily featured music by late 19th and early 20th-century Japanese doyo composers: Tamez\u014d Narita, K\u014dsaku Yamada, Megumi Ohnaka, Rentar\u014d Taki, Ry\u016btar\u014d Hirota, Kozaburo Hirai, Nagayo Motohori, and Shin Kusakawa, on CBS Records. In 1979, he signed an exclusive contract with the CBS label (later Sony Classical), and he made over 60 albums for them.\nIn the years following Rampal's death in 2000 many of his recordings spanning more than half a century were re-issued. Of particular note are the several collections produced by the recording companies he was most associated with. \nJean-Pierre Rampal: Le premier virtuose moderne - The compact disc set, issued in France in 2002 in collaboration with the Association Fran\u00e7aise de la Fl\u00fbte, contains rare early performances from 78\u00a0rpm records made from 1946 to 1959. Charting the emergence of the young Rampal on record in the post-war years, this 3xCD \"Traversieres Flute Collection\" collection (Patrimoine, Vol.1) includes a set of five Bach Sonatas (BWV 1030, 1031, 1032, 1020, 1034 \u2013 recorded 1947\u201350); sonatas by Telemann (rec 1949) and Leclair (rec 1950); pieces by Couperin (rec 1950) and Haydn (rec 1950); a concerto for five flutes by Boismortier (rec 1949); a duet in G by Beethoven played with his father Joseph Rampal (rec 1951); and three Mozart quartets (KV 285, 285a and 285b \u2013 recorded 1946\u201350); alongside these are contemporary works by Roussel (rec 1950), Milhaud (rec 1949), Honegger (rec 1949), Dukas (rec 1950), Hindemith (rec 1950), Feld (rec 1959) and Francaix (rec 1955), and Rampal\u2019s earliest recording of Debussy\u2019s \u2018Syrinx\u2019 (rec 1949). The accompanying notes by Dennis Verroust of the French Flute Association, June 2002, reveal that in the 1949 Boismortier recording Rampal is not yet the star but plays the third flute part alongside Fernand Dufrene, Robert Rochut, Alphonse Kenvyn and Georges Lussagnet; it also confirms what Rampal himself declared in his autobiography \u2018Music, My Love\u2019 that the D major flute quartet (KV 285) by Mozart, with the Trio Pasquier in April 1946, was in fact his first ever recording.\nThe Association Jean-Pierre Rampal has re-issued a number of early recordings (on the Premier Horizons label and elsewhere), including his 1954 recording of the concerto by Feld, and a range of recordings he made between 1954 and 1966 with orchestras conducted by Karl Ristenpart, with whom he enjoyed a close collaboration. These include works by Vivaldi, Bach, Handel, Tartini, Mozart, Arma, and Jolivet.\nJean-Pierre Rampal: The Complete Erato Recordings (3 vols) - \nIn 2015, the \"Complete Erato Recordings\" made by Rampal were reissued, containing a wealth of material on the label for which he recorded extensively from the early 1950s to the early 1980s. These three volumes, comprising over 40 CDs (vo.1: 1954\u201363, vol.2: 1963\u201369, vol.3: 1970\u201382), stand alongside the Complete HMV Recordings (1951\u201376 on 12 CDs) also re-issued under the Erato label. \nIn 2017 the release of the double CD Jean-Pierre Rampal in Prague: the Complete Supraphon Recordings specifically marked his landmark collaboration in the mid-1950s with Czech conductor and flutist Milan Munclinger, and contains the first recordings of concertos by Benda, Richter, Stamitz and Feld, together with the Prokofiev sonata and other pieces.\nJean-Pierre Rampal: The Complete CBS Masterworks Recordings - \nIn 2022, to mark the centenary of Rampal's birth, Sony Classical, in collaboration with Association Jean-Pierre Rampal, issued its collection \"Jean-Pierre Rampal: The Complete CBS Masterworks Recordings\". Across 56 CDs, this box-set features recordings that Rampal made through the second half of his career, between 1969 and 1996, a period that saw his recording interests transferred to the American company CBS after his earlier and lengthy partnership with the French label Erato. Although the bulk of the CBS recordings are from the classical repertoire, there are also several cross-over albums (e.g. music by Bolling, Gershwin, Joplin, etc). Among many highlights, the collection charts Rampal's collaboration with American pianist John Steele Ritter, who in the late 1970s took over as his principal accompanist once illness had caused long-time recital partner Robert Veyron Lacroix to step back from touring.\nRampal on TV and DVD.\nRampal made a great number of television concert appearances in France from the late 1950s onwards, and later elsewhere\u2014especially in America and Japan, where his reputation and following remained highest. As the first televised flute-player of any age, the medium contributed to his worldwide popularity in the decades after World\u00a0War\u00a0II:\n\"EMI \"Classic Archive\" DVB 51089991; released 2007 in collaboration with the Association Jean-Pierre Rampal\"\n This presents a collection of fine early performances filmed for French TV between 1958 and 1965 and still held in the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel, the national French television archive. The earliest footage was broadcast on 17 March 1958, in the musical TV series \"Les Grandes Interpr\u00e8tes\", soon after Rampal had returned from his successful debut tour of the US.\nHe begins with Handel's Sonata in F (HWV.369), then plays Debussy's \"The Little Shepherd\" and Ravel's \"Pi\u00e8ce en forme de habanera\", both transcribed for flute and piano; and also Jolivet's \"Incantation C\" for unaccompanied flute. For the Handel, Debussy, and Ravel pieces, he is accompanied by the programme's presenter, pianist Bernard Gavoty. After a performance of Vivaldi's \"La Notte\" concerto in G minor RV 439 with the Collegium Musicum de Paris (broadcast 8 October 1963) comes a rendition of J.S. Bach's Suite in C minor BWV 997 (Paris, 16 April 1963) and the opening Allegro from Bach's Sonata in G minor BWV 1020 (Paris, broadcast 28 December 1964), both with Veyron-Lacroix at the harpsichord. More of this duo in recital at the Salle Gaveau in Paris (19 March 1964) appears from the TV series the Jeunesses musicales de France, featuring Couperin's Concert Royal No. 4, parts of J. S. Bach's Partita in A minor for solo flute and a sonata in B flat, K.15, by Mozart. The two concerto performances that complete the collection, both with the Orchestre Philharmonique de l'ORTF conducted by Rampal's long-time collaborator Louis de Froment, are of Mozart's Concerto No. 1 in G, K.313 (Paris, 5 May 1965), and the Ibert flute concerto (Paris, 8 April 1962). Of the Mozart concertos, Rampal said in a BBC Radio 4 interview that he did not like his 1966 recording with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra for ERATO because his playing was adversely affected by the uncomfortably high orchestral pitch insisted upon in Vienna. By contrast, he said he preferred his 1978 recording with the \u2018Israel Symphony Orchestra\u2019, even though it does not compare particularly well with the earlier TV performance.\n\"EMI 'Classic Archive' DVB 3102019\"\n Rampal, playing the Poulenc flute sonata, is featured twice in this compilation, once with Poulenc himself in 1959 and again after the composer's death in 1963. The initial footage, preserved in the national French TV archive, is of a televised concert given by Poulenc in Paris at the Salle Gaveau in 1959. After a brief interview with the composer, Poulenc is joined on set by Rampal to perform the slow \"Cantilena\" from the flute Sonata. Rampal is seen again later in footage from a TV broadcast in which he plays the complete Flute Sonata, this time accompanied by Veyron-Lacroix. Additional performances of Poulenc's music are provided by artists including pianist Jacques F\u00e9vrier, cellist Maurice Gendron, baritone Gabriel Bacquier, organist Jean-Jacques Grunenwald, soprano Denise Duval and others, together with the ORTF National Orchestra conducted by Georges Pr\u00eatre.\n\"Video Artists International\"\n This is a two-volume DVD compilation featuring a series of Radio-Canada \"Telecasts\", broadcast and recorded during the years when Rampal was at the peak of his fame. In this rare footage, retrieved from the archives of CBC Montreal, Rampal is accompanied by Veyron-Lacroix and the McGill Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Alexander Brott. The first volume of this set of live broadcasts includes: Boccherini's Concerto for Flute and Orchestra in D major (broadcast 1 March 1956); Haydn's Concerto for flute, harpsichord and string orchestra in F major, with Debussy's \"Syrinx for unaccompanied flute\" (broadcast 28 March 1957); Couperin's Concert Royal IV, with J. S. Bach's Sonata for flute and harpsichord in G minor, BWV 1020 (broadcast 27 December 1961). Volume two features Mozart's Flute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K.314, together with the Flute Concerto No. 1 in G major, K.313 (broadcast 24 February 1966).\n This features a live televised performance from 1976 of Claude Bolling's cross-over \"Suite\" (1973), written for Jean-Pierre Rampal (who plays a classical line to Bolling's jazz piano) and which by then had become a runaway success in the \"Billboard\" charts. Special guest double-bass player Max Hediguer is also featured.\nRadio.\nApart from the many French Radio broadcasts of performances by Rampal, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 45-minute profile, \"Rampal\u2013\"Prince of Flute Players\"\", on 11 October 1983 in the 20:20\u201321:05 documentary slot. It contained extracts from an interview with Rampal himself, rare for the fact that Rampal gave very few interviews of any length in English. Rampal talks about his life and times and his approach to music-making. Also featured are interviews with English flautist William Bennett, American flautist and Rampal's sometime-pupil Elena Duran, and violinist Isaac Stern\u2014who was Rampal's long-time friend and musical collaborator. The programme is kept in the BBC Sound Archive, together with the two unedited original interviews with Rampal that it draws on (both recorded by BBC producer Peter Griffiths in London, in January 1981 and November 1982, at the Westbury Hotel, Conduit Street, off Regent Street, where Rampal normally stayed in London).\nFilms.\n\"L. Subramaniam: Violin From the Heart\" (1999), directed by Jean Henri Meunier, includes a scene of Rampal performing with L. Subramaniam.\nRampal also makes an appearance in the 1977 educational film \"The Joy of Bach\", playing his flute on a rooftop in France.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72448", "revid": "17220063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72448", "title": "Adandozan", "text": "King of Dahomey from 1797 to 1818\nAdandozan was a king of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1797 until 1818. His rule ended with a coup by his brother Ghezo who then erased Adandozan from the official history resulting in high uncertainty about many aspects of his life. Adandozan took over from his father Agonglo in 1797 but was quite young at the time and so there was a regent in charge of the kingdom until 1804. Dealing with the economic depression that had defined the administrations of his father Agonglo and grandfather Kpengla, Adandozan tried to reduce slavery to decrease European trade, and when these failed reform the economy to focus on agriculture. Unfortunately, these efforts did not end domestic dissent and in 1818 at the Annual Customs of Dahomey, Ghezo and Francisco F\u00e9lix de Sousa, a powerful Brazilian slave trader, organized a coup d'\u00e9tat and replaced Adandozan. He was left alive and lived until the 1860s hidden in the palaces while he was largely erased from official royal history.\nRise to power.\nAgonglo's (1789-1797) reign had been very contentious ending in his assassination by a brother, Dogan. The slave trade had been largely disrupted for two decades by the Oyo empire, the lack of military success by Dahomey, and European traders changing their focus (the French abolished slavery in 1794 and the British and Portuguese had stopped relying on Dahomey's ports). The result was that when Agonglo died there was a large scale upheaval led by various factions, but this ended on May 5, 1797 with the appointment of Adandozan, the second oldest son of Agonglo as the new king. However, because Adandozan was young at the time, the first seven years of his rule were held by a regency of various elder statesmen. In 1804, he became old enough to formally rule with his own authority but the regency members retained importance.\nOne story contends that Adandozan's younger brother Ghezo had actually been named the heir to Agonglo and that Adandozan was merely a regent. However, that Adondozan refused to relinquish the throne when Ghezo was old enough. This story is doubted by historian Akinjogbin as an invention by Ghezo to justify his coup against Adandozan.\nAdministration.\nAdandozan followed Agonglo's policies of trying to revive the slave trade through slave raiding of the Mahi people to the north and disrupting the trade at rival ports (namely Porto-Novo). However, these attempts were generally unsuccessful and with the recovery of the Oyo empire by 1805, they reasserted power and stopped these activities by Adandozan.\nUnable to foster the slave trade through military action, he turned to improving diplomacy with European traders. In 1804, he sent ambassadors to Portugal and to the British at Cape Coast Castle. Unlike his father who had received Catholic missionaries from the Portuguese, Adandozan made clear that he had no interest in conversion but requested the Portuguese help him in building mining operations and a gun manufacturing facility in Dahomey. The Portuguese received these requests politely to secure the release of some Portuguese prisoners, but did not agree to the terms. The British had grown highly suspicious of Adandozan when the British officer in the port city of Whydah, who had become a citizen of Dahomey, had died in 1803 and, as per the customs, his wives were taken by the king. His assistant wrote to the British calling Adandozan a tyrant and this increased tension with the British. Adandozan, worried that the British would abandon their fort in Whydah, passed a law that any British person in Dahomey could not leave without a substitute which only ended increasing tensions.\nAdandozan responded to the slowing of the slave trade by trying to reform the economy to focus on agricultural production. He increased opportunities for agriculture and made the Corn Customs a primary festival held publicly. While attempting these reforms, changed policies in Europe largely undermined his efforts. The British abolished the slave trade in 1807 and began pressuring other countries in Europe to do the same. As part of these efforts they signed an agreement in 1810 with the Portuguese which allowed slave trade only at ports where the Portuguese already traded slaves and no new ports, Whydah was specifically mentioned as a port which could have trade while Porto-Novo, Badagry, and Little Popo (all rival slave trade ports) could not. The result was a sudden increase in the Portuguese slave trade in Whydah.\nThe increased slave trade simultaneously undermined the agricultural reforms of Adandozan and increased the power of Francisco F\u00e9lix de Sousa, a powerful Brazilian slave trader. By 1810, de Sousa had become the wealthiest trader in the city of Whydah and loaned significant amounts of money to Adandozan. When he requested repayment for this loan, Adandozan publicly insulted de Sousa and imprisoned him causing de Sousa to flee to Little Popo. One of Adandozan's younger brothers, Ghezo (then called Madogungun), befriended de Sousa and together the plotted a coup to replace Adandozan.\nCoup.\nThere is little evidence about the last years of Adandozan's reign and the specifics of the coup to replace him are detailed very differently in different sources; even the year of the coup is not agreed upon.\nIn general, it is contended that during the Annual Customs of Dahomey in 1818, Ghezo replaced Adandozan with the help of Adandozan's Migan and Mehu (prime ministers). Maurice Ahanhanzo Gl\u00e9l\u00e9 says that Adandozan was replaced because he had failed economically and then decided to sacrifice his sister, Sinkutin, to have her plead his case to the ancestors. Civil war erupted in the palace and Ghezo was able to bring the various factions together. Edouard Dunglas provides details about the coup saying that Ghezo took the war drum from the palace and then entered the palace standing in the position of the king over the drum. The Migan of Adandozan announces that \"two suns cannot shine at the same time\" and removes the royal sandals from Adandozan's feet. In reality there was apparently significant violence in the coup between different factions and many of Adandozan's sons and his entire group of female bodyguards were executed by Ghezo.\nLegacy.\nEvidence of Adandozan after the coup are not clear but there were reports in the 1860s that he was left alive and lived until 1861 (three years after Ghezo). He lived much of his later life confined to the palaces, while his descendants changed their name to avoid association, and when he died he was buried quickly but with full royal honors. Historian Edna Bay writes that after the coup \"Adandozan suffered a bizarre punishment that was perhaps worse than assassination--to watch history be reworked as though he had never lived.\"\nAdandozan's legacy was reworked significantly by Ghezo and Glele who depicted the former king as a cruel and incompetent ruler who had usurped his throne and erased all official history of Adandozan. His name was largely erased from the history of Dahomey, and to this day is generally not spoken aloud in the city of Abomey. He is not referred to in kings' lists and is not included in the cloth applique of the kingdom. The traditional stories about Adandozan's rule (which are retold, with some changing of names, in Bruce Chatwin's novel The Viceroy of Ouidah) portray him as extremely cruel: he is said to have raised hyenas to which he would throw live subjects for amusement; he is pictured slitting a pregnant woman's abdomen open on a bet to see whether he could predict the sex of the fetus.\nMany historians question the negative portrayal of Adandozan in the official history and common stories about the king and believe that it is the attempt to remove his claim to history. A similar process may have occurred earlier with Queen Hangbe who may have ruled for a brief period in the 1700s.\nAlthough tradition has not been kind to Adandozan, the letters he wrote to various outsiders, especially the kings and other officials of Portugal (who fled to Brazil following the conquest of Portugal by Napoleon) have shown a different picture of his rule. In these letters, Adandozan outlines substantial military campaigns, which he presents as victories, as well as detailing his negotiations with Europeans. Some of these letters were published in work by Pierre Verger in the 1960s. A large cache, found in the Instituto Historico e Geografico Brasileiro and Biblioteca Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, and several of the letters in this collection were examined in an article published by historian Ana Lucia Araujo in the British journal \"Slavery and Abolition.\" The full text of Adandozan's letters, both from the Institute cache and other repositories, as well as a few from his predecessor Agongolo and his successor Gezo were published in (the original) Portuguese in 2013.\nBibliography.\n\"La vie, le r\u00e8gne et l'\u0153uvre de D\u00e0d\u00e0 Ad\u00e0ndoz\u00e0n : Vingt-et-un ans effectifs de r\u00e8gne (1797-1818), deux cents ans d'ostracisme (1818-2018) : Actes du colloque tenu \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 d'Abomey-Calavi, Campus d'Abomey-Calavi, les 27, 28 et 29 mars 2014\", pref.
