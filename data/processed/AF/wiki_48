Iran's system of government (\"nezam\") was described by Juan Jos\u00e9 Linz in 2000 as combining \"the ideological bent of totalitarianism with the limited pluralism of authoritarianism\", although it \"holds regular elections in which candidates who advocate different policies and incumbents are frequently defeated\". Iran was evaluated as an electoral autocracy for year 2024 by V-Dem Institute according to Regimes of the World classification.\nThe December 1979 constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, declares that Shia Islam is Iran's state religion (around 90\u201395% of Iranians associate themselves with the Shia branch of Islam), and it combines elements of theocracy (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) with a presidential system in a religious democracy. Iran directly elects the president, parliament (Majles) and the Assembly of Experts. \nAll candidates who run for these positions must be vetted by the Guardian Council (which disqualifies the overwhelming majority of the candidates) for their loyalty to the Islamic Republic's system of government. \nIndirectly elected are the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Supreme Leader of Iran, and the Guardian Council, half of which is made up of Islamic jurists. \nIn addition, there are representatives from appointed organizations, usually under the Supreme Leader's control, to \"protect the state's Islamic character\".\nThe Supreme Leader is the head of state, above the president. \nHistory and background.\n1979 Revolution.\nIn 1979, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown by an Islamic Revolution in Iran, replacing its millennia-old monarchy with a theocratic republic. Shortly after, the leader of the Revolution, a senior Islamic jurist named Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, also transliterated Khumayn\u00ee, successfully supported referendums to declare Iran an Islamic Republic in March 1979, and to approve a constitution in December 1979, whereby \"the Islamic government\" would be \"based upon \"wilayat al-faqih\"\", (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) \"as proposed by Imam Khumayn\u00ee\", quoting the preamble of the constitution. \nThe constitution (which was drafted by an assembly made up primarily by disciples of Khomeini), calls for a \"Vali-ye faqih\" (Guardian Islamic Jurist), to serve as the Supreme Leader of Iran, and for Islamic jurists to serve in other powerful institutions such as the Guardian Council and Assembly of Experts.\nEstablishment of guardianship of the jurist.\nGuardianship of the Jurist is a concept in Twelver Shia Islamic law, which holds that, in the absence of the \"Infallible Imam\", who, according to Twelver beliefs, is the religious and political leader of Islam and will reappear sometime before Judgement Day, righteous Shi'i jurists (\"faq\u012bh\") should administer \"some\" of the \"religious and social affairs\" of the Shi'i community. In its \"absolute\" form\u2014the form advanced by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the basis of government in Islamic Republic of Iran\u2014the state and society are ruled by an Islamic jurist. Khomeini served as the Guardian Jurist Supreme Leader of Iran until his death in 1989. His successor, Ali Khamenei, is still ruling as of mid 2025.\nIn a 1970 book on the subject circulated to his network of supporters, Khomeini argued that since Islamic sharia law contains everything needed to rule a state, whether ancient or modern, any other basis of governance will lead to injustice and sin. Thus Iran, the Muslim world and eventually the whole world, must be ruled according to sharia, and the person who should rule according to sharia, is an expert in that form of law. \nThese Guardians are deemed the true holders of both religious and political authority, who must be obeyed as \"an expression of obedience to God\", \nand whose rule has \"precedence over all secondary ordinances in Islam such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage.\"\nPost-revolutionary political conditions.\nThe early days of the revolutionary government were characterized by political tumult. In November 1979, the US embassy was seized and its occupants taken hostage and kept captive for 444 days, because of US support for the Shah (monarch) of Iran. The eight-year Iran\u2013Iraq War killed hundreds of thousands and cost the country billions of dollars. By the early 1980s, power struggles ended in leftists and nationalists eliminated from all governmental institutions, and the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini and his supporters firmly in control.\nIran's post-revolution challenges have included the imposition of economic sanctions and the suspension of diplomatic relations with Iran by the United States because of the hostage crisis, political support to Iraq and other acts of terrorism that the U.S. government and some others have accused Iran of sponsoring. Emigration from Iran has cost Iran millions of educated people, including entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople and their capital. Poverty rose by nearly 45% in absolute terms during the first 6 years of the Iran-Iraq War, and according to the World Bank, by the time the war ended in 1988, per capita income was a little more than half of what it had been in 1976, shortly before the revolution.\nHuman rights.\nBackground.\nThe alleged tyranny and brutality towards all opposition of the monarchy was one of the propaganda themes of the Islamic revolution, but the Islamic Republic has not tolerated opposition to its system of government, since, as mentioned above, it believes disobedience to it is disobedience to God. In 1984, Iran's representative to the United Nations, Sa\u02bfid Raja\u02beie-Khorassani, declared the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be representing a \"secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition\", which did not \"accord with the system of values recognized by the Islamic Republic of Iran\" and whose provisions the IRI would \"not hesitate to violate\". \nIn reply to international criticism of repression, Iranian officials loyal to the Supreme Leader deny wrongdoing, maintaining its human rights record is better than western countries who criticize its record. In 2004, Judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, denied that there were any political prisoners in Iran, saying \"The world may consider certain cases, by their nature, political crimes, but because we do not have a law in this regard, these are considered ordinary offenses.\" In 2008, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad replied to a question about human rights by stating that Iran has fewer prisoners than the US and \"the human rights situation in Iran is relatively a good one, when compared ... with some European countries and the United States.\"\nWhether the Islamic Republic goes well beyond what Sunni and many Shia Muslims consider Islamic exceptions to international human rights norms, is also an issue. Khomeini's January 1988 pronouncement \"... that [Islamic] government is a branch of the Prophet's absolute Wilayat and one of the primary (first order) rules of Islam that has priority over all ordinances of the law even praying, fasting and Hajj\u2026The Islamic State could prevent implementation of everything \u2013 devotional and non- devotional \u2013 that so long as it seems against Islam's interests\", leads Ann Elizabeth Mayer to argue that this theory of \"velayat-e motlaqaye faqih\" (\"the absolute authority of the jurist\") \"freed\" the Islamic Republic \"to do as it chose-even if this meant violating fundamental pillars of the religion ...\", and that this doctrine, not sharia law, explained \"the prevalence of torture and punishment of political dissent\" in the Islamic Republic.\nOn the other hand, despite the vast popularity of Khomeini in Iran before and after the revolution, (approximately 10 million people are estimated to have participated in his funeral in a country of about 60 million), observers (Akbar Ganji, Arzoo Osanloo, Hooman Majd) have suggested there is no widespread support for violent crackdowns on dissent in contemporary Iran. \"Notions of democracy and human rights\" now have much deeper roots among Iranians than under the Shah, and in fact are \"almost hegemonic\" (Arzoo Osanloo), so that it is much harder to spread fear among them, even to the point that if Iranian intelligence services \"were to arrest anyone who speaks ill of the government in private, they simply couldn't build cells fast enough to hold their prisoners\", according to journalist Hooman Majd.\nSituation.\nThe Islamic Republic centralized and drastically expanded the prison system of the previous regime. In one early period (1981-1985) more than 7,900 people were executed. Somewhere between 3,000 and 30,000 political prisoners were executed between July and early September 1988 on orders of the Ayatollah Khomeini, causing a 2020 UN Special Rapporteurs to send a letter to the regime describing the killings as \"crimes against humanity\".\nThe Islamic Republic has been criticized both for restrictions and punishments that follow the Islamic Republic's constitution and law, but not international human rights norms (harsh penalties for crimes, punishment of victimless crimes, restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, restrictions on freedom of religion, etc.); and for \"extrajudicial\" actions that follow neither, such as firebombings of newspaper offices, and beatings, torture, rape, and killing without trial of political prisoners and dissidents/civilians.\nProtests.\nWhile the Islamic Republic has been noted for its political stability, political protests against perceived corruption and injustice have become more severe and common in the twenty-first century. Nevertheless, at least one analyst, Seth G. Jones, believes that as of 2019, \"the Iranian protest movement is ... too decentralized and Iranian security forces ... too strong\" for the regime to be in danger of being overthrown by protesters. Some protests include: \nLeading figures and institutions.\nSupreme Leader.\nTwo very powerful, unelected posts/institutions unique to the Islamic Republic are the Supreme Leader and Guardian Council.\nThe Supreme Leader of Iran is the head of state and highest ranking political and religious authority (above the President). The armed forces, judicial system, state television, and other key governmental organizations such as the Guardian Council and Expediency Discernment Council are under the control of the Supreme Leader. According to article 110 of the\u00a0constitution, the\u00a0Supreme Leader\u00a0delineates the general policies of the Islamic Republic. There have been only two Supreme Leaders since the founding of the Islamic Republic, and the current leader (Ali Khamenei), has been in power since 1989. His powers extend to issuing decrees and making final decisions on the economy, environment, foreign policy, education, national planning of population growth, \nthe amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and who is to be fired and reinstated in the Presidential cabinet.\nThe Supreme Leader is appointed by the Assembly of Experts. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), are selected by the Guardian Council, half of whose members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. All directly elected members after the vetting process by the Guardian Council still have to be approved by the Supreme Leader.\nGuardian Council.\nThe Guardian Council is an appointed and constitutionally mandated 12-member council with considerable power. It approves or vetoes legislative bills from the Islamic Consultative Assembly (the Iranian Parliament), supervises elections, and approves or forbids candidates seeking office to the Assembly of Experts, the Presidency and the parliament. Six of its twelve members are Islamic faqihs (expert in Islamic Law) selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. The other six are jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial system (who is also appointed by the Supreme Leader), and approved by the Iranian Parliament.\nPolitical parties, factions and elections.\nPolitical parties, organizations, pressure groups.\nAfter the revolution, the Islamic Republic Party was Iran's ruling and only legal political party until its dissolution in 1987. Its abolition has been attributed to Ayatollah Khomeini's well founded belief that leftist, monarchists and nationalists had been suppressed, and his network's place in power was secure. Supporters of the Islamic Republic Party reorganised themselves as \"principalists\", and along with the \"reformists\", became two of the major political factions in the country.\nThe Executives of Construction Party was formed in 1994 to run for the fifth parliamentary elections, made up mainly of executives in the government close to the then-president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. There are several other legal political parties or associations operating in Iran. Legal political groups, must support the Ayatollah Khomeini, his Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist political system (\"nezam\") created by the revolution, the exclusion of \u201cnonrevolutionary\u201d and secular parties from political participation, and agree Iran's fundamental security interest is the survival and strengthening of the \"nezam\".\nActive student groups include the pro-reform \"Office for Strengthening Unity\" and \"the Union of Islamic Student Societies\".\nGroups that generally support the Islamic Republic include Ansar-e Hizballah, The Iranian Islamic Students Association, Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam, Islam's Students, and the Islamic Coalition Association. The conservative power base has been said to be made up of a \"web of Basiji militia members, families of war martyrs, some members of the Revolutionary Guard, some government employees, some members of the urban and rural poor, and conservative-linked foundations.\"\nThere are many nationalist, leftist and monarchist dissident parties and militias including National Front, the Constitutionalist Party, the Tudeh Party, People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas (IPFG), Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan,and the Qashqai Freedom Path Party(QAYI).\nPolitical factions.\nIran's political parties/organizations are said to represent political factions in Iran,\nand according to at least one source, \"factionalism has generally been more important than constitutional process in decision making\", especially under Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, i.e. after 1990, when \"factional competition\" grew \"markedly in both intensity and\ninfluence\".\nScholars such as Maziar Behrooz, Behzad Nabavi, Bahman Baktiari, Maaike Warnaar, Payam Mohseni, have given different formulations of them, varying in number, usually between three and five, the basic three being Principlists aka hard liners, Pragmatists and Reformists, and orientation (ideological purity vs. pragmatism; support for political and religious freedom vs. authoritarianism; support for regulation and intervention in the marketplace vs. laissez faire policies).\nElections.\nThese are the most recent elections that have taken place:\nComplexity of the system.\nAccording to the constitution, the Guardian Council oversees and approves electoral candidates for elections in Iran. The Guardian Council has 12 members: 6 clerics, appointed by the Supreme Leader and 6 jurists, elected by the Majlis from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial System, who is appointed by the Supreme Leader. According to the current law, the Guardian Council approves the Assembly of Experts candidates, who in turn elect the Supreme Leader.\nIndirect elections can reduce accountability and political efficacy. \nIranian reformists, such as Mohammad-Ali Abtahi have considered this to be the core legal obstacle.\nIn 1998, the Guardian Council rejected Hadi Khamenei's candidacy for a seat in the Assembly of Experts for \"insufficient theological qualifications\". \nPublic finance and fiscal policy.\nBudget.\nIran's fiscal year (FY) goes from 21 to 20 March of the following year.\nIran has two types of budget:\nIran's budget is established by the Management and Planning Organization of Iran and then \"proposed\" by the government to the parliament/Majlis. Once approved by Majlis, the bill still needs to be ratified by the Guardian Council. The bill will be sent back to the parliament for amendments if it is voted down by the Guardian Council. The Expediency Council acts as final arbiter in any dispute.\nFollowing annual approval of the government's budget by Majlis, the central bank presents a detailed monetary and credit policy to the Money and Credit Council (MCC) for approval. Thereafter, major elements of these policies are incorporated into the five-year economic development plan. The 5-year plan is part of \"Vision 2025\", a strategy for long-term sustainable growth.\nA unique feature of Iran's economy is the large size of the religious foundations, called \"Bonyads\", whose combined budgets make up more than 30% of that of the central government.\nSetad, another organization worth more than $95 billion, has been described as \"secretive\" and \"little known\". It is not overseen by the Iranian Parliament. In 2008, Parliament voted to \"prohibit itself from monitoring organizations that the supreme leader controls, except with his permission\". It is an important factor in the Supreme Leader's power, giving him financial independence from parliament and the national budget.\nThe National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) does not depend on Iran's budget. But according to the Santiago Principles, NDFI must coordinate its investment decisions and actions with the macro-economic and monetary policies of the government of Iran.\nRevenues.\nIn 2004, about 45 percent of the government's budget came from exports of oil and natural gas revenues. This varies with the fluctuations in world petroleum markets. 31 percent of the budget came from taxes and fees. Overall, an estimated 50 percent of Iran's GDP was exempt from taxes in FY 2004.\nIn 2010, oil income accounted for 80% of Iran's foreign currency revenues and 60% of Iran's overall budget. Any surplus revenues from the sale of crude oil and gas are to be paid into the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF). In 2010, the approved \"total budget\", including state owned commercial companies, was $295 billion.\nThe Government seeks to increase the share of tax revenue in the budget through the implementation of the economic reform plan, through more effective tax collection from businesses.\nAs of 2016, the formula set by law is that, for sales of oil at or below the budget's price assumption, 14.5% remains with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), 20% goes to the National Development Fund (NDF), 2% goes to deprived and oil-producing provinces, and 63.5% goes to the government treasury.\nIran has not yet implemented the treasury single account system.\nExpenditures.\nBecause of changes in the classification of budgetary figures, comparison of categories among different years is not possible. However, since the Iranian Revolution, the government's general budget payments have averaged:\nIran spent 22.5% of its 2003 national budget on social welfare programs, of which more than 50% covered pension costs.\nFor a breakdown of expenditures for social and economic purposes, see the attached chart.\nIn FY 2004, central government expenditures were divided as follows:\nAmong current expenditures, wages and salaries accounted for 36 percent; subsidies and transfers to households accounted for 22 percent (not including \"indirect\" subsidies). Earmarked expenditures totaled 13 percent of the central government total. Between FY 2000 and FY 2004, total expenditures and net lending accounted for about 26 percent of GDP. According to the Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs, Iran's subsidy reforms would save 20 percent of the country's budget.\nAccording to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of budgeting were observed in this structure, the government could save at least 30 to 35 percent on its expenses.\nContrary to the main objective and because of a lack in the implementation of the subsidy reform plan, the volume of Iranian subsidies given to its citizens on fossil fuel, which increased 42.2% in 2019, equals 15.3% of Iran's GDP and 16% of total global energy subsidies. As a direct consequence, \nIranian taxpayers incur a loss of $3.3 billion annually because of fuel smuggling (&amp; not including other smuggled oil derivatives), equivalent to the \"development budget\" of Iran.\nPublic debt.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2014, Iran's banks and financial institutions total claims on the public sector (government and governmental institutions) amounted to 929 trillion IRR ($34.8 billion), which must be reduced according to the IMF. IMF estimates that public debt could be as high as 40% of GDP (or more) once government arrears to the private sector are recognized. These arrears are owed to banks (45%), private contractors (37%), and social security (18%) (FY 2016).\nExternal debts.\nIn 2013, Iran's external debts stood at $7.2 billion compared with $17.3 billion in 2012. Iran's external debt was $7.12 billion in April 2022. This is one of the lowest numbers internationally (~$90 per capita).\nAnnual budgets.\n2009\u201310.\nIn Iran's state budget for the Iranian calendar year 1388 (2009\u20132010), of the $102 billion earmarked for government spending,\nOil revenues are calculated based on the average price of $37.50 per barrel at the US Dollar conversion rate of 9,500 Rials. Iran balances its external accounts around $75 per barrel.\n2010\u201311.\nThe budget for Iranian year 1389 (2010\u20132011), which starts on 21 March, amounts to $368.4bn, representing an increase of 31 per cent on the previous year and is based on a projected oil price of $60 a barrel compared with just $37.50 last year.\n2011\u201312.\nThe public budget was $165 billion (1,770 trillion rials) in Iranian year 2011\u20132012. The Iranian Parliament also approved a total budget of $508 billion (5,170 trillion rials) that factors in $54 billion from price hikes and subsidy cuts and aside from the government (or public budget) also includes spending for state-owned companies. The budget is based on an oil price of $81.5 per barrel. The value of the US dollar is estimated at IRR 10,500 for the same period. The 2011-12 total budget is \"40\" per cent bigger than previous year's (which stood at $368 billion) because of dropping subsidies on energy and food item.\n2012\u201313.\nThe proposed budget for 2011\u20132012 amounts to 5.1 quadrillion rials (approximately $416 billion). The funding for running the government has been decreased by 5.6 percent and the government's tax revenues have been envisaged to rise by 20 percent. The defense budget shows an increase of 127 percent. The government also is seeking higher sums for development, research, and health projects. Approved budget of 5,660 trillion Rials $477 billion is based on an oil price of $85 per barrel and the average value of the U.S. dollar for the fiscal year has been projected to be 12,260 rials, allowing the government to gain $53.8 billion from subsidy cut. \nThe approved total state budget figure shows an 11% increase in Rial terms, in comparison to the previous year's budget. Of this amount, $134 billion relates to the government's general budget and the remaining $343 billion relates to state-owned companies and organizations. Of the $134 billion for the government's general budget, $117 billion relates to operating expenditure and $17 billion is for infrastructure developments. The government's general budget for 2012\u201313 shows a 3.5% decline in comparison to the previous year, while the budget for state-owned companies and organisations has risen by 18.5%. Revenues from crude oil make up 37% of the state's total revenues in the budget. Revenues from taxes have been projected at 458 trillion Rials ($37 billion), which shows a 10% increase year-on-year. In the first half of 2012, Iran announced in Majlis that it has taken in only 25% of its budgeted annual revenue. According to Apicorp, Iran needs oil to average $127 a barrel in 2012 for its fiscal budget to break even.\n2013\u201314.\nIn May 2013, the Iranian parliament approved a 7.27-quadrillion-rial (about $593 billion) national budget bill for 2013\u201314. The new national budget has forecast a 40% drop in oil revenues compared to the previous year's projected figure. The bill has set the price of oil at $95 per barrel, based on the official exchange rate of 12,260 rials for a U.S. dollar, which has been fixed by the Central Bank of Iran. The budget law also includes income of 500 trillion Rials from the subsidies reform plan. Out of this amount, 410 trillion Rials is allocated for direct cash handouts to those eligible who have registered and for social funds.\n2014\u201315.\nIran's earmarked government spending for the year starting in March 2014 at $75 billion, calculated on an open-market exchange rate, with an overall/\"total\" budget ceiling estimated at $265 billion. The draft budget estimates oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd). The 2014 budget assumes an average oil price of $100 per barrel, inflation at 21%, GDP growth at 3% and the official USD/IRR exchange rate at 26,000 Iranian rials. The budget bill permits the government to use more than $35 billion in foreign finance. Capital expenditure is set to rise by 9.7%. \nThe administration has set the goal of 519 trillion rials, (about $20.9 billion) government's income from implementation of the subsidy reform plan in budget bill and will be likely forced to double fuel prices. In February 2014, Parliament approved a \"total\" budget bill worth 7,930 trillion rials ($319 billion at the official exchange rate). The International Monetary Fund has estimated Iran needs an oil price above $130 a barrel to balance its 2015-state budget; Brent crude was below $80 a barrel in November 2014. The IMF estimated in October 2014 that Iran would run a general government deficit of $8.6 billion in 2015, at the official exchange rate, to be compensated by drawing on the National Development Fund.\n2015\u201316.\nIran's 2015 proposed budget is nearly $300 billion. The overall/\"total\" budget shows a 4% growth compared with the 2014 budget. The budget assumes\nthat the country exports 1 million barrels per day of crude oil and 0.3 million barrels per day of gas condensates at an average price of $72 per barrel of crude. The official exchange rate is projected to be on average US$28,500/IRR. Dependency on oil exports in this overall budget bill has dropped to 25% (down from over 30% of government revenues in 2014.) The plan is to increase taxation on large organizations by reducing tax evasion/exemption. The Iranian state is the biggest player in the economy, and the annual budget strongly influences the outlook of local industries and the stock market. The 2015 budget is not expected to bring much growth for many of the domestic industries. \nAn average oil price of $50 for the coming year would result in a deficit of $7.5 billion. The government can lower this deficit by increasing the official exchange rate but this will trigger higher inflation. The proposed expenses are $58 billion including $39 billion is salary and pension payments to government employees. Proposed development expenditure amounts to $17 billion. R&amp;D's share in the GNP is at 0.06% (where it should be 2.5% of GDP) and industry-driven R&amp;D is almost non\u2011existent.\n2016\u201317.\nProposed government budget is 9.52-quadrillion Iranian rials (about 262 billion US dollars). Assumptions made in the budget are $50 billion in foreign investment and foreign loans, 5-6% GDP growth and 11% inflation. Sixty-five percent of the budget is to be financed through taxation and the remaining 35% from oil sales, based on 2.25 million barrels of oil sales per day, an average oil price of 40 dollars a barrel and US dollar-Iranian rial exchange rate at 29,970.\nAccording to the sixth five-year development plan (2016-2021), the subsidy reform plan is to continue until 2021.\nAn amendment to the budget was passed in August 2016. This amendment allows the government to issue debt based instruments and the use of forex reserves in an attempt to clear its debt to the private sector, including contractors, banks and insurers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "64704", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64704", "title": "Economy of Iran", "text": "Iran has a mixed, centrally planned economy with a large public sector. It consists of hydrocarbon, agricultural and service sectors, in addition to manufacturing and financial services, with over 40 industries traded on the Tehran Stock Exchange. With 10% of the world's proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas reserves, Iran is considered an \"energy superpower\". Nevertheless since 2024, Iran has been suffering from an energy crisis.\nSince the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran's economy has experienced slower economic growth, high inflation, and recurring crises. The 8-year Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988), increased Corruption in Iran, and subsequent international sanctions severely disrupted development. In recent years, Iran's economy has faced stagnant growth, inflation rates among the highest in the world, currency devaluation, rising poverty, water and power shortages, and low rankings in corruption and business climate indices. The brief war with Israel in June 2025 further exacerbated economic pressures, causing billions in damage and loss of revenues. Despite possessing large oil and gas reserves, Iran's economy remains burdened by structural challenges and policy mismanagement, resulting in limited growth and a decline in living standards in the post-revolution era.\nA unique feature of Iran's economy is the reliance on large religious foundations called bonyads, whose combined budgets represent more than 30 percent of central government spending.\nIn 2007, the Iranian subsidy reform plan introduced price controls and subsidies particularly on food and energy. Contraband, administrative controls, widespread corruption, and other restrictive factors undermine private sector-led growth. The government's 20-year vision involved market-based reforms reflected in a five-year development plan, 2016 to 2021, focusing on \"a resilient economy\" and \"progress in science and technology\". Most of Iran's exports are oil and gas, accounting for a majority of government revenue in 2010. In March 2022, the Iranian parliament under the then new president Ebrahim Raisi decided to eliminate a major subsidy for importing food, medicines and animal feed, valued at $15 billion in 2021. Also in March 2022, 20 billion tons of basic goods exports from Russia including vegetable oil, wheat, barley and corn were agreed.\nIran's educated population, high human development, constrained economy and insufficient foreign and domestic investment prompted an increasing number of Iranians to seek overseas employment, resulting in a significant \"brain drain\". However, in 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear program which removed most international sanctions. Consequently, for a short period, the tourism industry significantly improved and the inflation of the country was decreased, though US withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 hindered the growth of the economy again and increased inflation.\nGDP contracted in 2018 and 2019, but a modest rebound was expected in 2020. Challenges include a COVID-19 outbreak starting in February 2020, US sanctions reimposed in mid-2018, increased unemployment due to the sanctions, inflation, food inflation, a \"chronically weak and undercapitalized\" banking system, an \"anemic\" private sector, and corruption. Iran's currency, the Iranian rial, has fallen, and Iran has a relatively low rating in \"Economic Freedom\", and \"ease of doing business\". Recently, Iran faces severe economic challenges resulting from long conflict with Israel and the war that broke between the two states, which resulted in a destruction of investments of more than 3 trillion USD.\nHistory until 1979.\nIn 546 BC, Croesus of Lydia was defeated and captured by the Persians, who then adopted gold as the main metal for their coins. There are accounts in the biblical Book of Esther of dispatches being sent from Susa to provinces as far out as India and the Kingdom of Kush during the reign of Xerxes the Great (485\u2013465 BC). By the time of Herodotus (c. 475 BC), the Royal Road of the Persian Empire ran some 2,857\u00a0km from the city of Susa on the Karun (250\u00a0km east of the Tigris) to the port of Smyrna (modern \u0130zmir in Turkey) on the Aegean Sea.\nModern agriculture in Iran dates back to the 1850s when Amir Kabir undertook a number of changes to the traditional agricultural system. Such changes included importing modified seeds and signing collaboration contracts with other countries. Polyakov's \"Bank Esteqrazi\" was bought in 1898 by the Tsarist government of Russia, and later passed into the hands of the Iranian government by a contract in 1920. The bank continued its activities under the name of \"Bank Iran\" until 1933 when incorporating the newly founded Keshavarzi Bank.\nThe Imperial Bank of Persia was established in 1885, with offices in all major cities of Persia. Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925\u201341) improved the country's overall infrastructure, implemented educational reform, campaigned against foreign influence, reformed the legal system, and introduced modern industries. During this time, Iran experienced a period of social change, economic development, and relative political stability.\nReza Shah Pahlavi, who abdicated in 1941, was succeeded by his son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1941\u201379). No fundamental change occurred in the economy of Iran during World War II and the years immediately following. Between 1954 and 1960 a rapid increase in oil revenues and sustained foreign aid led to greater investment and fast-paced economic growth, primarily in the government sector. Subsequently, inflation increased, the value of the national currency, the rial, depreciated, and a foreign-trade deficit developed. Economic policies implemented to combat these problems led to declines in the rates of nominal economic growth and per capita income by 1961.\nHistory since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\nPrior to 1979, Iran developed rapidly. Traditionally agricultural, by the 1970s, the country had undergone significant industrialization and modernization. The pace slowed by 1978 as capital flight reached $30 to $40 billion 1980-US dollars just before the revolution.\nFollowing the nationalizations in 1979 and the outbreak of the Iran\u2013Iraq War, over 80% of the economy came under government control. The eight-year war with Iraq claimed at least 300,000 Iranian lives and injured more than 500,000. The cost of the war to Iran's economy was some $500 billion.\nAfter hostilities ceased in 1988, the government tried to develop the country's communication, transportation, manufacturing, health care, education and energy sectors, including its prospective nuclear power facilities, and began integrating its communication and transportation systems with those of neighboring states.\nThe government's long-term objectives since the revolution were stated as economic independence, full employment, and a comfortable standard of living but Iran's population more than doubled between 1980 and 2000 and its median age declined. Although many Iranians are farmers, agricultural production has consistently fallen since the 1960s. By the late 1990s, Iran imported much of its food. At that time, economic hardship in the countryside resulted in many people moving to cities.\nDue to its relative isolation from global financial markets, Iran was initially able to avoid recession in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. However, following expansion of international sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme, the Iranian rial fell to a record low of 23,900 to the US dollar in September 2012.\nMacroeconomic trends.\nIran's national science budget in 2005 was about $900 million, roughly equivalent to the 1990 figure. By early 2000, Iran allocated around 0.4% of its GDP to research and development, ranking the country behind the world average of 1.4%. In 2009 the ratio of research to GDP was 0.87% against the government's medium-term target of 2.5%. Iran ranked first in scientific growth in the world in 2011 and 17th in science production in 2012.\nIran has a broad and diversified industrial base. According to \"The Economist\", Iran ranked 39th in a list of industrialized nations, producing $23 billion of industrial products in 2008. Between 2008 and 2009 Iran moved to 28th from 69th place in annual industrial production growth because of its relative isolation from the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn the early 21st century, the service sector was Iran's largest, followed by industry (mining and manufacturing) and agriculture.\nGrowth.\nIran's long-term economic growth since the 1979 Islamic Revolution has been far below its pre-revolution performance. According to Central Bank data, GDP grew on average only about 1.9% per year from 1979 to 2020, compared to 9.1% annually in 1960\u20131979 before the revolution. The Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u201388) caused a deep recession: during 1981\u201389 Iran's GDP grew only 0.9% annually on average, the lowest of any period, as war destruction and revolutionary upheaval crippled output. In the early 1990s, after the war, Iran saw a rebound \u2013 President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's administration (1989\u20131997) achieved about 5.5% average growth by rebuilding infrastructure and liberalizing parts of the economy.\nIn 2008, Iran's GDP was estimated at $382.3 billion ($842 billion PPP), or $5,470 per capita ($12,800 PPP).\nIn 2010, the nominal GDP was projected to double in the next five years. Real GDP growth was expected to average 2.2% a year in 2012\u201316, insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate. Furthermore, international sanctions have damaged the economy by reducing oil exports by half, before recovering in 2016. The Iranian rial lost more than half of its value in 2012, directing Iran to import substitution industrialization and a resistive economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran is a \"transition economy\", i.e., changing from a planned to a market economy.\nIn 2008, the United Nations classified Iran's economy as semi-developed. In 2014, Iran ranked 83rd in the World Economic Forum's analysis of the global competitiveness of 144 countries.\nIn 2008, according to Goldman Sachs, Iran has the potential to become one of the world's largest economies in the 21st century. In 2014, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated that Iran has the potential to become one of the ten largest economies within the next 30 years.\nThe lifting of sanctions in 2016 under the JCPOA nuclear deal spurred a one-time jump of 12.5% GDP growth in 2016, Iran's only double-digit growth in decades (mostly from restored oil exports). But after the United States reimposed sanctions in 2018, Iran entered another downturn (GDP fell in 2018\u20132019). The 2011\u20132020 period is regarded as a \"lost decade\" for Iran's economy, with average growth near 0.5%, due to sanctions, capital flight, and low investment.\nAfter a modest recovery in 2020\u20132022, the IMF and World Bank estimated Iran's real GDP growth at around 2\u20135% in 2022\u20132024, partly due to higher oil prices and improved non-oil output. However, for 2025 the outlook turned grim: after new U.S. sanctions and the mid-2025 conflict, the IMF projected near zero growth (0.3%) for 2025, revising down earlier forecasts. Oil production and exports have been constrained by sanctions and the 2025 war damage; Iran's oil exports, which averaged ~1.4\u20131.7 million barrels/day in 2024, were expected to drop by several hundred thousand barrels in 2025 under sanctions.\nReform plan.\nExpansion of public healthcare and international relations are the other main objectives of the fifth plan, an ambitious series of measures that include subsidy reform, banking recapitalization, currency, taxation, customs, construction, employment, nationwide goods and services distribution, social justice and productivity. The intent is to make the country self-sufficient by 2015 and replace the payment of $100 billion in subsidies annually with targeted social assistance. These reforms target Iran's major sources of inefficiency and price distortion and are likely to lead to major restructuring of almost all economic sectors.\nBy removing energy subsidies, Iran intends to make its industries more efficient and competitive. By 2016, one third of Iran's economic growth is expected to originate from productivity improvement. Energy subsidies left the economy as one of the world's least energy-efficient, with energy intensity three times the global average and 2.5 times higher than the Middle Eastern average. Notwithstanding its own issues, the banking sector is seen as a potential hedge against the removal of subsidies, as the plan is not expected to directly impact banks.\nNational planning.\nIran's budget is established by the Management and Planning Organization of Iran and proposed by the government to the parliament before the year's end. Following approval of the budget by Majlis, the central bank presents a detailed monetary and credit policy to the Money and Credit Council (MCC) for approval. Thereafter, major elements of these policies are incorporated into the five-year economic development plan. The plan is part of \"Vision 2025\", a strategy for long-term sustainable growth.\nThe sixth five-year development plan for the 2016\u20132021 period places emphasis on \"guidelines\" rather than \"hard targets\". It defines only three priorities:\nFiscal policy.\nSince the 1979 revolution, government spending has averaged 59% on social policies, 17% on economic matters, 15% on national defense, and 13% on general affairs. Payments averaged 39% on education, health and social security, 20% on other social programs, 3% on agriculture, 16% on water, power and gas, 5% on manufacturing and mining, 12% on roads and transportation and 5% on other economic affairs. Iran's investment reached 27.7% of GDP in 2009. Between 2002 and 2006, inflation fluctuated around 14%.\nIn 2008, around 55% of government revenue came from oil and natural gas revenue, with 31% from taxes and fees. There are virtually millions of people who do not pay taxes in Iran and hence operate outside the formal economy. The budget for year 2012 was $462 billion, 9% less than 2011. The budget is based on an oil price of $85 per barrel. The value of the US dollar is estimated at IRR 12,260 for the same period.\nAccording to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of budgeting were observed the government could save at least 30 to 35% on its expenses. The central bank's interest rate is 21%, and the inflation rate has climbed to 22% in 2012, 10% higher than in 2011. There is little alignment between fiscal and monetary policy. According to the Central Bank of Iran, the gap between the rich and the poor narrowed because of monthly subsidies but the trend could reverse if high inflation persists.\nDefense related burden.\nAccording to official data, as of 2023 Iran spends 10.3 billion USD or 2.1% of its GDP on national defense. This percentage is similar to that in other countries such as UK, France and Finland.\nIn 2025, the Iranian budget bill granted 51% of the total oil and gas export revenues, estimated at 12 billion euros, to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Law Enforcement Command (LEF).\nIran also finances Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Iraqi militia, and Hamas. The average annual budget reserved for the funding of Iran's proxies is estimated at US$1.6 billion. According to Syrian opposition sources, starting from the beginning of 2011, Iran allocated a total of US$50 billion to maintain the Assad regime in Syria. However, this investment proved to be a failure following the eventual collapse of the regime.\nThe most costly of Iran's defense expenditures is its nuclear program. The estimated total cost of Iran's nuclear program until 2025 approaches US$500 billion. As a result of its nuclear program Iran is subject to international sanctions, causing a long-term economic stagnation which cost Iran an additional US$1.2 trillion over 12 years. Furthermore, the sanctions led to a significant decline in foreign direct investments (FDI), with Iran experiencing a reduction of approximately 80% in FDI between 2011 and 2021.\nCorruption and governance indices.\nCorruption.\nIran consistently ranks poorly on international corruption and governance indices. In Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), Iran scores very low \u2013 in the 2023 CPI report, Iran scored 23/100, ranking 151st out of 180 countries (among the worst 20% globally for perceived public-sector corruption). This was a slight decline from the previous year (score 24). Issues include widespread bureaucratic corruption, bribery, embezzlement, and the influence of powerful organizations that operate outside formal oversight (like parastatal religious foundations and the Revolutionary Guard's economic wing). Corruption has been cited as a major obstacle to investment and equitable growth in Iran. Iranian leaders, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, have at times called for \"jihad against corruption\", and some high-profile arrests/trials have occurred (e.g. banking fraud scandals). However, critics argue that many corrupt actors enjoy impunity, especially if politically connected, and that anti-corruption efforts are often politicized or selective.\nEase of doing business.\nThe business climate in Iran is widely seen as difficult. In the World Bank's now-discontinued Ease of Doing Business Index, Iran was ranked around 127th out of 190 countries in the last published report (Doing Business 2020), reflecting a generally poor environment for starting and running private businesses. Cumbersome regulations, lengthy permit processes, weak contract enforcement, and barriers to trade and finance all contributed to this low ranking. Although Iran made some reforms (e.g. simplifying business registration and improving access to credit information), it lagged behind regional peers. International sanctions added another layer of difficulty, as Iranian firms were cut off from global banking and faced restrictions on imports/exports.\nIran is rated as \"Repressed\" economically in the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom. In the 2025 Heritage index, Iran's score was 42.5 (out of 100), ranking it 169th in the world (near the bottom, among countries with least economic freedom). This reflects extensive state intervention, weak property rights, and lack of investment freedom. Large sectors of Iran's economy are dominated by the government or semi-state entities (including the bonyads and IRGC-affiliated companies), leading to oligopolies and limited competition. The judiciary's lack of independence and rule-of-law issues also deter investors.\nGovernance indicators.\nGovernance indicators by the World Bank also rate Iran poorly on control of corruption, regulatory quality, and rule of law. These problems have tangible impacts: for example, cumbersome customs procedures and the prevalence of informal payments increase costs for businesses; unclear property rights or contract enforcement discourages entrepreneurship. International companies have largely shied away from investing in Iran (aside from some Chinese, Russian, and regional firms) due not only to sanctions but also concerns about transparency and predictability. Iran's government acknowledges the need to improve its business environment \u2013 the Rouhani administration (2013\u20132021) made it a goal to climb rankings \u2013 but progress has been limited, especially as U.S. sanctions returned.\nInflation.\nInflation in Iran has been persistently high since the revolution, eroding living standards. During 1960\u20131978, Iran's inflation was usually in single digits, but after 1979 it surged into double digits almost every year. From 1979 to 2024, consumer prices increased astronomically \u2013 an item that cost 100 rials in 1960 costs over 2 million rials by 2025. The average inflation rate since 1979 has been about 17\u201318% per year, compared to under 10% before 1979. Periodic bouts of very high inflation occurred: in the 1980s during the war and money-printing, inflation topped 20\u201330%. In the 1990s, it spiked above 50% (in 1995). Tightening measures brought inflation down to ~10% by the early 2000s, but it accelerated again later. International sanctions on Iran's oil and banking (especially 2012 and 2018 onward) led to currency devaluation and shortages, driving inflation to 30\u201350% annually in 2018\u20132023. By 2023\u20132024, Iran's annual inflation was roughly 40%, particularly elevated for food prices, which led to steep declines in real incomes. In 2025, amid renewed sanctions and war disruption, the IMF raised Iran's projected inflation to over 43%, placing Iran as the 4th-highest inflation country globally (after Venezuela, Sudan, Zimbabwe). The latest data shows that the annual inflation rate reached 38.7% in May 2025. Due to the high inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian real (90% since 2018) have brought the Iran's parliament to approve a bill in committee that paves the way to remove four zeros from the national currency, the rial, in an effort to tackle long-term inflation. However, experts say that while cutting zeros from the currency may have some benefits, it does not offer a clear solution to Iran\u2019s deeper economic problems.\nIn August Iran effectively raised taxation by introducing a new law making inflation partly taxable framing it as a tool against hoarding in a country where inflation often exceeds 40 percent.\nThe current account.\nIran had an estimated $110 billion in foreign reserves in 2011 and balances its external payments by pricing oil at approximately $75 per barrel. As of 2013, only $30 to $50 billion of those reserves are accessible because of current sanctions. Iranian media has questioned the reason behind Iran's government non-repatriation of its foreign reserves before the imposition of the latest round of sanctions and its failure to convert into gold. As a consequence, the Iranian rial lost more than 40% of its value between December 2011 and April 2012.\nIran's external and fiscal accounts reflect falling oil prices in FY 2012, but remain in surplus. The current account was expected to reach a surplus of 2.1% of GDP in FY 2012, and the net fiscal balance (after payments to Iran's National Development Fund) will register a surplus of 0.3% of GDP. In 2013 the external debts stood at $7.2 billion down from $17.3 billion in 2012. Overall fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate to 2.7% of GDP in FY 2016 from 1.7% in 2015.\nMoney in circulation reached $700 billion in March 2020 (based on the 2017 pre-devaluation exchange rate), thus furthering the decline of the Iranian rial and rise in inflation.\nThe Iranian Rial.\nThe Iranian rial has continually lost value, especially since the 2010s. The currency was roughly 70 rials per US dollar before 1979; after the revolution and war, it fell to ~1,700 rials/USD by 1990s, and kept sliding. Following the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal (2018) and sanctions, the rial's decline accelerated: the free-market exchange rate crossed 300,000 rials/USD in 2020, then 600,000 by late 2022, and hit 1,000,000 rials per USD in early 2025 \u2013 a psychological milestone of 1 million. Authorities periodically attempted currency reforms, e.g., banning exchange shops, unifying rates, or proposing to cut four zeros from the currency, but the underlying pressures of limited foreign exchange and excess money supply have kept the rial weak. By 2025, Iran's currency and inflation problems were severe enough that even basic goods saw rapid price rises, sparking protests over living costs. Subsidy reforms (such as cutting the subsidized currency for imports in 2022) also led to jumps in prices of staples like bread and medicine.\nThe stock market.\nIran's stock market, the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE), has experienced boom-and-bust cycles in recent years, often moving opposite to the real economy. During recessions and currency devaluation, many Iranians invested in stocks as a hedge against inflation, fueling speculative rallies. In 2019\u20132020, amid U.S. \"maximum pressure\" sanctions and a recession, the TSE index surged by over 500% within a year. The index hit record highs (over 2 million points in Aug 2020), propelled by high liquidity and public campaigns by authorities for people to buy stocks. Analysts warned of a bubble, given poor economic fundamentals (GDP was shrinking and COVID-19 ravaged the economy). By late 2020 and into 2021, the bubble burst \u2013 the market crashed over 30% from its peak by early 2021, wiping out many small investors' savings. Allegations emerged that government insiders had benefited from selling at highs, causing public mistrust.\nAfter a period of stagnation, the stock market rallied again in 2023, with the main TEDPIX index reaching about 3.2 million points by early 2025. However, trading volumes were often driven by inflation hedge motives rather than corporate earnings. In mid-June 2025, the exchange was shut down for 9 days during the war with Israel, and when it reopened after the ceasefire, the market plunged sharply. Within the first three days post-war, the TSE's benchmark index fell by over 200,000 points (\u22487%) to around 2.79 million, despite daily trading limits that normally slow declines. Panicked investors placed massive sell orders, on the first day back, sell orders outweighed buy orders by a 220:1 ratio (31.9 trillion tomans sell vs 0.145 trillion buy), indicating widespread flight from equities. The post-war drop highlighted fragile confidence: even before the conflict, many retail investors doubted the rally's sustainability and kept funds out of the market. The government intervened by limiting daily price moves to 3% and has at times injected liquidity via state funds to stabilize stocks. Yet, structural issues, such as lack of market depth, high inflation, and political risks, continue to make Iran's stock market volatile. Following the war, analysts argued that without genuine government support (e.g. large capital injections like those used to stabilize the currency), the market downturn could deepen, as the war's aftermath and ongoing sanctions deter both local and foreign investors.\nIn 2024, Iran passed a law to make a two-day weekend. Saturday was added to Friday weekends and Thursdays were removed. The work week was reduced from 44 hours to 40/42 hours.\nChallenges.\nThe GDP of Iran contracted in FY 2018 and FY 2019 and modest rebound is expected in 2020/2021 according to an April 2020 World Economic Outlook by the IMF.\nChallenges to the economy include the COVID-19 outbreak starting in February 2020, which on top of US sanctions reimposed in mid-2018 and other factors, led a fall in oil production and are projected to lead to a slow recovery in oil exports. Labor-force participation has risen but unemployment is above 10% as of 2020 and projected to rise in 2021 and 2022.\nInflation reached 41.1% in 2019, and is expected to continue \"in the coming years\" according to the World Bank, but decline into the 34-33% range. In July 2022, the average inflation rate rose 40.5% while the inflation rate for food and beverages alone rose 87%. Iran's banking system is \"chronically weak and undercapitalised\" according to Nordea Bank Abp, holding billions of dollars of non-performing loans, and the private sector remains \"anemic\".\nThe unofficial Iranian rial to US dollar exchange rate, which had plateaued at 40,000 to one in 2017, has fallen 120,000 to one as of November 2019. Iran's economy has a relatively low rating in the Heritage Foundation's \"Index of Economic Freedom\" (164 out of 180); and ease of doing business ranking (127 among 190) according to the World Bank. Critics have complained that privatization has led not to state owned businesses being taken over by \"skilled businesspeople\" but by the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \"and its associates\".\nIn 2020, an Iranian businessperson complained to a foreign journalist (Dexter Filkins) that the uncertainty of \"chronic shortages of material and unruly inspectors pushing for bribes\" made operating his business very difficult -- \"Plan for the next quarter? I can't plan for tomorrow morning.\"\nIn 2021, according to the NIOC, daily consumption of gasoline in Iran has surpassed 85 million liters, i.e., 10 times more than Turkey with almost the same population.\nOwnership.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFollowing the hostilities with Iraq, the Government declared its intention to privatize most industries and to liberalize and decentralize the economy. Sale of state-owned companies proceeded slowly, mainly due to opposition by a nationalist majority in the parliament. In 2006, most industries, some 70% of the economy, remained state-owned. The majority of heavy industries including steel, petrochemicals, copper, automobiles, and machine tools remained in the public sector, with most light industry privately owned.\nArticle 44 of the Iranian Constitution declares that the country's economy should consist of state, cooperative, and private based sectors. The state sector includes all large-scale industries, foreign trade, major minerals, banking, insurance, power generation, dams and large-scale irrigation networks, radio and television, post, telegraph and telephone services, aviation, shipping, roads, railroads and the like. These are publicly owned and administered by the State. Cooperative companies and enterprises concerned with production and distribution in urban and rural areas form the basis of the cooperative sector and operated in accordance with Shariah law. As of 2012, 5,923 consumer cooperatives, employed 128,396. Consumer cooperatives have over six million members. Private sector operate in construction, agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, trade, and services that supplement the economic activities of the state and cooperative sectors.\nSince Article 44 has never been strictly enforced, the private sector has played a much larger role than that outlined in the constitution. In recent years, the role of this sector has increased. A 2004 constitutional amendment allows 80% of state assets to be privatized. Forty percent of such sales are to be conducted through the \"Justice Shares\" scheme and the rest through the Tehran Stock Exchange. The government would retain the remaining 20%.\nIn 2005, government assets were estimated at $120 billion. Some $63 billion of such assets were privatized from 2005 to 2010, reducing the government's direct share of GDP from 80% to 40%. Many companies in Iran remain uncompetitive because of mismanagement over the years, thus making privatization less attractive for potential investors. According to then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 60% of Iran's wealth is controlled by just 300 people.\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are thought to control about one third of Iran's economy through subsidiaries and trusts. 2007 estimates by the \"Los Angeles Times\" suggest the IRGC has ties to over one hundred companies and annual revenue in excess of $12 billion, particularly in construction. The Ministry of Petroleum awarded the IRGC billions of dollars in no-bid contracts as well as major infrastructure projects.\nTasked with border control, the IRGC maintains a monopoly on smuggling, costing Iranian companies billions of dollars each year. Smuggling is encouraged in part by the generous subsidization of domestic goods, including fuel. The IRGC also runs the telecommunication company, laser eye-surgery clinics, makes cars, builds bridges and roads and develops oil and gas fields.\nReligious foundations.\nWelfare programs for the needy are managed by more than 30 public agencies alongside semi-state organizations known as \"bonyads\", together with several private non-governmental organizations. \"Bonyads\" are a consortium of over 120 tax-exempt organizations that receive subsidies and religious donations. They answer directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran and control over 20% of GDP. Operating everything from vast soybean and cotton farms to hotels, soft drink, automobile manufacturing, and shipping lines, they are seen as overstaffed, corrupt and generally unprofitable.\n\"Bonyad\" companies compete with Iran's unprotected private sector, whose firms complain of the difficulty of competing with the subsidized \"bonyads\". \"Bonyads\" are not subject to audit or Iran's accounting laws. \"Setad\" is a multi-sector business organization, with holdings of 37 companies, and an estimated value of $95 billion. It is under the control of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and created from thousands of properties confiscated from Iranians.\nLabor force.\nAfter the revolution, the government established a national education system that improved adult literacy rates. In 2008, 85% of the adult population was literate, well ahead of the regional average of 62%. The Human Development Index was 0.749 in 2013, placing Iran in the \"high human development\" bracket.\nIn 2008, annual economic growth of above 5% was necessary to absorb the 750,000 new labor force entrants each year. In 2020, agriculture was 10% of GDP and employed 16% of the labor force. In 2017, the industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, and construction, was 35% of GDP and employed 35% of the labor force. In 2009, mineral products, notably petroleum, accounted for 80% of Iran's export revenues, even though mining employs less than 1% of the labor force.\nIn 2004, the service sector ranked as the largest contributor to GDP, at 48% of the economy, and employed 44% of workers. Women made up 33% of the labor force in 2005. Youth unemployment, aged 15\u201324, was 29.1% in 2012, resulting in significant brain drain. In 2016, according to the government, some 40% of the workforce in the public sector are either in excess or incompetent.\nLabor force and the public sector.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran employs around 8 million individuals, of whom roughly 3 million hold formal positions within the three branches of government, the armed forces, and leadership institutions. These roles encompass bureaucratic staff, civil servants, and uniformed military personnel.\nBeyond the formal government structure, approximately 2.3 million individuals are employed in quasi-governmental organizations, including state-owned enterprises, national banks, municipalities, and the Islamic Azad University. Additionally, about 2.5 million pensioners receive state stipends, often distributed through the Relief Committee, a government-controlled charitable organization. As a result, nearly one in ten Iranian citizens maintain a regular financial connection to the state.\nUnemployment.\nUnemployment in Iran has remained at high single digits officially, but underemployment and joblessness among youth are significant concerns. However, this headline figure masks labor force dropout: over 38 million working-age Iranians (especially women and youth) are economically inactive, and only 25 million were employed, indicating a very low labor participation rate (around 41%). Youth unemployment is much higher: for ages 18\u201335 it was around 15%, and for 15\u201324 year-olds about 20% in 2024\u201325 (with young women's jobless rate even higher, near 35%).\nPersonal income.\nIran is classed as a middle income country and has made significant progress in provision of health and education services in the period covered by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In 2010, Iran's average monthly income was about $500. The GNI per capita in 2012 was $13,000, by PPP. A minimum national wage applies to each sector of activity as defined by the Supreme Labor Council. In 2009 this was about $263 per month ($3,156 per year).\nIn 2001, approximately 20% of household consumption was spent on food, 32% on fuel, 12% on health care and 8% on education. In 2015, Iranians had little personal debt. In 2007, seventy percent of Iranians owned their homes.\nIn 2018\u20132019, the median household income of Iran was 434,905,000 rials (a bit above $3,300), an 18.6% rise from 2017 to 2018, when median household income was about 366,700,000 rials. Adjusted for purchasing power parity, Iran's 2017\u20132018 median income was equivalent to about $28,647 (2017 conversion factor, private consumption, LCU).\nAs the average Iranian household size is 3.5, this puts median personal income at around $8,185. While Iran rates relatively well on income, median wealth is very low for its income level, on par with Vietnam or Djibouti, indicating a high level of spending. According to SCI, median household spending in 2018 was 393,227,000 rials, or 90.5% of the median household income of 434,905,000 rials.\nAfter the Revolution, the composition of the middle class in Iran did not change significantly, but its size doubled from about 15% of the population in 1979 to more than 32% in 2000. In 2008, the official poverty line in Tehran for 2008 was $9,612. The national average poverty line was $4,932. In 2010, Iran's Department of Statistics announced that 10 million Iranians live under the absolute poverty line and 30 million live under the relative poverty line.\nSalaries and wages in Iran have not kept up with inflation, causing a steep decline in real purchasing power. The government sets a national minimum wage annually through the Supreme Labor Council. In March 2024, the minimum monthly wage was raised by 35% to 11,107,000 rials (about \\$185 at the time, including certain benefits). However, due to rapid rial depreciation, by late 2024 that amount was worth only ~$137, while the cost of living spiked causing a real decrease of wages. Labor organizations note the minimum wage that once covered roughly half of a family's basic expenses now covers only one-quarter or less of essential costs.\nIncome inequality.\nAccording the inequality dataset of the world bank, in 2002 the Gini index in Iran was 34.8, a level that is considered to be quite modest. However, closer data analysis reveals significant wealth concentration, with the top 10% of earners holding 52.7% of the national income - a larger share than in the United States or European countries.\nIran's Gini coefficient fell from ~0.50 in the late 1970s to ~0.40 by the mid-1980s. In the 2000s, inequality fluctuated around a Gini index of 0.38\u20130.40. In the late 2010s and 2020s, some official data suggested a slight decline in the Gini (possibly due to overall economic contraction hitting higher incomes). The World Bank estimated Iran's Gini index at around 36.0 in 2019, improving to 34.8 in 2022 (on a 0\u2013100 scale where higher is more unequal).\nEconomic disparity is also evident within the public sector. Many Iranian state employees face significant financial hardship, with salaries as low as $200 per month, however, some Majlis representatives receive monthly salaries ranging from 200 to 250 million tomans (or more than $59,172 according to the exchange rate of January 2024). Additionally, they receive extra bonuses during religious holidays and on \"Parliament Day\" and \"Employee Day,\" along with perquisites like Nowruz and Yalda Night snacks.\nInequality is also evident in access to essential services such as water supply. In Tehran impoverished districts struggle with inadequate water provision and hazardous water quality, while affluent areas, housing many of the nation's economic elite, including high-ranking government and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officials, are largely unaffected by these shortages.\nThe government has a sizable social transfer system (subsidies for fuel, bread, cash handouts introduced in 2010, etc.) which has helped limit extreme inequality. However, wealth inequality is believed to be more pronounced \u2013 a small subset connected to power and business conglomerates (like religious foundations and the Revolutionary Guard's businesses) control significant assets, while many Iranians struggle. Notably, inequalities between urban and rural areas and between provinces persist.\nPoverty.\nPoverty levels in Iran have risen in recent years amid sanctions and inflation, after some improvements in the 2000s. The Research Center of Iran's Parliament reported that poverty reached 30.1% of the population in 2023, up from about 26% in 2018, meaning around 25\u201327 million people unable to meet basic needs. Over 5 years, the poverty rate hovered around 30%, indicating persistent hardship. The World Bank estimated that in 2018, only 0.5% of Iranians lived on under $1.90/day (extreme poverty), but by 2021 the share living under the upper-middle-income country poverty line (~$6.85/day) had increased sharply due to inflation. By March 2022, Iranian media reported over 32 million people (around 38% of the population) were below the poverty line when considering the ability to afford essential food and housing, as inflation in food prices outpaced incomes.\nMalnutrition in Iran has been reported as a growing social and economic issue amid the country\u2019s ongoing economic crisis. In August 2025, the Iranian newspaper \"Shargh\", citing surveys conducted by NGOs and volunteer groups, highlighted severe deficiencies in food access and nutrition, particularly protein intake, across the population. The study revealed that only 1.7% of households reported daily protein consumption. About 27% of households reported no protein intake at all. Among households with temporary employment, over 93% consumed protein less than once a week or not at all. In unemployed households, this figure rose to 95%.\nSocial security.\nAlthough Iran does not offer universal social protection, in 1996, the Iranian Center for Statistics estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population was covered by social security. Membership of the social security system for all employees is compulsory.\nSocial security ensures employee protection against unemployment, disease, old age and occupational accidents. In 2003, the government began to consolidate its welfare organizations to eliminate redundancy and inefficiency. In 2003 the minimum standard pension was 50% of the worker's earnings but no less than the minimum wage. Iran spent 22.5% of its 2003 national budget on social welfare programs of which more than 50% covered pension costs. Out of the 15,000 homeless in Iran in 2015, 5,000 were women.\nEmployees between the age of 18 and 65 years are covered by the social security system with financing shared between the employee (7% of salary), the employer (20\u201323%) and the state, which in turn supplements the employer contribution up to 3%. Social security applies to self-employed workers, who voluntarily contribute between 12% and 18% of income depending on the protection sought. Civil servants, the regular military, law enforcement agencies, and IRGC have their own pension systems.\nTrade unions.\nAlthough Iranian workers have a theoretical right to form labor unions, there is no union system in the country. Ostensible worker representation is provided by the Workers' House, a state-sponsored institution that attempts to challenge some state policies. Guild unions operate locally in most areas, but are limited largely to issuing credentials and licenses. The right to strike is generally not respected by the state. Since 1979 strikes have often been met by police action.\nA comprehensive law covers labor relations, including hiring of foreign workers. This provides a broad and inclusive definition of the individuals it covers, recognizing written, oral, temporary and indefinite employment contracts. Considered employee-friendly, the labor law makes it difficult to lay off staff. Employing personnel on consecutive six-month contracts (to avoid paying benefits) is illegal, as is dismissing staff without proof of a serious offense. Labor disputes are settled by a special labor council, which usually rules in favor of the employee.\nSectors.\nAgriculture and foodstuffs.\nAgriculture contributes 9.5% to the gross domestic product and employs 17% of the labor force. About 9% of Iran's land is arable, with the main food-producing areas located in the Caspian region and in northwestern valleys. Some northern and western areas support rain-fed agriculture, while others require irrigation.\nPrimitive farming methods, overworked and under-fertilized soil, poor seed and water scarcity are the principal obstacles to increased production. About one third of total cultivated land is irrigated. Construction of multipurpose dams and reservoirs along rivers in the Zagros and Alborz mountains have increased the amount of water available for irrigation. Agricultural production is increasing as a result of modernization, mechanization, improvements to crops and livestock as well as land redistribution programs.\nWheat, the most important crop, is grown mainly in the west and northwest. Rice is the major crop in the Caspian region. Other crops include barley, corn, cotton, sugar beets, tea, hemp, tobacco, fruits, potatoes, legumes (beans and lentils), vegetables, fodder plants (alfalfa and clover), almonds, walnuts and spices including cumin and sumac. Iran is the world's largest producer of saffron, pistachios, honey, berberis and berries and the second largest date producer. Meat and dairy products include lamb, goat meat, beef, poultry, milk, eggs, butter, and cheese.\nNon-food products include wool, leather, and silk. Forestry products from the northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains are economically important. Tree-cutting is strictly controlled by the government, which also runs a reforestation program. Rivers drain into the Caspian Sea and are fished for salmon, carp, trout, pike, and sturgeon that produce caviar, of which Iran is the largest producer.\nSince the 1979 revolution, commercial farming has replaced subsistence farming as the dominant mode of agricultural production. By 1997, the gross value reached $25 billion. Iran is 90% self-sufficient in essential agricultural products, although limited rice production leads to substantial imports. In 2007 Iran reached self-sufficiency in wheat production and for the first time became a net wheat exporter. By 2003, a quarter of Iran's non-oil exports were of agricultural products, including fresh and dried fruits, nuts, animal hides, processed foods, and spices. Iran exported $736 million worth of foodstuffs in 2007 and $1 billion (~600,000\u00a0tonnes) in 2010. A total of 12,198 entities are engaged in the Iranian food industry, or 12% of all entities in the industry sector. The sector also employs approximately 328,000 people or 16.1% of the\nentire industry sector's workforce.\nManufacturing.\nLarge-scale factory manufacturing began in the 1920s. During the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Iraq bombed many of Iran's petrochemical plants, damaging the large oil refinery at Abadan bringing production to a halt. Reconstruction began in 1988 and production resumed in 1993. In spite of the war, many small factories sprang up to produce import-substitution goods and materials needed by the military.\nIran's major manufactured products are petrochemicals, steel and copper products. Other important manufactures include automobiles, home and electric appliances, telecommunications equipment, cement and industrial machinery. Iran operates the largest operational population of industrial robots in West Asia. Other products include paper, rubber products, processed foods, leather products and pharmaceuticals. In 2000, textile mills, using domestic cotton and wool such as \"Tehran Patou\" and \"Iran Termeh\" employed around 400,000 people around Tehran, Isfahan and along the Caspian coast.\nA 2003 report by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization regarding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) identified the following impediments to industrial development:\nDespite these problems, Iran has progressed in various scientific and technological fields, including petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aerospace, defense, and heavy industry. Even in the face of economic sanctions, Iran is emerging as an industrialized country.\nHandicrafts.\nIran has a long tradition of producing artisanal goods including Persian carpets, ceramics, copperware, brassware, glass, leather goods, textiles and wooden artifacts. The country's carpet-weaving tradition dates from pre-Islamic times and remains an important industry contributing substantial amounts to rural incomes. An estimated 1.2 million weavers in Iran produce carpets for domestic and international export markets. More than $500 million worth of hand-woven carpets are exported each year, accounting for 30% of the 2008 world market. Around 5.2 million people work in some 250 handicraft fields and contribute 3% of GDP.\nAutomobile manufacturing.\nAs of 2001, 13 public and privately owned automakers within Iran, led by Iran Khodro and Saipa that accounted for 94% of domestic production. Iran Khodro's Paykan, replaced by the Samand in 2005, is the predominant brand. With 61% of the 2001 market, Khodro was the largest player, whilst Saipa contributed 33% that year. Other car manufacturers, such as the Bahman Group, Kerman Motors, Kish Khodro, Raniran, Traktorsazi, Shahab Khodro and others accounted for the remaining 6%.\nThese automakers produce a wide range of vehicles including motorbikes, passenger cars such as Saipa's Tiba, vans, mini trucks, medium-sized trucks, heavy trucks, minibuses, large buses and other heavy automobiles used for commercial and private activities in the country. In 2009 Iran ranked fifth in car production growth after China, Taiwan, Romania and India. Iran was the world's 12th biggest automaker in 2010 and operates a fleet of 11.5 million cars. Iran produced 1,395,421 cars in 2010, including 35,901 commercial vehicles.\nDefense industry.\nIn 2007 the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated Iran's defense budget at $7.31 billion, equivalent to 2.6% of GDP or $102 per capita, ranking it 25th internationally. The country's defense industry manufactures many types of arms and equipment. Since 1992, Iran's Defense Industries Organization (DIO) has produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, guided missiles, radar systems, guided missile destroyers, military vessels, submarines and fighter planes. In 2006 Iran exported weapons to 57 countries, including NATO members, and exports reached $100 million. It has also developed a sophisticated mobile air defense system dubbed as Bavar 373.\nConstruction and real estate.\nUntil the early 1950s construction remained in the hands of small domestic companies. Increased income from oil and gas and easy credit triggered a building boom that attracted international construction firms to the country. This growth continued until the mid-1970s when a sharp rise in inflation and a credit squeeze collapsed the boom. The construction industry had revived somewhat by the mid-1980s, although housing shortages and speculation remained serious problems, especially in large urban centers. As of January 2011, the banking sector, particularly Bank Maskan, had loaned up to 102 trillion rials ($10.2 billion) to applicants of Mehr housing scheme. Construction is one of the most important sectors accounting for 20\u201350% of total private investment in urban areas and was one of the prime investment targets of well-off Iranians.\nAnnual turnover amounted to $38.4 billion in 2005 and $32.8 billion in 2011. Because of poor construction quality, many buildings need seismic reinforcement or renovation. Iran has a large dam building industry.\nMines and metals.\nMineral production contributed 0.6% of the country's GDP in 2011, a figure that increases to 4% when mining-related industries are included. Gating factors include poor infrastructure, legal barriers, exploration difficulties, and government control over all resources. Iran is ranked among the world's 15 major mineral-rich countries.\nAlthough the petroleum industry provides the majority of revenue, about 75% of all mining sector employees work in mines producing minerals other than oil and natural gas. These include coal, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, chromium, barite, salt, gypsum, molybdenum, strontium, silica, uranium, and gold, the latter of which is mainly a by-product of the Sar Cheshmeh copper complex operation. The mine at Sar Cheshmeh in Kerman Province is home to the world's second largest store of copper.\nLarge iron ore deposits exist in central Iran, near Bafq, Yazd and Kerman. The government owns 90% of all mines and related industries and is seeking foreign investment. The sector accounts for 3% of exports.\nIn 2019, the country was the 2nd largest world producer of gypsum; the 8th largest world producer of molybdenum; the world's 8th largest producer of antimony; the 11th largest world producer of iron ore; the 18th largest world producer of sulfur, in addition to being the 21st largest worldwide producer of salt. It was the 13th largest producer in the world of uranium in 2018.\nIran has recoverable coal reserves of nearly 1.9 billion\u00a0short tonnes. By mid-2008, the country produced about 1.3 million\u00a0short tonnes of coal annually and consumed about 1.5 million\u00a0short tonnes, making it a net importer. The country plans to increase hard-coal production to 5 million\u00a0tons in 2012 from 2 million\u00a0tons in November 2008.\nThe main steel mills are located in Isfahan and Khuzestan. Iran became self-sufficient in steel in 2009. Aluminum and copper production are projected to hit 245,000 and 383,000\u00a0tons respectively by March 2009. Cement production reached 65 million\u00a0tons in 2009, exporting to 40 countries.\nPetrochemicals.\nIran manufactures 60\u201370% of its equipment domestically, including refineries, oil tankers, drilling rigs, offshore platforms, and exploration instruments.\nBased on a fertilizer plant in Shiraz, the world's largest ethylene unit, in Asalouyeh, and the completion of other special economic zone projects, Iran's exports in petrochemicals reached $5.5 billion in 2007, $9 billion in 2008 and $7.6 billion during the first ten months of the Iranian calendar year 2010. National Petrochemical Company's output capacity will increase to over 100 million\u00a0tpa by 2015 from an estimated 50 million\u00a0tpa in 2010 thus becoming the world' second largest chemical producer globally after Dow Chemical with Iran housing some of the world's largest chemical complexes.\nMajor refineries located at Abadan (site of its first refinery), Kermanshah and Tehran failed to meet domestic demand for gasoline in 2009. Iran's refining industry requires $15 billion in investment over the period 2007\u20132012 to become self-sufficient and end gasoline imports. Iran has the fifth cheapest gasoline prices in the world leading to fuel smuggling with neighboring countries.\nIn November 2019, Iran raised the gasoline prices by 50% and imposed a strict rationing system again, as in 2007. The prices per liter gasoline rose to 15,000 rials, where only 60 liters were permitted to private cars for a month. Besides, oil purchase beyond the limit would cost 30,000 rials per liter. Those prices are still well below target prices set in the subsidy reform plan, however. The policy changes came in effect to the US sanctions, and caused protests across the country. The result of the rationing, a year later, was reduced pollution and wasteful domestic consumption and increase in exports.\nServices.\nDespite 1990s efforts towards economic liberalization, government spending, including expenditure by quasi-governmental foundations, remains high. Estimates of service sector spending in Iran are regularly more than two-fifths of GDP, much government-related, including military expenditures, government salaries, and social security disbursements. Urbanization contributed to service sector growth. Important service industries include public services (including education), commerce, personal services, professional services and tourism.\nThe total value of transport and communications is expected to rise to $46 billion in nominal terms by 2013, representing 6.8% of Iran's GDP. Projections based on 1996 employment figures compiled for the International Labour Organization suggest that Iran's transport and communications sector employed 3.4 million people, or 20.5% of the labor force in 2008.\nEnergy, gas, and petroleum.\nEnergy\nElectricity:\nElectricity\u00a0\u2013 production by source:\nOil:\nNatural gas:\nIran possesses 10% of the world's proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas reserves. Domestic oil and gas along with hydroelectric power facilities provide power. Energy wastage in Iran amounts to six or seven billion dollars per year, much higher than the international norm. Iran recycles 28% of its used oil and gas, whereas some other countries reprocess up to 60%. In 2008 Iran paid $84 billion in subsidies for oil, gas and electricity. It is the world's third largest consumer of natural gas after United States and Russia. In 2010 Iran completed its first nuclear power plant at Bushehr with Russian assistance.\nIran has been a major oil exporter since 1913. The country's major oil fields lie in the central and southwestern parts of the western Zagros mountains. Oil is also found in northern Iran and in the Persian Gulf. In 1978, Iran was the fourth largest oil producer, OPEC's second largest oil producer and second largest exporter. Following the 1979 revolution the new government reduced production. A further decline in production occurred as result of damage to oil facilities during the Iraq-Iran war.\nOil production rose in the late 1980s as pipelines were repaired and new Gulf fields exploited. By 2004, annual oil production reached 1.4 billion\u00a0barrels producing a net profit of $50 billion. Iranian Central Bank data show a declining trend in the share of Iranian exports from oil-products (FY 2006: 84.9%, 2007/2008: 86.5%, 2008/2009: 85.5%, 2009/2010: 79.8%, FY 2010 (first three quarters): 78.9%). Iranian officials estimate that Iran's annual oil and gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015 once current projects come on stream.\nPipelines move oil from the fields to the refineries and to such exporting ports as Abadan, Bandar-e Mashur and Kharg Island. Since 1997, Iran's state-owned oil and gas industry has entered into major exploration and production agreements with foreign consortia. In 2008 the Iranian Oil Bourse (IOB) was inaugurated in Kish Island. The IOB trades petroleum, petrochemicals and gas in various currencies. Trading is primarily in the euro and rial along with other major currencies, not including the US dollar. According to the Petroleum Ministry, Iran plans to invest $500 billion in its oil sector by 2025.\nAs of August 2025 the crude oil price declined by 15.44% since August 2024. In addition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) says global demand in 2025 is expected to grow by less than 700,000 barrels per day (bpd), while supply is set to rise by 2.5 million bpd\u2014 resulting in a surplus of more than 1.8 million bpd and consequently, a further decline in oil price is expected. The decline of oil price is expected to further aggravate Iran's economic situation since Iran is heavily dependent on Chinese refiners that take advantage on Iran's difficulties to sell oil in the global markets. \nRetail and distribution.\nIran's retail industry consists largely of cooperatives (many of them government-sponsored), and independent retailers operating in bazaars. The bulk of food sales occur at street markets with prices set by the Chief Statistics Bureau. Iran has 438,478 small grocery retailers. These are especially popular in cities other than Tehran where the number of hypermarkets and supermarkets is still very limited. More mini-markets and supermarkets are emerging, mostly independent operations. The biggest chainstores are state-owned Etka, Refah, Shahrvand and Hyperstar Market. Electronic commerce in Iran passed the $1 billion mark in 2009.\nIn 2012, Iranians spent $77 billion on food, $22 billion on clothes and $18.5 billion on outward tourism. In 2015, overall consumer spending and disposable income are projected at $176.4 billion and $287 billion respectively.\nHealthcare and pharma.\nThe constitution entitles Iranians to basic health care. By 2008, 73% of Iranians were covered by the voluntary national health insurance system. Although over 85% of the population use an insurance system to cover their drug expenses, the government heavily subsidizes pharmaceutical production/importation. The total market value of Iran's health and medical sector was $24 billion in 2002 and was forecast to rise to $50 billion by 2013. In 2006, 55 pharmaceutical companies in Iran produced 96% (quantitatively) of the medicines for a market worth $1.2 billion. This figure is projected to increase to $3.65 billion by 2013.\nAccording to Hataminia, S., &amp; Mohammadzadeh Asl, N. (2025), the deteriorating economic indicator of Iran especially, inflation and unemployment rates exert significant negative effects on life expectancy.\nTourism and travel.\nAlthough tourism declined significantly during the war with Iraq, it has subsequently recovered. About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004 and 2.3 million in 2009 mostly from Asian countries, including the republics of Central Asia, while about 10% came from the European Union and North America.\nThe most popular tourist destinations are Mazandaran, Isfahan, Mashhad and Shiraz. In the early 2000s the industry faced serious limitations in infrastructure, communications, industry standards and personnel training. Several organized tours from Germany, France and other European countries come to Iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments. In 2003 Iran ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide. According to UNESCO and the deputy head of research for Iran Travel and Tourism Organization (ITTO), Iran is rated among the \"10 most touristic countries in the world\". Domestic tourism in Iran is one of the largest in the world.\nBanking, finance and insurance.\nGovernment loans and credits are available to industrial and agricultural projects, primarily through banks. Iran's unit of currency is the rial which had an average official exchange rate of 9,326 rials to the U.S. dollar in 2007. Rials are exchanged on the unofficial market at a higher rate. In 1979, the government nationalized private banks. The restructured banking system replaced interest on loans with handling fees, in accordance with Islamic law. This system took effect in the mid-1980s.\nThe banking system consists of a central bank, the Bank Markazi, which issues currency and oversees all state and private banks, as well as the Organization of Islamic Economics which acts as a sort of central bank for issuing Qard al-Hasan, as a parallel system in the banking sector, operating outside the purview of the Central Bank. It supervises 1200, out of 2500 Islamic loan funds, on behalf of Iran's Central Bank. Several commercial banks have branches throughout the country. Two development banks exist and a housing bank specializes in home mortgages. The government began to privatize the banking sector in 2001 when licenses were issued to two new privately owned banks.\nState-owned commercial banks predominantly make loans to the state, \"bonyad\" enterprises, large-scale private firms and four thousand wealthy/connected individuals. While most Iranians have difficulty obtaining small home loans, 90 individuals secured facilities totaling $8 billion. In 2009, Iran's General Inspection Office announced that Iranian banks held some $38 billion of delinquent loans, with capital of only $20 billion.\nForeign transactions with Iran amounted to $150 billion of major contracts between 2000 and 2007, including private and government lines of credit. In 2007, Iran had $62 billion in assets abroad. In 2010, Iran attracted almost $11.9 billion from abroad, of which $3.6 billion was FDI, $7.4 billion was from international commercial bank loans, and around $900 million consisted of loans and projects from international development banks.\nAs of 2010, the Tehran Stock Exchange traded the shares of more than 330 registered companies. Listed companies were valued at $100 billion in 2011.\nInsurance premiums accounted for just under 1% of GDP in 2008, a figure partly attributable to low average income per head. Five state-owned insurance firms dominate the market, four of which are active in commercial insurance. The leading player is the Iran Insurance Company, followed by Asia, Alborz and Dana insurances. In 2001/02 third-party liability insurance accounted for 46% of premiums, followed by health insurance (13%), fire insurance (10%) and life insurance (9.9%).\nCommunications, electronics and IT.\nBroadcast media, including five national radio stations and five national television networks as well as dozens of local radio and television stations are run by the government. In 2008, there were 345 telephone lines and 106 personal computers for every 1,000 residents. Personal computers for home use became more affordable in the mid-1990s, since when demand for Internet access has increased rapidly. As of 2010, Iran also had the world's third largest number of bloggers (2010).\nIn 1998, the Ministry of Post, Telegraph &amp; Telephone, later renamed the Ministry of Information &amp; Communication Technology, began selling Internet accounts to the general public. In 2006, revenues from the Iranian telecom industry were estimated at $1.2 billion. In 2006, Iran had 1,223 Internet Service Providers (ISPs), all private sector operated. As of 2014, Iran has the largest mobile market in the Middle East, with 83.2 million mobile subscriptions and 8 million smart-phones in 2012.\nAccording to the World Bank, Iran's information and communications technology sector had a 1.4% share of GDP in 2008. Around 150,000 people work in this sector, including 20,000 in the software industry. 1,200 IT companies were registered in 2002, 200 in software development. In 2014 software exports stood at $400 million. By the end of 2009, Iran's telecom market was the fourth-largest in the Middle East at $9.2 billion and was expected to reach $12.9 billion by 2014 at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9%.\nTransport.\nIran has an extensive paved road system linking most towns and all cities. In 2011, the country had of roads, of which 73% were paved. In 2007 there were approximately 100 passenger cars for every 1,000 inhabitants. Trains operated on of track.\nIran's major port of entry is Bandar-Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz. After arriving in Iran, imported goods are distributed by trucks and freight trains. The Tehran\u2013Bandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to Central Asia via Tehran and Mashhad. Other major ports include Bandar Anzali and Bandar Torkaman on the Caspian Sea and Khoramshahr and Bandar Imam Khomeini on the Persian Gulf.\nDozens of cities have passenger and cargo airports. Iran Air, the national airline, was founded in 1962 and operates domestic and international flights. All large cities have bus transit systems and private companies provide intercity bus services. Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Tabriz, Ahvaz and Isfahan are constructing underground railways. More than one million people work in the transportation sector, accounting for 9% of 2008 GDP.\nIn August 2022, President Ebrahim Raisi's cabinet approved a law to import fully assembled foreign cars. His predecessor President Hassan Rouhani, had outlawed such imports in July 2018 due to sanctions imposed on Iran. Regular Iranian citizens were unable to buy safe cars at affordable prices.\nInternational trade.\nIran is a founding member of OPEC and the Organization of Gas Exporting Countries. Petroleum constitutes 56% of Iran's exports with a value of $60.2 billion in 2018. For the first time, the value of Iran's non-oil exports is expected to reach the value of imports at $43 billion in 2011. Pistachios, liquefied propane, methanol (methyl alcohol), hand-woven carpets and automobiles are the major non-oil exports. Copper, cement, leather, textiles, fruits, saffron and caviar are also export items of Iran.\nTechnical and engineering service exports in FY 2007 were $2.7 billion of which 40% of technical services went to Central Asia and the Caucasus, 30% ($350 million) to Iraq, and close to 20% ($205 million) to Africa.\nIranian firms have developed energy, pipelines, irrigation, dams and power generation in different countries. The country has made non-oil exports a priority by expanding its broad industrial base, educated and motivated workforce and favorable location, which gives it proximity to an estimated market of some 300 million people in Caspian, Persian Gulf and some ECO countries further east.\nTotal import volume rose by 189% from $13.7 billion in 2000 to $39.7 billion in 2005 and $55.189 billion in 2009. Iran's major commercial partners are China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, and South Korea. From 1950 until 1978, the United States was Iran's foremost economic and military partner, playing a major role in infrastructure and industry modernization. It is reported that around 80% of machinery and equipment in Iran is of German origin.\nIn March 2018, Iran had banned Dollar in trade. In July 2018, France, Germany and the UK agreed to continue trade with Iran without using Dollar as a medium of exchange.\nSince the mid-1990s, Iran has increased its economic cooperation with other developing countries in \"South\u2013South integration\" including Syria, India, China, South Africa, Cuba, and Venezuela. Iran's trade with India passed $13 billion in 2007, an 80% increase within a year. Iran is expanding its trade ties with Turkey and Pakistan and shares with its partners the common objective to create a common market in West and Central Asia through ECO.\nSince 2003, Iran has increased investment in neighboring countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. In Dubai, UAE, it is estimated that Iranian expatriates handle over 20% of its domestic economy and account for an equal proportion of its population. Migrant Iranian workers abroad remitted less than $2 billion home in 2006. Between 2005 and 2009, trade between Dubai and Iran tripled to $12 billion; money invested in the local real estate market and import-export businesses, collectively known as the \"Bazaar\", and geared towards providing Iran and other countries with required consumer goods. It is estimated that one third of Iran's imported goods and exports are delivered through the black market, underground economy, and illegal jetties, thus damaging the economy.\nThe current account.\nIran had an estimated $110 billion in foreign reserves in 2011 and balances its external payments by pricing oil at approximately $75 per barrel. As of 2013, only $30 to $50 billion of those reserves are accessible because of current sanctions. Iranian media has questioned the reason behind Iran's government non-repatriation of its foreign reserves before the imposition of the latest round of sanctions and its failure to convert into gold. As a consequence, the Iranian rial lost more than 40% of its value between December 2011 and April 2012.\nThe current account was expected to reach a surplus of 2.1% of GDP in FY 2012, and the net fiscal balance (after payments to Iran's National Development Fund) will register a surplus of 0.3% of GDP. In 2013 the external debts stood at $7.2 billion down from $17.3 billion in 2012. Overall fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate to 2.7% of GDP in FY 2016 from 1.7% in 2015.\nMoney in circulation reached $700 billion in March 2020 (based on the 2017 pre-devaluation exchange rate), thus furthering the decline of the Iranian rial and rise in inflation.\nForeign direct investment.\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, indirect oilfield development agreements were made with foreign firms, including buyback contracts in the oil sector whereby the contractor provided project finance in return for an allocated production share. Operation transferred to National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) after a set number of years, completing the contract.\nUnfavorable or complex operating requirements and international sanctions have hindered foreign investment in the country, despite liberalization of relevant regulations in the early 2000s. Iran absorbed $24.3 billion of foreign investment between the Iranian calendar years 1993 and 2007. The EIU estimates that Iran's net FDI will rise by 100% between 2010 and 2014.\nForeign investors concentrated their activities in the energy, vehicle manufacture, copper mining, construction, utilities, petrochemicals, clothing, food and beverages, telecom and pharmaceuticals sectors. Iran is a member of the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. In 2006, the combined net worth of Iranian citizens abroad was about 1.3 trillion\u00a0dollars.\nAccording to the head of the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI), in 2008 Iran ranked 142 among 181 countries in working conditions. Iran stands at number 96 in terms of business start-ups, 165 in obtaining permits, 147 in employment, 147 in asset registration, 84 in obtaining credit, 164 in legal support for investments, 104 in tax payments, 142 in overseas trade, 56 in contract feasibility and 107 in bankruptcy. Firms from over 50 countries invested in Iran between 1992 and 2008, with Asia and Europe the largest participants as shown below:\nThe economic impact of a partial lifting of sanctions extends beyond the energy sector; \"The New York Times\" reported that \"consumer-oriented companies, in particular, could find opportunity in this country with 81 million consumers, many of whom are young and prefer Western products\". The consumer-goods market is expected to grow by $100 billion by 2020.\nIn 2015, Iran was considered \"a strong emerging market play\" by investment and trading firms. Opening Iran's market place to foreign investment could also be a boon to competitive multinational firms operating in a variety of manufacturing and service sectors, worth $600 billion to $800 billion in new investment opportunities over the next decade.\nForeign currency reserves.\nIn the 2000s, during high oil prices, Iran's central bank built up reserves well above $100 billion. However, sanctions after 2012 cut Iran's access to much of its money (funds accumulated from oil sales in countries like China, India, South Korea were locked or could only be used for limited purchases). In 2018, when the U.S. reimposed banking sanctions, Iran's usable reserves shrank dramatically \u2013 at one point in 2020, the IMF estimated Iran had as little as $4 billion in accessible reserves (excluding gold and illiquid assets). After 2021, higher oil exports to China allowed some rebuilding of reserves. By late 2024, Iran's total international reserves (including gold and deposits abroad) were estimated at around $26 billion, rising to a projected $34 billion in 2025 as per IMF data \u2013 though not all of that is readily deployable.\nLack of reserve access has contributed to Iran's currency volatility; the central bank has limited ability to intervene in the open market with dollars or euros. In late 2023, a deal with the U.S. allowed Iran to repatriate about $6 billion of its funds from South Korea (in exchange for a prisoner release), but those funds were designated for humanitarian trade only. Iran's oil export revenue (mostly in yuan from China) is partly kept offshore to finance imports from those countries.\nFacing this, the Central Bank of Iran has tried tactics like currency swap agreements with allies, efforts to ditch the U.S. dollar in trade (using barter or currencies like yuan/rouble), and even reportedly buying cryptocurrencies as alternative reserve assets. In 2022, the bank also raised interest rates and banned private exchange trading for a period to slow capital flight. Yet capital flight persisted \u2013 an estimated $14 billion left Iran in 2024 and $20 billion in 2023 as people sought safer assets abroad, reflecting low confidence in the rial.\nWorld Trade Organization.\nIran has held observer status at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since 2005. Although the United States has consistently blocked its bid to join the organization, observer status came in a goodwill gesture to ease nuclear negotiations between Iran and the international community. With exports of 60 products with revealed comparative advantage, Iran is the 65th \"most complex country\".\nShould Iran eventually gain membership status in the WTO, among other prerequisites, copyrights will have to be enforced in the country. This will require a major overhaul. The country is hoping to attract billions of dollars' worth of foreign investment by creating a more favorable investment climate through freer trade. Free trade zones such as Qeshm, Chabahar, and Kish Island are expected to assist in this process. Iran allocated $20 billion in 2010 to loans for the launch of twenty trade centers in other countries.\nInternational sanctions.\nSee also Economic Recession in Iran\nAfter the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States ended its economic and diplomatic ties with Iran, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately $11 billion of its assets. In 1996, the U.S. Government passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) which prohibits U.S. (and non-U.S.) companies from investing and trading with Iran in amounts of more than $20 million annually. Since 2000 exceptions to this restriction have been made for items including pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.\nIran's nuclear program has been the subject of contention with the West since 2006 over suspicions of its intentions. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions against select companies linked to the nuclear program, thus furthering the country's economic isolation. Sanctions notably bar nuclear, missile and many military exports to Iran and target investments in oil, gas and petrochemicals, exports of refined petroleum products, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, banks, insurance, financial transactions and shipping.\nIn 2012, the European Union tightened its own sanctions by joining the three decade-old US oil embargo against Iran. In 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear program that will remove the main sanctions by early 2016. Even though Iran can trade in its own currency some problems subsist mainly due to the fact that it cannot transact in US dollars freely. \nIn 2018, the United States government unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA agreement and re-imposed its sanctions on Iran's oil sales, petrochemicals, shipping, metals trading and banking transactions.\nEffects.\nAccording to U.S. Undersecretary of State William J. Burns, Iran may be losing as much as $60 billion annually in energy investment. Sanctions are making imports 24% more costly on average. In addition, the latest round of sanctions could cost Iran annually $50 billion in lost oil revenues. Iran is increasingly using barter trade because its access to the international dollar payment system has been denied. According to Iranian officials, large-scale withdrawal by international companies represents an \"opportunity\" for domestic companies to replace them.\nThe IEA estimated that Iranian exports fell to a record of 860,000\u00a0bpd in September 2012 from 2.2 million\u00a0bpd at the end of 2011. This fall led to a drop in revenues and clashes on the streets of Tehran when the local currency, the rial, collapsed. September 2012 output was Iran's lowest since 1988.\nThe economic impacts of sanctions have been severe. Based on research, the sanctions resulted in welfare losses across all income groups in Iran, with wealthier groups suffering greater losses compared to poorer groups. Additionally, income concentration and share within top income groups declined post-sanctions.\nAccording to the U.S. Iran could reduce the world price of crude petroleum by 10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008 world oil price of $100/bbl).\nAccording to NIAC, sanctions cost the United States over $175 billion in lost trade and 279,000 lost job opportunities. Between 2010 and 2012, sanctions cost the E.U. states more than twice as much as the United States in terms of lost trade revenue. Germany was hit the hardest, losing between $23.1 and $73.0 billion between 2010 and 2012, with Italy and France following at $13.6-$42.8 billion and $10.9-$34.2 billion respectively.\nGDP growth turned negative in 2013 (\u22125%). The unofficial unemployment rate was 20% by mid-2012. Oil exports dropped to 1.4 million\u00a0bpd in 2014 from 2.5 million\u00a0bpd in 2011. By 2013, Iran had $80 billion in foreign exchange reserves frozen overseas. Automobile production declined 40% between 2011 and 2013. According to the U.S. government in 2015, Iran's economy has reached a point where it is \"fundamentally incapable of recovery\" without a nuclear accommodation with the West.\nThe tentative rapprochement between Iran and the US, which began in the second half of 2013, has the potential to become a world-changing development, and unleash tremendous geopolitical and economic opportunities, if it is sustained [\u2026] if Iran and the US were to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could decline sharply, and Iran could come to be perceived as a promising emerging market in its own right.\nIn January 2019, President Hassan Rouhani blamed the US for Iran's declining economy. Following the US pullout from an international nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions, Iran faced the toughest economic situation in 40 years. According to Majlis, this has caused damages estimated between 150 and 200 billion dollars to the Iranian economy.\nIn August 2024, an Iranian group called IRLeaks attacked Iranian banks. Politico described the attack as the \"worst cyberattack\" in Iranian history. According to Politico, the Iranian government was forced to pay millions of dollars to IRLeaks in ransom. Politico reported that 20 out of about 29 Iranian credit institutions fell in the attack. The Iranian supreme leader blamed Israel and the United States without mentioning the cyberattack on the banking system. Politico remarked it was plausible Israel or the US were involved because of tensions with Israel as well as the Americans having accused Iran of intervening in the American 2024 elections. Politico also remarked that the group was made of freelance hackers and the attack was likely carried out for monetary gain. TechCentral said the attack was probably carried out by freelance hackers. An Iranian firm paid the hackers no less than $3 million to stop the attack and retrieve data.\nWater crisis.\nIran is in the midst of a severe water crisis that threatens its agriculture, power supply, and habitability in some regions. Years of drought, climate change, and poor water management policies have led to depleting water reserves. Since the late 1990s, Iran's average rainfall has declined, and 2021\u20132025 marked an especially arid period \u2013 Iran has endured five consecutive years of drought as of 2025. By mid-2025, authorities warned that many reservoirs were dangerously low or empty. For instance, Tehran's main reservoir, the Karaj Dam, reached its lowest level on record, reportedly only a few percent of capacity, raising alarm about water shortages in the capital. Nationwide, Iran's Water Resources Management Company reported in 2021 that 57% of all reservoirs were completely empty, after a 47% drop in inflows compared to the previous year. Over-extraction of groundwater has caused thousands of wells to dry up and land subsidence in many aquifers.\nThe water crisis has had dire effects. Rivers and wetlands have shrunk. Lake Urmia, once the Middle East's largest salt lake, lost about 95% of its volume by 2022 before emergency measures to divert water were taken. In farming provinces like Khuzestan, Isfahan, and Sistan-Baluchestan, irrigation shortages have devastated crops and livestock. Rural livelihoods are undermined, leading to migration from villages to slums in cities. The water scarcity has also triggered public unrest: in July 2021, massive protests erupted in Khuzestan over water shortages, where security forces cracked down, causing multiple deaths. Similar protests occurred in Isfahan in 2021 by farmers demanding water for dried-up Zayandeh Rud river.\nThe government has implemented some measures, including cloud-seeding, building dams and water transfer pipelines, and negotiating with neighboring countries for shared water rights (e.g. over the Helmand River with Afghanistan). In 2023\u20132024, President Ebrahim Raisi's administration inaugurated a pipeline to transfer water from the Sea of Oman to central provinces, and pursued desalination projects on the Persian Gulf. However, experts criticize decades of mismanagement, such as over-damming, wasteful irrigation, and the cultivation of water-intensive crops (like rice, sugarcane) in arid areas, for aggravating the crisis. The situation became so acute in summer 2025 that the government declared public holidays to conserve water and electricity during an extreme heatwave (temperatures &gt;50\u00a0\u00b0C), urging citizens to drastically limit water use. Officials have even discussed importing water from neighboring countries. President Masoud Pezeshkian (in 2025) warned that the water crisis is \"more serious than what is being discussed\" and that without urgent action, Iran could face an unmanageable situation in the near future.\nElectricity crisis.\nIran grappled with an electricity supply crisis in recent years, leading to frequent power outages across the country. The power grid faces multiple strains: rising domestic demand, particularly for air conditioning in hot summers and heating in winters, reduced generation from hydropower due to drought (water shortages have cut hydroelectric output), aged infrastructure and lack of investment, and fuel supply issues (natural gas shortages in winter curtail power plants). Starting around 2020, these issues converged into regular blackouts. In summer 2021, for example, many cities endured scheduled and unscheduled electricity cuts during a heatwave, sparking public anger as traffic lights failed and businesses lost refrigeration.\nOne controversial factor has been cryptocurrency mining : Iran became a hub for Bitcoin mining (legalized in 2019) due to cheap subsidized power, but the energy-intensive activity strained the grid. At times Iran temporarily banned crypto mining (e.g. summer 2021 and winter 2022) to free up power capacity. It was revealed that some entities, including possibly the Revolutionary Guard, operated large mining farms that consumed as much electricity as several provinces, often without proper billing \u2013 causing outrage that ordinary people suffered blackouts while illicit mining drew power.\nThe electricity rationing has been notably inequitable. In Tehran, wealthier northern neighborhoods (which include many government and military facilities) experience far fewer outages than poorer southern districts. In mid-2025, data showed northern Tehran had only about 1% of the city's blackouts, while southern districts suffered over 30% of the outages. This disparity, confirmed by official reports, led to public criticism and even parliamentary questions about fairness \u2013 many suspect that \"sensitive\" areas (where elites live or strategic sites are located) are shielded from cuts, leaving ordinary neighborhoods to bear the brunt. In provinces like Khuzestan, Busher, Hormozgan and other southern regions, summer temperatures above 45\u00a0\u00b0C combined with lengthy power outages have created life-threatening conditions and sparked protests. Politicians from those regions complained that cutting electricity for up to 6\u20137 hours a day in 50\u00a0\u00b0C heat is intolerable and blamed mismanagement by the Energy Ministry.\nThe government has cited peak demand outstripping generation as the cause of the blackouts. Iran's installed power capacity (~85 GW) is theoretically sufficient, but actual output is lower due to maintenance issues and fuel constraints. Natural gas, which fuels ~70% of power plants, saw shortages in winter 2021\u20132022, causing electricity cuts and even shutting industries and schools to save gas. In response, officials have been pushing projects for new power plants (often with Russian or Chinese assistance) and upgrading the grid. Nonetheless, the electricity crisis remains unresolved as of 2025 \u2013 with outages now a common part of daily life in summer and even winter. The crisis has economic costs: small businesses lose customers and goods (e.g. melted frozen products, downed internet), factories halt production during cuts, and urban residents incur appliance damages. Public frustration is high, viewing the persistent outages as a sign of poor governance in a country that is a major energy producer. The government's inability to ensure consistent power, critics say, undermines Iran's ambitions for industrial growth and has even led to sarcastic comparisons to the 1980s war era, when electricity was more reliable than today.\nThe effect of Iran's nuclear program.\nThe Iranian regime spent more that 9 billion USD on Iran's nuclear program over the last three decades. The efforts to develop the nuclear program were accompanied by threats to destroy Israel, which resulted in heavy sanctions that were imposed on Iran and consequently, heavy indirect cost. The indirect cost of the nuclear program are estimated to be 3 trillion USD. Iran lost more than 450 billion USD in oil revenues, more than 100 billion USD in lost of foreign investment, and the Iranian Real has been devaluated in more than 95%.\nMuch of the investment was evaporated as a result of Iran-Israel war, which resulted in a destruction of large parts of Iran's nuclear program, including the destruction of facilities like the nuclear facilities in Natanz and Fordow as well as assassination of nuclear scientists.\nThe economic effect of the 2025 war with Israel.\nThe 12-day war with Israel in June 2025 had a profound short-term impact on Iran's economy and underscored its fragility. During the conflict, Israel's airstrikes targeted key Iranian infrastructure, including oil refineries, export terminals, and even nuclear sites, while Iran's Revolutionary Guard launched hundreds of missiles at Israeli targets. The economic toll was significant: Iran's oil exports plunged by 94% during the war, dropping from about 1.7 million barrels per day to barely 100,000, due to damage and fear of tanker transit in the Persian Gulf. This translated to around $120 million in lost oil income per day, or roughly $1.4 billion total loss over 12 days. Tehran also incurred heavy costs firing ballistic missiles and drones \u2013 an estimated 591 missiles were launched, which, given unit costs ranging from $250k to $8 million, could have cost up to $4\u20135 billion in arsenal expenditure. On the other side, Israeli and U.S. strikes caused billions in physical damage: dozens of military facilities, communication centers, and at least 120 residential buildings in Tehran were destroyed or severely damaged. Three nuclear enrichment sites were hit; while Iran claimed damage was minor, U.S. officials said one site was \"completely destroyed,\" potentially nullifying an investment Iran valued at trillions of dollars over decades.\nThe war's destruction compounded Iran's existing infrastructure crisis. Even before 2025, Iran estimated it needed over $500 billion in investment to modernize infrastructure (power plants, water systems, transport). War damage meant reconstruction spending will divert funds from other development needs. Moreover, the conflict prompted a week-long internet blackout by Iranian authorities for security, which itself caused over $400 million in economic losses (e.g. e-commerce, communications) according to NetBlocks estimates. Cyberattacks also hit Iran's financial sector during the war, with one hack of a major crypto exchange (Nobitex) reportedly stealing over $100 million of assets.\nAfter 12 days, Iran agreed to a ceasefire; an Iranian MP on parliament's economic commission admitted Iran's economy \"lacks the resilience for a decisive battle\" and that the financial strain was a key reason Iran could not prolong the war.\nThe war's aftermath brought even tighter U.S. sanctions. For example, enforcement on oil smuggling was intensified by Western navies. Global risk perception of Iran rose, deterring foreign investors further and even prompting capital flight among wealthy Iranians fearing instability. The currency, which had plunged during the conflict, remained very weak (around 1.3 million rials per USD by mid-late 2025).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral references.\n\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" entries\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArticles\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGovernments\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPapers\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64705", "revid": "1315037427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64705", "title": "Boris Godunov", "text": "Tsar of Russia from 1598 to 1605\nBoris Feodorovich Godunov , (//); 12 August\u00a0[O.S. 2 August]\u00a01552 \u00a0\u2013 23 April\u00a0[O.S. 13 April]\u00a01605) was the \"de facto\" regent of Russia from 1585 to 1598 and then tsar from 1598 to 1605 following the death of Feodor I, the last of the Rurik dynasty. After the end of Feodor's reign, Russia descended into the Time of Troubles.\nEarly years.\nBoris was the son of Feodor Ivanovich Godunov \"Krivoy\" (lit.\u2009'the one-eyed', died c. 1568\u20131570) and his wife Stepanida Ivanovna. His older brother Vasily died young and without issue. There is a version according to which the Godunovs were descended from the Tatar \"murza\" Chet, who came to Russia in 1330 during the reign of Ivan Kalita. This version was included in later editions of the 16th-century \"Gosudarev Rodoslovets\", but historians have raised doubts about this version of Godunov's ancestry due to various chronological and genealogical issues.\nGodunov's career began at the court of Ivan the Terrible. He is mentioned in 1570 for taking part in the Serpeisk campaign as an archer of the guard. The following year he became an \"oprichnik\" \u2013 a member of Ivan's personal guard and secret police. In 1570\u20131571, Godunov strengthened his position at court by his marriage to Maria Grigorievna Skuratova-Belskaya, the daughter of Malyuta Skuratov-Belskiy, head of the \"oprichniki\".\nIn 1580, Ivan chose Boris Godunov's sister Irina Godunova (1557\u20131603) to be the wife of his second son and eventual heir, Feodor Ivanovich (1557\u20131598). On this occasion, Godunov was promoted to the rank of boyar. On 15 November 1581, Godunov was present when Ivan murdered his own eldest son, Tsarevich Ivan. Godunov tried to intervene but received blows from the tsar's sceptre. The elder Ivan immediately repented, and Godunov rushed to get help for the tsarevich, who died four days later.\nRegency.\nThree years later, on his deathbed, Ivan IV appointed a council whose members consisted of Godunov, Feodor Nikitich Romanov, Vasili Shuiski and others to guide his son and successor of Russia Feodor I, who was feeble in both mind and body: \"he took refuge from the dangers of the palace in devotion to religion; and though his people called him a saint, they recognized the fact that he lacked the iron to govern men.\"\nAt the time of his death, Ivan also had a three-year-old son, Dmitry Ivanovich (1581\u20131591), from his seventh and last marriage. This son (and his mother's family) had no claim to the throne because the Eastern Orthodox Church only recognized Ivan's first three marriages as legitimate. Shortly after Ivan's death, the council had both Dmitri and his mother, Maria Nagaya, moved to Uglich, some 120 miles north of Moscow. Dmitri died there in 1591 at the age of ten under suspicious circumstances.\nWhen Dmitri's death was announced by the ringing of the church bell, the population of Uglich rose up in order to protest against the suspected assassination, which it believed was commissioned by Boris Godunov. Troops swiftly quelled the rebellion. Godunov ordered the removal of the Uglich bell's clapper (the bell's \"tongue\"). He had the offending bell ringer flogged in public and exiled to Siberia along with the townspeople who had not been executed.\nAn official commission which was headed by Vasili Shuiski was sent to determine the cause of the boy's death. The official verdict was that the boy had cut his throat during an epileptic seizure. Ivan's widow claimed that her son had been murdered by Godunov's agents. Godunov's guilt was never established and shortly thereafter, Dmitri's mother was forced to take the veil. Dmitry Ivanovich was laid to rest and promptly, though temporarily, forgotten.\nAt the coronation of Feodor Ivanovich as Tsar Feodor I on 31 May 1584, Boris received honors and riches as a member of the regency council, in which he held the second place during the life of the Tsar's uncle Nikita Romanovich. When Nikita died in 1586, Boris had no serious rival for the regency.\nA group of other boyars and Dionysius II, Metropolitan of Moscow, conspired to break Boris's power by divorcing the Tsar from Godunov's childless sister. The attempt proved unsuccessful, and the conspirators were banished or sent to monasteries. After that, Godunov remained supreme in Russia and he corresponded with foreign princes as their equal.\nHis policy was generally pacific and always prudent. In 1595, he recovered from Sweden some towns lost during the former reign. Five years previously he had defeated a Turkic raid upon Moscow, for which he received the title of \"Konyushy\", an obsolete dignity even higher than that of \"Boyar\". He supported an anti-Turkish faction in the Crimea and gave the Khan subsidies in his war against the sultan.\nGodunov encouraged English merchants to trade with Russia by exempting them from duties. He built towns and fortresses along the north-eastern and south-eastern borders of Russia to keep the Tatar and Finnic tribes in order. These included Samara, Saratov, Voronezh, and Tsaritsyn, as well as other lesser towns. He colonized Siberia with scores of new settlements, including Tobolsk.\nDuring his rule, the Russian Orthodox Church received its patriarchate, placing it on an equal footing with the ancient Eastern churches and freeing it from the influence of the Patriarch of Constantinople. This pleased the Tsar, as Feodor took a great interest in church affairs.\nIn Godunov's most important domestic reform, a 1597 decree forbade peasants from transferring land from one landowner to another (which they had been freely able to do each year around Saint George's Day in November), thus binding them to the soil. This ordinance aimed to secure revenue, but it led to the institution of serfdom in its most oppressive form. (See also Serfdom in Russia.)\nReign.\nUpon the death of the childless tsar Feodor on 7 January 1598, self-preservation as much as ambition constrained Boris to seize the throne. Had he not done so, the mildest treatment he could have hoped for would have been lifelong seclusion in a monastery. His election was proposed by Patriarch Job of Moscow, who believed that Boris was the only man who would be able to cope with the difficulties of the situation. Boris, however, would only accept the throne from a \"Zemsky Sobor\", or national assembly, which met on February 17 and unanimously elected him on the 21st. On September 1, he was solemnly crowned tsar.\nDuring the first years of his reign, he was both popular and prosperous, and ruled well. He recognized the need for Russia to catch up with the intellectual progress of the West, and he did his best to bring about educational and social reforms. He was the first tsar to import foreign teachers on a large scale, the first tsar to send young Russians to be educated abroad, and the first tsar to allow Lutheran churches to be built in Russia. After the Russo\u2013Swedish War (1590\u20131595), he attempted to gain access to the Baltic Sea and he also attempted to obtain Livonia by diplomatic means. He cultivated friendly relations with the Scandinavians in order to intermarry with foreign royal houses and thereby increase the dignity of his own dynasty.\nAs he did during his regency, Boris received support from various groupings of boyars, including those of the top princely aristocracy. He took advantage of the jostling for precedence among the aristocracy to advance his interests. The result was that a fairly broad circle of boyars came to court and were favored by the tsar, but they did not form a coherent party, and few of them were skilled politicians. According to historian Andrei Pavlov, this was the source of the internal weakness in the Godunovs' government which became apparent after the tsar's death. The main threat to Boris's rule came from the Romanov clan, which was still displeased with being passed over for the tsardom in the election. Boris moved against them in November 1600: the eldest Romanov brother, Feodor Nikitich, was tonsured and exiled to a monastery in the north, and his brothers and followers were exiled or imprisoned in various places, where many of them died. Ruslan Skrynnikov suggests that the repression of the Romanovs was prompted by Boris's illness; he eliminated his main rivals to secure the succession of his son after his death. \nDespite the recovery of the economy, at the end of the 16th century the effects of the economic and social crisis in Russia had not been entirely eliminated. This was compounded by a devastating famine in 1601\u20131603, which killed hundreds of thousands of people. Boris's active relief efforts did not succeed in significantly mitigating the effects of the disaster. Social tensions became more severe, and a large-scale flight of peasants and slaves occurred. In 1601 and again in 1602, the government decreed that the traditional right of peasants to move on Saint George's Day was being restored; however, it was only to apply to the lands of the provincial nobility and the lowest level of courtiers, not to court and state lands or large estates. These measures only exacerbated social tensions: many peasants believed that the decrees had abolished serfdom, while landowners refused to comply with the allowance of peasant movement. The law was not reissued in 1603, and Boris resumed his previous policy of enforcing serfdom, further alienating the peasantry. Unrest began among the lower classes, leading to disturbances in several towns and a battle between the army and insurgents outside Moscow.\nThe greatest unrest was in the southern frontier region, where large numbers of escaped peasants and slaves had gone and joined the ranks of the 'free' Cossacks. Among the ranks of the Cossacks were also military slaves of the boyars and even indigent nobles. These Cossack groups posed a significant military threat and were made even more restless by the construction of the new border towns under Boris, which encroached upon their lands. The tsar took repressive measures to rein in the Cossacks, to no avail. More unrest was caused in the south by the government's policy of imposing mandatory labor on state lands, which was done to guarantee the availability of food in the region. Thus, when a pretender appeared claiming to be the late Tsarevich Dmitry, supposedly having survived Godunov's assassination attempt, he received significant support from the free Cossacks and the rebellious population of the southern frontiers. Godunov's government asserted that the pretender was really Grigory Otrepyev, an escaped monk and former nobleman. In the autumn of 1604, the False Dmitry crossed the border into Russia from Poland\u2013Lithuania with a force of 2,000 Polish noblemen and a few thousand Cossacks. He attracted new forces as he advanced deeper into Russia. The victories won by government forces over the pretender at the battles of Novgorod-Seversk and Dobrynichi failed to put an end to the threat, as the whole southern frontier region rose up in revolt. The inhabitants of the southern towns willingly recognized the False Dmitry as tsar and surrendered their governors to him. Historians such as Sergei Platonov and Vasily Klyuchevsky believed that the False Dmitry was promoted by boyars opposed to the rule of the Godunovs, but Andrei Pavlov writes that there is no \"direct and reliable evidence of this.\" Rather, Pavlov writes, the unrest at the time of the pretender's invasion came from the lower rungs of the social hierarchy. \nBoris died on 23 April\u00a0[O.S. 13 April]\u00a01605. According to the French mercenary captain Jacques Margeret, who was at the palace at the time, the tsar died of a stroke. He took monastic orders shortly before his death and accepted the monastic name Bogolep. Although Godunov had been seriously ill for a long time, his death was a shock for everybody. The boyars soon crowned Boris's sixteen-year-old son Feodor as tsar, but Boris's death caused discord among the nobility. Many people believed that Boris was actually guilty of regicide and usurpation and viewed his death as divine punishment and proof of the False Dmitry's authenticity.\nIn his last days, Boris Godunov had promoted Pyotr Basmanov, a young officer of non-noble origin who had served with distinction in the first campaign against the False Dmitry. Boris hoped that Basmanov would secure the future of his dynasty. However, Basmanov was offended when, after Boris's death, the powerful courtier Semyon Godunov placed his own son-in-law Andrei Telyatevsky 'above' Basmanov in the service registry. This caused Basmanov to betray the Godunovs. More important was the opposition of detachments of servicemen from the southern towns such as Ryazan and Tula. In May 1605, the army at Kromy went over to the side of the False Dmitry, and on 1 June 1605 a revolt in Moscow by supporters of the pretender overthrew Tsar Feodor. On June 10, Feodor and his mother, Boris's widow, were killed by agents of the False Dmitry.\nFamily.\nBoris left one son, Feodor II, who succeeded him but only ruled Russia for less than a month, until he and Boris's widow were murdered by the enemies of the Godunovs in Moscow on 10/20 June 1605. Boris's first son, Ivan, was born in 1587 and died in 1588. His daughter, Xenia, was born in 1582. She was engaged to Johann of Schleswig-Holstein, but he died shortly before their planned wedding in October 1602. Xenia was given the name \"Olga\" upon being forced to take monastic vows at the Voskresensky Monastery in Beloozero and her name is inscribed as \"the Nun Olga Borisovna\" at the crypt of the Godunovs at the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius where she lived from 1606, when she sojourned there to attend the reburial of her father, until her death in 1622. Boris, his wife, and their children are buried together in a mausoleum near the entrance of the Assumption Cathedral at Trinity\u2013St. Sergius Lavra.\nArts and popular media.\nBoris's life was dramatised by the founder of Russian literature, Alexander Pushkin, in his play \"Boris Godunov\" (1831), which was inspired by Shakespeare's \"Henry IV\". Modest Mussorgsky based his opera \"Boris Godunov\" on Pushkin's play. Sergei Prokofiev later wrote incidental music for Pushkin's drama. In 1997, the score of a 1710 baroque opera based on the reign of Boris by German composer Johann Mattheson was rediscovered in Armenia and returned to Hamburg, Germany. This opera, never performed during the composer's lifetime, had its world premiere in 2005 at the Boston Early Music Festival &amp; Exhibition.\nBoris was portrayed on BBC Radio 4 by Shaun Dooley in the radio plays \"Ivan the Terrible: Absolute Power\" and \"Boris Godunov: Ghosts\" written by Mike Walker and which were the first two plays in the first series of \"Tsar\". The plays were broadcast on 11 and 18 September 2016.\nThe 2018 Russian television miniseries \"Godunov\" is a historical drama based on the lives of the Godunovs with a focus on Boris Godunov (played by Sergey Bezrukov) and lasted for two seasons.\nThe character Boris Badenov in the cartoon \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\" takes his name from a play on Godunov's name.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fixed-line penetration in 2004 was relatively well-developed by regional standards, standing at 22 lines per 100 people, higher than Egypt with 14 and Saudi Arabia with 15, although behind the UAE with 27. Iran had more than 1 mobile phone per inhabitant by 2012.\nIran has a population of 80 million with some 56% of Iranians under the age of 25. In 2008, there were more than 52,000 rural offices, providing Telecom services to the villages across the country. The number of fixed telephone lines is above 24 million, with penetration factor of 33.66%. In 2012, there were 43 million internet users in Iran, making the country first in the Middle East in terms of number. As of 2020, 70 million Iranians are using high-speed mobile internet.\nIran is among the first five countries which have had a growth rate of over 20 percent and the highest level of development in telecommunications. Iran has been awarded the UNESCO special certificate for providing telecommunication services to rural areas. By the end of 2009, Iran's telecommunications market was the fourth-largest market in the region at $9.2 billion and is expected to grow to $12.9 billion by 2014 at a CAGR of 6.9 percent.\nAccording to the \"Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries\" (EJISDC), the information and communications technology (ICT) sector had a 1.1\u20131.3% share of GDP in 2002. About 150,000 people are employed in the ICT sector, including around 20,000 in the software industry. There were 1,200 registered information technology (IT) companies in 2002, 200 of which were involved in software development. Software exports stood around $50 million in 2008. Between 2009 and 2020 the Telecommunications market more than doubled.\nOverview.\nThe government runs the broadcast media, which includes three national radio stations and two national television networks, as well as dozens of local radio and television stations. In 2000 there were 252 radios, 158 television sets, 219 telephone lines, and 110 personal computers for every 1,000 residents. Computers for home use became more affordable in the mid-1990s, and since then demand for access to the Internet has increased rapidly. In 1998, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (renamed the Ministry of Information &amp; Communication Technology) began selling Internet accounts to the general public. In 2006, the Iranian telecom industry's revenues were estimated at $1.2 billion. By the end of 2009, Iran's telecommunications market was the fourth-largest market in the region at $9.2 billion and is expected to grow to $12.9 billion by 2014 at a CAGR of 6.9 percent.\nThe Fourth Five Year Economic Development Plan has proposed the following key benchmarks for 2010: 36 million fixed lines; 50% penetration rate for mobile phones; establishment of reliable rural ICT connections and 30 million internet users. Given the recent developments of the industry, the objectives are very likely to be achieved.\nAccording to one report, Iran has seen above average growth, specially in mobile subscriber numbers. Mobile data services are available but account for a small proportion of total data consumption in 2014. Some telecom parameters of 2012 &amp; 2014 are as below:\nMore than 23 million Iranians have access to the Internet and over 45 million own mobile phones (2009/10). Tech-savvy citizens use text messages to communicate with friends and browse the Internet \u2014 which the government controls in terms of access and speed \u2014 for a multiplicity of purposes. Blogging is also immensely popular.\nPress.\nThe press in Iran is privately \"and\" government owned and reflects a diversity of political and social views. A special court has authority to monitor the print media and may suspend publication or revoke the licenses of papers or journals that a jury finds guilty of publishing anti-religious material, slander, or information detrimental to the national interest. Since the late 1990s the court has shut down many pro-reform newspapers and other periodicals. Most Iranian newspapers are published in Persian, but newspapers in English and other languages also exist. The most widely circulated periodicals are based in Tehr\u0101n. Popular daily and weekly newspapers include \"Ettelaat\", \"Kayhan\", \"Resalat\", \"Iran Daily\" and the \"Tehran Times\" (Iran Daily and Tehran Times are both English-language papers).\nSatellite.\nSince the 1970s, there have been a number of proposals for a state-owned communications satellite, called \"Zohreh\" (en:Venus) from 1993 onwards. The planned satellite would have similar capabilities to a commercially produced Western satellite, while such capabilities are already provided through leases owned by the Iranian telecommunications sector. An agreement was signed between Iran and Russia in 2005 to develop the satellite with a planned launch date of 2007, but the launch has been postponed until at least 2009, set to follow actual construction of the satellite.\nTelephone.\nThe telephone system is inadequate but being modernized and expanded with the goal of not only improving the efficiency and increasing the volume of the urban service but also bringing telephone service to several thousand villages that are not connected now.\nDomestic.\nAs a result of heavy investing in the telephone system since 1994, thousands of mobile cellular subscribers are being served; moreover, the technical level of the system has been raised by the installation of thousands of digital switches.\nIran's telecommunication network enjoys the highest growth rate in the Middle East. One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989\u20131994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994\u20131999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines. Iran's telecom market, which generated an estimated $9.1 billion in 2010 (of which 2/3 from \"voice\" mobile-phone and 1/10 from \"data\" mobile-phone services), has been growing significantly, especially its mobile-phone business. As of 2010, Iran had about 66 million mobile-phone subscribers covering about 70% of the population. In contrast, about 36% of Iranians had fixed-line phones.\nMobile phone.\nOperators.\nMajor mobile operators as of 2008: Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran (MCI Hamrahe Aval) with 70% market share, MTN Irancell (28%), and Emirates Telecommunications Corp (Etisalat) who won a license for 300 million euros in December 2008. Etisalat has been replaced by an Iranian consortium and operates under the name \"RighTel\". The two national operators, Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran and MTN Irancell both offer GPRS-based data services. Recently a new LTE mobile broadband service provider called ApTel has started its work in Iran.\nAs of 2011, major foreign supplier to Iran's mobile-phone networks are: Huawei of China along, Telefon AB L.M. and Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens. As of 2016, France's Orange and U.K.'s Vodafone (through \"HiWEB.ir\") are also developing mobile IT in Iran.\n3G network.\nAbu Dhabi-based Etisalat and \"Tamin Telecom\", the telecommunications investment arm of Iran's social security and pensions department, will gain exclusive rights for two years to offer second- and third-generation services (3G) in Iran (2008). Assuming a minimum network investment of $4 billion, Etisalat can gain about 20 percent to 25% market share over five years of its operations (by 2013). In 2009 it was announced that Etisalat, however, failed to secure the right to be Iran's exclusive 3G operator for two years. Later, \"Tamin Telecom\" announced that, IDRO and \"Imam Khomeini Decree Center\" have replaced Etisalat because of contractual disagreements. In 2011, Tamin Telecom revealed plans to cover 60 percent of the population with its 2G network and 40 percent with its 3G network by 2014.\n4G network.\nAs of 2020, 4G LTE population coverage in Iran has reached around 90%. The government is preparing regulations for 5G deployment and aims to launch services in the next couple of years.\n5G network\nIn 2021, Irancell and MCI launched 5G networks in Iran. In 2025, most major cities in Iran are have 5G internet support.\nInternational.\nAs of 2010, international connection services are provided exclusively by Infrastructure Company of Iran, a fully owned subsidiary of TCI. Submarine fiber-optic cable to UAE with access to Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG); Trans Asia Europe (TAE) fiber-optic line runs from Azerbaijan through the northern portion of Iran to Turkmenistan with expansion to Georgia and Azerbaijan; HF radio and microwave radio relay to Turkey, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Syria, Kuwait, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan; satellite earth stations \u2013 13 (9 Intelsat and 4 Inmarsat) (2007)\nApart from Iran-Kuwait submarine communications cable network, Iran is launching an optical fiber channel and a submarine communications cable in the Persian Gulf. The next program is to connect the country with global optical fiber networks from northern and northwestern borders.\nRadio and Television.\nSince 2015, Iran is domestically manufacturing DVB-T 6,000W digital transmitters.\nInternet.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1993 Iran became the second country in the Middle East to be connected to the Internet, and since then the government has made significant efforts to improve the nation's ICT infrastructure. Iran's national Internet connectivity infrastructure is based on two major networks: the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the public data network. The PSTN provides a connection for end-users to Internet service providers (ISPs) over mostly digital lines and supports modem-based connections. The Data Communication Company of Iran (DCI), a subsidiary of TCI, operates the public data network. Iran's external Internet links use the basic Internet protocol of TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol) via satellite exclusively. For data lines, copper, fiber, satellite and microwave are the available media, and popular services are high-speed Internet via digital subscriber lines (DSL), high-bandwidth lease lines and satellite. About 33 Iranian cities are connected directly by the Trans-Asia-Europe cable network, or \"silk road\", connecting China to Europe. According to the \"Statistical Center of Iran\", 13.5 million households (i.e. 55.5% of all Iranians) have access to the internet (2016). Of this number, 7 million households have access to fixed high-speed internet connection, and 10.7 million households have access to wireless high-speed internet. In 2016 64.8% of urban households and 36.1% of rural households had access to computers at their home. As of 2020, mobile broadband coverage had exceeded 91 percent in Iran.\nSince 2005 the Iranian government has been developing its \"National Information Network\" to tighten its control over content as well as increasing speed. The project, which is separate from the World Wide Web, will be completed by 2017. This network will be separated from the rest of the internet, specifically for domestic use. Creating such a network, similar to one used by North Korea would prevent unwanted information from outside of Iran getting into the closed system, such as with an intranet network. Myanmar and Cuba also use similar systems. Iran has announced that all government ministries and state bodies will be available through the secure \"national information network\" (NIN).\nThe current internet services will not be replaced by the National Information Network or \"Clean Internet\" as it is called. In order to protect the privacy of Iranian internet users, a number of non-governmental organizations are currently developing domestic search engines that people can use through the NIN.\nIranian officials have accused U.S.-based technology companies such as Google, Twitter and Microsoft of working in tandem with U.S. authorities to spy on Iranian online trends, search behavior, social networking sites and e-mail. These companies have denied those allegations despite NSA leaks. As of 2013, 90% of all of Internet traffic is being routed to hosts outside the country. Iran said it set a \"world record\" of 46% in online participation using NIN during the national census in 2016.\nMuch has been reported on the ways in which NIN aids the government with censorship and controls on the internet. Whilst to date, the existence of the NIN has not resulted in long-term disconnection from the global Internet, in the short-term it has been used by the authorities for this purpose. This was illustrated during the widespread deliberate disruptions to both mobile and networked Internet connections in the midst of nationwide protests in late 2017 and into early 2018. Research by the Campaign for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) identified that the authorities had ordered IXPs to intentionally interrupt international traffic while maintaining national connections hosted on the NIN.\nStrengthening and driving local users towards local platforms is central to the NIN strategy. This has included efforts to undermine net neutrality, by requiring domestic ISPs to zero-rate domestic platforms, in effect subsidising users\u2019 use of local Internet platforms. These domestic platforms are subject to the close oversight, influence and enforcement powers of the authorities. Pushing users to use these services strengthens the government's surveillance and monitoring capabilities and raises concerns for the protection of the right to privacy. These platforms are required to apply Iranian law, including content-based restrictions on content outlined in the Islamic Penal Code, the Press Laws and the Computer Crimes Law. Over-reliance on domestic platforms is therefore likely to have a detrimental effect on the diversity and pluralism of content available on these platforms.\n80 percent of modem imports are smuggled to Iran.\nInfrastructure.\nIran has developed (or is in the process of developing) IT/technology parks, infrastructures for local emails, instant messaging (such as \"TD Messenger\" produced by Tehran Data), domestic search engines (such as Yooz, Parsijoo or \"Gorgor.ir\"), auction website (e.g. \"Esam.ir\"), e-commerce (e.g. Digikala), e-government, distance education (e.g. Payame Noor University), social medias (e.g. Cloob or Aparat), a domestic version of the Linux operating system called \"Sharif Linux\", bespoke or open source software for web browsing, word processing, spreadsheet and database; accounting and various business/financial and industrial software (e.g. NOSA), security software (e.g. Padvish Antivirus or APA at Shiraz University), and video games.\nIran is also manufacturing key computer, internet and IT components, including a local data center, microprocessors (design only), PCBs, supercomputers, routers (experimental basis), computer monitors, printers, mobile phones, fiber optics and lasers.\nAs of 2020 there were 7 Internet exchange points built in some Iranian cities. 72 private data centers were connected to them.\nCyber-security.\nIran is among 5 countries with cyber warfare capabilities according to the Defense Tech institute (US military and security institute).\nInternet service provider|ISPs.\nThe leading Data Communication Company of Iran (DCI) which belongs to TCI (now privatized) and the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST) are two bodies that act as ISPs. As of 2008, the largest privately owned ISP was Parsnet, which serves only Tehran. The leading ISP with a provincial focus is Isfahan-based Irangate.net. The https:// was the first private ISP in Iran.\nDomain names with the \".ir\" suffix are assigned by the Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics (IPM). DCI maintains the network infrastructure, providing Internet access via the IRANPAK X.25 packet-switching network, which covers most major cities. DCI is the only ISP with a permit for supplying government agencies. DCI supplies both dial-up and leased lines to its users.\nBy the regulations of Iran, these ISPs should rely on TCI for their bandwidth. Previously serviced by TCI's Public Switch Telephone Network, the ISPs have been provided with modern data line capacity through a national IP-based network. With the completion of this new network, Internet services in Iran is expected to improve dramatically.\nSpeed and costs.\nIranian internet has an average speed of 2\u00a0Mbit/s, about one-tenth of the global average (2014). Hong Kong, the world leader, boasts an average of 72\u00a0Mbit/s; the United States ranks 31st, at about 21\u00a0Mbit/s. A 2\u00a0Mbit/s subscription costs $5 a month, daily traffic is charged at 60\u00a2/GB but traffic is free at night at up to 5\u00a0GB per night. Upload speeds are typically 40% of the download speed.People must pay four times price for download and upload using internet than national internet network.\nAccording speedtest.net in 2019, the average landline Internet speed in Iran is 12.84\u00a0Mbit/s and the country is ranked 104 among 130 audited countries. The global average speed of landline Internet services is 49.26\u00a0Mbit/s. Mobile Internet services is significantly better in Iran compared to landline services, with an average speed of 27.71\u00a0Mbit/s \u2014 4\u00a0Mbit/s higher than the global average. Iran is ranked 51.\nBroadband Internet access.\nAs of 2012, 11 private access providers (PAPs) and TCI compete for market share, offering ADSL2+, WiMAX, and other fixed wireless broadband services. Meanwhile, fixed broadband internet connections quadrupled between 2011 and 2015 to 8.3m lines. Iran's IP-based 'national data network' is being developed by Information Technology Company (ITC), which is also a TCI subsidiary. This network covers 210 Iranian cities and has 60,000 high-speed ports to meet the needs of its end users such as business and ISPs (2009). Some actions are being taken to build and optimize infrastructure for provision of broadband services in the next five years and the Regulatory has decided to grant the license of offering WiMAX services to some private companies based on auction and then the license for the 3rd mobile operator.\nCompanies that are under the PAP license:\nLandline ISP ranking in customer satisfaction (score out of 20, 2018 survey):\nShatel:17.55 \nAsiaTech:15.67 \nDatak:15.53 \nHiWeb:15.17 \nPars Online:14.64 \nSaba Net:14.31 \nPishgaman:13.3 \nHelmaGostar:12.94 \nTCI:10.91\nUsage.\nFull Internet service is available in all major cities and it is very rapidly increasing. Many small towns and even some villages now have full Internet access. The government aims to provide 10% of government and commercial services via the Internet by end-2008 and to equip every school with computers and Internet connections by the same date. The Internet has become an expanding means to accessing information and self-expression among the younger population. Iran is also the world's fourth largest country of bloggers with approx. 60,000 Persian blogs although Internet censorship in Iran is amongst the most restrictive and sophisticated in the world. As of 2014, 67.4 percent of Iranian young people (between the ages of 15 and 29) use the internet. 69.3% of Iranian young people reported using anti-internet filtering software to be able to surf through blocked websites. Three-fifths of Iranians use Facebook. Iranians spend an average of nine hours on social media websites every day. according of the government of Iran, the first stage of smart filtering for the internet has been successful and the second stage has been launched in 2015. As of 2016, 40 percent of content used by Iranian Internet citizens are produced in the country.\nElectronic commerce.\nIran's electronic commerce was 10,000 billion rials ($1 billion) in March 2009 and growing 60% annually. Online-sales reached $300,000 per day in 2014 with more than 20,000 active online stores with electronics being the most popular sale product. In 2007, Tetra-Tech IT Company announced that using Visa and Mastercard is now possible for online sales and in Iranian e-card terminals at shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies for Iranians and foreign tourists. Saman Bank was the first bank to introduce online banking services in Iran. Since, it has been at the forefront of expansion and enhancement of electronic banking. In 2010, a state-linked technology group (the Rouyesh Technical Centre) established the country's first online supermarket.\nIn 2015, the dollar value of e-commerce reached $17.4 billion. With the new \"national information network\", Internet speed has increased drastically. Iran's penetration rate of the internet stands at 82.12% (2016), with 19 million people using the internet on their mobile phones. As of 2016, 600 cities in Iran had access to 3G networks and 200 cities had access to 4G Internet. The rate of mobile phone penetration in Iran stands at 94.46%.\nIran is presently implementing a barcode system across the country in order to facilitate e-commerce and tax collection. The executive state organizations, which are the largest buyers of goods in the country, cannot buy and use goods that do not have the \"Irancode\".\nIn 2004 the Majlis adopted the Electronic Commerce Law:\nThe Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (2010\u201315) has set the target of conducting electronically:\nSoftware development.\nAccording to the \"Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries\" (EJISDC), the information and communications technology (ICT) sector had a 1.1\u20131.3% share of GDP in 2002. About 150,000 people are employed in the ICT sector, including around 20,000 in the software industry. There were 1,200 registered information technology (IT) companies in 2002, 200 of which were involved in software development. Software exports stood around $50 million in 2008 and $400 million in 2014.\nIran imports a large part of its software. According to the EJISDC, around 95% of the output of the domestic industry is bespoke development (including translation/adaptation from foreign source) \u2014as opposed to product work\u2014meaning export possibilities are low.\nDomestic firms involved in software production include Sena Soft, Dadeh-Pardazi, Iran Argham, Kafa System Information Network, Iran System and Puya. IDRO's subsidiaries \"Magfa\" (Information Technology Development Center) and Iran Info-Tech Development Co. are also leading players in this sector. The largest private computer software producer in Iran is Hamkaran Systems with 7000 customers.\nIran's National Foundation for Computer Games unveiled the country's first online video game in 2010, capable of supporting up to 5,000 users at the same time.\nAlthough there are no established clusters in Tehran, a major facility, the Tehran Software and Information Technology Park, is planned. \"International Development Ireland\" was selected as the consultant for the project in mid-2004. There are also plans for a technology park in the free-trade zone on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, which already contains the necessary technological infrastructure.\nThe government's drive to automate manual processes is expected to account for about 70% of demand for software development, but there are also some 15,000 private-sector factories that have software needs. Foreign investment in the sector is minimal, although some links are being developed with the Indian software industry. Poor intellectual property protection in Iran has also hindered the development of Iranian software companies causing a lack of foreign direct investment in this sector.\nPopular apps.\nAs of 2019, main categories are tools with 12,024 apps published in this group, followed by health and sports (4,368), travel and transportation (2,578), social media (2,227) and shopping (2,072). The most popular Android apps as measured by Cafe Bazaar downloads are:\nFinancial services:\nAsan Pardakht with 9 million downloads.\nMofid Securities\nNobitex\nShopping: \nDivar has some 17 million people downloaded. \nSheypoor has been downloaded over 5 million times.\nDigikala had 3 million hits.\nTransportation:\nSnapp (taxi riding app) has been downloaded 7 million times.\nTap30 with 2 million downloads.\nSocial Media Platforms, Messengers:\nInstagram with 23 million downloads.\nTelegram (fork) with 13 million users.\nTechnology start-ups.\nIran is an innovative country with a population of approximately 80 million and 120% mobile penetration. Yet the technology \"start-up economy\" represents less than 1% of Iran's GDP. Since 2012, Iran's startup ecosystem has flourished. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", sanctions are also helping spur entrepreneurship in Iran by protecting them from outside competition. Iran has three seed accelerators already (e.g. https:// and http://), a few VCs (e.g. https:// and https://) and 170 incubators (e.g. MAPS). eCommerce is growing at a rapid speed. The advent of higher Internet speed marks the beginning of a new era for entrepreneurs. Iran Entrepreneurship Association (IEA) is the flagship NGO in the \"entrepreneurship revolution\" in Iran. TechRasa is the leading online media devoted to the coverage of technology startups. As of 2015, there are almost 180 technology startups companies in Iran, many of them backed by state-run universities (this number does not include 3,000 (non-IT) knowledge based companies also active in Iran). As of 2016, fifty fintech firms are operating in Iran.\nParsijoo and Yooz are 2 domestic search engines with 600,000 and 100,000 hits per day and 120,000 and 60,000 searches per day respectively. Adro is a leading Adtech/Ad exchange start-up (In 2016, publishers had 365 billion impressions through Iranian Ad networks). Cafe Bazaar, with 20 million visits weekly and a market share of 85%, has 25,000 downloadable Iranian and international apps for gaming, social media, messaging and other uses. Iranians developed 70 thousand mobile apps in less than 2 years (2016).\nCloob, the Iranian version of Facebook, has 2.5 million users. Soroush is the messaging application replacing Telegram. Aparat (Owned by \"Saba Idea Technology Co\"), with a staff of 65, is an Iranian video-sharing platform similar to YouTube, has a following of 5 millions a day and has 22,000 minutes of video uploaded daily. Takhfifan (with 100 employees) and Netbarg are two group buying portals. eSam and Saddarsad are similar to eBay. Digikala, an e-commerce platform like Amazon.com with a daily average income of $400,000, ships more than 4,000 orders each day. With a staff of 900 and about 850,000 visitors every day, Digikala was estimated to be worth $150 million in 2014 ($500 million according to the company in 2015, over $1 billion in 2018). As of 2015, 85\u201390% of Iran's e-commerce takes place on Digikala (which has its own courier system throughout Iran). Albasko is another well-known e-commerce platform. Fidibo is the Iranian equivalent of Kindle. With 40,000 orders per month, Maman-Paz is a food delivery service that connects hungry workers with housewives selling home-cooked meals. Its restaurant-based counterpart is ZoodFood. ShopFa, with 2000 active online stores in 2012, is the local version of Shopify. ZarinPal (owned by \"SamanSystems\"), with 2 million transactions processed in 2012, is the Iranian alternative to PayPal. As of 2015, Taskulu, a task management platform, had over 8000 users from 120 different countries. Hamijoo is a crowdfunding platform. AnjamMidam is an online marketplace for freelance services modeled after Fiverr. Navaak is modeled after Spotify, the online music streaming company. AloPeyk is a delivery service company. Pak Charkh is a bike-sharing app like Germany's Nextbike.\nSince 2015, many foreign companies are beginning to explore ways to start technology companies in Iran (such as Germany's Rocket Internet) or allow their services to become available in the country (such as United States' Google). For example, \"Iran Internet Group\", a joint venture between South African telecom company MTN and Rocket Internet has been launching Iranian versions of eBay (Mozando), Amazon (Bamilo), and Uber (Snapp/previously known as \"Taxi Yaab\"). Snapp has over 600,000 drivers across Iran and has a valuation potential of $1 billion ($1.4\u20131.7 billion according to the company in 2018). It carries over 1 million passengers-a-day. Many returning Iranian citizens abroad are also participating in this trend (Iranian Americans in particular).\nConsumer electronics.\nThe Middle East consumer electronics and technology sector amounts to a $37 billion high (2008), according to a study by the Dubai-based subsidiary of GfK-MEMRB Marketing Services.\nThe study also predicts that the market will continue riding the wave of growth to hit $39\u2013$40 billion in 2009. Mobile and smartphones make up 41 percent of the entire digital consumer market with sales of $10 billion expected in 2008. It's followed by desktop and notebook computers at $5 billion and LCD televisions at $4 billion. The study also reveals the market structure by channel where, in Iran and the UAE, independent retailers still lead with 60-percent share in volume for product categories such as digital cameras, LCD televisions and mobile phones. However, large retailers like Plug-Ins, Emax and Sharaf DG are also making their presence felt by capturing the remaining 40 percent. The digital consumer technology sector is expected to see retail sales in excess of $24 billion by the end of 2008.\nIran\u2019s domestic consumer electronic market, defined as including computing devices, mobile handsets and video audio and gaming products, was estimated at $7.3 billion in 2008 ($8.2 billion in 2010), with 47% market share for computer hardware, 28% Audio/Video and 25% mobile phone (with growing demand for PDAs, smartphones and 3G handsets). Business Monitor International (BMI) forecasts that Iran\u2019s demands for domestic consumer electronic devices will reach $10 billion by 2013 and $16 billion by 2016.\nHeld once a year, \"ELECOMP\" is the greatest commercial event in Iran\u2019s market of electronics and computer products and services.\nComputers.\nIran is manufacturing some computer components under license from international companies, predominantly in the area of monitors. Eight Iranian companies are manufacturing monitors under licence of LG, Samsung, Hyundai, Benq, Tatung and CTX. Motherboard, keyboard, mouse, computer case, power supply, CPU, hard drive and printers are other components that are now manufactured locally. Personal computer (PC) ownership in Iran stood at 7.3m in 2005, or 10.5 PCs per 100 people.\nAmong the leading domestic telecoms equipment manufacturers is the Iran Telephone Manufacturing Company (ITMC), which has licensing agreements with Siemens and Alcatel-Lucent of France. ITMC is owned by TCI (45%), Industry Bank (35%) and Siemens (20%).\nOther manufacturers include Iran Communications Industries Incorporated and Parstel\u2014which produces under licence from Daewoo Corporation, a South Korean firm. IDRO's Iran Info-Tech Development Co. is producing computers under the brand name \"SAHAND\". Overall, ICT hardware sales were estimated to total US$700m a year in 2008.\nMinistry of Information and Communication Technology.\nThe main functions of the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology are laying out and implementing policies pertaining to post and communications in Iran. The Ministry is also in charge of issuing import licenses for certain communication equipment and parts thereof. This ministry was originally named \"Ministry of Post, Telegraph &amp; Telephone\".\nPrivatization.\nBased on Note C of the general policies of the constitution's Article 44, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology announced that it will float the shares of affiliated companies such as Telecommunications Company in the stock market.\nUnder the general policies of Article 44, telecom companies are categorized in four groups as follows:\nTCI's Infrastructure Telecom Company will be detached from it and it would continue its activities as a part of the ICT Ministry. 33 companies in the telecom sector are to be privatized by September 2007. This happened simultaneously with the launch of MTN Irancell, a private second carrier with foreign ownership. The privatization and introduction of a second operator has created a significantly more competitive environment which has led to significant cost reductions for mobile owners and service benefits.\n2009 \u2013 IPO.\nIn 2009, 51% of the shares of TCI was sold to Mobin Trust Consortium, a consortium which some media claimed it was affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for the sum of $7.8 billion.\nOther ICP/ISP IPOs.\nIn late 2011, Iranian ICP/ISP Afranet (Symbol in Tehran Stock Exchange: AFRZ1) went public. As of 2012, there is no other ICP/ISP companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The country's major port of entry is Bandar-Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz. After arriving in Iran, imported goods are distributed throughout the country by trucks and freight trains. The Tehran\u2013Bandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to the railroad system of Central Asia via Tehran and Mashhad. Other major ports include Bandar e-Anzali and Bandar e-Torkeman on the Caspian Sea and Khorramshahr and Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni on the Persian Gulf.\nDozens of cities have airports that serve passenger and cargo planes. Iran Air, the national airline, was founded in 1962 and operates domestic and international flights.\nTransport in Iran is inexpensive because of the government's subsidization of the price of gasoline. The downside is a huge draw on government coffers, economic inefficiency because of highly wasteful consumption patterns, contraband with neighboring countries and air pollution.\nMinistry of Road and Transportation.\nThe Ministry of Roads and Transportation is in charge of studying and deciding pricing policy of the transportation; as well as issuing licenses for the establishment of transportation firms. In addition, the Ministry is in charge of implementing comprehensive and integrated transportation policies in Iran. As of 2016, plans for foreign direct investment in the transport sector include over 5,600\u00a0km of highways, 745\u00a0km of freeways, and close to 3,000\u00a0km of main roads. These projects and others are worth $25 billion (not including aircraft purchases worth another $50 billion). Iran says it needs more than $40 billion to complete 258 major unfinished transportation projects (2016).\nRailways.\nElectrified railway is 146\u00a0km from Tabriz to Jolfa and the tender for electrification of Tehran\u2013Mashhad has been finished according to Railway electrification in Iran.\nNote: Broad-gauge track is employed at the borders with Azerbaijan Republic and Turkmenistan which have broad gauge rail systems; 41\u00a0km of the standard gauge, electrified track is in suburban service at Tehran (2007).\nThe majority of transport in Iran is road-based. The government plans to transport 3.5% of the passenger volume and 8.5% of the freight volume by rail. Extensive electrification is planned. According to the Ministry of R&amp;T,The railway network expands by about 500\u00a0km per year.\nRailway links with adjacent countries.\nIn December 2014, a rail line from Iran opened to Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. The opening of the line marks the first direct rail link between Iran, Kazakhstan and China and upon completion direct rail transport between China and Europe (while avoiding Russia) will be possible.\nRapid transit.\nTehran Metro.\nThe Tehran Metro is a rapid transit system in Tehran carrying 5 million passengers a day and consisting of seven lines that run a total of 200 kilometres (~120\u00a0mi) with two further lines under construction. The metro will have a final length of 430 kilometres (270\u00a0mi) once all nine lines are constructed by 2028. Metro services run from 5:30 to 23:00 throughout the city and the ticket price is 3,000-8,000 IRR ($0.10-$0.30 USD) and is based on distance of the trip.\nTehran Bus Rapid Transit.\nThe Tehran Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a rapid transit system serving Tehran which was officially inaugurated in 2008. The BRT has a network of over 150 kilometres, transporting 1.8 million passengers on a daily basis. The BRT has a total of ten lines with a further expansion planned to bring the total length to 300 kilometres. The price of Tehran's BRT is somewhere between 4,000IRR to 9,500IRR ($0.15 to $0.35 USD).\nMashhad Urban Railway.\nThe Mashhad Urban Railway is urban rail line in Mashhad, construction on line one began in 1999 and was opened on 24 April 2011. Line two has also been opened recently and finished construction. Four other lines are either being constructed or are planned to be. Mashhad Urban Railway operates its single line from 6:30 to 21:30 daily. It has a daily ridership of 130,000 passengers and has a total length of 24 kilometres (14.9\u00a0mi).\nIsfahan Metro.\nThe Isfahan Metro construction of line one commenced in 2001 and was finally opened to the public on 15 October 2015. Line one has a total length of 11 kilometres. The city is planning a second East to West line.\nShiraz Metro.\nThe Shiraz Metro is a rapid transit system in Shiraz. Line one was officially inaugurated on 11 October 2014 after being in construction since 2011; the single line has a length of 10.5 kilometres (6.5\u00a0mi) and stops at six stations. Line 2 is currently under construction and has a length of 15 kilometres (9.3\u00a0mi). The metro currently has a daily ridership of 500 000 passengers with 27 trains in operation.\nTabriz Metro.\nThe Tabriz Metro is a metro system serving the city of Tabriz. The first line was opened on 28 August 2015 with a 7-kilometre length and six stations. There is also a regional commuter line planned to the city of Sahand. Line one runs Northwest from El Goli Station to Noor Station.\nTotal Length.\nThe total route length of the various Metros is 253\u00a0km.\nRoadways and automobiles.\nIn 2011 the country had of roads, of which 73% were paved. In 2008 there were nearly 100 passenger cars for every 1,000 inhabitants.\n*Paved: 125,908\u00a0km (includes 1,429\u00a0km of expressways)\n*Unpaved: 47,019 km\nNote: There were more than 11 million vehicles in Iran by 2010 mostly manufactured or assembled locally. As of 2015, 34,000\u00a0km of roads provided essential corridors of transportation, while 45,000\u00a0km of major roads and 100,000\u00a0km of roads connecting villages and rural areas have seen no maintenance and upkeep practices (worth a total of $57 billion). As of 2020, bicycles were used for less than 1% of urban trips.\nRoad accidents.\nIran ranks 23rd worldwide in traffic deaths per 100,000 population per year, with a rate of 24.3, half the rate of the worst country, Eritrea. Iran ranks first worldwide in terms of having the largest number of road accidents with 38,000 deaths and injuries per year. Other sources place the total number of fatalities at 100,000 over the past six years or 20,000 per year on average (2008).\nTransport officials say 46.8% of car accidents take place in cities, 21.5% outside, 19.5% on rural routes, 4.2% on urban highways and 4.2% on suburban highways. Pedestrians account for 45% of traffic deaths in Tehran.\nThe high death tolls in car accidents are blamed on high speed, unsafe vehicles, widespread disregard of traffic laws and inadequate emergency services.\nMotorcycles account for 50% of sound pollution in Tehran and 40-45% of accidents.\nWaterways.\nThere are no major rivers in Iran. Just Karun is navigable which \"shallow-draft boats can negotiate from Khorramshahr to Ahvaz, a distance of about 180 km (110 mi)\". The Shatt al-Arab is usually navigable by maritime traffic for about 130\u00a0km; channel has been dredged to 3\u00a0m and is in use.\nPorts and harbours.\nThe capacity of container loading and unloading in the country's ports is currently at 4.4 million which will increase to 7 million by the end of 2015. Port capacity will increase to 200 million tons in 2015 from 150 million tons in 2010.\nAll Iranian ports are supervised by the 'PMO', i.e. the 'Port &amp; Maritime Organization', which is part of the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development.\nBandar Abbas, with capacity of 2.5 million TEU in 2010 and 3.3 million TEU in 2016, is in southern-central Iran and handles 90% of the country's container throughput. Bandar Abbas is run by the \"Shaheed Rajaee\" Port Authority.\nChabahar Port, the southernmost Iranian port, on the Gulf of Oman, a couple dozen kilometers from the Iran - Pakistan border, is being recently expanded and developed partly with Indian public funding, and in connection with the INSTC North-South overland transportation corridor linking Iran with Afghanistan, the Caucasus countries, Turkey and Russia.\nMerchant marine.\nOver the next two decades, Iran would need 500 new ships, including 120 oil tankers, 40 liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers and over 300 commercial vessels.\nAirports and airlines.\nIran handles about 50 million passengers annually (2016). Iran's airports are improving their international connections, and Arak Airport in Markazi province has recently begun to operate international flights, making a total of five such airports in the country, in addition to ten local airports. In May 2007 international flights into the capital, Tehran, were moved to the Imam Khomeini International Airport (IKIA), just outside the city because of capacity constraints at the existing central Mehrabad Airport.\nNational airline:\nAirports \u2013 with paved runways.\n\"Total:\"\n140 (2013)\n\"over 3,047\u00a0m:\" 42\n\"2,438 to 3,047\u00a0m:\" 29\n\"1,524 to 2,437\u00a0m:\" 26\n\"914 to 1,523\u00a0m:\" 36\n\"under 914\u00a0m:\" 7 (2013)\nAirports \u2013 with unpaved runways.\n\"Total:\" 179 (2013)\n\"over 3,047\u00a0m:\" 1\n\"1,524 to 2,437\u00a0m:\" 2\n\"914 to 1,523\u00a0m:\" 135\n\"under 914\u00a0m:\" 32 (2013)\nHeliports.\nTotal: 26 (2013)\nTransit statistics.\nTRACECA.\nIn September 2009, Iran formally joined the Transport Corridor Europe \u2013 Caucasus \u2013 Asia (TRACECA) programme, also known as the \"new Silk Road.\" TRACECA was founded in 1998 with the aim of promoting economic relations, trade and transport communications between Europe, the Caucasus and Asia. This programme consists of the EU and 14 member states (including Iran) from Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Iran's strategic location means that it is a key transport corridor between Europe and Central Asia.\nIn August 2010, Iran declared that it \"did not sign on to TRACECA project\" and said it has been fostering improved transport links through a series of bilateral agreements with neighboring states instead. According to Iran's first Vice-President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi \"If all the potential of the country's transit sector is tapped, it can bring in as much revenues as [the] oil [industry]\". He also announced that Iran will join China and Europe by rail in the near future.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64709", "revid": "32005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64709", "title": "Foreign relations of Iran", "text": " \nGeography is an important factor in informing Iran's foreign policy. Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the newly formed Islamic Republic, under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini, dramatically reversed the pro-American foreign policy of the last Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Since the country's policies then oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour to eliminate non-Muslim Western influences while promoting the Islamic revolution abroad, and pragmatism, which would advance economic development and normalization of relations, bilateral dealings can be confused and contradictory.\nAccording to data published by RepTrak, Iran is the world's second least internationally reputable country, just ahead of Iraq, and has held that position for the three consecutive years of 2016, 2017, and 2018. Islamism and nuclear proliferation are recurring issues with Iran's foreign relations. In a series of international polls by Pew Research in 2012, only one country (Pakistan) had the majority of its population supporting Iran's right to acquire nuclear arms; every other population polled overwhelmingly rejected a nuclear-armed Iran (90\u201395% opposed in the polled European, North American, and South American countries), and majorities in most of them were in favor of military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran from materializing. Additionally, the majority of Americans, Brazilians, Japanese, Mexicans, Egyptians, Germans, Britons, French, Italians, Spaniards, and Poles (among other national groups) had majority support for \"tougher sanctions\" on Iran, while majorities in China, Russia, and Turkey opposed tougher sanctions.\nBackground.\nIranians have traditionally been highly sensitive to foreign interference in their country, pointing to such events as the Russian conquest of northern parts of the country in the course of the 19th century, the tobacco concession, the British and Russian occupations of the First and Second World Wars, and the CIA plot to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq. This suspicion manifests itself in attitudes that many foreigners might find incomprehensible, such as the \"fairly common\" belief that the Iranian Revolution was actually the work of a conspiracy between Iran's Shi'a clergy and the British government. This may have been a result of the anti-Shah bias in BBC Radio's influential Persian broadcasts into Iran: a BBC report of 23 March 2009 explains that many in Iran saw the broadcaster and the government as one, and interpreted the bias for Khomeini as evidence of weakening British government support for the Shah. It is entirely plausible that the BBC did indeed help hasten revolutionary events.\nRevolutionary period under Khomeini.\nUnder Khomeini's government, Iran's foreign policy often emphasized the elimination of foreign influence and the spread of Islamic revolution over state-to-state relations or the furtherance of trade. In Khomeini's own words:\nWe shall export our revolution to the whole world. Until the cry \"There is no God but Allah\" resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.\nThe Islamic Republic's effort to spread the revolution is considered to have begun in earnest in March 1982, when 380 men from more than 25 Arab and Islamic nations met at the former Tehran Hilton Hotel for a \"seminar\" on the \"ideal Islamic government\" and, less academically, the launch of a large-scale offensive to cleanse the Islamic world of the satanic Western and Communist influences that were seen to be hindering the Islamic world's progress. The gathering of militants, primarily Shi'a but including some Sunnis, \"with various religious and revolutionary credentials\", was hosted by the Association of Militant Clerics and the Pasdaran Islamic Revolutionary Guards. The nerve centre of the revolutionary crusade, operational since shortly after the 1979 revolution, was located in downtown Tehran and known to outsiders as the \"Taleghani Centre\". Here the groundwork for the gathering was prepared: the establishment of Arab cadres, recruited or imported from surrounding countries to spread the revolution, and provision of headquarters for such groups as the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the Iraqi Shi'a movement, and Philippine Moro, Kuwaiti, Saudi, North African and Lebanese militant clerics.\nThese groups came under the umbrella of the \"Council for the Islamic Revolution\", which was supervised by Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the designated heir of Ayatollah Khomeini. Most of the council's members were clerics, but they also reportedly included advisors from the Syrian and Libyan intelligence agencies. The council apparently received more than $1\u00a0billion annually in contributions from the faithful in other countries and in funds allocated by the Iranian government.\nIts strategy was two-pronged: armed struggle against what were perceived as Western imperialism and its agents; and an internal purifying process to free Islamic territory and Muslim minds of non-Islamic cultural, intellectual and spiritual influences, by providing justice, services, resources to the \"mustazafin\" (weak) masses of the Muslim world. These attempts to spread its Islamic revolution strained the country's relations with many of its Arab neighbours, and the extrajudicial execution of Iranian dissidents in Europe unnerved European nations, particularly France and Germany. For example, the Islamic Republic expressed its opinion of Egypt's secular government by naming a street in Tehran after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's killer, Khalid al-Istanbuli. At this time Iran found itself very isolated, but this was a secondary consideration to the spread of revolutionary ideals across the Persian Gulf and confrontation with the US (or \"Great Satan\") in the 1979-1981 hostage crisis.\nRevolutionary influence and regional interventions.\nArab and other Muslim volunteers who came to Iran were trained in camps run by the Revolutionary Guards. There were three primary bases in Tehran, and others in Ahvaz, Isfahan, Qom, Shiraz, and Mashhad, and a further facility, converted in 1984, near the southern naval base at Bushire.\nIn 1981 Iran supported an attempt to overthrow the Bahraini government, in 1983 expressed political support for Shi'ites who bombed Western embassies in Kuwait, and in 1987 Iranian pilgrims rioted at poor living conditions and treatment during the Hajj (pilgrimage) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and were consequently massacred. Nations with strong fundamentalist movements, such as Egypt and Algeria, also began to mistrust Iran. With the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Iran was thought to be supporting the creation of the Hizballah organization. Furthermore, Iran went on to oppose the Arab\u2013Israeli peace process, because it saw Israel as an illegal country.\nIran\u2013Iraq War.\nIranian relations with Iraq have never been good. They took a turn for the worse in 1980 when Iraq invaded Iran. The stated reason for Iraq's invasion was the contested sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway (\"Arvand Rud\" in Persian). Other unstated reasons were probably more significant: Iran and Iraq had a history of interference in each other's affairs by supporting separatist movements, although this interference had ceased since the Algiers Agreement.\nIran demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iranian territory and the return to the \"status quo ante\" for the Shatt al-Arab, as established under the Algiers Agreement. This period saw Iran become even more isolated, with virtually no allies. Exhausted by the war, Iran signed UN Security Council Resolution 598 in July 1988, after the United States and Germany began supplying Iraq with chemical weapons. The ceasefire resulting from the UN resolution was implemented on 20 August 1988. Neither nation had made any real gains in the war, which left one million dead and had a dramatic effect on the country's foreign policy. From this point on, the Islamic Republic recognized that it had no choice but to moderate its radical approach and rationalize its objectives. This was the beginning of what Anoushiravan Ehteshami calls the \"reorientation phase\" of Iranian foreign policy.\nPragmatism.\nLike other revolutionary states, practical considerations have sometimes led the Islamic Republic to inconsistency and subordination of such ideological concerns as pan-Islamic solidarity. One observer, Graham Fuller, has called the Islamic Republic \"stunningly silent\"\nabout [Muslim] Chechens in [non-Muslim] Russia, or Uyghurs in China, simply because the Iranian state has important strategic ties with both China and Russia that need to be preserved in the state interest. Iran has astonishingly even supported Christian Armenia in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War against Shi'ite Azerbaijan and has been careful not to lend too much support to Islamic Tajiks in Tajikistan, where the language is basically a dialect of Persian.\nKhamenei's leadership.\nPost-war foreign policy and regional influence.\nSince the end of the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Iran's new foreign policy has had a dramatic effect on its global standing. Relations with the European Union have dramatically improved, to the point where Iran is a major oil exporter and a trading partner with such countries as Italy, France, and Germany. China and Pakistan have also emerged as friends of Iran; these three countries face similar challenges in the global economy as they industrialize, and consequently find themselves aligned on a number of issues.\nIran maintains regular diplomatic and commercial relations with Russia and the former Soviet Republics. Both Iran and Russia believe they have important national interests at stake in developments in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus, particularly concerning energy resources from the Caspian Sea. The Islamic Republic of Iran accords priority to its relations with the other states in the region and with the rest of the Islamic world. This includes a strong commitment to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Non-Aligned Movement. Relations with the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), especially with Saudi Arabia, are characterized by rivalry and hostility. An unresolved territorial dispute with the United Arab Emirates concerning three islands in the Persian Gulf continues to mar its relations with these states. Iran has close relations with Kuwait.\nIsolation, sanctions, and global ambitions.\nIran seeks new allies around the world due to its increasing political and economic isolation in the international community. This isolation is evident in the various economic sanctions and the EU oil embargo that have been implemented in response to questions that have been raised over the Iranian nuclear program.\nTehran supports the Interim Governing Council in Iraq, but it strongly advocates a prompt and full transfer of state authority to the Iraqi people. Iran hopes for stabilization in Afghanistan and supports the reconstruction effort so that the Afghan refugees in Iran (which number approximately 2.5\u00a0million.) can return to their homeland and the flow of drugs from Afghanistan can be stemmed. Iran is also pursuing a policy of stabilization and cooperation with the countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, whereby it is seeking to capitalise on its central location to establish itself as the political and economic hub of the region.\nOn the international scene, it has been argued by some that Iran has become, or will become in the near future, a superpower due to its ability to influence international events. Others, such as Robert Baer, have argued that Iran is already an energy superpower and is on its way to becoming an empire. Flynt Leverett calls Iran a rising power that might well become a nuclear power in coming years\u2014if the US does not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear technology, as part of a grand bargain under which Iran would cease its nuclear activities in exchange for a guarantee of its borders by the US.\nIran-Israel war.\nIsrael launched surprise attacks on key military and nuclear facilities in Iran on 13 June 2025, which started the Iran\u2013Israel war. Israeli air and ground forces assassinated some of Iran's prominent military leaders, nuclear scientists, and politicians. and damaged or destroyed Iran's air defenses and some of its nuclear and military facilities. Iran retaliated with waves of missile and drone strikes against Israeli cities and military sites. The United States, which defended Israel against Iranian missiles and drones, took offensive action on the ninth day of the war by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar.\nEuropean powers, especially France, proposed a diplomatic deal offering Iran limited sanctions relief and recognition of peaceful nuclear rights in exchange for halting uranium enrichment and cutting support to regional militias. Meanwhile, Russia and China supported Iran politically, criticizing Israeli aggression, but avoided direct involvement. Gulf states like Qatar and Oman acted as neutral intermediaries, facilitating indirect communication between Iran, the U.S., and Israel. G7 foreign ministers, meeting shortly afterward in The Hague on June 25, reinforced the message by urging Iran to resume cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and return to nuclear negotiations. These combined efforts led to a fragile ceasefire on June 24. Khamenei's isolation during the war, with access restricted to his closest aides, coincided with diplomatic efforts in Geneva, which Arab officials said were complicated by him being difficult to reach.\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs.\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran is selected by the President of Iran.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Iran maintains diplomatic relations with:\nBilateral relations.\nAfrica.\nIn 2009, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said that if Iran and Africa works together, both can largely meet each other\u2019s interest. Some signs of disillusionment began to emerge when 20 African nations threatened to close their embassies in Tehran following what they saw as Ahmadinejad's failure to live up to the promises he made during his trips to Africa. The Iranian government was not deterred by the misadventures, and some think it considers African countries strategically necessary to enable it to receive international support for its much criticized nuclear program.\nAmericas.\nTrade between Iran and Brazil quadrupled between 2002 and 2007, and it will further increase as much as fivefold, from $2 billion to $10 billion annually. In addition to Brazil, Iran has signed dozens of economic agreements with Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, Iran and Venezuela have agreed to invest $350 million in building a deepwater seaport off the Caribbean coast, in addition to a cross-country system of pipelines, rails and highways. Iranian firms are also planning to build two cement factories in Bolivia. Other developments include the agreement reached with Ecuador to build a cement factory as well as several other industrial cooperation MoUs (2008). In the four years after Ahmadinejad ascended to the Iranian presidency in 2005, Iran opened six new embassies in Latin America. The new embassies are located in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Uruguay - in addition to the five already in operation in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela.\nInternational organization participation.\nIran is the member of the following organizations: ALBA (observer), BRICS, Colombo Plan, UNESCAP, ECO, FAO, GECF, G-15, G-24, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICC, ICAO, IDA, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFC, IFAD, IHO, ILO, IMO, IMSO, IMF, IOC, IOM, ISO, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, ITU, Interpol, IDB, NAM, OPEC, OPCW, OIC, PCA, SCO, SAARC (observer), UNESCO, UNCTAD, UNIDO, UNODC, United Nations, UPU, WCO WFTU, WHO, WMO, WTO (observer).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64710", "revid": "47584370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64710", "title": "Modest Mussorgsky", "text": "Russian composer (1839\u20131881)\nModest Petrovich Mussorgsky (; ; ; 21 March\u00a0[O.S. 9 March]\u00a01839 \u2013 28 March\u00a0[O.S. 16 March]\u00a01881) was a Russian composer, one of the group known as \"The Five.\" He was an innovator of Russian music in the Romantic period and strove to achieve a uniquely Russian musical identity, often in deliberate defiance of the established conventions of Western music.\nMany of Mussorgsky's works were inspired by Russian history, Russian folklore, and other national themes. Such works include the opera \"Boris Godunov\", the orchestral tone poem \"Night on Bald Mountain\" and the piano suite \"Pictures at an Exhibition\".\nFor many years, Mussorgsky's works were mainly known in versions revised or completed by other composers. Many of his most important compositions have posthumously come into their own in their original forms, and some of the original scores are now also available.\nName.\nThe spelling and pronunciation of the composer's name have caused some confusion.\nThe family name derives from a 15th- or 16th-century ancestor, Roman Vasilyevich Monastyryov, who appears in the Velvet Book, the 17th-century genealogy of Russian boyars. Roman Vasilyevich bore the nickname \"Musorga\" (from , meaning \"music maker\"), and was the grandfather of the first Mussorgsky. The composer could trace his lineage to Rurik, the legendary ninth-century prince of Novgorod and founder of the Russian monarchy.\nIn Mussorgsky family documents, the spelling of the name varies: \"Musarskiy\", \"Muserskiy\", \"Muserskoy\", \"Musirskoy\", \"Musorskiy\", and \"Musurskiy\". The baptismal record gives the composer's name as \"Muserskiy\".\nIn early (up to 1858) letters to Mily Balakirev, the composer signed his name \"Musorskiy\" (). The \"g\" made its first appearance in a letter to Balakirev in 1863. Mussorgsky used this new spelling (, \"Musorgskiy\") to the end of his life, but occasionally reverted to the earlier \"Musorskiy\". The addition of the \"g\" to the name was likely initiated by the composer's elder brother Filaret to obscure the resemblance of the name's root to an unsavory Russian word:\n\"\u043c\u0443\u0441o\u0440\" (m\u00fasor) \u2014 \"n. m.\" debris, rubbish, refuse\nMussorgsky apparently did not take the new spelling seriously and played on the \"rubbish\" connection in letters to Vladimir Stasov and to Stasov's family, routinely signing his name \"Musoryanin\", roughly \"garbage-dweller\" (compare \"dvoryanin\": \"nobleman\").\nThe first syllable of the name originally received the stress (i.e., M\u00daS-\u0259r-skiy), and does so to this day in Russia, including the composer's home district. The mutability of the second-syllable vowel in the versions of the name mentioned above gives evidence that this syllable did not receive the stress.\nThe addition of the \"g\" and the accompanying shift in stress to the second syllable (i.e., Mu-S\u00d3RK-skiy), sometimes described as a Polish variant, was supported by Filaret Mussorgsky's descendants until his line ended in the 20th century. Their example was followed by many influential Russians, such as Fyodor Shalyapin, Nikolay Golovanov, and Tikhon Khrennikov, who, perhaps dismayed that the great composer's name was \"reminiscent of garbage\", supported the second-syllable stress that has also become entrenched in the West.\nThe Western convention of doubling the first \"s\", which is not observed in scholarly literature (e.g., \"The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\"), likely arose because in many Western European languages a single intervocalic /s/ often becomes voiced to /z/ (as in \"music\"), unlike in Slavic languages where the intervocalic /s/ is always unvoiced. Doubling the consonant thus reinforces its voiceless sibilant /s/ sound.\n\"Modest\" is the Russian form of the name \"Modestus\" which means \"moderate\" or \"restrained\" in Late Latin. He was called \"Modinka\" (), diminutive form with the stressed O, by his close friends and relatives.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nMussorgsky was born in Karevo, Toropets Uyezd, Pskov Governorate, Russian Empire, south of Saint Petersburg. His wealthy and land-owning family, the noble family of Mussorgsky, is reputedly descended from Rurik, through the sovereign princes of Smolensk. His mother, Julia Chirikova, was the daughter of a comparatively non-rich nobleman. Modest's paternal grandmother Irina used to be a serf that could be sold without land in his grandfather's estate. At age six, Mussorgsky began receiving piano lessons from his mother, herself a trained pianist. His progress was sufficiently rapid that three years later, he was able to perform a John Field concerto and works by Franz Liszt for family and friends. At age 10, Mussorgsky and his brother were taken to Saint Petersburg to study at the elite German language Petrischule (St. Peter's School). While there, Modest studied the piano with Anton Gerke. In 1852, the 12-year-old Mussorgsky published a piano piece titled \"Porte-enseigne Polka\" at his father's expense.\nMussorgsky's parents planned the move to Saint Petersburg so that both their sons would renew the family tradition of military service. Mussorgsky entered the Cadet School of the Guards at age 13. Controversy had arisen over the educational attitudes at the time of both this institute and its director, General Sutgof. All agreed the Cadet School could be a brutal place, especially for new recruits. More tellingly for Mussorgsky, it was likely where he began his eventual path to alcoholism. According to a former student, singer and composer Nikolai Kompaneisky, Sutgof \"was proud when a cadet returned from leave drunk with champagne.\"\nMusic still remained important to Mussorgsky. Sutgof's daughter was also a pupil of Gerke, and Mussorgsky was allowed to attend lessons with her. His skills as a pianist made Mussorgsky much in demand by fellow-cadets; for them, he would play dances interspersed with his own improvisations. In 1856, Mussorgsky \u2013 who had developed a strong interest in history and studied German philosophy \u2013 graduated from the Cadet School. Following family tradition, he received a commission with the Preobrazhensky Regiment, the foremost regiment of the Russian Imperial Guard.\nMaturity.\nIn October 1856, the 17-year-old Mussorgsky met the 22-year-old Alexander Borodin while both men served at a military hospital in Saint Petersburg. The two were soon on good terms. Borodin later remembered:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His little uniform was spic and span, close-fitting, his feet turned outwards, his hair smoothed down and greased, his nails perfectly cut, his hands well groomed like a lord's. His manners were elegant, aristocratic: his speech likewise, delivered through somewhat clenched teeth, interspersed with French phrases, was rather precious. There was a touch\u2014though very moderate\u2014of foppishness. His politeness and good manners were exceptional. The ladies made a fuss of him. He sat at the piano and, throwing up his hands coquettishly, played with extreme sweetness and grace (etc) extracts from \"Trovatore\", \"Traviata\", and so on, and around him buzzed in chorus: \"Charmant, d\u00e9licieux!\" and suchlike. I met Modest Petrovich three or four times at Popov's in this way, both on duty and at the hospital.\"\nMore portentous was Mussorgsky's introduction that winter to Alexander Dargomyzhsky, at that time the most important Russian composer after Mikhail Glinka. Dargomyzhsky was impressed with Mussorgsky's pianism. As a result, Mussorgsky became a fixture at Dargomyzhsky's soir\u00e9es. There, as critic Vladimir Stasov later recalled, he began \"his true musical life.\"\nOver the next two years at Dargomyzhsky's, Mussorgsky met several figures of importance in Russia's cultural life, among them Stasov, C\u00e9sar Cui (a fellow officer), and Mily Balakirev. Balakirev had an especially strong impact. Within days he took it upon himself to help shape Mussorgsky's fate as a composer. He recalled to Stasov, \"Because I am not a theorist, I could not teach him harmony (as, for instance Rimsky-Korsakov now teaches it) ... [but] I explained to him the form of compositions, and to do this we played through both Beethoven symphonies [as piano duets] and much else (Schumann, Schubert, Glinka, and others), analyzing the form.\" Up to this point, Mussorgsky had known nothing but piano music; his knowledge of more radical recent music was virtually non-existent. Balakirev started filling these gaps in Mussorgsky's knowledge.\nIn 1858, within a few months of beginning his studies with Balakirev, Mussorgsky resigned his commission to devote himself entirely to music. He also suffered a painful crisis at this time. This may have had a spiritual component (in a letter to Balakirev the young man referred to \"mysticism and cynical thoughts about the Deity\"), but its exact nature will probably never be known. In 1859, the 20-year-old gained valuable theatrical experience by assisting in a production of Glinka's opera \"A Life for the Tsar\" on the Glebovo estate of a former singer and her wealthy husband; Mussorgsky also met Konstantin Lyadov (father of Anatoly Lyadov) and enjoyed a formative visit to Moscow \u2013 after which he professed love of \"everything Russian\". Mussorgsky and his brother were also inspired by the gothic script, they were using an \"M\" personal sign instead of , very similar to the symbols of the early Rurikids.\nDespite this epiphany, Mussorgsky's music leaned more toward foreign models; a four-hand piano sonata that he produced in 1860 contains his only movement in sonata form. Nor is any 'nationalistic' impulse easily discernible in the incidental music for Vladislav Ozerov's play \"Oedipus in Athens\", on which he worked between the ages of 19 and 22 (and then abandoned unfinished), or in the \"Intermezzo in Modo Classico\" for piano solo (revised and orchestrated in 1867). The latter was the only important piece he composed between December 1860 and August 1863: the reasons for this probably lie in the painful re-emergence of his subjective crisis in 1860 and the purely objective difficulties which resulted from the emancipation of the serfs the following year \u2013 as a result of which the family was deprived of half its estate, and Mussorgsky had to spend a good deal of time in Karevo unsuccessfully attempting to stave off their looming impoverishment.\nBy this time, Mussorgsky had freed himself from the influence of Balakirev and was largely teaching himself. In 1863 he began an opera \u2013 \"Salammb\u00f4\" \u2013 on which he worked between 1863 and 1866 before losing interest in the project. During this period, he returned to Saint Petersburg and supported himself as a low-grade civil servant while living in a six-man \"commune\". In a heady artistic and intellectual atmosphere, he read and discussed a wide range of modern artistic and scientific ideas \u2013 including those of the provocative writer Chernyshevsky, known for the bold assertion that, in art, \"form and content are opposites\". Under such influences he came more and more to embrace the idea of artistic realism and all that it entailed, whether this concerned the responsibility to depict life \"as it is truly lived\"; the preoccupation with the lower strata of society; or the rejection of repeating, symmetrical musical forms as insufficiently true to the unrepeating, unpredictable course of \"real life\".\n\"Real life\" affected Mussorgsky painfully in 1865 when his mother died; at this point, the composer had his first serious bout of alcoholism, which forced him to leave the commune to stay with his brother. However, the 26-year-old was on the point of writing his first realistic songs (including \"Hopak\" and \"Darling Savishna\", both of them composed in 1866 and among his first \"real\" publications the following year). The year 1867 was also the one in which he finished the original orchestral version of his \"Night on Bald Mountain\" (which, Balakirev criticised and refused to conduct, with the result that it was never performed during Mussorgsky's lifetime).\nPeak.\nMussorgsky's career as a civil servant was by no means stable or secure: though he was assigned to various posts and even received a promotion in these early years, Mussorgsky was declared \"supernumerary\" in 1867 \u2013 remaining \"in service\" but receiving no wages. However, decisive developments were occurring in his artistic life. Although it was in 1867 that Stasov first referred to the \"kuchka\" (, lit. \"bunch\", English: \"The Five\") of Russian composers loosely grouped around Balakirev, Mussorgsky was by then ceasing to seek Balakirev's approval and was moving closer to the older Alexander Dargomyzhsky. Inside \"The Five\" and its close companions, Mussorgsky was nicknamed as \"Humour\", Balakirev was \"Power\", and Rimsky-Korsakov was \"Sincerity\".\nSince 1866, Dargomyzhsky had been working on his opera \"The Stone Guest\", a version of the \"Don Juan\" story with a Pushkin text that he declared would be set \"just as it stands, so that the inner truth of the text should not be distorted\", and in a manner that abolished the \"unrealistic\" division between aria and recitative in favor of a continuous mode of syllabic but lyrically heightened declamation somewhere between the two.\nUnder the influence of this work (and the ideas of Georg Gottfried Gervinus, according to whom \"the highest natural object of musical imitation is emotion, and the method of imitating emotion is to mimic speech\"), Mussorgsky in 1868 rapidly set the first eleven scenes of Nikolai Gogol's play \"Marriage\" (\"Zhenitba\"), with his priority being to render into music the natural accents and patterns of the play's naturalistic and deliberately humdrum dialogue. This work marked an extreme position in Mussorgsky's pursuit of naturalistic word-setting: he abandoned it unorchestrated after reaching the end of his \"Act 1\", and though its characteristically \"Mussorgskyian\" declamation is to be heard in all his later vocal music, the naturalistic mode of vocal writing more and more became merely one expressive element among many.\nA few months after abandoning \"Zhenitba\", the 29-year-old Mussorgsky was encouraged to write an opera on the story of Boris Godunov. This he did, assembling and shaping a text from Pushkin's play and Karamzin's history. Mussorgsky completed the large-scale score the following year while living with friends and working for the Forestry Department. However, the finished opera was rejected for theatrical performance in 1871, apparently because of its lack of any \"prima donna\" role. Mussorgsky set to work producing a revised and enlarged \"second version\". During the next year, which he spent sharing rooms with Rimsky-Korsakov, he made changes that went beyond those requested by the theatre. In this version the opera was accepted, probably in May 1872, and three excerpts were staged at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1873. It is often asserted that in 1872 the opera was rejected a second time, but no specific evidence for this exists.\nBy the time of the first production of \"Boris Godunov\" in February 1874, Mussorgsky had taken part in the ill-fated \"Mlada\" project (in the course of which he had made a choral version of his \"Night on Bald Mountain\") and had begun \"Khovanshchina\". Though far from being a critical success \u2013 and in spite of receiving only a dozen or so performances \u2013 the popular reaction in favour of \"Boris\" made this the peak of Mussorgsky's career.\nDecline.\nFrom this peak, a pattern of decline became increasingly apparent. At this point, the Balakirev circle was disintegrating, something Mussorgsky was especially bitter about. He wrote to Vladimir Stasov, \"[T]he Mighty Handful has degenerated into soulless traitors.\" In drifting away from his old friends, Mussorgsky had been seen to fall victim to \"fits of madness\" that could well have been alcoholism-related. His friend Viktor Hartmann had died, and Mussorgsky's relative and recent roommate Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov (who furnished the poems for the song-cycle \"Sunless\" and would go on to provide those for the \"Songs and Dances of Death\") had moved away to get married. Mussorgsky engaged a new and prominent personal private physician about 1870, Dr. George Leon Carrick, sometime Secretary and later President of the St. Petersburg Physicians' Society and a cousin of Sir Harry Lauder.\nWhile Mussorgsky suffered personally from alcoholism, it was also a behavior pattern considered typical for those of Mussorgsky's generation who wanted to oppose the establishment and protest through extreme forms of behavior. One contemporary noted, \"an intense worship of Bacchus was considered to be almost obligatory for a writer of that period. It was a showing off, a 'pose,' for the best people of the [eighteen-]sixties.\" Another writes, \"Talented people in Russia who love the simple folk cannot but drink.\" Mussorgsky spent day and night in a Saint Petersburg tavern of low repute, the Maly Yaroslavets, accompanied by other bohemian dropouts. He and his fellow drinkers idealized their alcoholism, perhaps seeing it as ethical and aesthetic opposition.\nFor a time, Mussorgsky was able to maintain his creative output: his compositions from 1874 include \"Sunless\", the \"Khovanshchina\" Prelude, and the piano suite \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" (in memory of Hartmann); Mussorgsky also began working on another opera based on Gogol, \"The Fair at Sorochyntsi\" (for which he produced another choral version of \"Night on Bald Mountain\").\nIn the years that followed, Mussorgsky's decline became increasingly steep. Although now part of a new circle of eminent personages that included singers, medical men, and actors, he was increasingly unable to resist drinking, and a succession of deaths among his closest associates caused him great pain. However, Mussorgsky's alcoholism would seem to be in check at times, and among the most powerful works composed during his last six years are the four \"Songs and Dances of Death\". Mussorgsky's civil service career was made more precarious by his frequent \"illnesses\" and absences, and Mussorgsky was fortunate to obtain a transfer to a post (in the Office of Government Control), where his music-loving superior treated him with great leniency \u2013 even allowing Mussorgsky to spend three months touring 12 cities as a singer's accompanist in 1879.\nHowever, the decline could not be halted. In 1880, Mussorgsky was finally dismissed from government service. Aware of his destitution, one group of friends organized a stipend designed to support the completion of \"Khovanshchina\" while another group organized a similar fund to pay him to complete \"The Fair at Sorochyntsi\", but neither work was completed (although \"Khovanshchina\", in piano score with only two numbers uncomposed, came close to being finished).\nIn early 1881, a desperate Mussorgsky declared to a friend that there was \"nothing left but begging\" and suffered four seizures in rapid succession. Mussorgsky also suffered from delirium tremens during this period. Although he found a comfortable room in a good hospital\u2014and for several weeks even appeared to be rallying\u2014the situation was hopeless. In March 1881, Ilya Repin painted the famous, red-nosed portrait in what were to be the last days of the composer's life as Mussorgsky died a week after his 42nd birthday. Mussorgsky was interred at the Tikhvin Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg.\nMussorgsky, like others of \"The Five\", was perceived as an extremist by the emperor and much of his court. This may have been the reason Tsar Alexander III personally crossed off \"Boris Godunov\" from the list of proposed pieces for the Imperial Opera in 1888.\nWorks.\nMussorgsky's works, while strikingly novel, are stylistically Romantic and draw heavily on Russian musical themes. He has been the inspiration for many Russian composers, including most notably Dmitri Shostakovich (in his late symphonies) and Sergei Prokofiev (in his operas).\nIn 1868 or 1869, Mussorgsky composed the opera \"Boris Godunov\", about the life of the Russian tsar, but it was rejected by the Mariinsky Opera. Mussorgsky thus edited the work, making a final version in 1874. The early version is considered darker and more concise than the later version, but also more crude. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov re-orchestrated the opera in 1896 and revised it in 1908. The opera has also been revised by other composers, notably Shostakovich, who made two versions, one for film and one for stage.\nThe opera \"Khovanshchina\" was unfinished and unperformed when Mussorgsky died, but it was completed by Rimsky-Korsakov and received its premiere in 1886 in Saint Petersburg. This opera was also revised by Shostakovich. \"The Fair at Sorochyntsi\", another opera, was left incomplete at his death but a dance excerpt, the Gopak, is frequently performed.\nMussorgsky's most imaginative and frequently performed work is the cycle of piano pieces describing paintings in sound called \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". This composition, best known through an orchestral arrangement by Maurice Ravel, was written in commemoration of his friend, the architect Viktor Hartmann.\nMussorgsky's single-movement orchestral work \"Night on Bald Mountain\" enjoyed broad popular recognition in the 1940s when it was featured, in tandem with Schubert's \"Ave Maria\", in the 1940 Walt Disney animated film \"Fantasia\".\nAmong the composer's other works are a number of songs, including three song cycles: \"The Nursery\" (1872), \"Sunless\" (1874) and \"Songs and Dances of Death\" (1877); plus \"Mephistopheles' Song of the Flea\" and many others. Important early recordings of songs by Mussorgsky were made by tenor Vladimir Rosing in the 1920s and 1930s. Other recordings have been made by Boris Christoff between 1951 and 1957 and by Sergei Leiferkus in 1993.\nReputation.\nContemporary opinions of Mussorgsky as a composer and person varied from positive to ambiguous to negative. Mussorgsky's eventual supporters, Vladimir Stasov and Mily Balakirev, initially registered strongly negative impressions of the composer. Stasov wrote to Balakirev, in an 1863 letter, \"I have no use for Mussorgsky. His views may tally with mine, but I have never heard him express an intelligent idea. All in him is flabby, dull. He is, it seems to me, a thorough idiot\", and Balakirev agreed: \"Yes, Mussorgsky is little short of an idiot.\"\nMixed impressions are recorded by Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky, colleagues of Mussorgsky who, unlike him, made their living as composers. Both praised his talent while expressing disappointment with his technique. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that Mussorgsky's scores included:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;absurd, disconnected harmony, ugly part-writing, sometimes strikingly illogical modulation, sometimes a depressing lack of it, unsuccessful scoring of orchestral things... what was needed at the moment was an edition for performance, for practical artistic aims, for familiarization with his enormous talent, not for the study of his personality and artistic transgressions.\nWhile preparing an edition of \"Sorochints\u00ef Fair\", Anatoly Lyadov remarked: \"It is easy enough to correct Mussorgsky's irregularities. The only trouble is that when this is done, the character and originality of the music are done away with, and the composer's individuality vanishes.\"\nTchaikovsky, in a letter to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck, was also critical of Mussorgsky:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mussorgsky you very rightly call a hopeless case. In talent he is perhaps superior to all the [other members of The Five], but his nature is narrow-minded, devoid of any urge towards self-perfection, blindly believing in the ridiculous theories of his circle and in his own genius. In addition, he has a certain base side to his nature which likes coarseness, uncouthness, roughness. He flaunts his illiteracy, takes pride in his ignorance, mucks along anyhow, blindly believing in the infallibility of his genius. Yet he has flashes of talent which are, moreover, not devoid of originality.\nWestern perceptions of Mussorgsky changed with the European premiere of \"Boris Godunov\" in 1908. Before the premiere, he was regarded as an eccentric in the West. Critic Edward Dannreuther, wrote, in the 1905 edition of \"The Oxford History of Music\", \"Mussorgsky, in his vocal efforts, appears wilfully eccentric. His style impresses the Western ear as barbarously ugly.\" However, after the premiere, views on Mussorgsky's music changed drastically. Gerald Abraham, a musicologist, and an authority on Mussorgsky: \"As a musical translator of words and all that can be expressed in words, of psychological states, and even physical movement, he is unsurpassed; as an absolute musician he was hopelessly limited, with remarkably little ability to construct pure music or even a purely musical texture.\"\nIn popular culture.\nMussorgsky's tone poem \"Night on Bald Mountain\" was used in the 1940 animated film \"Fantasia\", accompanied by an animation of Chernobog summoning evil spirits on a mountain. It segues into \"Ave Maria\" by Franz Schubert.\nThe progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer performed and recorded an arrangement of Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" in 1971, featuring lyrics by Greg Lake, and released it as a live album of the same name.\nThe first 20 seconds of Michael Jackson's 1995 song \"HIStory\" relies on an orchestrated version of \"The Bogatyr Gates (In the Capital in Kiev)\" fragment of \"The Pictures at an Exhibition\".\nThe 2020 film \"\" starring Dan Stevens as Alexander Lemtov, a flamboyant singer representing Russia, had a non-typical Russian character development as an obvious cultural reference to Modest Mussorgsky, also known domestically for encouraging a female opera singer Daria Leonova to compose a classical song \"Letter After the Ball\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire. Its borders were the Danube to the north, Raetia and Vindelici to the west, Pannonia to the east and south-east, and Italia (Venetia et Histria) to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg.\nArea and population.\nAround 800 BC, the region was inhabited mostly by the people of the Hallstatt culture. Around 450 BC, they merged with the people of other areas in the south-western regions of Germany and eastern France.\nThe country is mountainous and rich in iron and salt. It supplied material for the manufacturing of arms in Pannonia, Moesia, and northern Italy. The famous Noric steel was largely used in the making of Roman weapons (e.g. Horace, \"Odes\", i.16.9\u201310: \"Noricus ensis\", \"a Noric sword\"). Gold and salt were found in considerable quantities. The plant called saliunca (the wild nard, a relative of the lavender) grew in abundance and was used as a perfume according to Pliny the Elder.\nThe inhabitants developed a culture rich in art, salt mining, cattle breeding, and agriculture. When part of the area became a Roman province, the Romans introduced water management and the already important trade relations between the people north and south of the Alps increased.\nArchaeological research, particularly in the cemeteries of Hallstatt, has shown that a vigorous civilization was in the area centuries before recorded history. The graves contained weapons and ornaments from the Bronze Age, through the period of transition, up to the Hallstatt culture, i.e., the fully developed older period of the Iron Age.\nLanguage.\nThe Noric language is attested in only fragmentary inscriptions, one from Ptuj and two from Grafenstein, neither of which provide enough information for any conclusions about the nature of the language.\nHistory.\nSteel for Roman weaponry.\nThe kingdom of Noricum was a major provider of weaponry for the Roman army from the mid-Republic onwards. Roman swords were made of the best-quality steel then available from this region, the \"chalybs Noricus\". The strength of steel is determined by its composition and heat treatment. The wrought iron produced in the Greco-Roman world was too soft for tools and weapons. Ore from Noricum, by contrast, could yield a superior product. The ore needed to be rich in manganese (an element which remains essential in modern steelmaking processes), and contain little or no phosphorus, which weakens steel. The ore mined in Carinthia (S. Noricum) fulfilled both criteria particularly well. The Noricum discovered their ore made superior steel around 500 BC and built a major steel industry.\nAt Magdalensberg, a major production and trading centre, specialised blacksmiths crafted metal products and weapons. The finished arms were exported to Aquileia, a Roman colony founded in 180 BC.\nFrom 200 BC, the Noricum tribes gradually united into a kingdom, known as the Regnum Noricum, with its capital at a place called Noreia. Noricum became a key ally of the Roman Republic, providing high-quality weapons and tools in exchange for military protection. This was demonstrated in 113 BC, when Teutones invaded Noricum. In response, the Roman consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo led an army over the Alps to attack the tribes at the Noreia.\nRoman rule.\nNoricum was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 16 BC. For a long time previously, the Noricans had enjoyed independence under princes of their own and carried on commerce with the Romans. In 48 BC they took the side of Julius Caesar in the civil war against Pompey. In 16 BC, having joined with the Pannonians in invading Histria, they were defeated by Publius Silius Nerva, proconsul of Illyricum. Thereafter, Noricum became a Roman province. It was not until the reign of Antoninus Pius that the Second Legion, \"Pia\" (later renamed \"Italica\") was stationed in Noricum, and the commander of the legion became the governor of the province.\nUnder Diocletian (245\u2013313), Noricum was divided into \"Noricum ripense\" (\"Noricum along the river\", the northern part southward from the Danube), and \"Noricum mediterraneum\" (\"landlocked Noricum\", the southern, more mountainous district). The dividing line ran along the central part of the eastern Alps. Each division was under a praeses, and both belonged to the diocese of Illyricum in the Praetorian prefecture of Italy. It was in this time (304 AD) that a Christian serving as a military officer in the province suffered martyrdom for the sake of his faith, later canonised as Saint Florian.\nThe Roman colonies and chief towns were \"Virunum\" (near Maria Saal to the north of Klagenfurt), \"Teurnia\" (near Spittal an der Drau), \"Flavia Solva\" (near Leibnitz), \"Celeia\" (Celje) in today's Slovenia, \"Juvavum\" (Salzburg), \"Ovilava\" (Wels), \"Lauriacum\" (Lorch at the mouth of the Enns, the ancient \"Anisus\").\nKnowledge of Roman Noricum has been decisively expanded by the work of Richard Knabl, an Austrian epigrapher of the 19th century.\nThe transition from Roman to barbarian rule in Noricum is well documented in Eugippius' \"Life of Saint Severinus\", providing material for analogies for this process in other regions where primary sources from the period are lacking.\nIn modern politics.\nIn 1919, Heinrich Lammasch, the last prime minister of Imperial Austria, proposed to give the young republic the name of \"Norische Republik\" or \"Noric Republic\", because the ancient borders were similar to those of the new state, which\u2014at the time\u2014did not wish to be considered the heir of the Habsburg monarchy, but an independent, neutral and peaceful state.\nEpiscopal sees.\nEpiscopal sees of Noricum that are now listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as titular sees include:\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64719", "revid": "32589484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64719", "title": "Paul Gauguin", "text": "French artist (1848\u20131903)\nEug\u00e8ne Henri Paul Gauguin (; ; 7 June 1848 \u2013 8 May 1903) was a French painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramist, and writer, whose work has been primarily associated with the Post-Impressionist and Symbolist movements. He was also an influential practitioner of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms. While only moderately successful during his lifetime, Gauguin has since been recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinct from Impressionism.\nGauguin was born in Paris in 1848, amidst the tumult of Europe's revolutionary year. In 1850, Gauguin's family settled in Peru, where he experienced a privileged childhood that left a lasting impression on him. Later, financial struggles led them back to France, where Gauguin received formal education. Initially working as a stockbroker, Gauguin started painting in his spare time, his interest in art kindled by visits to galleries and exhibitions. The financial crisis of 1882 significantly impacted his brokerage career, prompting a shift to full-time painting. Gauguin's art education was largely self-taught and informal, shaped significantly by his associations with other artists rather than academic training. His entry into the art world was facilitated by his acquaintance with Camille Pissarro, a leading Impressionist. Pissarro took on a mentor role for Gauguin, introducing him to other Impressionist artists and techniques.\nHe exhibited with the Impressionists in the early 1880s, but soon began developing his distinct style, characterized by a bolder use of color and less traditional subject matter. His work in Brittany and Martinique showcased his inclination towards depicting native life and landscapes. By the 1890s, Gauguin's art took a significant turn during his time in Tahiti, then a French colony, where he sought a refuge from the Western civilization. Gauguin's later years in Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands were marked by health problems and financial struggles.\nHis paintings from that period, characterized by vivid colors and Symbolist themes, would prove highly successful among the European viewers for their exploration of the relationships between people, nature, and the spiritual world. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh.\nBiography.\nFamily history and early life.\nGauguin was born in Paris to Clovis Gauguin and Aline Chazal on 7 June 1848, the year of revolutionary upheavals throughout Europe. His father, a 34-year-old liberal journalist from a family of entrepreneurs in Orl\u00e9ans, was compelled to flee France when the newspaper for which he wrote was suppressed by French authorities. Gauguin's mother was the 22-year-old daughter of Andr\u00e9 Chazal, an engraver, and Flora Tristan, an author and activist in early socialist movements. Their union ended when Andr\u00e9 shot his wife Flora and was sentenced to prison for attempted murder.\nPaul Gauguin's maternal grandmother, Flora Tristan, was the illegitimate daughter of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Laisnay and Don Mariano de Tristan Moscoso. Details of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's family background are not known; Don Mariano came from an aristocratic Spanish family from the Peruvian city of Arequipa. He was an officer of the Dragoons. Members of the wealthy Tristan Moscoso family held powerful positions in Peru. Nonetheless, Don Mariano's unexpected death plunged his mistress and daughter Flora into poverty. When Flora's marriage with Andr\u00e9 failed, she petitioned for and obtained a small monetary settlement from her father's Peruvian relatives. She sailed to Peru in hopes of enlarging her share of the Tristan Moscoso family fortune. This never materialized; but she successfully published a popular travelogue of her experiences in Peru which launched her literary career in 1838. An active supporter of early socialist societies, Gauguin's maternal grandmother helped to lay the foundations for the 1848 revolutionary movements. Placed under surveillance by French police and suffering from overwork, she died in 1844. Her grandson Paul \"idolized his grandmother, and kept copies of her books with him to the end of his life\".\nIn 1850, Clovis Gauguin departed for Peru with his wife Aline and young children in hopes of continuing his journalistic career under the auspices of his wife's South American relations. He died of a heart attack en route, and Aline arrived in Peru as a widow with the 18-month-old Paul and his 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 year-old sister, Marie. Gauguin's mother was welcomed by her paternal granduncle, whose son-in-law, Jos\u00e9 Rufino Echenique, would shortly assume the presidency of Peru. To the age of six, Paul enjoyed a privileged upbringing, attended by nursemaids and servants. He retained a vivid memory of that period of his childhood which instilled \"indelible impressions of Peru that haunted him the rest of his life\".\nGauguin's idyllic childhood ended abruptly when his family mentors fell from political power during Peruvian civil conflicts in 1854. Aline returned to France with her children, leaving Paul with his paternal grandfather, Guillaume Gauguin, in Orl\u00e9ans. Deprived by the Peruvian Tristan Moscoso clan of a generous annuity arranged by her granduncle, Aline settled in Paris to work as a dressmaker.\nEducation and first job.\nAfter attending a couple of local schools, Gauguin was sent to the prestigious Catholic boarding school Petit S\u00e9minaire de La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin. He spent three years at the school. At the age of 14, he entered the Loriol Institute in Paris, a naval preparatory school, before returning to Orl\u00e9ans to take his final year at the Lyc\u00e9e Jeanne D'Arc. Gauguin signed on as a pilot's assistant in the merchant marine. Three years later, he joined the French navy, in which he served for two years. His mother died on 7 July 1867, but he did not learn of it for several months until a letter from his sister Marie caught up with him in India.\nIn 1871, Gauguin returned to Paris where he secured a job as a stockbroker. A close family friend, Gustave Arosa, got him a job at the Paris Bourse; Gauguin was 23. He became a successful Parisian businessman and remained one for the next 11 years. In 1879 he was earning 30,000 francs a year (about $145,000 in 2019 US dollars) as a stockbroker, and as much again in his dealings in the art market. But in 1882 the Paris stock market crashed and the art market contracted. Gauguin's earnings deteriorated sharply and he eventually decided to pursue painting full-time.\nMarriage.\nIn 1873, he married a Danish woman, Mette-Sophie Gad (1850\u20131920). Over the next ten years, they had five children: \u00c9mile (1874\u20131955); Aline (1877\u20131897); Clovis (1879\u20131900); Jean Ren\u00e9 (1881\u20131961); and Paul Rollon (1883\u20131961). By 1884, Gauguin had moved with his family to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he pursued a business career as a tarpaulin salesman. It was not a success: He could not speak Danish, and the Danes did not want French tarpaulins. Mette became the chief breadwinner, giving French lessons to trainee diplomats. \nHis middle-class family and marriage fell apart after 11 years when Gauguin was driven to paint full-time. He returned to Paris in 1885, after his wife and her family asked him to leave because he had renounced the values they shared. Gauguin's last physical contact with them was in 1891, and Mette eventually broke with him decisively in 1894.\nFirst paintings.\nIn 1873, around the time he became a stockbroker, Gauguin began painting in his free time. His Parisian life centered on the 9th arrondissement of Paris. Gauguin lived at 15, rue la Bruy\u00e8re. Nearby were the caf\u00e9s frequented by the Impressionists. Gauguin also visited galleries frequently and purchased work by emerging artists. He formed a friendship with Camille Pissarro and visited him on Sundays to paint in his garden. Pissarro introduced him to various other artists. In 1877 Gauguin \"moved downmarket and across the river to the poorer, newer, urban sprawls\" of Vaugirard. Here, on the third floor at 8 rue Carcel, he had his first home with a studio.\nHis close friend \u00c9mile Schuffenecker, a former stockbroker who also aspired to become an artist, lived close by. Gauguin showed paintings in Impressionist exhibitions held in 1881 and 1882 (earlier, a sculpture of his son \u00c9mile had been the only sculpture in the 4th Impressionist Exhibition of 1879). His paintings received dismissive reviews, although several of them, such as \"The Market Gardens of Vaugirard\", are now highly regarded.\nIn 1882, the stock market crashed and the art market contracted. Paul Durand-Ruel, the Impressionists' primary art dealer, was especially affected by the crash, and for a period of time stopped buying pictures from painters such as Gauguin. Gauguin's earnings contracted sharply, and over the next two years he slowly formulated his plans to become a full-time artist. The following two summers, he painted with Pissarro and occasionally Paul C\u00e9zanne.\nIn October 1883, he wrote to Pissarro saying that he had decided to make his living from painting at all costs and asked for his help, which Pissarro at first readily provided. The following January, Gauguin moved with his family to Rouen, where they could live more cheaply and where he thought he had discerned opportunities when visiting Pissarro there the previous summer. However, the venture proved unsuccessful, and by the end of the year Mette and the children moved to Copenhagen, Gauguin following shortly after in November 1884, bringing with him his art collection, which subsequently remained in Copenhagen.\nLife in Copenhagen proved equally difficult, and their marriage grew strained. At Mette's urging, supported by her family, Gauguin returned to Paris the following year.\nFrance 1885\u20131886.\nAfter a brief period in Italy, spent in the small towns of San Salvo and Ururi, Gauguin returned to Paris in June 1885, accompanied by his six-year-old son Clovis. The other children remained with Mette in Copenhagen, where they had the support of family and friends while Mette herself was able to get work as a translator and French teacher. Gauguin initially found it difficult to re-enter the art world in Paris and spent his first winter back in real poverty, obliged to take a series of menial jobs. Clovis eventually fell ill and was sent to a boarding school, Gauguin's sister Marie providing the funds. During this first year, Gauguin produced very little art. He exhibited 19 paintings and a wood relief at the eighth (and last) Impressionist exhibition in May 1886.\nMost of these paintings were earlier work from Rouen or Copenhagen and there was nothing really novel in the few new ones, although his \"Baigneuses \u00e0 Dieppe\" (\"Women Bathing\") introduced what was to become a recurring motif, the woman in the waves. Nevertheless, F\u00e9lix Bracquemond did purchase one of his paintings. This exhibition also established Georges Seurat as leader of the \"avant-garde\" movement in Paris. Gauguin contemptuously rejected Seurat's Neo-Impressionist Pointillist technique and later in the year broke decisively with Pissarro, who from that point on was rather antagonistic towards Gauguin.\nGauguin spent the summer of 1886 in the artist's colony of Pont-Aven in Brittany. He was attracted in the first place because it was cheap to live there. However, he found himself an unexpected success with the young art students who flocked there in the summer. His naturally pugilistic temperament (he was both an accomplished boxer and fencer) was no impediment in the socially relaxed seaside resort. He was remembered during that period as much for his outlandish appearance as for his art. Amongst these new associates was Charles Laval, who would accompany Gauguin the following year to Panama and Martinique.\nThat summer, he executed some pastel drawings of nude figures in the manner of Pissarro and those by Degas exhibited at the 1886 eighth Impressionist exhibition. He mainly painted landscapes such as \"La Berg\u00e8re Bretonne\" (\"The Breton Shepherdess\"), in which the figure plays a subordinate role. His \"Jeunes Bretons au bain\" (\"Young Breton Boys Bathing\"), introducing a theme he returned to each time he visited Pont-Aven, is clearly indebted to Degas in its design and bold use of pure colour. The naive drawings of the English illustrator Randolph Caldecott, used to illustrate a popular guide-book on Brittany, had caught the imagination of the \"avant-garde\" student artists at Pont-Aven, anxious to free themselves from the conservatism of their academies, and Gauguin consciously imitated them in his sketches of Breton girls. These sketches were later worked up into paintings back in his Paris studio. The most important of these is \"Four Breton Women\", which shows a marked departure from his earlier Impressionist style as well as incorporating something of the naive quality of Caldecott's illustration, exaggerating features to the point of caricature.\nGauguin, along with \u00c9mile Bernard, Charles Laval, \u00c9mile Schuffenecker and many others, re-visited Pont-Aven after his travels in Panama and Martinique. The bold use of pure colour and Symbolist choice of subject matter distinguish what is now called the Pont-Aven School. Disappointed with Impressionism, Gauguin felt that traditional European painting had become too imitative and lacked symbolic depth. By contrast, the art of Africa and Asia seemed to him full of mystic symbolism and vigour. There was a vogue in Europe at the time for the art of other cultures, especially that of Japan (Japonism). He was invited to participate in the 1889 exhibition organized by Les XX.\nCloisonnism and synthetism.\nUnder the influence of folk art and Japanese prints, Gauguin's work evolved towards Cloisonnism, a style given its name by the critic \u00c9douard Dujardin to describe \u00c9mile Bernard's method of painting with flat areas of colour and bold outlines, which reminded Dujardin of the Medieval cloisonn\u00e9 enameling technique. Gauguin was very appreciative of Bernard's art and of his daring with the employment of a style which suited Gauguin in his quest to express the essence of the objects in his art.\nIn Gauguin's \"The Yellow Christ\" (1889), often cited as a quintessential Cloisonnist work, the image was reduced to areas of pure colour separated by heavy black outlines. In such works Gauguin paid little attention to classical perspective and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of colour, thereby dispensing with the two most characteristic principles of post-Renaissance painting. His painting later evolved towards Synthetism in which neither form nor colour predominate but each has an equal role.\nPanama Canal.\nIn 1887, Gauguin left France along with his friend, another young painter, Charles Laval. His dream was to purchase land of his own on the small Panamanian island of Taboga, where he stated he desired to live \"on fish and fruit and for nothing... without anxiety for the day or for the morrow.\" By the time he reached the port city of Col\u00f3n, Gauguin was out of money and found work as a laborer on the French construction of the Panama Canal. During this time, Gauguin penned letters to his wife, Mette, lamenting the arduous conditions: \"I have to dig... from five-thirty in the morning to six in the evening, under the tropical sun and rain,\" he wrote. \"At night I am devoured by mosquitoes.\" Meanwhile, Laval had been earning money by drawing portraits of canal officials, work which Gauguin detested since only portraits done in a lewd manner would sell.\nGauguin held a profound contempt for Panama, and at one point was arrested in Panama City for urinating in public. Marched across town at gunpoint, Gauguin was ordered to pay a fine of four francs. After discovering that land on Taboga was priced far beyond reach (and after falling deathly ill on the island where he was subsequently interned in a yellow fever and malaria sanatorium), he decided to leave Panama.\nMartinique.\nLater that same year, Gauguin and Laval spent the time from June to November near Saint Pierre on the Caribbean island of Martinique, a French colony. His thoughts and experiences during this time are recorded in his letters to his wife and his artist friend Emile Schuffenecker. At the time, France had a policy of repatriation where if a citizen became broke or stranded on a French colony, the state would pay for the boat ride back. Upon leaving Panama, protected by the repatriation policy, Gauguin and Laval decided to disembark at the Martinique port of St. Pierre. Scholars disagree on whether Gauguin intentionally or spontaneously decided to stay on the island.\nAt first, the 'negro hut' in which they lived suited him, and he enjoyed watching people in their daily activities. However, the weather in the summer was hot and the hut leaked in the rain. Gauguin also suffered dysentery and marsh fever. While in Martinique, he produced between 10 and 20 works (12 being the most common estimate), traveled widely and apparently came into contact with a small community of Indian immigrants; a contact that would later influence his art through the incorporation of Indian symbols. During his stay, the writer Lafcadio Hearn was also on the island. His account provides an historical comparison to accompany Gauguin's images.\nGauguin finished 11 known paintings during his stay in Martinique, many of which seem to be derived from his hut. His letters to Schuffenecker express an excitement about the exotic location and natives represented in his paintings. Gauguin asserted that four of his paintings on the island were better than the rest. The works as a whole are brightly coloured, loosely painted, outdoor figural scenes. Even though his time on the island was short, it surely was influential. He recycled some of his figures and sketches in later paintings, such as the motif in \"Among the Mangoes\", which is replicated on his fans. Rural and indigenous populations remained a popular subject in Gauguin's work after he left the island.\nVincent and Theo van Gogh.\nGauguin's Martinique paintings were exhibited at his colour merchant Ars\u00e8ne Poitier's gallery. There they were seen and admired by Vincent van Gogh and his art dealer brother Theo, whose firm Goupil &amp; Cie had dealings with Portier. Theo purchased three of Gauguin's paintings for 900 francs and arranged to have them hung at Goupil's, thus introducing Gauguin to wealthy clients. This arrangement with Goupil's continued past Theo's death in 1891. At the same time, Vincent and Gauguin became close friends (on Vincent's part it amounted to something akin to adulation) and they corresponded together on art, a correspondence that was instrumental in Gauguin formulating his philosophy of art.\nIn 1888, at Theo's instigation, Gauguin and Vincent spent nine weeks painting together at Vincent's Yellow House in Arles in the South of France. Gauguin's relationship with Vincent proved fraught. Their relationship deteriorated and eventually Gauguin decided to leave. On the evening of 23 December 1888, according to a much later account of Gauguin's, Vincent confronted Gauguin with a straight razor. Later the same evening, he cut off his own left ear. He wrapped the severed tissue in newspaper and handed it to a woman who worked at a brothel Gauguin and Vincent had both visited, and asked her to \"keep this object carefully, in remembrance of me\". Vincent was hospitalized the following day and Gauguin left Arles. They never saw each other again, but they continued to correspond, and in 1890 Gauguin went so far as to propose they form an artist studio in Antwerp. An 1889 sculptural self-portrait \"Jug in the Form of a Head\" appears to reference Gauguin's traumatic relationship with Vincent.\nGauguin later claimed to have been instrumental in influencing Vincent van Gogh's development as a painter at Arles. While Vincent did briefly experiment with Gauguin's theory of \"painting from the imagination\" in paintings such as \"Memory of the Garden at Etten\", it did not suit him and he quickly returned to painting from nature.\nEdgar Degas.\nAlthough Gauguin made some of his early strides in the world of art under Pissarro, Edgar Degas was Gauguin's most admired contemporary artist and a great influence on his work from the beginning, with his figures and interiors as well as a carved and painted medallion of singer Val\u00e9rie Roumi. He had a deep reverence for Degas' artistic dignity and tact. It was Gauguin's healthiest, longest-lasting friendship, spanning his entire artistic career until his death.\nIn addition to being one of his earliest supporters, including buying Gauguin's work and persuading dealer Paul Durand-Ruel to do the same, there was never a public support for Gauguin more unwavering than from Degas. Gauguin also purchased work from Degas in the early to mid-1870s and his own monotyping predilection was probably influenced by Degas' advancements in the medium.\nGauguin's Durand-Ruel exhibition in November 1893, which Degas chiefly organized, received mixed reviews. Among the mocking were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and former friend Pissarro. Degas, however, praised his work, purchasing \"Te faaturuma\" and admiring the exotic sumptuousness of Gauguin's conjured folklore. In appreciation, Gauguin presented Degas with \"The Moon and the Earth\", one of the exhibited paintings that had attracted the most hostile criticism. Gauguin's late canvas \"Riders on the Beach\" (two versions) recalls Degas' horse pictures that he started in the 1860s, specifically \"Racetrack\" and \"Before the Race\", testifying to his enduring effect on Gauguin. Degas later purchased two paintings at Gauguin's 1895 auction to raise funds for his final trip to Tahiti. These were \"Vahine no te vi (Woman with a Mango)\" and the version Gauguin painted of \u00c9douard Manet's \" Olympia\".\nFirst visit to Tahiti.\nBy 1890, Gauguin had conceived the project of making Tahiti his next artistic destination. A successful auction of paintings in Paris at the H\u00f4tel Drouot in February 1891, along with other events such as a banquet and a benefit concert, provided the necessary funds. The auction had been greatly helped by a flattering review from Octave Mirbeau, courted by Gauguin through Camille Pissarro. After visiting his wife and children in Copenhagen, for what turned out to be the last time, Gauguin set sail for Tahiti on 1 April 1891, promising to return a rich man and make a fresh start. His avowed intent was to escape European civilization and \"everything that is artificial and conventional\". Nevertheless, he took care to take with him a collection of visual stimuli in the form of photographs, drawings and prints.\nHe spent the first three months in Papeete, the capital of the colony and already much influenced by French and European culture. His biographer Belinda Thomson observes that he must have been disappointed in his vision of a primitive idyll. He was unable to afford the pleasure-seeking life-style in Papeete, and an early attempt at a portrait, \"Suzanne Bambridge\", was not well liked. He decided to set up his studio in Mataiea, Papeari, some from Papeete, installing himself in a native-style bamboo hut. Here he executed paintings depicting Tahitian life such as \"Fatata te Miti (By the Sea)\" and \"Ia Orana Maria (Ave Maria)\", the latter to become his most prized Tahitian painting.\nMany of his finest paintings date from this period. His first portrait of a Tahitian model is thought to be \"Vahine no te tiare\" (\"Woman with a Flower\"). The painting is notable for the care with which it delineates Polynesian features. He sent the painting to his patron George-Daniel de Monfreid, a friend of Schuffenecker, who was to become Gauguin's devoted champion in Tahiti. By late summer 1892 this painting was being displayed at Goupil's gallery in Paris. Art historian Nancy Mowll Mathews believes that Gauguin's encounter with exotic sensuality in Tahiti, so evident in the painting, was by far the most important aspect of his sojourn there. He often rendered titles of his works in Tahitian, although some of these titles were misconjugated to a point where they were hard to understand by native Tahitian speakers themselves.\nGauguin was lent copies of Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout's 1837 \"Voyage aux \u00eeles du Grand Oc\u00e9an\" and Edmond de Bovis' 1855 \"\u00c9tat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tahitienne \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e des Europ\u00e9ens\", containing full accounts of Tahiti's forgotten culture and religion. Gauguin was fascinated by the accounts of \"Arioi\" society and their god 'Oro. Because these accounts contained no illustrations and the Tahitian models had in any case long disappeared, he could give free rein to his imagination. He executed some twenty paintings and a dozen woodcarvings over the next year. The first of these was \"Te aa no areois (The Seed of the Areoi)\", representing Oro's terrestrial wife Vairaumati, now held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His illustrated notebook of the time, \"Ancien Culte Mahorie,\" is preserved in the Louvre and was published in facsimile form in 1951.\nIn all, Gauguin sent nine of his paintings to Monfreid in Paris. These were eventually exhibited in Copenhagen in a joint exhibition with the late Vincent van Gogh. Reports that they had been well received (though in fact only two of the Tahitian paintings were sold and his earlier paintings were unfavourably compared with van Gogh's) were sufficiently encouraging for Gauguin to contemplate returning with some seventy others he had completed. He had in any case largely run out of funds, depending on a state grant for a free passage home. In addition he had some health problems diagnosed as heart problems by the local doctor, which Mathews suggests may have been the early signs of cardiovascular syphilis.\nGauguin later wrote a travelogue (first published 1901) titled \"Noa Noa\", originally conceived as commentary on his paintings and describing his experiences in Tahiti. Modern critics have suggested that the contents of the book were in part fantasized and plagiarized. In it he revealed that he had at this time taken a 13-year-old girl as native wife or \"vahine\" (the Tahitian word for \"woman\"), a marriage contracted in the course of a single afternoon. This was Teha'amana, called Tehura in the travelogue, who was pregnant by him by the end of summer 1892. Teha'amana was the subject of several of Gauguin's paintings, including \"Merahi metua no Tehamana\" and the celebrated \"Spirit of the Dead Watching\", as well as a notable woodcarving \"Tehura\" now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. By the end of July 1893, Gauguin had decided to leave Tahiti and he would never see Teha'amana or their child again even after returning to the island several years later. A digital catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the paintings from this period was released by the Wildenstein Plattner Institute in 2021.\nReturn to France.\nIn August 1893, Gauguin returned to France, where he continued to execute paintings on Tahitian subjects such as \"Mahana no atua (Day of the God)\" and \"Nave nave moe (Sacred spring, sweet dreams)\". An exhibition at the Durand-Ruel gallery in November 1894 was a moderate success, selling at quite elevated prices 11 of the 40 paintings exhibited. He set up an apartment at 6 rue Vercing\u00e9torix, on the edge of the Montparnasse district frequented by artists, and began to conduct a weekly \"salon\". He affected an exotic \"persona\", dressing in Polynesian costume, and conducted a public affair with a young woman still in her teens, \"half Indian, half Malayan\", known as Annah the Javanese.\nDespite the moderate success of his November exhibition, he subsequently lost Durand-Ruel's patronage in circumstances that are not clear. Mathews characterises this as a tragedy for Gauguin's career. Amongst other things he lost the chance of an introduction to the American market. The start of 1894 found him preparing woodcuts using an experimental technique for his proposed travelogue \"Noa Noa\". He returned to Pont-Aven for the summer. In February 1895 he attempted an auction of his paintings at H\u00f4tel Drouot in Paris, similar to the one of 1891, but this was not a success. The dealer Ambroise Vollard, however, showed his paintings at his gallery in March 1895, but they did not come to terms at that date.\nHe submitted a large ceramic sculpture he called \"Oviri\" he had fired the previous winter to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 \"salon\" opening in April. There are conflicting versions of how it was received: his biographer and \"Noa Noa\" collaborator, the Symbolist poet Charles Morice, contended (1920) that the work was \"literally expelled\" from the exhibition, while Vollard said (1937) that the work was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw all his own work. In any case, Gauguin took the opportunity to increase his public exposure by writing an outraged letter on the state of modern ceramics to \"Le Soir\".\nBy this time it had become clear that he and his wife Mette were irrevocably separated. Although there had been hopes of a reconciliation, they had quickly quarrelled over money matters and neither visited the other. Gauguin initially refused to share any part of a 13,000-franc inheritance from his uncle Isidore which he had come into shortly after returning. Mette was eventually gifted 1,500 francs, but she was outraged and from that point on kept in contact with him only through Schuffenecker\u2014doubly galling for Gauguin, as his friend thus knew the true extent of his betrayal.\nBy mid 1895 attempts to raise funds for Gauguin's return to Tahiti had failed, and he began accepting charity from friends. In June 1895 Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re arranged a cheap passage back to Tahiti, and Gauguin never saw Europe again.\nResidence in Tahiti.\nGauguin set out for Tahiti again on 28 June 1895. His return is characterised by Thomson as an essentially negative one, his disillusionment with the Paris art scene compounded by two attacks on him in the same issue of \"Mercure de France\"; one by Emile Bernard, the other by Camille Mauclair. Mathews remarks that his isolation in Paris had become so bitter that he had no choice but to try to reclaim his place in Tahiti society.\nHe arrived in September 1895 and was to spend the next six years living, for the most part, an apparently comfortable life as an artist-\"\" near, or at times in, Papeete. During this time he was able to support himself with an increasingly steady stream of sales and the support of friends and well-wishers, though there was a period of time 1898\u20131899 when he felt compelled to take a desk job in Papeete, of which there is not much record. He built a spacious reed and thatch house at Puna'auia in an affluent area ten miles east of Papeete, settled by wealthy families, in which he installed a large studio, sparing no expense. Jules Agostini, an acquaintance of Gauguin's and an accomplished amateur photographer, photographed the house in 1896. Later a sale of land obliged him to build a new one in the same neighbourhood.\nHe maintained a horse and trap, so was in a position to travel daily to Papeete to participate in the social life of the colony should he wish. He subscribed to the \"Mercure de France\" (indeed was a shareholder), by then France's foremost critical journal, and kept up an active correspondence with fellow artists, dealers, critics, and patrons in Paris. During his year in Papeete and thereafter, he played an increasing role in local politics, contributing abrasively to a local journal opposed to the colonial government, \"Les Gu\u00eapes (The Wasps)\", that had recently been formed, and eventually edited his own monthly publication \"Le Sourire: Journal s\u00e9rieux (The Smile: A Serious Newspaper)\", later titled simply \"Journal m\u00e9chant (A Wicked Newspaper)\". A certain amount of artwork and woodcuts from his newspaper survive. In February 1900 he became the editor of \"Les Gu\u00eapes\" itself, for which he drew a salary, and he continued as editor until he left Tahiti in September 1901. The paper under his editorship was noted for its scurrilous attacks on the governor and officialdom in general, but was not in fact a champion of native causes, although perceived as such nevertheless.\nFor the first year at least he produced no paintings, informing Monfreid that he proposed henceforth to concentrate on sculpture. Few of his wooden carvings from this period survive, most of them collected by Monfreid. Thomson cites \"Oyez Hui Iesu (Christ on the Cross)\", a wooden cylinder half a metre (20\") tall featuring a curious hybrid of religious motifs. The cylinder may have been inspired by similar symbolic carvings in Brittany, such as at Pleumeur-Bodou, where ancient menhirs have been Christianised by local craftsmen. When he resumed painting, it was to continue his long-standing series of sexually charged nudes in paintings such as \"Te tamari no atua (Son of God)\" and \"O Taiti (Nevermore)\". Thomson observes a progression in complexity. Mathews notes a return to Christian symbolism that would have endeared him to the colonists of the time, now anxious to preserve what was left of native culture by stressing the universality of religious principles. In these paintings, Gauguin was addressing an audience amongst his fellow colonists in Papeete, not his former \"avant-garde\" audience in Paris.\nHis health took a decided turn for the worse and he was hospitalised several times for a variety of ailments. While he was in France, he had his ankle shattered in a drunken brawl on a seaside visit to Concarneau. The injury, an open fracture, never healed properly. Then painful and debilitating sores that restricted his movement began erupting up and down his legs, and were treated with arsenic. Gauguin blamed the tropical climate and described the sores as eczema, but some biographers consider that this would have been the progress of syphilis. However, there is no direct evidence that Gauguin suffered from syphilis, and none that he infected any of his lovers, as is sometimes asserted, although he may have had eczema and erysipelas.\nIn April 1897, he received word that his favorite daughter Aline had died from pneumonia. This was also the month he learned he had to vacate his house because its land had been sold. He took out a bank loan to build a much more extravagant wooden house with beautiful views of the mountains and sea. But he overextended himself in so doing, and by the end of the year faced the real prospect of his bank foreclosing on him. Failing health and pressing debts brought him to the brink of despair. At the end of the year he completed his monumental \"Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?\", which he regarded as his masterpiece and final artistic testament (in a letter to Monfreid he explained that he tried to kill himself after finishing it). The painting was exhibited at Vollard's gallery in November the following year, along with eight thematically related paintings he had completed by July. This was his first major exhibition in Paris since his Durand-Ruel show in 1893 and it was a decided success, critics praising his new serenity. \"Where do we come from?\", however, received mixed reviews and Vollard had difficulty selling it. He eventually sold it in 1901 for 2,500 francs (about $10,000 in year 2000 US dollars) to Gabriel Frizeau, of which Vollard's commission was perhaps as much as 500 francs.\nGeorges Chaudet, Gauguin's Paris dealer, died in the fall of 1899. Vollard had been buying Gauguin's paintings through Chaudet and now made an agreement with Gauguin directly. The agreement provided Gauguin a regular monthly advance of 300 francs against a guaranteed purchase of at least 25 unseen paintings a year at 200 francs each, and in addition Vollard undertook to provide him with his art materials. There were some initial problems on both sides, but Gauguin was finally able to realise his long cherished plan of resettling in the Marquesas Islands in search of a yet more primitive society. He spent his final months in Tahiti living in considerable comfort, as attested by the liberality with which he entertained his friends at that time.\nGauguin was unable to continue his work in ceramics in the islands for the simple reason that suitable clay was not available. Similarly, without access to a printing press (\"Le Sourire\" was hectographed), he was obliged to turn to the monotype process in his graphic work. Surviving examples of these prints are rather rare and command very high prices in the saleroom.\nDuring this time Gauguin maintained a relationship with Pahura (Pau'ura) a Tai, the daughter of neighbours in Puna'auia. Gauguin began this relationship when Pau'ura was &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;14+1\u20442 years old. He fathered two children with her, of which a daughter died in infancy. The other, a boy, she raised herself. His descendants still inhabited Tahiti at the time of Mathews' biography. Pahura refused to accompany Gauguin to the Marquesas away from her family in Puna'auia (earlier she had left him when he took work in Papeete just 10 miles away). When the English writer W. Somerset Maugham visited her in 1917, she could offer him no useful memory of Gauguin and chided him for visiting her without bringing money from Gauguin's family.\nMarquesas Islands.\nGauguin had nurtured his plan of settling in the Marquesas ever since seeing a collection of intricately carved Marquesan bowls and weapons in Papeete during his first months in Tahiti. However, he found a society that, as in Tahiti, had lost its cultural identity. Of all the Pacific island groups, the Marquesas were the most affected by the import of Western diseases (especially tuberculosis). An 18th-century population of some 80,000 had declined to just 4,000. Catholic missionaries held sway and, in their effort to control drunkenness and promiscuity, obliged all native children to attend missionary schools into their teens. French colonial rule was enforced by a gendarmerie noted for its malevolence and stupidity, while traders, both Western and Chinese, exploited the natives appallingly.\nGauguin settled in Atuona on the island of Hiva-Oa, arriving 16 September 1901. This was the administrative capital of the island group, but considerably less developed than Papeete although there was an efficient and regular steamer service between the two. There was a military doctor but no hospital. The doctor was relocated to Papeete the following February and thereafter Gauguin had to rely on the island's two health care workers, the Vietnamese exile Nguyen Van Cam (Ky Dong), who had settled on the island but had no formal medical training, and the Protestant pastor Paul Vernier, who had studied medicine in addition to theology. Both of these were to become close friends.\nHe bought a plot of land in the center of the town from the Catholic mission, having first ingratiated himself with the local bishop by attending mass regularly. This bishop was Monseigneur Rogatien-Joseph Martin, initially well disposed to Gauguin because he was aware that Gauguin had sided with the Catholic party in Tahiti in his journalism.\nGauguin built a two-floor house on his plot, sturdy enough to survive a later cyclone that washed away most other dwellings in the town. He was helped in the task by the two best Marquesan carpenters on the island, one of them called Tioka, tattooed from head to toe in the traditional Marquesan way (a tradition suppressed by the missionaries). Tioka was a deacon in Vernier's congregation and became Gauguin's neighbour after the cyclone when Gauguin gifted him a corner of his plot. The ground floor was open-air and used for dining and living, while the top floor was used for sleeping and as his studio. The door to the top floor was decorated with a polychrome wood-carved lintel and jambs that still survive in museums. The lintel named the house as \"Maison du Jouir\" (i.e. \"House of Pleasure\"), while the jambs echoed his earlier 1889 wood-carving \"Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses\" (i.e. \"Be in Love, You Will Be Happy\"). The walls were decorated with, amongst other things, his prized collection of forty-five pornographic photographs he had purchased in Port Said on his way out from France.\nIn the early days at least, until Gauguin found a \"vahine\", the house drew appreciative crowds in the evenings from the natives, who came to stare at the pictures and party half the night away. Needless to say, all this did not endear Gauguin to the bishop, still less when Gauguin erected two sculptures he placed at the foot of his steps lampooning the bishop and a servant reputed to be the bishop's mistress, and yet still less when Gauguin later attacked the unpopular missionary school system. The sculpture of the bishop, \"P\u00e8re Paillard\", is to be found at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, while its pendant piece \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\" realized a record $30,965,000 for a Gauguin sculpture at a Christie's New York 2015 sale. These were among at least eight sculptures that adorned the house according to a posthumous inventory, most of which are lost today. Together they represented a very public attack on the hypocrisy of the church in sexual matters.\nState funding for the missionary schools had ceased as a result of the 1901 Associations Bill promulgated throughout the French empire. The schools continued with difficulty as private institutions, but these difficulties were compounded when Gauguin established that attendance at any given school was only compulsory within a catchment area of some two and a half miles radius. This led to numerous teenage daughters being withdrawn from the schools (Gauguin called this process \"rescuing\"). He took as \"vahine\" one such girl, Vaeoho (also called Marie-Rose), the 14-year-old daughter of a native couple who lived in an adjoining valley six miles distant. This can scarcely have been a pleasant task for her as Gauguin's sores were by then extremely noxious and required daily dressing. Nevertheless, she lived willingly with him and the following year gave birth to a healthy daughter whose descendants continue to live on the island.\nBy November he had settled into his new home with Vaeoho, a cook (Kahui), two other servants (nephews of Tioka), his dog, Pegau (a play on his initials \"PG\"), and a cat. The house itself, although in the center of the town, was set amongst trees and secluded from view. The partying ceased and he began a period of productive work, sending twenty canvases to Vollard the following April. He had thought he would find new motifs in the Marquesas, writing to Monfreid:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think in the Marquesas, where it is easy to find models (a thing that is growing more and more difficult in Tahiti), and with new country to explore \u2013 with new and more savage subject matter in brief \u2013 that I shall do beautiful things. Here my imagination has begun to cool, and then, too, the public has grown so used to Tahiti. The world is so stupid that if one shows it canvases containing new and \"terrible\" elements, Tahiti will become comprehensible and charming. My Brittany pictures are now rose-water because of Tahiti; Tahiti will become eau de Cologne because of the Marquesas.\u2014\u200a In fact, his Marquesas work for the most part can only be distinguished from his Tahiti work by experts or by their dates, paintings such as \"Two Women\" remaining uncertain in their location. For Anna Szech, what distinguishes them is their repose and melancholy, albeit containing elements of disquiet. Thus, in the second of two versions of \"Cavaliers sur la Plage (Riders on the Beach)\", gathering clouds and foamy breakers suggest an impending storm while the two distant figures on grey horses echo similar figures in other paintings that are taken to symbolise death.\nGauguin chose to paint landscapes, still lifes, and figure studies at this time, with an eye to Vollard's clientele, avoiding the primitive and lost paradise themes of his Tahiti paintings. But there is a significant trio of pictures from this last period that suggest deeper concerns. The first two of these are \"Jeune fille \u00e0 l'\u00e9ventail (Young Girl with Fan)\" and \"Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa (Marquesan Man in a Red Cape)\". The model for \"Jeune fille\" was the red-headed Tohotaua, the daughter of a chieftain on a neighbouring island. The portrait appears to have been taken from that Vernier later sent to Vollard. The model for \"Le sorcier\" may have been Haapuani, an accomplished dancer as well as a feared magician, who was a close friend of Gauguin's and, according to Bengt Danielsson, married to Tohotau. Szech notes that the white colour of Tohotau's dress is a symbol of power and death in Polynesian culture, the sitter doing duty for a Maohi culture as a whole threatened with extinction. \"Le Sorcier\" appears to have been executed at the same time and depicts a long-haired young man wearing an exotic red cape. The androgynous nature of the image has attracted critical attention, giving rise to speculation that Gauguin intended to depict a \"m\u0101h\u016b\" (i.e. a third gender person) rather than a \"taua\" or priest. The third picture of the trio is the mysterious and beautiful \"Contes barbares (Primitive Tales)\" featuring Tohotau again at the right. The left figure is Jacob Meyer de Haan, a painter friend of Gauguin's from their Pont-Aven days who had died a few years previously, while the middle figure is again androgynous, identified by some as Haapuani. The Buddha-like pose and the lotus blossoms suggests to Elizabeth Childs that the picture is a meditation on the perpetual cycle of life and the possibility of rebirth. As these paintings reached Vollard after Gauguin's sudden death, nothing is known about Gauguin's intentions in their execution.\nIn March 1902, the governor of French Polynesia, \u00c9douard Petit, arrived in the Marquesas to make an inspection. He was accompanied by \u00c9douard Charlier as head of the judicial system. Charlier was an amateur painter who had been befriended by Gauguin when he first arrived as magistrate at Papeete in 1895. However their relationship had turned to enmity when Charlier refused to prosecute Gauguin's then \"vahine\" Pau'ura for a number of trivial offences, allegedly housebreaking and theft, she had committed at Puna'auia while Gauguin was away working in Papeete. Gauguin had gone so far as to publish an open letter attacking Charlier about the affair in \"Les Gu\u00eapes\". Petit, presumably suitably forewarned, refused to see Gauguin to deliver the settlers' protests (Gauguin their spokesman) about the invidious taxation system, which saw most revenue from the Marquesas spent in Papeete. Gauguin responded in April by refusing to pay his taxes and encouraging the settlers, traders and planters, to do likewise.\nAt around the same time, Gauguin's health began to deteriorate again, revisited by the same familiar constellation of symptoms involving pain in the legs, heart palpitations, and general debility. The pain in his injured ankle grew insupportable and in July he was obliged to order a trap from Papeete so that he could get about town. By September the pain was so extreme that he resorted to morphine injections. However he was sufficiently concerned by the habit he was developing to turn his syringe set over to a neighbour, relying instead on laudanum. His sight was also beginning to fail him, as attested by the spectacles he wears in his last known self-portrait. This was actually a portrait commenced by his friend Ky Dong that he completed himself, thus accounting for its uncharacteristic style. It shows a man tired and aged, yet not entirely defeated. For a while he considered returning to Europe, to Spain, to get treatment. Monfreid advised him:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In returning you will risk damaging that process of incubation which is taking place in the public's appreciation of you. At present you are a unique and legendary artist, sending to us from the remote South Seas disconcerting and inimitable works which are the definitive creations of a great man who, in a way, has already gone from this world. Your enemies \u2013 and like all who upset the mediocrities you have many enemies \u2013 are silent; but they dare not attack you, do not even think of it. You are so far away. You should not return... You are already as unassailable as all the great dead; you already belong to the \"history of art\".\u2014\u200a\nIn July 1902, Vaeoho, by then seven months pregnant, left Gauguin to return home to her neighbouring valley of Hekeani to have her baby amongst family and friends. She gave birth in September but did not return. Gauguin did not subsequently take another \"vahine\". It was at this time that his quarrel with Bishop Martin over missionary schools reached its height. The local gendarme, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charpillet, at first friendly to Gauguin, wrote a report to the administrator of the island group, who resided on the neighbouring island of Nuku Hiva, criticizing Gauguin for encouraging natives to withdraw their children from school as well as encouraging settlers to withhold payment of their taxes. As luck would have it, the post of administrator had recently been filled by Fran\u00e7ois Picquenot, an old friend of Gauguin's from Tahiti and essentially sympathetic to him. Picquenot advised Charpillet not to take any action over the schools issue, since Gauguin had the law on his side, but authorised Charpillet to seize goods from Gauguin in lieu of payment of taxes if all else failed. Possibly prompted by loneliness, and at times unable to paint, Gauguin took to writing.\nIn 1901, the manuscript of \"Noa Noa\" that Gauguin had prepared along with woodcuts during his interlude in France was finally published with Morice's poems in book form in the \"La Plume\" edition (the manuscript itself is now lodged in the Louvre museum). Sections of it (including his account of Teha'amana) had previously been published without woodcuts in 1897 in \"La Revue Blanche\", while he himself had published extracts in \"Les Gu\u00eapes\" while he was editor. The \"La Plume\" edition was planned to include his woodcuts, but he withheld permission to print them on smooth paper as the publishers wished. In truth he had grown uninterested in the venture with Morice and never saw a copy, declining an offer of one hundred complimentary copies. Nevertheless, its publication inspired him to consider writing other books. At the beginning of the year (1902), he had revised an old 1896\u201397 manuscript, \"L'Esprit Moderne et le Catholicisme\" (\"The Modern Spirit and Catholicism\"), on the Roman Catholic Church, adding some twenty pages containing insights gleaned from his dealings with Bishop Martin. He sent this text to Bishop Martin, who responded by sending him an illustrated history of the Church. Gauguin returned the book with critical remarks he later published in his autobiographical reminiscences. He next prepared a witty and well-documented essay, \"Racontars de Rapin\" (\"Tales of a Dabbler\") on critics and art criticism, which he sent for publication to Andr\u00e9 Fontainas, art critic at the \"Mercure de France\" whose favourable review of \"Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?\" had done much to restore his reputation. Fontainas, however, replied that he dared not publish it. It was not subsequently published until 1951.\nOn 27 May that year, the steamer service, \"Croix du Sud,\" was shipwrecked off the Apataki atoll, and for a period of three months the island was left without mail or supplies. When mail service resumed, Gauguin penned an angry attack on Governor Petit in an open letter, complaining amongst other things about the way they had been abandoned following the shipwreck. The letter was published by \"L'Indep\u00e9ndant\", the successor newspaper to \"Les Gu\u00eapes\", that November in Papeete. Petit had in fact followed an independent and pro-native policy, to the disappointment of the Roman Catholic Party, and the newspaper was preparing an attack on him. Gauguin also sent the letter to the \"Mercure de France\", which published a redacted version of it after his death. He followed this with a private letter to the head of the \"gendarmerie\" in Papeete, complaining about his own local gendarme Charpillet's excesses in making prisoners labor for him. Danielsson notes that, while these and similar complaints were well-founded, the motivation for them all was wounded vanity and simple animosity. As it happened, the relatively supportive Charpillet was replaced that December by another gendarme, Jean-Paul Claverie, from Tahiti, much less well disposed to Gauguin and who in fact had fined him in his earliest Mataiea days for public indecency, having caught him bathing naked in a local stream following complaints from the missionaries there.\nHis health further deteriorated in December to the extent that he was scarcely able to paint. He began an autobiographical memoir he called \"Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After)\" (published in translation in the U.S. as \"Intimate Journals\"), which he completed over the next two months. The title referred to his experiences before and after coming to Tahiti and as tribute to his own grandmother's unpublished memoir \"Past and Future\". His memoir proved to be a fragmented collection of observations about life in Polynesia, his own life, and comments on literature and paintings. He included in it attacks on subjects as diverse as the local \"gendarmerie\", Bishop Martin, his wife Mette and the Danes in general, and concluded with a description of his personal philosophy conceiving life as an existential struggle to reconcile opposing binaries. Mathews notes two closing remarks as a distillation of his philosophy:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No one is good; no one is evil; everyone is both, in the same way and in different ways. \u2026 It is so small a thing, the life of a man, and yet there is time to do great things, fragments of the common task.\u2014\u200a He sent the manuscript to Fontainas for editing, but the rights reverted to Mette after Gauguin's death, and it was not published until 1918 (in a facsimile edition); the American translation appearing in 1921.\nDeath.\nAt the beginning of 1903, Gauguin engaged in a campaign designed to expose the incompetence of the island's gendarmes, in particular Jean-Paul Claverie, for taking the side of the natives directly in a case involving the alleged drunkenness of a group of them. Claverie, however, escaped censure. At the beginning of February, Gauguin wrote to the administrator, Fran\u00e7ois Picquenot, alleging corruption by one of Claverie's subordinates. Picquenot investigated the allegations but could not substantiate them. Claverie responded by filing a charge against Gauguin of libeling a gendarme. He was subsequently fined 500 francs and sentenced to three months' imprisonment by the local magistrate on 27 March 1903. Gauguin immediately filed an appeal in Papeete and set about raising the funds to travel to Papeete to hear his appeal.\nAt this time Gauguin was very weak and in great pain and resorted once again to using morphine. He died suddenly on the morning of 8 May 1903.\nEarlier, he had sent for his pastor, Paul Vernier, complaining of fainting fits. They had chatted together, and Vernier had left, believing him in a stable condition. However, Gauguin's neighbour, Tioka, found him dead at 11 o'clock, confirming the fact in the traditional Marquesan way by biting his scalp in an attempt to revive him. By his bedside was an empty bottle of laudanum, which has given rise to speculation that he was the victim of an overdose. Vernier believed he died of a heart attack.\nGauguin was buried in the Catholic Calvary Cemetery (Cimeti\u00e8re Calvaire), Atuona, Hiva 'Oa, at 2\u00a0p.m. the next day. In 1973, a bronze cast of his \"Oviri\" figure was placed on his grave, as he had indicated was his wish. Ironically, his nearest neighbor in the cemetery is Bishop Martin, his grave surmounted by a large white cross. Vernier wrote an account of Gauguin's last days and burial, reproduced in O'Brien's edition of Gauguin's letters to Monfreid.\nWord of Gauguin's death did not reach France (to Monfreid) until 23 August 1903. In the absence of a will, his less valuable effects were auctioned in Atuona while his letters, manuscripts, and paintings were auctioned in Papeete on 5 September 1903. Mathews notes that this speedy dispersal of his effects led to the loss of much valuable information about his later years. Thomson notes that the auction inventory of his effects (some of which were burned as pornography) revealed a life that was not as impoverished or primitive as he had liked to maintain. Mette Gauguin in due course received the proceeds of the auction, some 4,000 francs. One of the paintings auctioned in Papeete was \"Maternit\u00e9 II\", a smaller version of \"Maternit\u00e9 I\" in the Hermitage Museum. The original was painted at the time his then \"vahine,\" Pau'ura, in Puna'auia, gave birth to their son Emile. It is not known why he painted the smaller copy. It was sold for 150 francs to a French naval officer, Commandant Cochin, who said that Governor Petit himself had bid up to 135 francs for the painting. It was sold at Sotheby's for US$39,208,000 in 2004.\nThe Paul Gauguin Cultural Center at Atuona has a reconstruction of the \"Maison du Jouir\". The original house stood empty for a few years, the door still carrying Gauguin's carved lintel. This was eventually recovered, four of the five pieces held at the Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay and the fifth at the Paul Gauguin Museum in Tahiti.\nIn 2007, four rotten molars, which may have been Gauguin's, were found by archaeologists at the bottom of a well that he built on the island of Hiva Oa, on the Marquese Islands. In 2014, forensic examination of these teeth threw into question the conventional belief that Gauguin had suffered from syphilis. DNA examination established that the teeth were almost certainly Gauguin's, but no traces were found of cadmium, mercury, or arsenic, \"the standard treatment for syphilis at the time\", suggesting either that Gauguin did not suffer from syphilis or that he was not being treated for it.\nChildren.\nGauguin outlived three of his children; his favorite daughter Aline died of pneumonia, his son Clovis died of a blood infection following a hip operation, and a daughter, whose birth was portrayed in Gauguin's painting of 1896 \"Te tamari no atua\", the child of Gauguin's young Tahitian mistress, Pau'ura, died only a few days after her birth on Christmas Day 1896. His son, \u00c9mile Gauguin, worked as a construction engineer in the U.S. and is buried in Lemon Bay Historical Cemetery, in Florida. Another son, Jean Ren\u00e9, became a well-known sculptor and a staunch socialist. He died on 21 April 1961 in Copenhagen. Pola (Paul Rollon) became an artist and art critic and wrote a memoir, \"My Father, Paul Gauguin\" (1937). \nGauguin had several other children by his mistresses: Germaine (born 1891) with Juliette Huais (1866\u20131955); \u00c9mile Marae a Tai (born 1899) with Pau'ura; and a daughter (born 1902) with Vaeoho (Marie-Rose). There is some speculation that the Belgian artist, Germaine Chardon, was Gauguin's daughter. Emile Marae a Tai, illiterate and raised in Tahiti by Pau'ura, was brought to Chicago in 1963 by the French journalist Josette Giraud and was an artist in his own right, his descendants still living in Tahiti as of 2001.\nHistorical significance.\nPrimitivism was an art movement of late 19th-century painting and sculpture, characterized by exaggerated body proportions, animal totems, geometric designs, and stark contrasts. The first artist to systematically use these effects and achieve broad public success was Paul Gauguin. The European cultural elite, discovering the art of Africa, Micronesia, and Native Americans for the first time, were fascinated, intrigued, and educated by the newness, wildness, and the stark power embodied in the art of those faraway places. Like Pablo Picasso in the early days of the 20th century, Gauguin was inspired and motivated by the raw power and simplicity of the so-called Primitive Art of those foreign cultures.\nGauguin is also considered a Post-Impressionist painter. His bold, colourful, and design oriented paintings significantly influenced Modern art. Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Fauvism, Cubism, and Orphism, among others. Later, he influenced Arthur Frank Mathews and the American Arts and Crafts movement.\nJohn Rewald, recognized as a foremost authority on late 19th-century art, wrote a series of books about the Post-Impressionist period, including \"Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin\" (1956) and an essay, \"Paul Gauguin: Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr\u00e9 Fontainas\" (included in Rewald's \"Studies in Post-Impressionism\", 1986), discusses Gauguin's years in Tahiti and the struggles of his survival as seen through correspondence with the art dealer Vollard and others.\nInfluence on Picasso.\nGauguin's posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903, and an even larger one in 1906, had a stunning and powerful influence on the French avant-garde and in particular Pablo Picasso's paintings. In the autumn of 1906, Picasso made paintings of oversized nude women and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art. Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting, and his writing as well. The power evoked by Gauguin's work led directly to \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" in 1907.\nAccording to Gauguin biographer, David Sweetman, Picasso, as early as 1902, became a fan of Gauguin's work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio, in Paris. Durrio had several of Gauguin's works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work. Durrio tried to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris. After they met, Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin's stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces, and gave Picasso a first \"La Plume\" edition of \"Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin.\" In addition to seeing Gauguin's work at Durrio's, Picasso also saw the work at Ambroise Vollard's gallery where both he and Gauguin were represented.\nConcerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, John Richardson wrote: The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art\u2014not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides\u2014could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor.\nBoth David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin sculpture called \"Oviri\" (literally meaning 'savage'), the gruesome phallic figure of the Tahitian goddess of life and death that was intended for Gauguin's grave, exhibited in the 1906 retrospective exhibition that even more directly led to \"Les Demoiselles.\" Sweetman writes, \"Gauguin's statue \"Oviri,\" which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\".\"\nAccording to Richardson, Picasso's interest in stoneware was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome \"Oviri.\" Until 1987, when the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the \"Demoiselles.\" Although just under 30 inches high, \"Oviri\" has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by \"Oviri.\" 50 years later he was delighted when [Douglas] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to Primitivism.\nTechnique and style.\nGauguin's initial artistic guidance was from Pissarro, but the relationship left more of a mark personally than stylistically. Gauguin's masters were Giotto, Raphael, Ingres, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Manet, Degas, and C\u00e9zanne. His own beliefs, and in some cases the psychology behind his work, were also influenced by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer and poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9.\nGauguin, like some of his contemporaries such as Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, employed a technique for painting on canvas known as \"peinture \u00e0 l'essence\". For this, the oil (binder) is drained from the paint and the remaining sludge of pigment is mixed with turpentine. He may have used a similar technique in preparing his monotypes, using paper instead of metal, as it would absorb oil giving the final images a matte appearance he desired. He also proofed some of his existing drawings with the aid of glass, copying an underneath image onto the glass surface with watercolour or gouache for printing. Gauguin's woodcuts were no less innovative, even to the avant-garde artists responsible for the woodcut revival happening at that time. Instead of incising his blocks with the intent of making a detailed illustration, Gauguin initially chiseled his blocks in a manner similar to wood sculpture, followed by finer tools to create detail and tonality within his bold contours. Many of his tools and techniques were considered experimental. This methodology and use of space ran parallel to his painting of flat, decorative reliefs.\nStarting in Martinique, Gauguin began using analogous colours in close proximity to achieve a muted effect. Shortly after this, he also made his breakthroughs in non-representational colour, creating canvases that had an independent existence and vitality all their own. This gap between surface reality and himself displeased Pissarro and quickly led to the end of their relationship. His human figures at this time are also a reminder of his love affair with Japanese prints, particularly gravitating to the naivety of their figures and compositional austerity as an influence on his primitive manifesto. For that very reason, Gauguin was also inspired by folk art. He sought out a bare emotional purity of his subjects conveyed in a straightforward way, emphasizing major forms and upright lines to clearly define shape and contour. \nGauguin also used elaborate formal decoration and colouring in patterns of abstraction, attempting to harmonize man and nature. His depictions of the natives in their natural environment are frequently evident of serenity and a self-contained sustainability. This complemented one of Gauguin's favorite themes, which was the intrusion of the supernatural into day-to-day life, in one instance going so far as to recall ancient Egyptian tomb reliefs with \"Her Name is Vairaumati\" and \"Ta Matete\".\nIn an interview with L'\u00c9cho de Paris published on 15 March 1895, Gauguin explains that his developing tactical approach is reaching for synesthesia. He states:\nEvery feature in my paintings is carefully considered and calculated in advance. Just as in a musical composition, if you like. My simple object, which I take from daily life or from nature, is merely a pretext, which helps me by the means of a definite arrangement of lines and colours to create symphonies and harmonies. They have no counterparts at all in reality, in the vulgar sense of that word; they do not give direct expression to any idea, their only purpose is to stimulate the imagination\u2014just as music does without the aid of ideas or pictures\u2014simply by that mysterious affinity which exists between certain arrangements of colours and lines and our minds.\nIn an 1888 letter to Schuffenecker, Gauguin explains the enormous step he had taken away from Impressionism and that he was now intent on capturing the soul of nature, the ancient truths and character of its scenery and inhabitants. Gauguin wrote:\nDon't copy nature too literally. Art is an abstraction. Derive it from nature as you dream in nature's presence, and think more about the act of creation than the outcome.\nOther media.\nGauguin began making prints in 1889, highlighted by a series of zincographs commissioned by Theo van Gogh known as the \"Volpini Suite\", which also appeared in the Cafe des Arts show of 1889. Gauguin was not hindered by his printing inexperience, and made a number of provocative and unorthodox choices, such as a zinc plate instead of limestone (lithography), wide margins and large sheets of yellow poster paper. The result was vivid to the point of garish, but foreshadows his more elaborate experiments with colour printing and intent to elevate monochromatic images. \nHis first masterpieces of printing were from the \"Noa Noa Suite\" of 1893\u201394 where he was one of a number of artists reinventing the technique of the woodcut, bringing it into the modern era. He started the series shortly after returning from Tahiti, eager to reclaim a leadership position within the avant-garde and share pictures based on his French Polynesia excursion. These woodcuts were shown at his unsuccessful 1893 show at Paul Durand-Ruel's, and most were directly related to paintings of his in which he had revised the original composition. They were shown again at a small show in his studio in 1894, where he garnered rare critical praise for his exceptional painterly and sculptural effects. Gauguin's emerging preference for the woodcut was not only a natural extension of his wood reliefs and sculpture, but may have also been provoked by its historical significance to medieval artisans and the Japanese.\nGauguin started making watercolour monotypes in 1894, likely overlapping his \"Noa Noa\" woodcuts, perhaps even serving as a source of inspiration for them. His techniques remained innovative and it was an apt technique for him as it did not require elaborate equipment, such as a printing press. Despite often being a source of practice for related paintings, sculptures or woodcuts, his monotype innovation offers a distinctly ethereal aesthetic; ghostly afterimages that may express his desire to convey the immemorial truths of nature. His next major woodcut and monotype project was not until 1898\u201399, known as the \"Vollard Suite\". He completed this enterprising series of 475 prints from some twenty different compositions and sent them to the dealer Ambroise Vollard, despite not compromising to his request for salable, conformed work. Vollard was unsatisfied and made no effort to sell them. Gauguin's series is starkly unified with black and white aesthetic and may have intended the prints to be similar to a set of myriorama cards, in which they may be laid out in any order to create multiple panoramic landscapes. This activity of arranging and rearranging was similar to his own process of repurposing his images and motifs, as well as a symbolism tendency. He printed the work on tissue-thin Japanese paper and the multiple proofs of gray and black could be arranged on top of one another, each transparency of colour showing through to produce a rich, chiaroscuro effect.\nIn 1899 he started his radical experiment: oil transfer drawings. Much like his watercolour monotype technique, it was a hybrid of drawing and printmaking. The transfers were the grand culmination of his quest for an aesthetic of primordial suggestion, which seems to be relayed in his results that echo ancient rubbings, worn frescos and cave paintings. Gauguin's technical progress from monotyping to the oil transfers is quite noticeable, advancing from small sketches to ambitiously large, highly finished sheets. With these transfers he created depth and texture by printing multiple layers onto the same sheet, beginning with graphite pencil and black ink for delineation, before moving to blue crayon to reinforce line and add shading. He would often complete the image with a wash of oiled-down olive or brown ink. The practice consumed Gauguin until his death, fueling his imagination and conception of new subjects and themes for his paintings. This collection was also sent to Vollard who remained unimpressed. \nGauguin prized oil transfers for the way they transformed the quality of drawn line. His process, nearly alchemical in nature, had elements of chance by which unexpected marks and textures regularly arose, something that fascinated him. In metamorphosing a drawing into a print, Gauguin made a calculated decision of relinquishing legibility in order to gain mystery and abstraction.\nHe worked in wood throughout his career, particularly during his most prolific periods, and is known for having achieved radical carving results before doing so with painting. Even in his earliest shows, Gauguin often included wood sculpture in his display, from which he built his reputation as a connoisseur of the so-called primitive. A number of his early carvings appear to be influenced by Gothic and Egyptian art. In correspondence, he also asserts a passion for Cambodian art and the masterful colouring of Persian carpet and Oriental rug.\nLegacy.\nThe vogue for Gauguin's work started soon after his death. Many of his later paintings were acquired by the Russian collector Sergei Shchukin. A substantial part of his collection is displayed in the Pushkin Museum and the Hermitage. Gauguin paintings are rarely offered for sale, their prices reaching tens of millions of US dollars when they are offered. His 1892 \"Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?)\" became the world's third-most expensive artwork when its owner, the family of Rudolf Staechelin, sold it privately for US$210\u00a0million in September 2014. The buyer is believed to be the Qatar Museums.\nThe Japanese styled Gauguin Museum, opposite the Botanical Gardens of Papeari in Papeari, Tahiti, contains some exhibits, documents, photographs, reproductions and original sketches and block prints of Gauguin and Tahitians. In 2003, the Paul Gauguin Cultural Center opened in Atuona in the Marquesas Islands.\nIn 2014 the painting \"Fruits on a Table\" (1889), with an estimated value of between \u20ac10m and \u20ac30m (\u00a38.3m to \u00a324.8m), which had been stolen in London in 1970, was discovered in Italy. The painting, together with a work by Pierre Bonnard, had been bought by a Fiat employee in 1975, at a railway lost property sale, for 45,000 lira (about \u00a332).\nGauguin and colonialism.\nIn the 21st century, Gauguin's Primitivist representations of Tahiti and its people have been a subject of controversy and renewed scholarly attention. His depictions of Polynesian women have been described as \"racial fantasy forged from a position of patriarchal, colonialist power\" with some critics pointing to Gauguin's sexual relationships with teenage Tahitian girls.\nIn contrast, a 2025 biography \"Wild Thing: A Life of Paul Gauguin\" by Sue Prideaux describes Gauguin as believing in gender and culture equity, following local Polynesian customs, having the approval of his Danish wife with respect to his works, and as a defender of the locals against the French colonialist oppression.\nGallery.\nFor a comprehensive list of paintings by Gauguin, see List of paintings by Paul Gauguin.\nSelf-portraits:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences and sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some species can grow to tall or more, with a straight, largely branchless trunk that culminates in a huge, spreading canopy, and buttress roots that can be taller than a grown person. The best-known, and most widely cultivated, species is kapok, \"Ceiba pentandra\", one of several trees known as \"kapok\". \"Ceiba\" is a word from the Ta\u00edno language meaning \"boat\" because Ta\u00ednos use the wood to build their dugout canoes.\n\"Ceiba\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including the leaf-miner \"Bucculatrix ceibae\", which feeds exclusively on the genus.\nRecent botanical opinion incorporates \"Chorisia\" within \"Ceiba\" and puts the genus as a whole within the family Malvaceae.\nCulture and history.\nThe tree plays an important part in the mythologies of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. In addition, several Amazonian tribes of eastern Peru believe deities live in Ceiba tree species throughout the jungle. The Ceiba, or ya\u2019axch\u00e9 (in the Mopan Mayan language), symbolised to the Maya civilization an axis mundi which connects the planes of the Underworld (Xibalba) and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm. This concept of a central world tree is often depicted as a Ceiba trunk. The unmistakable thick conical thorns in clusters on the trunk were reproduced by the southern lowland Maya of the Classical Period on cylindrical ceramic burial urns or incense holders.\nModern Maya still often respectfully leave the tree standing when harvesting forest timber. The Ceiba tree is represented by a cross and serves as an important architectural motif in the Temple of the Cross Complex at Palenque.\nCeiba Tree Park is located in San Ant\u00f3n, in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Its centerpiece is the historic Ceiba de Ponce, a 500-year-old \"Ceiba pentandra\" tree associated with the founding of the city. In the surroundings of the legendary Ceiba de Ponce, broken pieces of indigenous pottery, shells, and stones were found to confirm the presence of Taino Indians long before the Spaniards that later settled in the area. In 1525, Spanish Conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s ordered the hanging of Aztec emperor Cuauhtemoc from a \"Ceiba\" tree after overtaking his empire. The town of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico was founded in 1528 by the Spanish around La Pochota, \"Ceiba pentandra\", according to tradition. Founded in 1838, the Puerto Rican town of Ceiba is also named after this tree. The Honduran city of La Ceiba founded in 1877 was named after a particular \"Ceiba\" tree that grew down by the old docks. In 1898, the Spanish Army in Cuba surrendered to the United States under a \"Ceiba\", which was named the Santiago Surrender Tree, outside of Santiago de Cuba.\n\"Ceiba\" is also the national tree of Guatemala. The most important Ceiba in Guatemala is known as La Ceiba de Pal\u00edn Escuintla which is over 400 years old. In Caracas, Venezuela there is a 100-year-old ceiba tree in front of the San Francisco Church known as La Ceiba de San Francisco and is an important element in the history of the city. The towering specimen near the town of Sabalito, Costa Rica, is a relict tree called \"la ceiba\" by residents and a survivor of one of the highest terrestrial rates of tropical deforestation.\n\"Ceiba pentandra\" produces a light and strong fiber (kapok) used throughout history to fill mattresses, pillows, tapestries, and dolls. Kapok has recently been replaced in commercial use by synthetic fibers. The Ceiba tree seed is used to extract oils used to make soap and fertilizers. The Ceiba continues to be commercialized in Asia, especially in Java, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\"Ceiba pentandra\" is the central theme in the book titled, The Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry. \"Ceiba insignis\" and \"Ceiba speciosa\" are added to some versions of the hallucinogenic drink Ayahuasca.\nPablo Antonio Cuadra, a Nicaraguan poet, wrote a chapter about the Ceiba tree. He used it as a symbol of the Nicaraguan ancestral roots, a cradle for the nation, and source during the people's exile.\nSpecies.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]], Plants of the World Online accepts 21 species:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The file specification was introduced by Esri.\nFilename extension.\nThe base filename of a world file matches the raster's base filename, but has a different filename extension (suffix). There are three filename extension naming conventions used for world files, with variable support across software.\nOne simple convention with widespread support is to append the letter \"w\" to the end of the raster filename. For example, a raster named \"mymap\".jpg should have a world file named \"mymap\".jpgw.\nAn alternative file naming convention that uses a three-character extension to conform to the 8.3 file naming convention uses the first and last character of the raster file's extension, followed by \"w\" at the end. For example, here are a few naming conventions for popular raster formats:\nA third convention is to use a .wld file extension, irrespective of the type of raster file, as supported by GDAL and QGIS, but not Esri.\nContent.\nThe generic meaning of the six parameters in a world file (as defined by Esri) is:\nThis description is however misleading in that the \"D\" and \"B\" parameters are not angular rotations, and that the \"A\" and \"E\" parameters do not correspond to the pixel size if \"D\" or \"B\" are not zero. The \"A\", \"D\", \"B\" and \"E\" parameters are sometimes named \"x-scale\", \"y-skew\", \"x-skew\" and \"y-scale\".\nA better description of the \"A\", \"D\", \"B\" and \"E\" parameters is:\nAll four parameters are expressed in the map units, which are described by the spatial reference system for the raster.\nWhen \"D\" or \"B\" are non-zero the pixel width is given by:\nformula_1\nand the pixel height by\nformula_2\nWorld files describing a map on the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system (UTM) use these conventions:\nThe above description applies also to a rectangular, non-rotated image which might be, for example, overlaid on an orthogonally projected map. If the world file describes an image that is rotated from the axis of the target projection, however, then A, D, B and E must be derived from the required affine transformation (see below). Specifically, A and E will no longer be the meter/pixel measurement on their respective axes.\nThese values are used in a six-parameter affine transformation:\nformula_3\nwhich can be written as this set of equations:\nformula_4\nwhere:\n\"x\"' is the calculated UTM easting of the pixel on the map\n\"y\"' is the calculated UTM northing of the pixel on the map\n\"x\" is the column number of the pixel in the image counting from left\n\"y\" is the row number of the pixel in the image counting from top\n\"A\" or \"x\"-scale; dimension of a pixel in map units in \"x\"-direction\n\"B\", \"D\" are rotation terms\n\"C\", \"F\" are translation terms: \"x\", \"y\" map coordinates of the center of the upper-left pixel\n\"E\" is negative of \"y\"-scale: dimension of a pixel in map units in \"y\"-direction\nThe \"y\"-scale (\"E\") is negative because the origins of an image and the UTM coordinate system are different. The origin of an image is located in the upper-left corner, whereas the origin of the map coordinate system is located in the lower-left corner. Row values in the image increase from the origin downward, while \"y\"-coordinate values in the map increase from the origin upward. Many mapping programs are unable to handle \"upside down\" images (i.e. those with a positive \"y\"-scale).\nTo go from UTM(x'y') to pixel position(x,y) one can use the equation:\nformula_5\nExample:\nOriginal codice_1 is 800\u00d7600 pixels (map not shown).\nIts world file is codice_2 and contains:\n 32.0\n 0.0\n 0.0\n -32.0\n 691200.0\n 4576000.0\nThe position of Falkner Island light on the map image is:\n x = 171 pixels from left\n y = 343 pixels from top\nThis gives:\n x1 = 696672 meters Easting\n y1 = 4565024 meters Northing\nThe UTM (grid) zone is not given so the coordinates are ambiguous \u2014 they can represent a position in any of the approximately 120 UTM grid zones.

Four parchment leaves and a further quarter of a page have been preserved (i.e., folia 78, 158, 159, 160, and 161, comprising nine pages altogether). They consist of three texts in the oldest Slovene dialect. Linguistic, stylistic and contextual analyses reveal that these are church texts of careful composition and literary form.\nThe precise date of the origin of the Freising manuscripts cannot be exactly determined; the original text was probably written in the 9th century. In this liturgic and homiletic manuscript, three Slovene records were found and this miscellany was probably an episcopal manual (pontificals). The Freising manuscripts in it were created between 972 and 1039, most likely before 1000. The main support for this dating is the writing, which was used in the centuries after Charlemagne and is named Carolingian minuscule.\nDuring the time of the writing of the two manuscripts (sermons on sin and repentance, a confessional form), Bishop Abraham was active (from 957 to 994) in Freising. It is believed that the manuscripts were written in the M\u00f6ll Valley in Carinthia. For this reason some linguists (e.g. Jernej Kopitar and Rajko Nahtigal) linked Abraham closely to the origin of the Freising manuscripts and even attributed to him the authorship of one of the texts and suspected that he was of Slovene origin, although this was later disproven.\nModern history.\nThe manuscripts were discovered in Freising, Bavaria. The Slovene name \"Bri\u017einski spomeniki\" (literally 'Bri\u017einj Monuments') was coined by the Carinthian Slovene philologist Anton Jane\u017ei\u010d, who Slovenized the German name Freising to \"Bri\u017einj\" in 1854. In 1803, the manuscript came to the Bavarian State Library in Munich and the Freising manuscripts were discovered there in 1807. The texts were translated into modern Slovene in 1854 by Anton Jane\u017ei\u010d. Before World War II, a facsimile of the Freising manuscripts was published by Silvester \u0160kerl at \"Akademska zalo\u017eba\" (Academic Publisher) in Ljubljana.\nExhibitions.\nThe manuscripts are still kept at the Bavarian State Library in Munich and have left it only twice. In the 1970s, they were exhibited in the Vatican Museums. In May and June 2004, they were exhibited at the National and University Library in Ljubljana.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

K Rock operates a mainstream Top 40 playlist and also airs Australian Football League matches involving the Geelong Football Club.\nK Rock shares transmitter facilities with sister station 93.9 Bay FM (along with 94.7 The Pulse and 96.3 Rhema FM), broadcasting from a transmitter on top of Murradoc Hill on the Bellarine Peninsula. The license area covers the Greater Geelong area, Werribee and Western Melbourne, The Golden Plains, and the Surf Coast. K Rock also streams online via their website.\nThe station was originally known as 3GL and broadcast on the AM band, most famously 1341 AM from 1978 onwards. In 1990, it was transferred to 95.5 on the FM band and changed its name to K-Rock. In 2023, 3GL was revived on 1341 AM and now broadcasts as its own station independent of K-Rock.\nHistory.\n3GL original run (1930 - 1990).\nFrom 1930 to 1990, K Rock was known as 3GL on the AM band, broadcasting first on 1400\u00a0kHz, then 1350\u00a0kHz and later 1341\u00a0kHz. Although based in Geelong, it was notable for being received over most of the Melbourne metropolitan area. \n3GL gave Happy Hammond his start in broadcasting in 1948 as a breakfast announcer. While at 3GL, Hammond also made his first TV appearance in 1948, long before the Tarax Show, as part of an exhibition using closed-circuit TV equipment for trial purposes. Towards the end of its time as an AM station, 3GL used the \"3GL on the West Coast\" slogan and associated jingles, many sung by Mike Brady.\nFor many years, 3GL was based in James Street, Geelong, but relocated after being granted the right to convert to the FM band in 1990.\n3GL was offered an FM conversion upon the entry to the Geelong market of competitor BAY FM in December 1989. 3GL converted to FM to allow equal competition in the Geelong regional market, with the management of the former Geelong AM service agreeing to transfer the service to the FM band in 1990. The station was going to drop the 3GL call sign in favour of 3CAT (after the Geelong Cats), as proposed by the radio station's head of football commentary Ted Whitten (who at the time was in the early stages of his battle with cancer). However, the official call sign, 3CAT-FM has never been used on-air. Instead, a decision was made to adopt the moniker K-Rock for the station's commencement on the FM band at 95.5\u00a0MHz, on 27 January 1990.\nK Rock (1990 - present).\nAfter simulcasting on both 1341 AM and 95.5 FM for two weeks, K Rock went to air at midday on the Saturday of the Australia Day weekend 1990, the first announcer to speak on the new FM station was Ian 'Strawny' Strachan.\nK Rock was also among the first commercial FM stations to cover AFL football, along with 3KKZ (KZFM) the same year. The lineup included Ted Whitten, Sam Kekovich, Billy Brownless and Dwayne Russell, K Rock continues to focus on Geelong Football Club matches.\nOriginally owned by Hoyts, which operated Triple M brand in Australia, K Rock was sold to Grant Broadcasters in the mid-1990s. Shortly after this, the station purchased the rival Geelong station, 93.9 Bay FM, moving it from its Ryrie Street studios to co-locate in the K Rock studios in Moorabool Street, Geelong. Both K Rock and Bay FM now operate from the same studios in Geelong's CBD.\nIn 2007, K Rock celebrated 75 years of broadcasting 3GL and K Rock Footy, culminating in a week of broadcasting at various events as the city celebrated the first AFL Premiership victory by the Geelong Football Club in 44 years.\nIn 2010, K Rock underwent a major format change which re-focused the music toward a younger audience and minimised the station's traditional rock base. In later years, K Rock would take the ARN Regional music log, which is heard on ARN's regional stations including Power FM 103.1.\n3GL revival (2023 - present).\nIn 2023, 3GL was reactivated on the original 1341 AM frequency with a \"classic hits\" format. Test transmissions commenced intermittently in December 2023, using the station ID sweepers from the 70's and 80's \"West Coast's 3GL 1341\" and \"Classic Hits 3GL Geelong\", then continuously from New Years Day 2024. The station officially relaunched on 1 April 2024 under the slogan \"Hits and Memories\". It continues to broadcast in its new form as a separate station from K-Rock.\nK Rock Football.\nK Rock only commentates on every home and away and finals matches involving the Geelong Cats plus most other finals including the Grand Final from Melbourne. The station also covers the match of the round from the Geelong Football Netball League.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He sided with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz during the Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy and was an early proponent of Leibnizian calculus, to which he made numerous contributions. A member of the Bernoulli family, he, along with his brother Johann, was one of the founders of the calculus of variations. He also discovered the fundamental mathematical constant e. However, his most important contribution was in the field of probability, where he derived the first version of the law of large numbers in his work \"Ars Conjectandi\".\nBiography.\nJacob Bernoulli was born in Basel in the Swiss Confederation; the son and grandson of Protestant spice merchants on his father's side, his mother was born into a family engaged in banking and city governing.\nFollowing his father's wish, he studied theology and entered the ministry. But contrary to the desires of his parents, he also studied mathematics and astronomy. He traveled throughout Europe from 1676 to 1682, learning about the latest discoveries in mathematics and the sciences under leading figures of the time. This included the work of Johannes Hudde, Robert Boyle, and Robert Hooke. During this time he also produced an incorrect theory of comets.\nBernoulli returned to Switzerland, and began teaching mechanics at the University of Basel from 1683. His doctoral dissertation \"Solutionem tergemini problematis\" was submitted in 1684. It appeared in print in 1687.\nIn 1684, Bernoulli married Judith Stupanus; they had two children. During this decade, he also began a fertile research career. His travels allowed him to establish correspondence with many leading mathematicians and scientists of his era, which he maintained throughout his life. During this time, he studied the new discoveries in mathematics, including Christiaan Huygens's \"De ratiociniis in aleae ludo\", Descartes' \"La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\" and Frans van Schooten's supplements of it. He also studied Isaac Barrow and John Wallis, leading to his interest in infinitesimal geometry. Apart from these, it was between 1684 and 1689 that many of the results that were to make up \"Ars Conjectandi\" were discovered.\nPeople believe he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Basel in 1687, remaining in this position for the rest of his life. By that time, he had begun tutoring his brother Johann Bernoulli on mathematical topics. The two brothers began to study the calculus as presented by Leibniz in his 1684 paper on the differential calculus in \"Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis\" published in \"Acta Eruditorum\". They also studied the publications of von Tschirnhaus. It must be understood that Leibniz's publications on the calculus were very obscure to mathematicians of that time and the Bernoullis were among the first to try to understand and apply Leibniz's theories.\nJacob collaborated with his brother on various applications of calculus. However the atmosphere of collaboration between the two brothers turned into rivalry as Johann's own mathematical genius began to mature, with both of them attacking each other in print, and posing difficult mathematical challenges to test each other's skills. By 1697, the relationship had completely broken down.\nThe lunar crater Bernoulli is also named after him jointly with his brother Johann.\nImportant works.\nJacob Bernoulli's first important contributions were a pamphlet on the parallels of logic and algebra published in 1685, work on probability in 1685 and geometry in 1687. His geometry result gave a construction to divide any triangle into four equal parts with two perpendicular lines.\nBy 1689, he had published important work on infinite series and published his law of large numbers in probability theory. Jacob Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between 1682 and 1704. The first two of these contained many results, such as the fundamental result that formula_1 diverges, which Bernoulli believed were new but they had actually been proved by Pietro Mengoli 40 years earlier and was proved by Nicole Oresme in the 14th century already. Bernoulli could not find a closed form for formula_2, but he did show that it converged to a finite limit less than 2. Euler was the first to find the limit of this series in 1737. Bernoulli also studied the exponential series which came out of examining compound interest.\nIn May 1690, in a paper published in \"Acta Eruditorum\", Jacob Bernoulli showed that the problem of determining the isochrone is equivalent to solving a first-order nonlinear differential equation. The isochrone, or curve of constant descent, is the curve along which a particle will descend under gravity from any point to the bottom in exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. It had been studied by Huygens in 1687 and Leibniz in 1689. After finding the differential equation, Bernoulli then solved it by what we now call separation of variables. Jacob Bernoulli's paper of 1690 is important for the history of calculus, since the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning. In 1696, Bernoulli solved the equation, now called the Bernoulli differential equation,\nformula_3\nJacob Bernoulli also discovered a general method to determine evolutes of a curve as the envelope of its circles of curvature. He also investigated caustic curves and in particular he studied these associated curves of the parabola, the logarithmic spiral and epicycloids around 1692. The lemniscate of Bernoulli was first conceived by Jacob Bernoulli in 1694. In 1695, he investigated the drawbridge problem which seeks the curve required so that a weight sliding along the cable always keeps the drawbridge balanced.\nBernoulli's most original work was \"Ars Conjectandi\", published in Basel in 1713, eight years after his death. The work was incomplete at the time of his death but it is still a work of the greatest significance in the theory of probability. The book also covers other related subjects, including a review of combinatorics, in particular the work of van Schooten, Leibniz, and Prestet, as well as the use of Bernoulli numbers in a discussion of the exponential series. Inspired by Huygens' work, Bernoulli also gives many examples on how much one would expect to win playing various games of chance. The term Bernoulli trial resulted from this work.\nIn the last part of the book, Bernoulli sketches many areas of mathematical probability, including probability as a measurable degree of certainty; necessity and chance; moral versus mathematical expectation; a priori and a posteriori probability; expectation of winning when players are divided according to dexterity; regard of all available arguments, their valuation, and their calculable evaluation; and the law of large numbers.\nBernoulli was one of the most significant promoters of the formal methods of higher analysis. Astuteness and elegance are seldom found in his method of presentation and expression, but there is a maximum of integrity.\nDiscovery of the mathematical constant \"e\".\nIn 1683, Bernoulli discovered the constant e by studying a question about compound interest which required him to find the value of the following expression (which is in fact \"e\"):\nformula_4\nOne example is an account that starts with $1.00 and pays 100 percent interest per year. If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value is $2.00; but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year, the $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00\u00d71.52\u00a0=\u00a0$2.25. Compounding quarterly yields $1.00\u00d71.254\u00a0=\u00a0$2.4414..., and compounding monthly yields $1.00\u00d7(1.0833...)12\u00a0=\u00a0$2.613035...\nBernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) for more and smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly yields $2.692597..., while compounding daily yields $2.714567..., just two cents more. Using \"n\" as the number of compounding intervals, with interest of 100% / \"n\" in each interval, the limit for large \"n\" is the number that Euler later named \"e\"; with \"continuous\" compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818... More generally, an account that starts at $1, and yields (1+R) dollars at compound interest, will yield \"e\"R dollars with continuous compounding.\nTombstone.\nBernoulli wanted a logarithmic spiral and the motto \"Eadem mutata resurgo\" ('Although changed, I rise again the same') engraved on his tombstone. He wrote that the self-similar spiral \"may be used as a symbol, either of fortitude and constancy in adversity, or of the human body, which after all its changes, even after death, will be restored to its exact and perfect self\". Bernoulli died in 1705, but an Archimedean spiral was engraved rather than a logarithmic one.\nTranslation of Latin inscription:\nJacob Bernoulli, the incomparable mathematician. \nProfessor at the University of Basel For more than 18 years; \nmember of the Royal Academies of Paris and Berlin; famous for his writings.\nOf a chronic illness, of sound mind to the end; \nsuccumbed in the year of grace 1705, the 16th of August, at the age of 50 years and 7 months, awaiting the resurrection. \nJudith Stupanus, \nhis wife for 20 years, \nand his two children have erected a monument to the husband and father they miss so much.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64746", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64746", "title": "Stanley Lord", "text": "English sea captain\nStanley Phillip Lord (13 September 1877 \u2013 24 January 1962) was the British captain of the SS \"Californian\" on the night the RMS \"Titanic\" sank on 15 April 1912. The ship, which was primarily a freighter that could carry a small number of passengers, has been named in sources as the unidentified ship that failed to come to the aid of the foundering \"Titanic\". On the eve of the sinking, Captain Lord had stopped the \"Californian\" for night when it had entered an ice field to away from the White Star liner's final position. Over the next few hours, crew members on Lord's ship reported seeing white rockets on the horizon, something Lord ascribed to company signals. The sinking of the \"Titanic\" resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people.\nLord and \"Californian\" only became aware of the disaster the following morning when wireless signals were received from the SS \"Frankfurt\". Despite remaining in the area to help recover bodies, Lord and the \"Californian\" were criticised for not rendering timely assistance to the \"Titanic\". Both the United States and British inquiries concluded Lord was captain of the ship that was closest to the \"Titanic\" at the time of its sinking. However, neither suggested he should face any criminal charges. Subsequent authors have offered differing opinions on Lord that night, with some defending and others criticising him; resulting in two factions now labelled as \"Lordites\" or \"Anti-Lordites\".\nThe debate about Lord focuses on several factors, these include his response to the rockets, whether his ship and the \"Titanic\" (and its rockets) were visible to one another, the presence of one or more \"Mystery Ships\" between the \"Californian\" and the sinking liner, and whether or not Lord could have saved any additional lives while his ship was stuck in its own ice field.\nEarly life.\nLord was born on 13 September 1877 in Bolton, Lancashire, England. He began his training at sea when he was thirteen, aboard the barque \"Naiad\", in March 1891. He later obtained his Second Mate\u2019s Certificate of competency and served as Second Officer on the barque \"Lurlei\".\nIn February 1901, at the age of 23, Lord obtained his Master's Certificate, and three months later, obtained his Extra Master's Certificate. He entered the service of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1897. The company was taken over by the Leyland Line in 1900, but Lord continued service with the new company, and was awarded his first command in 1906.\nLord was given command of the \"SS Californian\" in 1911.\nSinking of RMS \"Titanic\".\nIce field.\nOn the night of 14 April 1912, as the \"Californian\" approached a large ice pack, Captain Lord decided to stop around 10:21\u00a0p.m. (ship's time) and wait out the night. Before turning in for the night, he ordered his sole Marconi wireless operator, Cyril Evans, to warn other ships in the area about the ice. Using Morse code, the newly-qualified Evans tapped out to the \"Titanic\" using a Spark-gap transmitter, \"MGY [\"Titanic\" 's call sign]. MWL [\"Californian\" 's call sign]. I say old man, we are stopped and surrounded by ice.\" However, as the \"Californian\" was so close to the \"Titanic\" his message was so loud in the ears of \"Titanic\" First Wireless Operator Jack Phillips, he angrily responded \"Keep out! Shut up! [DDD in morse] I am working Cape Race.\" His response might have been different if the inexperienced Evans had followed Lord's order and sent an ice warning with the prefix \"MSG\" which meant \"Masters' Service Gram\". This meant that the \"Titanic\"'s Captain Edward Smith would have had to personally acknowledge receipt of the Californian message.\nPhillips response was likely due to commercial pressure. He was also an employee of Marconi, which made its money sending private messages to and from commercial shipping. Earlier in the day the wireless equipment aboard the \"Titanic\" had broken down and Phillips, along with Second Wireless Operator Harold Bride, had spent the better part of the day repairing it. This delay had resulted in a backlog of outgoing messages that now needed to be sent. Phillips was likely exhausted after such a long day. Additionally, the \"Titanic\" had already received several ice warnings from other ships which had already been passed up to the bridge, including an earlier one from \"Californian\". Hence, this casual message from the \"Californian\" was not imperative or news to him. Onboard the \"Californian\", Evans continued to listen to Phillips' routine passenger traffic to the Marconi telegraphy station at Cape Race until about 11:30\u00a0p.m.; he then turned off the ship's wireless set and went to his bunk. Ten minutes later the \"Titanic\" collided with the iceberg. A consequence of the \"Titanic\" disaster was that all commercial shipping would be required to keep a round-the-clock watch at their wireless transmitters.\nMystery ship.\nAt 12:15am Captain Lord, still in uniform, went to the chart room on the ship's bridge deck to lie down after being on duty for 17 hours (not his cabin or bunk as dramatisations of the disaster always portray). He would be awakened twice during the night. The first time was to be told about the rockets. Over the course of the night, officers and crew on the \"Californian\" witnessed eight white rockets fired into the sky above an unknown ship in the distance. The \"Titanic\" had begun firing its first rockets about an hour after the iceberg collision when the lights of an unknown ship were seen. They were launched every six to seven minutes not once a minute which was maritime practice for a ship in distress. When Lord was told about the rockets he replied that they may be \"company rockets\"; distinct coloured signals which help ships of the same line identify each other. However, he never ordered wireless officer Evans to turn on his set or contact the ship to ask why they were firing signal rockets. \nThe \"Titanic\"'s Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe said they tried to contact the mystery ship with Morse lamp but got no reply or saw any coherent signals. Meanwhile the \"Californian\" 's officers decided they were looking at the flickering lights on the masthead of a ship that had also stopped because of the ice. Lord supporters attribute the visual distortions caused by cold-water mirages as a reason as to why the nearby ship was not identified as the \"Titanic\". After the \"Titanic\" had gone down at 2:20\u00a0a.m., Lord was informed by his officers that they thought the disappearance of lights from the mystery ship indicated it had steamed away.\nAt 5:30\u00a0a.m., on the morning of 15 April 1912, Evans heard the first reports from the SS \"Frankfurt\" that the \"Titanic\" had sunk. After being notified, Captain Lord immediately ordered the \"Californian\" to make steam and head to the last known location of the liner. By 8:45 a.m., his ship had pulled up alongside the \"Carpathia\". It then remained in the area to search for additional bodies after the \"Carpathia\" returned to New York with the survivors.\nInquiry.\nThe following is from Captain Lord's testimony in the US Inquiry on 26 April:\nLord made no effort to awaken the wireless operator and send a message that way, which might have been far more effective in obtaining information from the Titanic.\nPersonal life.\nLord was married and had a son. His son, Stanley Tutton Lord (1908\u20131994), worked as a banker in Liverpool; he never married or had children. He died from natural causes in 1994. He rarely spoke of his father, except to say he believed in his innocence. In 1965 he wrote a preface to a book by Peter Padfield, \"The Titanic and the Californian\", which supported the case that Lord had been judged unfairly.\nLord's wife, Mabel, died in 1957. He died on 24 January 1962, aged 84, almost half a century after the sinking of the \"Titanic\". He is buried in Rake Lane Cemetery, Wallasey, Wirral.\nLegacy.\nWhile Lord was never tried or convicted of any offence, he was still viewed publicly as a pariah after the \"Titanic\" disaster. His attempts to fight for his exoneration gained him nothing, and the events of the night of 14\u201315 April 1912 would haunt him for the rest of his life.\nLord was dismissed by the Leyland Line in August 1912. So far as any negligence of the SS \"Californian\"'s officers and crew was concerned, the conclusions of both the American and British inquiries seemed to disapprove of Lord's actions, but stopped short of recommending charges. While both inquiries censured Lord, they did not make any recommendations for an official investigation to ascertain if he was guilty of offences under the Merchant Shipping Acts. Lord was not allowed to be represented at either the U.S. or British inquiry.\nIn February 1913, with help from a Leyland director who believed he had been unfairly treated, Lord was hired by the Nitrate Producers Steamship Co., where he remained until March 1927, resigning for health reasons. In 1958, Lord contacted the Mercantile Marine Service Association in Liverpool to clear his name. The association's general secretary, Mr. Leslie Harrison, took up the case for him and petitioned the Board of Trade on his behalf for a re-examination of the facts, but there had been no finding by the time of Lord's death in 1962. In 1965, largely because Lord had offered no new evidence, his petition was rejected, but in the same year Peter Padfield's book \"The Titanic and the Californian\" was published, defending Lord's reputation, with a preface by his son Stanley Tutton Lord. This was followed by a second petition, in 1968, which was also rejected.\nIn 1957, Lord's wife died. It was a devastating loss to him and precipitated a decline in his health. In 1958 the film \"A Night To Remember\" was released, based on a 1955 book of the same title by Walter Lord (no relation). Stanley Lord, now 81 years old, never saw the film, but purportedly read the \"Liverpool Echo\" newspaper reviews of the film. Lord was very disappointed, and it brought back memories of the \"Titanic\" tragedy, and was upset over his negative portrayal by the Australian-British actor Russell Napier, which depicted him as a captain in his forties, in a warm cabin in bed asleep when \"Titanic\" was sinking. In reality, Lord was 34 years old at the time and was asleep in the chart room with his uniform on at the time of the disaster. Lord's son Stanley Tutton Lord saw the film and was upset about how his father was treated after the \"Titanic\" tragedy. In 1959, Stanley helped fight to get his father's name cleared from the records of the \"Titanic\" disaster. He continued his attempts after his father died in 1962, up until he died in 1994. Stanley Tutton Lord was seen in an interview from \"Titanic: The Legend Lives On\", part 2 of documentary in 1994 just before his death. Stanley Tutton was only 4 years old when the Titanic tragedy happened, and he told stories about how his father's life was affected by the tragedy up to when the 1958 Hollywood film was released in theaters. In 1996, just two years after Stanley Tutton died, the TV series Titanic was released on TV. It had a scene of the Californian ship that had stopped for the night, because of field ice. The crew on board the Californian saw a passenger ship that had also stopped from the ice. The Californian crew called Captain Lord on the phone and told him about a ship that had stopped for the night, and had also tried Morse lamping the ship to know who it was. Captain Lord in the low-budget TV series was depicted in his late 60s and was sleeping in his cabin just like in the 1958 film \"A Night To Remember\" 38 years earlier.\nThe discovery in 1985 of the remains of the \"Titanic\" on the sea bed made it clear that the S.O.S. position given after the iceberg collision by the \"Titanic's\" fourth officer, Joseph Boxhall, was wrong by thirteen miles. At both of the 1912 inquiries, there had been some conflict about the true position of the ship when it sank. The conclusions of the inquiries discounted the evidence of uncertainty about the position of the \"Titanic\". At the time, some assumed that the position that Lord had given for his ship was incorrect and that he was much closer to the \"Titanic\" than he claimed to be. While the entries in the \"Californian\"'s scrap log (used for recording information before it was written up officially in the ship's logbook) referring to the night in question had mysteriously gone missing, sometimes seen as overwhelming proof that Lord deliberately destroyed evidence to cover his crime of ignoring a distress call, destroying the scrap log records was normal company practice. While modifying the official ship's log or removing pages is a serious violation of maritime law, this was not the case. A re-appraisal by the British government, instigated informally in 1988 and published in 1992 by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), further implicated the consequences of Lord's inaction. Among its conclusions were that although the \"Californian\" was probably out of visual sight, the \"Titanic\"'s rockets had been sighted by the \"Californian\"'s crew. Another conclusion stated that it was unrealistic to assume that Lord could have rushed towards the signals and that with the \"Titanic\" reporting an incorrect position, the \"Californian\" would have arrived at about the same time as the \"Carpathia\" and fulfilled a similar role \u2013 rescuing those who had escaped. The report was critical of the behaviour of the other officers of the \"Californian\" in reaction to the signals. What has never been satisfactorily resolved was why Lord did not simply wake his radio operator and listen for any distress signals.\nDaniel Allen Butler, in his 2009 book \"The Other Side of Night: The Carpathia, the Californian, and the Night Titanic Was Lost\", makes a case that Lord's personality and temperament \u2014 his behaviour at both inquiries, his threats towards his crew, his frequent changing of his story, the absence of the scrap log, and odd remarks made by Lord in Boston in a newspaper interview \u2013 point to Lord's having some sort of mental illness. His lack of compassion\u00a0\u2014 never once expressing grief at the loss of the \"Titanic\" or sorrow for those who had lost family when it sank is, according to Butler, compatible with sociopathy. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was a prominent leader of the disarmament movement. She, along with Alfonso Garc\u00eda Robles, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982. She married Gunnar Myrdal in 1924; he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1974, making them the fourth ever married couple to have won Nobel Prizes, and the first to win independent of each other (versus a shared Nobel Prize by scientist spouses).\nBiography.\nEarly life and studies.\nAlva Myrdal was born in Uppsala and grew up as the first child of a modest family, the daughter of Albert Reimer and Lowa Jonsson. She had four siblings: Ruth (1904\u20131980), Folke (1906\u20131977), May (1909\u20131941) and Stig (1912\u20131977). Her father was a socialist and modern liberal. During her childhood the family moved around to different places. For example, they were residents of Eskilstuna, \u00c4lvsj\u00f6, and Stockholm. Her academic studies involved psychology and family sociology. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Stockholm in 1924.\nIn 1929, Myrdal and her husband Gunnar Myrdal had the opportunity to travel to the US as Rockefeller Fellows. Myrdal further deepened her studies in the fields of psychology, education and sociology whilst in the US. She had the special chance to broaden her knowledge of children's education. Myrdal's observation of the great social and economic disparities in the United States also led to an increased political commitment \u2013 \"radical\" was the term that she and her husband came to use to describe their shared political outlook They then moved to Geneva for further studies, where they started to so study the population decline that worried many Europeans during the interwar period.\nPolitics of the family and population issue.\nMyrdal first came to public attention in the 1930s, and was one of the main driving forces in the creation of the Swedish welfare state. She coauthored the book \"Crisis in the Population Question\" ( with Gunnar Myrdal in 1934). The basic premise of \"Crisis in the Population Question\" is to find what social reforms are needed to allow for individual liberty (especially for women) while also promoting child-bearing, and encouraging Swedes to have children. The book also detailed the importance of shared responsibility for children's education both between the parents as well as the community by trained child educators.\nMyrdal was highly critical of developments in the operation of preschools for children in Sweden. Consequently, she published the book \"Urban Children\" (1935), where she presented her ideas for a newly reformed Swedish preschool system. She argued that contemporary child care was flawed. The system was polarized between two extremes \u2013 measures of 'poor relief' for the less well-off contrasted with those measures which prepared children from wealthier families for private schools. She stressed that there were material obstacles in the way of being able to access a good education. Therefore, social and economic reforms were needed. Myrdal wanted to combine and integrate the two extremes.\nA year later, she was able to put her theory into practice, as she became director of the National Educational Seminar, which she cofounded in 1936. She personally worked there as a teacher and pedagogue by training preschool teachers. Myrdal emphasized the lack of recent educational research in regards to preschool teacher training. Her teaching tried to integrate the new discoveries in child psychology in education. Social studies were also emphasized, as was women's personal development.\nWith architect Sven Markelius, Myrdal designed Stockholm's cooperative \"Collective House\" in 1937, with an eye towards developing more domestic liberty for women. She was a member of the Committee for Increased Women's Representation, founded in 1937 to increase women's political representation.\nIn 1938, Alva and Gunnar Myrdal moved to the United States. While in the US, Myrdal published the book \"Nation and Family\" (1941) concerning the Swedish family unit and population policy. During World War II, she also periodically lived in Sweden.\nPostwar career takeoff.\nA long-time prominent member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, in the late 1940s she became involved in international issues with the United Nations, appointed to head its section on welfare policy in 1949. From 1950 to 1955 she was chairman of UNESCO's social science section\u2014the first woman to hold such prominent positions in the UN. In 1955\u20131956, she served as a Swedish envoy to New Delhi, India, Yangon, Myanmar and Colombo, Sri Lanka.\nFrom 1951 she had collaborated with British-based sociologist Viola Klein and in 1958 they co-wrote the book \"Women's Two Roles: Home and Work\", supported by the International Federation of University Women \"to make an international survey of the needs for social reforms if women are to be put into a position to reconcile family and professional life\".\nIn 1962, Myrdal was elected to the Riksdag, and in 1962 she was sent as the Swedish delegate to the UN disarmament conference in Geneva, a role she kept until 1973. During the negotiations in Geneva, she played an extremely active role, emerging as the leader of the group of nonaligned nations which endeavored to bring pressure to bear on the two superpowers (US and USSR, respectively) to show greater concern for concrete disarmament measures. Her experiences from the years spent in Geneva found an outlet in her book \"The game of disarmament\", in which she expresses her disappointment at the reluctance of the US and the USSR to disarm.\nMyrdal participated in the creation of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, becoming the first chairman of the governing board in 1966. In 1967 she was also named consultative Cabinet minister for disarmament, an office she held until 1973. Myrdal also wrote the acclaimed book \"The Game of Disarmament,\" originally published in 1976. A vocal supporter of disarmament, Myrdal received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982 together with Alfonso Garc\u00eda Robles. In 1983 Myrdal effectively ended the heated controversy over the future of Adolf Fredrik's Music School, \"The AF-fight\" (Swedish: AF-striden).\nMyrdal promoted reforms in child care and later became a government commission on women's work and chair of the Federation of Business and Professional Women.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1924, she married Professor Gunnar Myrdal. Together they had children Jan Myrdal (born 1927), Sissela Bok (born 1934) and Kaj F\u00f6lster (born 1936).\nHer grandchildren include Hilary Bok and Stefan F\u00f6lster.\nDeath.\nShe died the day after her 84th birthday.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His first appearance was in the episode \"Homer's Odyssey\", although his voice could be heard in the series premiere, \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\". He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's owner, Mr. Burns, and is usually treated unfairly.\nSmithers's loyalty and devotion to Mr. Burns was inspired from how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. Smithers's first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers. The idea for Smithers's ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon. He proposed that Smithers should be gay and have an undying love for Mr. Burns. Smithers was colorized in his first appearance as black with blue hair. Matt Groening, in an interview with TMZ, said that this was a mistake but the producers did not have enough money to correct it.\nSexual orientation.\nSmithers is the loyal, obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns, and the relationship between the two is a frequent running gag. In many ways, Smithers represents the stereotype of a closeted gay man. Numerous allusions and double entendres about his orientation being homosexual are made, though some of the show's producers instead interpret him as a \"Burns-sexual\". There has been speculation throughout the series of Smithers' sexuality and in the season 27 (2016) episode \"The Burns Cage\", he officially came out as gay.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nMr. Smithers is Mr. Burns's devoted executive assistant. His father, Waylon Smithers Sr., worked for Burns until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown when Smithers was a baby. Smithers began thinking of Mr. Burns as his commander shortly after his birth. Up until 2016, he was not openly gay, but most people knew he was homosexual before he came out. It was revealed in a flashback that he was married to a woman once, but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them. Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns, and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as \"Burns-sexual\". \"He deserves his time,\" says the writer of \"The Simpsons\" about Smithers's gay love story in 2021.\nMr. Burns remained largely ignorant of Smithers's devoted adoration, much to Smithers's frustration. Mr. Burns himself has been involved with several women and, in \"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\", Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion. Burns, for his part, views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey, albeit a highly valued one for his competence. He has \"rewarded\" Smithers's devotion with the future \"honor\" of being buried alive with him after he dies. Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns. In \"Homer the Smithers\", Mr. Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns's assistant and eventually gets his job back. In the season 27 episode \"The Burns Cage\", Smithers attempts to admit his love to Burns, who interrupts to reaffirm his contempt for his assistant.\nSmithers's official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant, which he says is \"actually about 2,800 smaller jobs\", responsible for monitoring employee attendance, and is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of employee-of-the-month awards. Smithers does appear to be one of the few people at the power plant who is seemingly competent at their job as opposed to the lazy, oafish underlings such as Homer Simpson and the senile Mr. Burns, who is often out of touch with the modern times. While some of his early appearances showed him to have a malicious side (he tried to get Homer fired over his insurance claim for a hair-growing product, and the only reason this failed is that Mr. Burns had sympathy for Homer due to his own incurable baldness and gave him his old job back), his overall characterization is fairly benevolent and he ultimately just wants the SNPP to run well. He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive vice president, but Burns has repeatedly squashed this dream, while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on a dog. Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in the world, and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club. In \"Werking Mom\", Smithers makes a silent cameo as a drag queen named 'The Mysterious Waylon'.\nCharacter.\nMr. Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers's orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads. Jay Kogen said \"Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay.\" The script for \"Blood Feud\" originally featured Smithers saying \"Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids\", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon, coined by Mike Reiss, was first used in \"I Married Marge\" and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.\nSmithers made his first appearance in \"Homer's Odyssey\", which was the third episode of the first season, although he can be heard over a speaker in \"The Simpsons\" series premiere \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\". In his first visual appearance in \"Homer's Odyssey\", Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made darker than most characters by Gyorgyi Peluce, the color stylist. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be \"Mr Burns' white sycophant\", and the staff thought it \"would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character\" and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. Silverman retconned this error by saying that Smithers had a tan from a recent holiday in the Caribbean. The first appearance of a yellow Smithers was \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\", the fourth episode of the first season.\nDevelopment.\nMr. Smithers's relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on \"The Simpsons\". Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers's true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode \"The Telltale Head\". Smithers's sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a \"Burns-sexual\" and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is gay. During the Bill Oakley/Josh Weinstein era, they still tried to keep his sexuality unspoken and there was debate among the writers about his orientation. Al Jean, who thinks of Smithers as being a \"Burns-sexual\", felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay. David Silverman, a former supervising director has said, \"[Smithers] seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to anything beyond that. [Rather than being gay], he's sort of 'Burns-sexual'.\" In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian, but Smithers was not included. A list published in 2008 by the same organization included Smithers; Patty Bouvier, Marge Simpson's lesbian sister, was included on both lists.\nThe debate is referenced in \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\", when the episode host, Troy McClure is answering viewer questions, and one that is asked is \"What is the real deal with Mr. Burns's assistant Smithers? You know what I'm talking about.\" A montage of various clips that shows Smithers's lust for Mr. Burns follows, and in the end, McClure says \"as you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns's assistant. He's in his early forties, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing!\"\nSeveral of the allusions to Smithers's sexuality have turned into battles with the network censors. For example, in Smithers's fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in \"Rosebud\", the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is \"Marge Gets a Job\", which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally it went on for a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed \"Mr. Burns land[ing] in a particular position on Smithers's anatomy\". There were also issues with \"the lump in his bed\", which the animators said had been drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted.\nIn the second season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns' relationship, and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition.\nMostly in the early seasons, Smithers had a catchphrase, which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is. Smithers and Burns would watch Homer (usually over a security camera feed) and Burns would ask, \"Who is that man?\", to which Smithers would reply, \"That's Homer Simpson, sir, one of your [drones, organ banks, carbon blobs, etc.] from sector 7G.\" Burns would invariably respond, \"Simpson, eh?\"\nIn September 2015, it was confirmed by Jean that Smithers would come out to Mr. Burns in a season 27 episode. Though in the end he never came out to Mr. Burns as his attempt was cut short. The episode, \"The Burns Cage\", was broadcast the following April and saw Smithers unsuccessfully try to move on from Burns. A writer for British progressive magazine the \"New Statesman\" felt that the episode was a retcon, making a serious story about the character's homosexuality instead of the previous jokes and innuendo that were now considered homophobic.\nReception.\nIn 2004, \"The Simpsons\" producers announced that one of their characters was going to come out of the closet. Speculation on who it would be was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada (even claiming Smithers's \"sexual orientation was about the worst-kept secret in Springfield\") as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, (the \"Irish Independent\" called Smithers \"too obvious\" a choice), and the United Kingdom. Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, the \"Boston Herald\" calculated the odds of several characters being gay, with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on \"cartoon gaydar\" who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers. Jenny Stewart, the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll, \"We've never had such an avalanche of people voting in any of our polls as we did on \"The Simpsons\".\" It was Patty Bouvier who came out.\nIn a 2007 article, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named Smithers the 16th-greatest sidekick of all time. They have also described Smithers and Mr. Burns as being \"TV's most functional dysfunctional couple\". \"Star News Online\" named \"Smithers' fey way\" as one of the 400 reasons why they loved \"The Simpsons\". In a 2003 article, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named the two-part episode \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\", in which Smithers was prominently featured, the series' 25th-best episode. Gay.com ranked Smithers as the sixth-gayest cartoon character.\nMerchandise.\nSmithers was made into an action figure, and four different versions were included as part of the \"World of Springfield\" toy line. The first shows Smithers in his normal attire with a picture of Mr. Burns at his feet and was released in 2000 as part of \"wave two\". The second, released in 2002 as part of \"wave ten\", is called \"resort Smithers\" and shows him dressed as he was at the resort in the episode \"Homer the Smithers\". In 2003, a series of figures exclusive to \"Electronics Boutique\" was released, and a set of one Mr. Burns figure and two different Smithers toys based on the episode \"Rosebud\" were included. One, called \"Bobo Smithers\" shows Smithers dressed as Mr. Burns's teddy bear Bobo; and the other, known as \"future Smithers\", shows him as a robotic dog. A \"future Burns\" was included in the set as a companion to \"future Smithers\" and depicts Burns as a robot as he appeared at the end of the episode.\nIn 2015, \"Lego\" released a second series for their \"Simpsons\" \"Lego Minifigures\" theme. The second series features Smithers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64777", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64777", "title": "American League", "text": "League within Major League Baseball\nThe American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the American League (AL), is the younger of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \"Senior Circuit\").\nSince 1903, the American League champion has played in the World Series against the National League champion with only two exceptions: 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants refused to play their AL counterpart, and 1994, when a players' strike resulted in the cancellation of the Series. Through 2025, American League teams have won 68 of the 121 World Series played since 1903. The New York Yankees have won 27 World Series and 41 American League titles, the most in major league history. The Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics have won the second most AL titles with 15, followed by the Boston Red Sox with 14.\nFor decades, Major League baseball clubs only played teams from their own league during the regular season and playoffs, with only the two pennant winners meeting in the World Series. The AL and NL also employed and trained their own umpires, who only worked regular season games in their own league. These differences resulted in the leagues developing slightly different strategies and styles of play. The American League was usually regarded as the less \"traditional\" league during the 20th century, a reputation most exemplified by the introduction of the designated hitter rule in 1973, which encouraged AL managers to largely abandon \"smallball\" tactics. However, with the advent of free agency in the 1970s allowing for more player movement between leagues, the introduction of regular season interleague play in 1997, umpires working games across MLB beginning in 1999, and the NL's adoption of the designated hitter rule in 2022, the difference in play between the two major leagues has diminished considerably.\nThough both leagues agreed to be jointly governed by a commissioner in 1920, they remained separate business entities with their own presidents and management. This was the case until after the 1999 season, when the American League legally merged with the National League under the auspices of Major League Baseball, which now operates much like other North American professional sports leagues, albeit with two \"leagues\" instead of \"conferences\".\nHistory.\nOriginally a minor league known as the Western League, which existed from 1885 to 1899 with teams in mostly Great Lakes states, the league changed its name to the American League for the 1900 season and the next year developed into a second major league as a competitor to the older National League. This was prompted by the NL dropping four teams following the 1899 season after having absorbed its previous rival, the American Association, which disbanded in 1891 after ten seasons.\nIn its early history of the late 1880s, the minor Western League struggled until 1894, when Ban Johnson became the president of the league. Johnson pushed the league to rise to major league status, after the name change to the American League was decided in a league meeting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the former Republican Hotel. A historical marker is at the intersection of North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and West Kilbourn Avenue where the hotel once stood.\nIn March 1904, Johnson moved the league's headquarters from Chicago to New York.\nBabe Ruth, noted as one of the most prolific hitters in Major League Baseball history, spent the majority of his career in the American League with the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. From 1973 to 2022 The American League had one notable difference versus the rival National League, as it had the designated hitter rule. Under the rule, a team may use a batter in its lineup who is not in the field defensively, replacing the pitcher in the batting order, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher to bat. In the last two decades, the season schedule has allowed occasional interleague play. In 1969, the AL (and NL) were divided into East and West divisions, with a postseason playoff series for the pennant and the right to play in the World Series.\nUntil the late 1970s, league umpires working behind home plate wore large, balloon-style chest protectors worn outside the shirt or coat, while their colleagues in the National League wore chest protectors inside the shirt or coat. In 1977, new umpires (including Steve Palermo) had to wear the inside chest protector, although those on staff wearing the outside protector could continue to do so. Most umpires made the switch to the inside protector, led by Don Denkinger in 1975 and Jim Evans the next year, although several did not, including Bill Haller, Russ Goetz, George Maloney, Bill Kunkel and Jerry Neudecker, who became the last full-time MLB umpire to use the outside protector in 1985.\nIn 1994, the league, along with the National League, reorganized again, this time into three divisions (East, West, and Central) and added a third round to the playoffs in the form of the American League Division Series, with the best second-place team advancing to the playoffs as a wild-card team, in addition to the three divisional champions. In 1998, the newly franchised Tampa Bay Devil Rays joined the league, and the Arizona Diamondbacks joined the National League: i.e., each league added a fifteenth team. An odd number of teams per league meant that at least one team in each league would have to be idle on any given day, or alternatively, that odd team out would have had to play an interleague game against its counterpart in the other league. The initial plan was to have three five-team divisions per league with inter-league play year-round\u2014possibly as many as 30 interleague games per team each year.\nFor various reasons, it soon seemed more practical to have an even number of teams in both leagues. The Milwaukee Brewers agreed to change leagues to become the National League's 16th team, moving from the AL Central to the NL Central. At the same time, the Detroit Tigers were moved from the AL East to the AL Central, making room for the Devil Rays in the East. Even after expansion, the American League then continued with 14 teams. This situation changed again in 2013 when the Houston Astros moved from the National League Central division to the American League West. The Astros had been in the NL for 51 years since beginning as an expansion team in 1962. Since their move, both leagues now consist of 15 teams.\nInterleague play, and merger.\nFor the first 96 years, American League teams faced their National League counterparts only in exhibition games or in the World Series. Beginning in 1997, interleague games have been played during the regular season and count in the standings. As part of the agreement instituting interleague play, the designated-hitter rule was used only in games where the American League team is the home team, until the 2022 season, when the universal DH rule was implemented. \nIn 2023, American League teams played 46 regular season interleague games against all 15 National League teams, 23 at home and 23 on the road.\nIn 2000, the American League ended its status as a legally independent entity when the American and National Leagues were both merged into the legal entity Major League Baseball (MLB). This left MLB as a single league, divided into two parts, also called leagues. This change in legal status had no effect on play, scheduling, and so forth.\nTeams.\nCharter franchises.\nThere were eight charter teams in 1901, the league's first year as a major league, and\nthe next year the original Milwaukee Brewers (not to be confused with the current Milwaukee Brewers) moved to St. Louis to become the St. Louis Browns, and the year after the New York Highlanders replaced the disbanded original Baltimore Orioles. Those eight franchises constituted the league for 52 seasons until the Browns moved to Baltimore and took up the Orioles name. The eight original teams and their counterparts in the \"Classic Eight\" were:\nTimeline.\nThe first line is the transformation of the American League (AL) to a major league in 1901. The second line is the beginning of the expansion era in 1961. The third line marks the legal merger of the American and National Leagues into a single Major League Baseball in 2000.\nWorld Series championships are shown with a \"\u2022\", American League Pennants before the World Series are shown with a \"#\", and American League Pennants who lost the World Series are shown with a \"^\". No World Series was played in 1904, so the pennant winners for each league are indicated. Due to the 1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike, there were no pennant or World Series winners in 1994, so this year is left blank.\nPresidents.\nFollowing the 1999 season, the American and National Leagues were merged with Major League Baseball, and the leagues ceased to exist as business entities. The position of the American League President and National League President became honorary.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From the Montmartre quarter of Paris, France, Utrillo is one of the few famous painters of Montmartre to have been born there.\nBiography.\nUtrillo was the son of the artist Suzanne Valadon (born Marie-Cl\u00e9mentine Valadon), who was then an eighteen-year-old artist's model. She never revealed the father of her child; speculation exists that he was the offspring of a liaison with an equally young amateur painter named Boissy, or with the well-established painter Pierre-C\u00e9cile Puvis de Chavannes, or even with Renoir. (See below under \"Paternity\"). In 1891 a Spanish artist, Miquel Utrillo, signed a legal document acknowledging paternity, although the question remains as to whether he was in fact the child's father.\nValadon, who became a model after a fall from a trapeze ended her chosen career as a circus acrobat, found that posing for Berthe Morisot, Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others provided her with an opportunity to study their techniques. She taught herself to paint, and when Toulouse-Lautrec introduced her to Edgar Degas, he became her mentor. Eventually, she became a peer of the artists she had posed for.\nMeanwhile, her mother was left to raise the young Maurice, who soon showed a troubling inclination toward truancy and alcoholism. When schizophrenia took hold of the 21-year-old Utrillo in 1904, his mother encouraged him to take up painting. He soon showed real artistic talent. With no training beyond what his mother taught him, he drew and painted what he saw in Montmartre. After 1910 his work attracted critical attention, and by 1920 he was internationally acclaimed. In 1928, the French government awarded him the Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. Throughout his life, however, he was interned in mental asylums repeatedly.\nToday, tourists to the area will find many of his paintings on postcards, one of which is his very popular 1936 painting entitled \"Montmartre Street Corner\" or \"Lapin Agile\".\nIn middle age Utrillo became fervently religious and in 1935, at the age of fifty-two, he married and moved to Le V\u00e9sinet, just outside Paris. By that time, he was too ill to work in the open air and painted landscapes viewed from windows, from postcards, and from memory.\nAlthough his life also was plagued by alcoholism, he lived into his seventies. Maurice Utrillo died on 5 November 1955 in Hotel Splendid in Dax, at age 72, of a lung disease, and was buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re Saint-Vincent in Montmartre.\nPaternity.\nAn apocryphal anecdote told by Diego Rivera concerning Utrillo's paternity is related in the unpublished memoirs of one of his American collectors, Ruth Bakwin:\n\"After Maurice was born to Suzanne Valadon, she went to Renoir, for whom she had modeled nine months previously. Renoir looked at the baby and said, 'He can't be mine, the color is terrible!' Next she went to Degas, for whom she had also modeled. He said, 'He can't be mine, the form is terrible!' At a cafe, Valadon saw an artist she knew named Miguel Utrillo, to whom she spilled her woes. The man told her to call the baby Utrillo: 'I would be glad to put my name to the work of either Renoir or Degas!'\"\n2010 exhibitions and sale.\nIn 2010, several retrospective exhibitions were staged, at Oglethorpe University Museum of Art and in Montmartre (Paris) that culminated in an auction of 30 of Utrillo's works on 30\u00a0November 2010 from the collection of Paul P\u00e9trid\u00e8s, Utrillo's art dealer, whose Galerie P\u00e9trid\u00e8s also dealt with the likes of Jacques Th\u00e9venet. This follows the exhibition of Suzanne Valadon and Maurice Utrillo's works held in Paris in 2009.\nNazi-looted art.\nIn 2022, Utrillo's \"Carrefour \u00e0 Sannois\" which the Nazis had looted from the French Jewish art collector and dealer Georges Bernheim in 1940, was restituted to the heirs after a long legal battle. The city of Sannois (Val-d'Oise) had bought the painting at Sotheby's in 2004. In 2015 the Commission responsible for dealing with Nazi-looted art (the CIVS) advised the town that the painting had been looted. A new law voted by France's National Assembly in 2022 paved the way for restitution. \nIn popular culture.\nUtrillo is played by Bruno Gouery in the 2024 film \"Mod\u00ec, Three Days on the Wing of Madness\" directed and co-produced by Johnny Depp.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64803", "revid": "8729451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64803", "title": "Canadian literature", "text": "Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration. This progressed into three major themes of historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all of which tie into the garrison mentality. The evolution of Canadian literature is intricately linked to its historical and social contexts, often mirroring the challenges and triumphs of Canadian society. As Canadian literature progressed into the 20th and 21st centuries, it began to address a broader array of subjects and themes, such as female and LGBTQ rights, immigrant experiences, environmental issues, the relationship with Indigenous peoples, and Canadian values and identity.\nFinancial support from governmental bodies, such as the Canada Council for the Arts and various provincial grant programs, facilitates the creation, publication, and promotion of works by Canadian authors. Numerous Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards including the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Booker Prize, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Canadian literary prizes include the Governor General's Literary Awards, the Giller Prize, the Atwood Gibson Writers' Trust Fiction Prize, the Latner Griffin Writers' Trust Poetry Prize, the Burt Award for First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Literature and several accolades for literature aimed at children.\nIndigenous literatures.\nIndigenous peoples of Canada are culturally diverse. Each group has its own literature, language and culture. The term \"Indigenous literature\" therefore can be misleading, as writer Jeannette Armstrong states in one interview, \"I would stay away from the idea of \"Native\" literature, there is no such thing. There is Mohawk literature, there is Okanagan literature, but there is no generic Native in Canada\".\nFrench-Canadian literature.\nIn 1802, the Lower Canada legislative library was founded. All books it contained were subsequently moved to the Canadian parliament in Montreal when the two Canadas, Lower and Upper, were united. On April 25, 1849 the Canadian parliament was burned along with thousands of French Canadian books and a few hundred English books. A consequence of this event was the mistaken impression that from the early settlements until the 1820s, Quebec had virtually no literature. \nIt was the rise of Quebec patriotism and the 1837 Lower Canada Rebellion, in addition to a modern system of primary school education, which led to the rise of French-Canadian fiction. \"L'influence d'un livre\" by Philippe-Ignace-Francois Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 is widely regarded as the first French-Canadian novel. The genres which first became popular were the rural novel and the historical novel. French authors were influential, especially authors like Balzac.\nIn 1866, Father Henri-Raymond Casgrain became one of Quebec's first literary theorists. He argued that literature's goal should be to project an image of proper Catholic morality. However, a few authors like Louis-Honor\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chette and Arthur Buies broke the conventions to write more interesting works.\nThis pattern continued until the 1930s with a new group of authors educated at the Universit\u00e9 Laval and the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Novels with psychological and sociological foundations became the norm. Gabrielle Roy and Anne H\u00e9bert even began to earn international acclaim, which had not happened to French-Canadian literature before. During this period, Quebec theatre, which had previously been melodramas and comedies, became far more involved.\nFrench-Canadian literature began to greatly expand with the turmoil of the Second World War, the beginnings of industrialization in the 1950s, and most especially the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s. French-Canadian literature also began to attract a great deal of attention globally, with Acadian novelist Antonine Maillet winning the Prix Goncourt in 1979. An experimental branch of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois literature also developed; for instance the poet Nicole Brossard wrote in a formalist style.\nIn 1979, Roch Carrier wrote the story \"The Hockey Sweater\", which highlighted the cultural and social tensions between English and French speaking Canada.\nBefore Confederation.\nBecause Canada only officially became a country following the unification, or 'confederation' of several colonies, including Upper and Lower Canada, into one nation on July 1, 1867, it has been argued that literature written before this time was colonial. The book often considered to be the first work of Canadian literature is \"The History of Emily Montague\" by Frances Brooke, published in 1769. Brooke wrote the novel in Sillery, Quebec following the Conquest of New France. Susanna Moodie and Catharine Parr Traill, English sisters who adopted the country as their own, moved to Upper Canada in 1832. They recorded their experiences as pioneers in Parr Traill's \"The Backwoods of Canada\" (1836) and \"Canadian Crusoes\" (1852), and Moodie's \"Roughing It in the Bush\" (1852) and \"Life in the Clearings\" (1853). However, both women wrote until their deaths, placing them in the country for more than 50 years and certainly well past Confederation. Moreover, their books often dealt with survival and the rugged Canadian environment; these themes re-appear in other Canadian works, including Margaret Atwood's \"Survival\". Moodie and Parr Trail's sister, Agnes Strickland, remained in England and wrote elegant royal biographies, creating a stark contrast between Canadian and English literatures.\nHowever, one of the earliest Canadian writers virtually always included in Canadian literary anthologies is Thomas Chandler Haliburton (1796\u20131865), born and raised in Nova Scotia, who died just two years before Canada's official birth. He is remembered for his comic character, Sam Slick, who appeared in \"The Clockmaker\" and other humorous works throughout Haliburton's life.\nAfter 1867.\nA group of poets now known as the \"Confederation Poets\", including Charles G. D. Roberts, Archibald Lampman, Bliss Carman, Duncan Campbell Scott, and William Wilfred Campbell, came to prominence in the 1880s and 1890s. Choosing the world of nature as their inspiration, their work was drawn from their own experiences and, at its best, written in their own tones. Isabella Valancy Crawford, Annie Campbell Huestis, Frederick George Scott, and Francis Sherman are also sometimes associated with this group.\nDuring this period, E. Pauline Johnson and William Henry Drummond were writing popular poetry \u2013 Johnson's based on her part-Mohawk heritage, and Drummond, the Poet of the Habitant, writing dialect verse.\nL. M. Montgomery's novel \"Anne of Green Gables\" was first published in 1908. It has sold an estimated 50 million copies and is one of the best selling books worldwide. Atlantic Canadian folklore and song became the subject of a Maritime literary revival in the 1920s, centered on Nova Scotia. Folklore collection expressed an interest in the region's pre-industrial lifestyle and a romantic vision of the \"hardiness, simplicity, and virtues of the seafaring life\". Poets and novelists participating in the literary revival included the Song Fishermen.\nBetween 1915 and 1925, Stephen Leacock (1869\u20131944) was the best selling humour writer in the world. His best known book of fiction, Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town was published in 1912. \nThree of Canada's most important post-World War I novelists were Hugh MacLennan (1907\u20131990), W.O. Mitchell (1914\u20131998), and Morley Callaghan (1903\u20131990). MacLennan's best-known works are \"Barometer Rising\" (1941), \"The Watch That Ends the Night\" (1957), and \"Two Solitudes\" (1945), while Callaghan is best known for \"Such Is My Beloved\" (1934), \"The Loved and the Lost\" (1951), and \"More Joy in Heaven\" (1937). Mitchell's most-loved novel is Who Has Seen the Wind. \nPerhaps reacting against a tradition that largely emphasized the wilderness and the small town and country experience, Leonard Cohen wrote the novel \"Beautiful Losers\" (1966). It was labelled by one reviewer \"the most revolting book ever written in Canada\". In time, however, this novel was considered a Canadian classic. Despite beginning his career as a poet of major importance, Cohen is perhaps best known as a folk singer and songwriter, with an international following.\nCanadian author Farley Mowat is best known for his work \"Never Cry Wolf\" (1963) and his Governor General's Award-winning children's book, \"Lost in the Barrens\" (1956).\nFollowing World War II, writers such as Mavis Gallant, Mordecai Richler, Norman Levine, Sheila Watson, Margaret Laurence and Irving Layton added to the Modernist influence in Canadian literature previously introduced by F.\u00a0R. Scott, A.\u00a0J.\u00a0M. Smith and others associated with the \"McGill Fortnightly\". This influence, at first, was not broadly appreciated. Norman Levine's \"Canada Made Me\", a travelogue that presented a sour interpretation of the country in 1958, for example, was widely rejected.\nAfter 1967, the country's centennial year, the national government increased funding to publishers and numerous small presses began operating throughout the country.\nThe best-known Canadian children's writers include L. M. Montgomery and Monica Hughes.\nContemporary Canadian literature: After 1967.\nArguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Other great 20th-century Canadian authors include Margaret Laurence, Mavis Gallant, Michael Ondaatje, Carol Shields, Alistair MacLeod, Mazo de la Roche, and Gabrielle Roy.\nThis group, along with Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English, were part of a 'new wave' of Canadian writers, some starting their careers in the 1950s. The first to elevate Canadian Literature to the world stage were Lucy Maud Montgomery, Stephen Leacock, Mazo de la Roche, and Morley Callaghan. During the post-war decades Canadian literature, as were Australian and New Zealand literature, viewed as an appendage to British Literature. When academic Clara Thomas decided in the 1940s to concentrate on Canadian literature for her master's thesis, the idea was so novel and so radical that word of her decision reached \"The Globe and Mail\" books editor William Arthur Deacon, who then personally reached out to Thomas to pledge his and the newspaper's resources in support of her work.\nOther major Canadian novelists include Carol Shields, Lawrence Hill, and Alice Munro. Carol Shields novel \"The Stone Diaries\" won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and another novel, \"Larry's Party\", won the Orange Prize in 1998. Lawrence Hill's \"Book of Negroes\" won the 2008 Commonwealth Writers' Prize Overall Best Book Award, while Alice Munro became the first Canadian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013. Munro also received the Man Booker International Prize in 2009.\nIn the 1960s, a renewed sense of nation helped foster new voices in Canadian poetry, including: Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Leonard Cohen, Eli Mandel and Margaret Avison. Others such as Al Purdy, Milton Acorn, and Earle Birney, already published, produced some of their best work during this period.\nThe TISH Poetry movement in Vancouver brought about poetic innovation from Jamie Reid, George Bowering, Fred Wah, Frank Davey, Daphne Marlatt, David Cull, and Lionel Kearns.\nCanadian poets have been expanding the boundaries of originality: Christian B\u00f6k, Ken Babstock, Karen Solie, Lynn Crosbie, Patrick Lane, George Elliott Clarke and Barry Dempster have all imprinted their unique consciousnesses onto the map of Canadian imagery. \nA notable anthology of Canadian poetry is \"The New Oxford book of Canadian Verse\", edited by Margaret Atwood ().\nAnne Carson is probably the best known Canadian poet living today. Carson in 1996 won the Lannan Literary Award for poetry. The foundation's awards in 2006 for poetry, fiction and nonfiction each came with $US 150,000.\nCanadian authors who have won international awards.\nNobel Prize in Literature\nInternational Booker Prize\nBooker Prize\nPulitzer Prize for Fiction\nNational Book Critics Circle Award\nInternational Dublin Literary Award\nOrange Prize\nCommonwealth Writers' Prize\nPeace Prize of the German Book Trade\nAwards.\nThere are a number of notable Canadian awards for literature:\nAwards For Children's and Young Adult Literature:\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A 4th-grade teacher, she teaches Bart Simpson's class at Springfield Elementary School. In the twenty-third season, she marries Ned Flanders.\nFollowing Marcia Wallace's death in 2013, the show's producers announced that her character would be retired. The epilogue of the season 25 episode \"The Man Who Grew Too Much\" marks Edna Krabappel's final original speaking role.\nProfile.\nEdna Krabappel holds a Master's from Bryn Mawr College. She is a surly, grumpy and jaded caricature of the American public school system. In \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\", it is revealed that she was once a very optimistic woman who genuinely wanted to help people in need. However, after years of frustration with the school, and her constant battles with Bart Simpson in particular, she eventually became a much more bitter person.\nThere is some inconsistency about Edna's origins. She is said to have come to Springfield to begin teaching in \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\". However, in a case of retconning, she can be seen in \"Springfield Up\" as a student running through the background at Springfield High School while a young Chief Wiggum is filmed carrying out his duties as a hall monitor as part of the documentary featured in that episode.\nEdna smokes heavily, including during school hours. In the episode \"Grade School Confidential\", she and Principal Skinner have a romance after they are invited to Martin Prince's birthday party. They are witnessed kissing in Martin's playhouse by Bart. Principal Skinner then sends Bart to relay a message to Edna in front of his classmates who laugh at him, making him furious. He then shows them what they are doing and tells them not to tell anyone about their relationship, especially Superintendent Chalmers. Unknown to Bart they lose their jobs when Superintendent Chalmers finds out about their affair via Chief Wiggum and they lock themselves in the school with Bart until they are reinstated. They apologize to Bart for embarrassing him. After returning to their jobs, they resume their romance in a janitorial closet. In \"Bart Gets a 'Z'\", she is fired from teaching when she becomes drunk after drinking coffee that was spiked with alcohol by Bart. She later decides to open a muffin store. She is later rehired when the substitute teacher gets drunk. In \"Moms I'd Like to Forget\", she fights a fifth grade teacher, Mike, who talks badly about her students; this leads to a massive teacher brawl. In \"The Ned-Liest Catch\", she is suspended from teaching for slapping Bart and is placed in the Teacher Holding Facility. When Bart attempts to free her, she falls off a ladder but is saved by Ned Flanders.\nLove life.\nA recurring theme is Edna's desire for a romantic partner. She is divorced; in \"Separate Vocations\", she implies that her husband left her for their marriage counselor with whom he had an affair. In early episodes, she is shown as very sexually aggressive and promiscuous: in \"Flaming Moe's\", she is shown with her arms around two sailors in the parody of the famous \"Cheers\" theme, and tries to pick up Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer and Homer Simpson, even after learning he is married and is Bart's father. In \"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\", while the children are watching an unseen explicit scene in \"Fuzzy Bunny's Guide to You-Know-What\", a sex ed film, she says to the children in disgust, \"She's faking it\". In the same episode, Nelson Muntz asks why she does not live with \"Mr. Krabappel\"; she tells him that her ex-husband \"chased something small and fluffy down the rabbit hole\". In \"One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\", she has a \"hot encounter\" with a local Japanese sushi chef in the backseat of her car.\nThe episode \"Bart the Lover\" was the first episode to give Edna a central role, and also to expand her character and personality. In the episode, she has a personal ad placed in the newspaper so she can find a man. The advertisement is answered by Bart \u2013 under the alias of \"Woodrow\", a seemingly perfect male lover named after former President Woodrow Wilson \u2013 as a prank. This results in a cycle of romantic letters between both Edna and \"Woodrow\". Intending to finish the prank, Bart invites Edna to the Gilded Truffle Restaurant so she can meet with Woodrow. Edna waits expectantly for Woodrow, but is heartbroken after he does not appear. With his family's help, Bart writes a goodbye letter to Edna as Woodrow, satisfying her.\nEdna appears to be desired by many men (and in one case even women, when Patty Bouvier once had a sexual fantasy with Edna), as seen in Sideshow Bob's outrage (in \"Brother from Another Series\") wherein his romantic date with her is ruined by a spying Bart: \"You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel!\"\nAnother theme is her relationship with the school principal, Seymour Skinner. In the episode \"Grade School Confidential\", she develops a secret romance with Skinner, a relationship that almost leads to marriage. In the episode \"Special Edna\", Skinner proposes to Edna, to which she agrees. However, in the episode \"My Big Fat Geek Wedding\", Edna leaves Skinner at the altar after realizing that he doesn't want to marry her. Since then, Edna's attitudes to Skinner have vacillated between passion and disdain in various episodes. In \"The Simpsons Movie\", she can be seen at the Green Day concert on top of Seymour's shoulders wearing a T-shirt saying \"Not my boyfriend\" with an arrow pointing down at Skinner.\nIn season 17 (\"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\"), a flashback showed that Edna was in a serious relationship with Moe Szyslak when she first moved to Springfield, before meeting Skinner or even becoming a teacher. She was about to elope with him, but then changed her mind when she met Bart Simpson, a student she believed needed help. Consequently, Moe breaks up with her. At the end of the episode, Moe and Edna are a couple once again, much to Skinner's jealousy when he catches them making out on school property. In \"Regarding Margie\", she and Principal Skinner are seen making love on a golf course. Then he climbs off and she says, \"Birthday is over, Seymour\", and lights up a cigarette.\nDuring the 22nd episode of the 22nd season, \"The Ned-Liest Catch\", Ned Flanders and Edna began dating (though the two have dated previously in the episode \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\"). The fate of the couple was left to a fan vote, to be revealed during the 23rd season opener. When \"The Falcon and the D'ohman\" debuted, it revealed that the fans voted in favor of the relationship. At the close of the episode, a disclaimer appeared on screen which stated \u2013 \"What our fans have joined together, let no writer rip asunder\". It is also revealed in \"The Ned-Liest Catch\" that she has \"dated\" in addition to Skinner, Moe Szyslak, Lenny, Carl, Comic Book Guy, Joey Kramer, Krusty the Clown, Cletus Spuckler, and several others.\nIt is revealed in the episode \"Ned 'n' Edna's Blend Agenda\" that Edna and Ned married in secret (although she continues to use her first married name, Krabappel, as a teacher), and the town throws them a proper reception. In the episode \"Left Behind\", Ned took a teaching job as a way to honor Edna's memory after she dies. In the 30th-season episode, \"My Way or the Highway to Heaven\", Edna is seen in heaven next to George Washington while Maude Flanders is seen next to Abraham Lincoln.\nCharacter.\nKrabappel's name was chosen by early \"Simpsons\" writers Wallace Wolodarsky and Jay Kogen as a play on the fruit \"crabapple\" and as a reference to the teacher Miss Crabtree from the 1930s \"Our Gang\" shorts. Also, there was an initial joke of everyone mispronouncing the character's last name as \"Crabapple\" until Milhouse uses it in a later episode, stunning the other children. The real Seymour Skinner also mispronounced her name. In one episode, Homer is horrified to learn that no one has corrected him for accidentally calling her \"Crandall\". Like many characters, Ms. Krabappel has a memorable catchphrase, used often in the series: her derisive laugh (\"HA!\").\nRetirement.\nMarcia Wallace died on October 25, 2013; according to her son, the cause of death was related to pneumonia. Staff on \"The Simpsons\" had reportedly been aware of her illness. Showrunner Al Jean said, \"I was tremendously saddened to learn this morning of the passing of the brilliant and gracious Marcia Wallace.\" Although Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge Simpson, was considered to replace Wallace, Jean announced that the show would retire her character. The series first acknowledged Wallace's passing in the episode \"Four Regrettings and a Funeral\", in which the chalkboard gag in the opening sequence was changed to read a single \"We'll really miss you Mrs. K\". The episode \"The Man Who Grew Too Much\" later showed Ned Flanders wearing a black armband and mourning Edna, whose portrait joined that of Maude, Ned's first wife.\nPosthumous character appearances.\nIn \"Moho House\" (season 28, episode 21), she appears as a ghost with Maude when Marge looks at everyone enjoying their spouses. She also appears as a ghost together with Maude in \"Monty Burns' Fleeing Circus\", while Ned is watching his sons perform a song on stage. In \"Todd, Todd, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?\" (season 31, episode 9), she accompanies Maude Flanders as they greet Ned and Homer into Heaven, and appears again at the end of the episode as a ghost hovering over Ned's bed, saying, \"Ha!\". In \"Diary Queen\" (season 32, episode 12), the episode is centred around her diary and she guest-stars through archive recordings.\nCultural impact and reception.\nMarcia Wallace won an Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing Krabappel in the third-season episode \"Bart the Lover\". IGN called \"Special Edna\" the best episode of the fourteenth season of the show. Tilda Swinton modeled her hairdo in the film \"Burn After Reading\" on Krabappel's. \"The Guardian\" ranked Krabappel as the 8th-best teacher.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He developed several astronomical instruments to examine the regularity of the rotation of the earth and among his discoveries was an acceleration of the rotation of the Earth during periods of intense solar activity occurring in 11-year cycles correlated with an increase in earthquakes. The Danjon scale is used for measuring the intensity of lunar eclipses. He noted an increase in the number of dark lunar eclipses with solar activity which is termed as the Danjon effect.\nLife and work.\nDanjon was born in Caen to drapers Louis Dominique Danjon and Marie Justine Binet. He studied at the Lyce Malherbe and then went to the Ecole Normale Superieure during which time he worked at the observatory of the Societe Astronomique de France. He graduated in 1914 and was conscripted into the army during World War I. He served under Ernest Esclangon and lost an eye in combat in Champagne. He received war honours in 1915 and in 1919 he was appointed \"aide-astronome\" to the Strasbourg University. He took up duties as an observer at the Strasbourg Meridian observatory an began to work on the improvement of the observatory. He was involved in establishing a new observatory, the Observatoire de Haute-Provence which became operational in 1923.\nDanjon devised a method to measure \"earthshine\" on the darkside of the Moon using a telescope in which a prism split the Moon's image into two identical side-by-side images. By adjusting a diaphragm to dim one of the images until the sunlit portion had the same apparent brightness as the earthlit portion on the unadjusted image, he could quantify the diaphragm adjustment, and thus had a real measurement for the brightness of earthshine. He recorded the measurements using his method (now known as the Danjon scale, on which zero equates to a barely visible Moon) from 1925 until the 1950s. He extended similar methods to study the albedo of Venus and Mercury which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation \"Recherches de photometrie astronomique\" (1928) at Paris University. In 1930 he succeeded Ernest Esclangon as director of the Strasbourg Observatory. He was also appointed as a professor at Strasbourg University. In 1939, German invasion forced the move of faculty to Clermont-Ferrand near Vichy. He was arrested in November 1943 and he escaped being sent to Auschwitz and was released in January. After World War II, Esclangon retired from his position at the Paris Observatory and Danjon replaced him. Here he taught at the Sorbonne. In the 1960s he persuaded the government to establish the European Southern Observatories at La Silla and at Paranal. He also supported the establishment of radio astronomy.at Nancay in 1956.\nAmong his notable contributions to astronomy was the design of the impersonal (prismatic) astrolabe based on an earlier prismatic astrolabe developed by Fran\u00e7ois Auguste Claude which is now known as the Danjon astrolabe, which led to an improvement in the accuracy of fundamental optical astrometry. An account of this instrument, and of the results of some early years of its operation, are given in Danjon's 1958 George Darwin Lecture to the Royal Astronomical Society.\nThe \"Danjon limit\", a proposed measure of the minimum angular separation between the Sun and the Moon at which a lunar crescent is visible is named after him. However, this limit may not exist. The Danjon effect is a name given for his observation that there is an increase in the number of \"dark\" total lunar eclipses during the 11 year solar sunspot maxima. He developed an astrolabe to identify irregularity in the rotational periodicity and concluded that there was increases in the Earth's rotation during intense solar activity. He suggested that the atmospheric darkness might be due to an increase in aerosols in the atmosphere due to increased volcanic activity.\nDanjon was the President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, during two periods: 1947\u201349 and 1962\u201364. He was awarded the Prix Jules Janssen of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France in 1950, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1958. In 1946 he was made Officier of the Legion d'Honneur and in 1954 he was made Commandeur.\nDanjon died in 1967 in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine. He was married to Madeleine Renoult (m. 1919, died 1965) and they had four children.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2008[ [update]] a large installed base remained and a large variety of connectors, adapters and equipment such as ADSL filters were still in production and readily available.\nIt has no other common or standard use, either within Australia or beyond. However it is manufactured in other countries, usually in China, for export to Australia.\nThe 600 series plug has up to three flat pins plus a non-conducting spigot, which ensures correctly oriented insertion. Each pin carries up to two conductors by means of two contacts, one on each side of the pin. The pin bodies are of a non-conductive plastic material.\nVarieties.\nThe original series 600 plugs and sockets were designed to be equally suitable for fixed wall mounting or for use on flexible cords. Such connectors are still available, but specialised fixed and line versions also exist.\n605 plug.\nStandard three pin six conductor. Often now replaced by a modular 6P2C connector and an adaptor; In particular, this combination is now the most common connector supplied with new equipment in Australia.\nThe non-conducting spigot of the original 605 plug was provided with a hole for a countersunk screw, allowing the plug to be fixed in a wall-mounted socket. Removal then required first removing the socket cover, to allow this retaining screw to be removed. In this way a semi-permanent connection, requiring tools for disconnection, could be achieved.\n610 socket.\nStandard six conductor.\nThe original 610 socket was provided with two mounting holes, one behind the receptacle for the plug spigot, and both for countersunk screws. This arrangement allowed the socket to be secured using two screws, with no plug inserted, or alternatively with the plug inserted, using the same two mounting holes but with one of the screws passing through the spigot to secure the plug as well.\n611 socket.\nSimilar to 610, but with the contacts of pairs one and two allowed to connect when no plug is inserted, contact 1 connecting to 2 and 5 to 6.\nThis is particularly designed for mode 3 connection. The incoming line to the mode 3 device is connected using pair one, and pair two is used as the outgoing line to other devices. If the mode 3 device is unplugged, the switch contacts maintain line connection to the other devices.\nThis function is not generally supported by modular connectors. Modular connectors providing suitable switch contacts are available but not common; Instead, mode 3 devices use two modular connectors, one for the incoming line and the other for the outgoing line. The convenience of using a single connector in this application is one reason for the continued use of 600 series connectors, but mixing this wiring scheme with modular connectors does not work well. For example, if a modern modem with its supplied 6P2C adaptor is plugged into a conventionally wired 611 mode 3 socket, the result is to disconnect all downstream devices.\nIn some sockets conductors 3 and 4 also connect when no plug is present, shorting pair three. Sockets are also available with cams to allow the switching functions to be selectively enabled as required. In some older sockets this could be achieved by simply bending the contacts; The cams merely implement this useful accidental feature in an intentional fashion.\nMany recent 611 sockets have a stepped recess for the plug spigot, to accept a plug with a larger spigot but still provide a good fit for a standard 605 plug. Equipment requiring mode 3 connection can then be equipped with these larger spigot plugs, to prevent this equipment being connected to a 610 socket which does not provide mode 3 support. These plugs are common on older fax machines and modems, and used on some security and similar equipment. These plugs were also used on Telex machines within Australia.\nOther varieties.\n60x plugs.\nIn general, 60x where x is any numeric other than 0 or 5 indicates a non-standard plug. Compatibility and designs vary from maker to maker.\n61x sockets.\nIn general, 61x where x is any numeric other than 0 or 1 indicates a non-standard socket. Compatibility and designs vary from maker to maker.\nExtensions.\nExtension leads are generally four conductor, including pair one and one other pair, wired straight through pin to pin. Some incorporate an adaptor plug which includes a 610 socket, often with all six conductors connected, allowing the extension to also serve as a double adaptor.\nDouble adaptors.\nDouble adaptors are almost always six conductor, wired pin to pin, with a 605 plug and two 610 sockets in parallel.\nMode 3 adaptors.\nA mode 3 adaptor appears physically to be a double adaptor, but the sockets are one 610 and one 611, with pair one of the 610 wired to pair two of the 611, and pair one of the 611 to pair one of the plug. Treatment of the other conductors varies, and may be assignable.\nStandard pinout.\nThe conductors are numbered 1\u20136 from the end further from the spigot. The contact terminals are normally labelled with their numbers on rewireable plugs and sockets.\nUse of pair one is almost always to standard, but pairs two and three may not be present, or the conductors may be used for other purposes. Pair two is often used for local power supply or other proprietary purposes. Adaptors to modular connectors may connect only pair one, or pairs one and two, or all six conductors.\nModems and other equipment supplied in Australia are nowadays normally provided with a modular plug, and an adaptor which connects only pair one, allowing the modular plug to be used with a 610 or 611 socket in need. The pin carrying pair three is often missing completely from the plugs of these adaptors.\nLegacy colour codes.\nLegacy installations and equipment most often use either:\nWiring detail and explanation.\nIn the early 1980s Telecom would install multiple phone sockets in premises as requested, but charged a rental fee per socket, to cover installation and maintenance. In this era the ringing tone was generated by electro-mechanical bells in each phone and with pulse dialling then in use, the 6xx series plugs and sockets supported separation of the bell circuit. This was to avoid a bell tinkling noise during dialling, from any on-hook phones in the circuit. The standard multi-extension wiring in residential premises thus used 3 wires of the 4 wire cable. White was wired to pins 2 and 3 which were bridged by a link in each socket. Red (bell circuit) was connect to pin 5 and blue was connected to pin 6. The black wire was unused and left unconnected in the socket. Electro-mechanical phones such as the 800 series had their internal wiring slightly adjusted to support such multiple extension use.\nWhen phones moved to electronic ringers and tone dialling, the additional socket wiring using pins 3 and 5 was no longer needed for suppression and the use of only pair one, with white on pin 2 and blue on pin 6 became the standard socket wiring, until being superseded by the modular connector.\nModular adaptors.\nAll connection schemes connect pair one to the centre two connectors on the modular connector.\n6P2C.\nThis is the most common scheme, connecting only pair one:\nThe pin carrying contacts 3 and 4 is generally completely absent from these adaptors, as are the contacts 1 and 5. Equipment such as handsets, modems and extension bells sold in or for use in Australia often arrives packaged with one of these adaptors.\n6P4C.\nThis is common in extension cables, many of which have built-in adaptors to 6P4C (and more rarely to 6P6C). There are several conflicting schemes, some using pair two in addition to one, others one and three. As most applications use only pair one, most users are unaware of the potential problem.\nEven if no modular connector is included in an extension cable, most 600 series extension cables are four conductor. Pair one is always connected, and either pair two or three.\n6P6C.\nA common connection scheme is:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the 1980s and early 1990s, they were popular in personal computers and workstations and were the primary competitors of Intel's x86 microprocessors. They were best known as the processors used in the early Apple Macintosh, the Sharp X68000, the Commodore Amiga, the Sinclair QL, the Atari ST and Falcon, the Atari Jaguar, the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) and Sega CD, the Philips CD-i, the Capcom System I (Arcade), the AT&amp;T UNIX PC, the Tandy Model 16/16B/6000, the Sun Microsystems Sun-1, Sun-2 and Sun-3, the NeXT Computer, NeXTcube, NeXTstation, and NeXTcube Turbo, early Silicon Graphics IRIS workstations, the Aesthedes, computers from MASSCOMP, the Texas Instruments TI-89/TI-92 calculators, the Palm Pilot (all models running Palm OS 4.x or earlier), the Control Data Corporation CDCNET Device Interface, the VTech Precomputer Unlimited and the Space Shuttle. Although no modern desktop computers are based on processors in the 680x0 series, derivative processors are still widely used in embedded systems.\nMotorola ceased development of the 680x0 series architecture in 1994, replacing it with the PowerPC RISC architecture, which was developed in conjunction with IBM and Apple Computer as part of the AIM alliance.\nImprovement history.\n68010:\n68020:\n68030:\n68040:\n68060:\nUses.\nThe 680x0 line of processors has been used in a variety of systems, from high-end Texas Instruments calculators (the TI-89, TI-92, and Voyage 200 lines) to all of the members of the Palm Pilot series that run Palm OS 1.x to 4.x (OS 5.x is ARM-based), and even radiation-hardened versions in the critical control systems of the Space Shuttle.\nThe 680x0 CPU family became most well known for powering desktop computers and video game consoles such as the Macintosh 128K, Amiga, Sinclair QL, Atari ST, Genesis / Mega Drive, NG AES/Neo Geo CD, CDTV. They were the processors of choice in the 1980s for Unix workstations and servers such as AT&amp;T's UNIX PC, Tandy's Model 16/16B/6000, Sun Microsystems' Sun-1, Sun-2, Sun-3, , Silicon Graphics (SGI), and numerous others. \nThe Saturn uses the 68000 for audio processing and other I/O tasks, while the Jaguar includes a 68000 intended for basic system control and input processing, but was frequently used for running game logic. Many arcade boards also use 68000 processors including those from Capcom, SNK, and Sega.\nThe first several versions of Adobe's PostScript interpreters were 68000-based. The 68000 in the Apple LaserWriter and LaserWriter Plus was clocked faster than the version used then in Macintosh computers. A fast 68030 in later PostScript interpreters, including the standard resolution LaserWriter IIntx, IIf and IIg (also 300 dpi), the higher resolution LaserWriter Pro 600 series (usually 600\u00a0dpi, but limited to 300\u00a0dpi with minimum RAM installed) and the very high resolution Linotronic imagesetters, the 200PS (1500+\u00a0dpi) and 300PS (2500+\u00a0dpi). Thereafter, Adobe generally preferred a RISC for its processor, as its competitors, with their PostScript clones, had already gone with RISCs, often an AMD 29000-series. The early 68000-based Adobe PostScript interpreters and their hardware were named for Cold War-era U.S. rockets and missiles: Atlas, Redstone, etc.\nMicrocontrollers derived from the 68000 family have been used in a huge variety of applications. CPU32 and ColdFire microcontrollers have been manufactured in the millions as automotive engine controllers.\nMany proprietary video editing systems used 68000 processors, such as the MacroSystem Casablanca, which was a black box with an easy to use graphic interface (1997). It was intended for the amateur and hobby videographer market. It is also worth noting its earlier, bigger and more professional counterpart, the \"DraCo\" (1995). The groundbreaking Quantel Paintbox series of early based 24-bit paint and effects system was originally released in 1981 and during its lifetime it used nearly the entire range of 68000 family processors, with the sole exception of the 68060, which was never implemented in its design. Another contender in the video arena, the Abekas 8150 DVE system, used the 680EC30, and the Play Trinity, later renamed Globecaster, uses several 68030s. The Bosch FGS-4000/4500 Video Graphics System manufactured by Robert Bosch Corporation, later BTS (1983), used a 68000 as its main processor; it drove several others to perform 3D animation in a computer that could easily apply Gouraud and Phong shading. It ran a modified Motorola VERSAdos operating system.\nArchitecture.\nPeople who are familiar with the PDP-11 or VAX usually feel comfortable with the 68000 series. With the exception of the split of general-purpose registers into specialized data and address registers, the 68000 architecture is in many ways a 32-bit PDP-11.\nIt had a more orthogonal instruction set than those of many processors that came before (e.g., 8080) and after (e.g., x86). That is, it was typically possible to combine operations freely with operands, rather than being restricted to using certain addressing modes with certain instructions. This property made programming relatively easy for humans, and also made it easier to write code generators for compilers.\nThe 68000 series has eight 32-bit general-purpose data registers (D0-D7), and eight address registers (A0-A7). The last address register is the stack pointer, and assemblers accept the label SP as equivalent to A7.\nIn addition, it has a 16-bit status register. The upper 8 bits is the system byte, and modification of it is privileged. The lower 8 bits is the user byte, also known as the condition code register (CCR), and modification of it is not privileged. The 68000 comparison, arithmetic, and logic operations modify condition codes to record their results for use by later conditional jumps. The condition code bits are \"zero\" (Z), \"carry\" (C), \"overflow\" (V), \"extend\" (X), and \"negative\" (N). The \"extend\" (X) flag deserves special mention, because it is separate from the carry flag. This permits the extra bit from arithmetic, logic, and shift operations to be separated from the carry for flow-of-control and linkage.\nWhile the 68000 had a 'supervisor mode', it did not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements due to the single instruction 'MOVE from SR', which copies the status register to another register, being unprivileged but sensitive. In the Motorola 68010 and later, this was made privileged, to better support virtualization software.\nThe 68000 series instruction set can be divided into the following broad categories:\nThe Motorola 68020 added some new instructions that include some minor improvements and extensions to the supervisor state, several instructions for software management of a multiprocessing system (which were removed in the 68060), some support for high-level languages which did not get used much (and was removed from future 680x0 processors), bigger multiply (32\u00d732\u219264 bits) and divide (64\u00f732\u219232 bits quotient and 32 bits remainder) instructions, and bit field manipulations.\nThe standard addressing modes are:\nPlus: access to the status register, and, in later models, other special registers.\nThe Motorola 68020 added a scaled indexing address mode, and added another level of indirection to many of the pre-existing modes.\nMost instructions have dot-letter suffixes, permitting operations to occur on 8-bit bytes (\".b\"), 16-bit words (\".w\"), and 32-bit longs (\".l\").\nMost instructions are dyadic, that is, the operation has a source, and a destination, and the destination is changed. Notable instructions were:\n68050 and 68070.\nMotorola mainly used even numbers for major revisions to the CPU core such as 68000, 68020, 68040 and 68060. The 68010 was a revised version of the 68000 with minor modifications to the core, and likewise the 68030 was a revised 68020 with some more powerful features, none of them significant enough to classify as a major upgrade to the core.\nThe 68050 was reportedly \"a minor upgrade of the 68040\" that lost a battle for resources within Motorola, competing against projects that had been scheduled to succeed it: the 0.5\u03bcm, low-power, low-cost \"LP040\", and the superscalar, superpipelined \"Q\", borrowing from the 88110 and anticipated as the 68060. Subsequent reports indicated that Motorola had considered the 68050 as not meriting the necessary investment in production of the part. Odd-numbered releases had always been reactions to issues raised within the prior even numbered part; hence, it was generally expected that the 68050 would have reduced the 68040's power consumption (and thus heat dissipation), improved exception handling in the FPU, used a smaller feature size and optimized the microcode in line with program use of instructions. Many of these optimizations were included with the 68060 and were part of its design goals. For any number of reasons, likely that the 68060 was in development, that the Intel 80486 was not progressing as quickly as Motorola assumed it would, and that 68060 was a demanding project, the 68050 was cancelled early in development.\nThere is also no revision of the 68060, as Motorola was in the process of shifting away from the 68000 and 88k processor lines into its new PowerPC business, so the 68070 was never developed. Had it been, it would have been a revised 68060, likely with a superior FPU (pipelining was widely speculated upon on Usenet).\nThere was a CPU with the 68070 designation, which was a licensed and somewhat slower version of the 16/32-bit 68000 with a basic DMA controller, I2C host and an on-chip serial port. This 68070 was used as the main CPU in the Philips CD-i. This CPU was, however, produced by Philips and not officially part of Motorola's 680x0 lineup.\nMotorola had announced a product roadmap beyond the 68060 featuring the 68080 rated at 200-350 MIPS, due by 1995, and a product rated at 800 MIPS, possibly with the name 68100, by 2000.\nLast generation.\nThe 4th-generation 68060 provided equivalent functionality (though not instruction-set-architecture compatibility) to most of the features of the Intel P5 microarchitecture.\nOther variants.\nThe Personal Computers XT/370 and AT/370 PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes each included two modified Motorola 68000 processors with custom microcode to emulate S/370 mainframe instructions.\nAn Arizona-based company, Edge Computer Corp, reportedly founded by former Honeywell designers, produced processors compatible with the 68000 series, these being claimed as having \"a three to five times performance \u2013 and 18 to 24 months' time \u2013 advantage\" over Motorola's own products. In 1987, the company introduced the Edge 1000 range of \"32-bit superminicomputers implementing the Motorola instruction set in the Edge mainframe architecture\", employing two independent pipelines - an instruction fetch pipeline (IFP) and operand executive pipeline (OEP) - relying on a branch prediction unit featuring a 4096-entry branch cache, retrieving instructions and operands over multiple buses. An agreement between Edge Computer and Olivetti subsequently led to the latter introducing products in its own \"Linea Duo\" range based on Edge Computer's machines. The company was subsequently renamed to Edgcore Technology Inc. (also reported as Edgecore Technology Inc.). Edgcore's deal with Olivetti in 1987 to supply the company's E1000 processor was followed in 1989 by another deal with Philips Telecommunications Data Systems to supply the E2000 processor, this supporting the 68030 instruction set and reportedly offering a performance rating of 16 VAX MIPS. Similar deals with Nixdorf Computer and Hitachi were also signed in 1989.\nEdge Computer reportedly had an agreement with Motorola. Despite increasing competition from RISC products, Edgcore sought to distinguish its products in the market by emphasising its \"alliance\" with Motorola, employing a marketing campaign drawing from Aesop's fables with \"the fox (Edgecore) who climbs on the back of the stallion (Motorola) to pluck fruit off the higher branches of the tree\". Other folktale advertising themes such as Little Red Riding Hood were employed. With the company's investors having declined to finance the company further, and with a number of companies having been involved in discussions with other parties, Arix Corp. announced the acquisition of Edgcore in July 1989. Arix was reportedly able to renew its deal with Hitachi in 1990, whereas the future of previous deals with Olivetti and Philips remained in some doubt after the acquisition of Edgcore.\nIn 1992, a company called International Meta Systems (IMS) announced a RISC-based CPU, the IMS 3250, that could reportedly emulate the \"Intel 486 or Motorola 68040 at full native speeds and at a fraction of their cost\". Clocked at , emulations had supposedly been developed of a 486 and 68040, including floating-point unit support, with the product aiming for mid-1993 production at a per-unit cost of . Amidst the apparent proliferation of emulation support in processors such as the PowerPC 615, in 1994, IMS had reportedly filed a patent on its emulation technology but had not found any licensees. Repeated delays to the introduction of this product, blamed on one occasion on \"a need to improve the chip's speech-processing capabilities\", apparently led to the company seeking to introduce another chip, the Meta6000, aiming to compete with Intel's P6 products. Ultimately, IMS entered bankruptcy having sold patents to a litigator, TechSearch, who in 1998 attempted to sue Intel for infringement of an IMS patent. TechSearch reportedly lost their case but sought to appeal, also seeking to sue Intel for \"libel and slander\" on the basis of comments made by an Intel representative who had characterised TechSearch's business model unfavourably in remarks to the press.\nAfter the mainline 68000 processors' demise, the 68000 family has been used to some extent in microcontroller and embedded microprocessor versions. These chips include the ones listed under \"other\" above, i.e. the CPU32 (aka 68330), the ColdFire, the QUICC and the DragonBall.\nWith the advent of FPGA technology an international team of hardware developers have re-created the 68000 with many enhancements as an FPGA core. Their core is known as the 68080 and is used in Vampire-branded Amiga accelerators.\nMagnetic Scrolls used a subset of the 68000's instructions as a base for the virtual machine in their text adventures.\nCompetitors.\nDesktop.\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, when the 68000 was widely used in desktop computers, it mainly competed against Intel's x86 architecture used in IBM PC compatibles. Generation 1 68000 CPUs competed against mainly the 16-bit 8086, 8088, and 80286. Generation 2 competed against the 80386 (the first 32-bit x86 processor), and generation 3 against the 80486. The fourth generation competed with the P5 Pentium line, but it was not nearly as widely used as its predecessors, since much of the old 68000 marketplace was either defunct or nearly so (as was the case with Atari and NeXT), or converting to newer architectures (PowerPC for the Macintosh and Amiga, SPARC for Sun, and MIPS for Silicon Graphics (SGI)).\nEmbedded.\nThere are dozens of processor architectures that are successful in embedded systems. Some are microcontrollers which are much simpler, smaller, and cheaper than the 68000, while others are relatively sophisticated and can run complex software. Embedded versions of the 68000 often compete with processor architectures based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS, SuperH, and others.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She came to prominence in the early 1950s with the song \"Come On-a My House\", which was followed by other pop numbers such as \"Botch-a-Me\", \"Mambo Italiano\", \"Tenderly\", \"Half as Much\", \"Hey There\", \"This Ole House\", and \"Sway\". She also had success as a jazz vocalist. Clooney's career languished in the 1960s, partly because of problems related to bipolar disorder and drug addiction, but revived in 1977, when her \"White Christmas\" co-star Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. Clooney continued recording until her death in 2002.\nEarly life.\nRosemary Clooney was born on May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Kentucky, the daughter of Marie Frances (n\u00e9e Guilfoyle) and Andrew Joseph Clooney. She was one of five children. Andrew was of Irish and German descent while Marie was of Irish ancestry. Clooney was raised Catholic. At age 15, her mother and brother Nick moved to California. Clooney and her sister Betty remained with their father. The family resided in the John Brett Richeson House in the late 1940s.\nRosemary and Betty became entertainers, whereas Nick became a newsman and television broadcaster (some of her children, including Miguel Ferrer and Rafael Ferrer, and her nephew, George Clooney, also became respected actors and entertainers). In 1945, the Clooney sisters won a spot on Cincinnati's radio station WLW as singers. Rosemary and Betty sang in a duo for much of Rosemary's early career.\nCareer.\nIn 1947, the Clooney sisters signed with Columbia Records and cut their first record with Tony Pastor's big band, \"I'm Sorry I Didn't Say Sorry\", backed with \"The Lady from Twenty-Nine Palms\". Pastor had initially been reluctant to take both sisters into his band especially as Betty was still under the age of 18 but finally relented. The Clooneys cut 14 sides with the Pastor band before going their separate ways; Rosemary made her solo recording debut in mid-1949 with \"Bargain Day\" and \"Cabaret\". Betty did some recording and live performances as an adult but did not pursue a full-time singing career like her sister.\nIn 1950\u201351, Clooney was a regular on the CBS radio and television versions of \"Songs for Sale\". In early 1951, she had a minor hit with \"Beautiful Brown Eyes\", but Clooney's recording of \"Come On-a My House\" four months later, produced by Mitch Miller, became her first big chart hit. Miller would gain a semi-notorious reputation for his promotion of novelty pop material, which he often personally selected and provided musical arrangements for. Clooney recounted in her memoir that she despised the song, but as a young upstart singer with no leverage to speak of, she had no say in any of the material that she recorded. Clooney made several duets with Marlene Dietrich (released in the EP \"Rosie and Marlene\"), and appeared in the early 1950s on \"Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town\" series on CBS. She also did several guest appearances on the Arthur Godfrey radio show, when it was sponsored by Lipton Tea. They did duets as he played his ukulele, and other times, Clooney would sing one of her latest hits.\nIn 1954, Clooney starred, along with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Vera-Ellen, in the movie \"White Christmas\". Two years later, she starred in a half-hour syndicated television musical-variety show, \"The Rosemary Clooney Show\", which featured The Hi-Lo's singing group and Nelson Riddle's orchestra. In 1957, the show moved to NBC prime time as \"The Lux Show Starring Rosemary Clooney\", but it lasted only one season. The new show featured the singing group The Modernaires and Frank DeVol's orchestra. In later years, Clooney often appeared with Bing Crosby on television, such as in the 1957 special \"The Edsel Show\", and the two friends made a concert tour of Ireland together. On November 21, 1957, she appeared on NBC's \"The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford\", a frequent entry in the \"Top 20\" and featuring a musical group called \"The Top Twenty\". In 1960, Clooney and Crosby co-starred in a 20-minute CBS radio program that aired before the midday news each weekday. She had 16 songs make the Billboard pop chart from 1951 to 1956 and was one of the biggest names in pop music for several years.\nClooney's last major chart hit was \"I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face\", released in May 1956. Rock-and-roll was displacing older singers from the pop charts but multiple pregnancies and childbirths in a short span of time also impaired her ability to tour or promote records.\nClooney left Columbia in 1958, doing a number of recordings for MGM Records and then some for Coral Records. Toward the end of 1958, she signed with RCA Victor, where she recorded until 1963. In 1964, Clooney recorded for Reprise Records, and in 1965, Dot Records.\nA one-off single for Dot, \"Let Me Down Easy\", in 1968 was the last new material Clooney would release for the next eight years as she spent most of that time recovering from a severe mental breakdown and substance abuse issues.\nIn 1976, Clooney recorded two albums for United Artists Records, the first new LP she had released in more than a decade. Beginning in 1977, she recorded an album every year for the Concord Jazz record label, a schedule which continued until her death. At that time, Clooney was one of the few singers of her generation to still be making regular recordings. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clooney did television commercials for Coronet brand paper towels, during which she sang the memorable jingle, \"Extra value is what you get, when you buy Cor-o-net.\" Clooney sang a duet with Wild Man Fischer on \"It's a Hard Business\" in 1986, and in 1994, she sang a duet of \"Green Eyes\" with Barry Manilow in his 1994 album, \"Singin' with the Big Bands\".\nIn 1994, Clooney guest-starred in the NBC television medical drama \"ER\" (starring her nephew, George Clooney); for her performance, she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. On January 27, 1996, Clooney appeared on Garrison Keillor's \"Prairie Home Companion\" radio program. She sang \"When October Goes\"\u2014lyrics by Johnny Mercer and music by Barry Manilow (after Mercer's death)\u2014from Manilow's 1984 album \"\", and discussed the excellence of Manilow the musician.\nClooney was also awarded Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. In 1999, she founded the Rosemary Clooney Music Festival, held annually in Maysville, her hometown. Clooney performed at the festival every year until her death. Proceeds benefit the restoration of the Russell Theater in Maysville, where Clooney's first film, \"The Stars Are Singing\", premiered in 1953.\nClooney received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.\nPersonal life.\nClooney was married twice to Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. They first married on July 13, 1953, in Durant, Oklahoma. They moved to Santa Monica, California, in 1954, and then to Los Angeles in 1958. Together, the couple had five children; son Miguel Ferrer also became an actor. Clooney and Ferrer divorced for the first time in 1961.\nClooney remarried Ferrer on November 22, 1964, in Los Angeles. However, the marriage again crumbled while Ferrer was carrying on an affair with the woman who would become his last wife, Stella Magee. The couple divorced again after Clooney found out about the affair, this time in 1967.\nIn 1968, Clooney's relationship with a drummer ended after two years. At this time, following a tour, she became increasingly dependent on tranquilizers and sleeping pills.\nClooney joined the presidential campaign of close friend Robert F. Kennedy and heard the shots when he was assassinated on June 5, 1968. A month later, she had a nervous breakdown onstage in Reno, Nevada, where Clooney began shouting insults at her audience. She was hospitalized in a mental health care facility and remained in psychoanalytic therapy for eight years.\nClooney's sister Betty died at age 45 of a brain aneurysm in 1976, and she subsequently started a foundation in memory of and named for Betty. During this time, Clooney also wrote her first autobiography, \"This for Remembrance: The Autobiography of Rosemary Clooney, an Irish-American Singer\", written in collaboration with Raymond Strait and published by Playboy Press in 1977. Clooney chronicled her unhappy early life, her career as a singer, her marriage to Ferrer, her mental breakdown in 1968, and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder that seriously disrupted her career, concluding with her comeback as a singer and her happiness. Clooney's good friend Bing Crosby wrote the introduction. Katherine Coker adapted the book for Jackie Cooper, who produced and directed the television movie, \"Rosie: The Rosemary Clooney Story\" (1982) starring Sondra Locke (who lip synced Clooney's songs), Penelope Milford as Betty, and Tony Orlando as Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. The 1944-born Locke was 38 at the time and just 16 years younger than Clooney in real life, yet playing her from 17 to 40. Orlando and Locke were the same age, although the real Ferrer was 16 years older than Clooney.\nIn 1983, Clooney and her brother Nick co-chaired the Betty Clooney Foundation for the Brain-Injured, addressing the needs of survivors of cognitive disabilities caused by strokes, tumors, and brain damage from trauma or age.\nIn 1997, Clooney married her longtime friend and a former dancer, Dante DiPaolo, at St. Patrick's Church in Maysville, Kentucky.\nIn 1999, Clooney published her second autobiography, \"Girl Singer: An Autobiography\", describing her battles with addiction to prescription drugs for depression, and how she lost and then regained a fortune. \"I'd call myself a sweet singer with a big band sensibility,\" she wrote.\nLung cancer and death.\nA longtime heavy smoker, Clooney was diagnosed with lung cancer at the end of 2001. She died on June 29, 2002, at age 74 at her Beverly Hills home from complications of cancer. A funeral was held for Clooney at St. Patrick's Church in Maysville, Kentucky.\nLegacy.\nClooney lived for many years in Beverly Hills, California, in the house formerly owned by George and Ira Gershwin at 1019 North Roxbury Drive. It was sold to a developer after her death in 2002 and has since been demolished. In 1980, Clooney purchased a second home on Riverside Drive in Augusta, Kentucky, near Maysville, her childhood hometown. Today, the Augusta house serves as a historic house museum, allowing visitors to view collections of her personal items and memorabilia from many of her films and singing performances. Clooney also maintained an apartment in the early 1960s at the Winslow Hotel on Madison Avenue (now demolished).\nIn 2003, Clooney was inducted into the Kentucky Women Remembered exhibit, and her portrait by Alison Lyne is on permanent display in the Kentucky State Capitol's rotunda. That same year, Bette Midler, after many years apart, rejoined forces with Barry Manilow to record \"Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook\". The album was an instant success, being certified gold by Recording Industry Association of America. One of the songbook selections, \"This Ole House\", became Midler's first Christian radio single shipped by Rick Hendrix and his positive music movement. The album was nominated for a Grammy the following year.\nIn 2005, the album \"Reflections of Rosemary\" by Debby Boone was released. Boone, who was Clooney's daughter-in-law, intended the album to be a musical portrait of Clooney, or as Boone put it: \"I wanted to select songs that would give an insight into Rosemary from a family perspective\".\nIn September 2007, a mural honoring moments from Clooney's life was painted in downtown Maysville; it highlights the 1953 premiere of \"The Stars Are Singing\" and her singing career. It was painted by Louisiana muralists Robert Dafford, Herb Roe, and Brett Chigoy as part of the Maysville Floodwall Murals project. Clooney's brother, Nick, spoke during the dedication for the mural, explaining various images to the crowd.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64844", "revid": "1304636092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64844", "title": "Hydrophone", "text": "Underwater microphone\nA hydrophone () is a microphone designed for underwater use, for recording or listening to underwater sound. Most hydrophones contain a piezoelectric transducer that generates an electric potential when subjected to a pressure change, such as a sound wave.\nA hydrophone can also detect airborne sounds but is insensitive of them because it is designed to match the acoustic impedance of water, a denser fluid than air. Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air, and a sound wave in water exerts a pressure 60 times more than what is exerted by a wave of the same amplitude in air. Similarly, a standard microphone can be buried in the ground, or immersed in water if it is put in a waterproof container but will give poor performance because of the similarly-bad acoustic impedance match.\nHistory.\nThe first hydrophones consisted of a tube with a thin membrane covering the submerged end and the observer's ear of the equipment.\u200a The design of effective hydrophones must take into account the acoustic resistance of water, which is 3750 times that of air, and so the pressure exerted by a wave of the same intensity in air is increased by a factor of 3750 in water. The American Submarine Signaling Company developed a hydrophone to detect bells rung from lighthouses and lightships underwater.\u200a The case was a thick, hollow brass disc in diameter. On one face was a brass diaphragm, which was coupled by a short brass rod to a carbon microphone.\nWorld War I.\nEarly in the war, French President Raymond Poincar\u00e9 provided Paul Langevin with the facilities needed to work on a method to locate submarines by the echos from sound pulses. They developed a piezoelectric hydrophone by increasing the power of the signal with a vacuum tube amplifier; the high acoustic impedance of piezoelectric materials facilitated their use as underwater transducers. The same piezoelectric plate could be vibrated by an electrical oscillator to produce the sound pulses.\u200a\nThe first submarine to be detected and sunk using a primitive hydrophone was the German submarine \"UC-3\" on 23 April 1916. \"UC-3\" was detected by the anti-submarine trawler \"Cheerio\" as the \"Cheerio\" was directly over the \"UC-3\"; the \"UC-3\" was then caught in a steel net dragged by the trawler, and sank after a large underwater explosion.\nLater in the war, the British Admiralty belatedly convened a scientific panel to advise on how to combat U-boats. It included the Australian physicist William Henry Bragg and the New Zealand physicist Sir Ernest Rutherford. They concluded that the best hope was to use hydrophones to listen for submarines. Rutherford's research produced his sole patent for a hydrophone. Bragg took the lead in July 1916 and he moved to the Admiralty hydrophone research establishment at Hawkcraig on the Firth of Forth.\u200a\nThe scientists set two goals: to develop a hydrophone that could hear a submarine despite the noise generated by the patrol ship carrying the hydrophone, and to develop a hydrophone that could reveal the bearing of the submarine. A bidirectional hydrophone was invented at East London College. They mounted a microphone on each side of a diaphragm in a cylindrical case; when the sounds heard from both microphones have the same intensity, the microphone is in line with the sound source.\u200a\nBragg's laboratory made such a hydrophone directional by mounting a baffle in front of one side of the diaphragm. It took months to discover that effective baffles must contain a layer of air.\u200a In 1918, airships of the Royal Naval Air Service engaged in anti-submarine warfare experimented by trailing dipped hydrophones. Bragg tested a hydrophone from a captured German U-boat and found it inferior to British models. By the end of the war, the British had 38 hydrophone officers and 200 qualified listeners, paid an additional 4\"d\" per day.\u200a\nFrom late in World War I until the introduction of active sonar in the early 1920s, hydrophones were the sole method for submarines to detect targets while submerged; they remain useful today.\nDirectional hydrophones.\nA small single cylindrical ceramic transducer can achieve near perfect omnidirectional reception. Directional hydrophones increase sensitivity from one direction using two basic techniques:\nFocused transducers.\nThis device uses a single transducer element with a dish or conical-shaped sound reflector to focus the signals, in a similar manner to a reflecting telescope. This type of hydrophone can be produced from a low-cost omnidirectional type, but must be used while stationary, as the reflector impedes its movement through water. A new way to direct is to use a spherical body around the hydrophone. The advantage of directivity spheres is that the hydrophone can be moved within the water, ridding it of the interferences produced by a conical-shaped element.\nArrays.\nMultiple hydrophones can be arranged in an array so that it will add the signals from the desired direction while subtracting signals from other directions. The array may be steered using a beamformer. Most commonly, hydrophones are arranged in a \"line array\" but may be in many different arrangements depending on what is being measured. As an example, in the article measuring propeller noise from fleet ships required complex hydrophone array systems to achieve actionable measurements.\nSOSUS hydrophones, laid on the seabed and connected by underwater cables, were used, beginning in the 1950s, by the U.S. Navy to track movement of Soviet submarines during the Cold War along a line from Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom known as the GIUK gap. These are capable of clearly recording extremely low frequency infrasound, including many unexplained ocean sounds.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta. He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa Simpson's favorite TV show, a variety show consisting of various kid-friendly sketches and often highly violent cartoons, most notably \"The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show\". Despite his cheery onscreen persona, Krusty is actually a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most frequently occurring characters outside the main Simpson family and has been the focus of many episodes, namely some centering around his relationship with his former co-star Sideshow Bob, who later became a major antagonist of the series.\nKrusty was created by cartoonist Matt Groening and partially inspired by Rusty Nails, a television clown from Groening's hometown of Portland, Oregon. He was designed to look like Homer Simpson (also voiced by Castellaneta) with clown makeup, based on the scrapped original concept of Krusty where Bart worships a television clown who is ironically his own father that he looks down upon; the idea of Homer playing the role of Krusty would eventually be explored in the Season 6 episode, \"Homie the Clown\". Krusty's voice is based on Bob Bell, who portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown. Krusty made his television debut on January 15, 1989, in the \"Tracey Ullman Show\" short \"The Krusty the Clown Show\".\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nHerschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky was born in the Lower East Side of Springfield and is the son of Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky. Very little is known about Herschel's mother, aside from her name being Rachel and that she died when Krusty was around thirteen years old. Hyman strongly opposed Krusty's wish to become a clown and make people laugh, believing that it would distract Herschel from his religion, wanting the boy to go to \"yeshiva\" instead. However, Krusty performed slapstick comedy, obscuring this from his father. However, Herschel was performing at a rabbis' convention when one joking rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. When Rabbi Krustofsky discovered Herschel was the clown onstage, he disowned his son and did not speak to him for 25 years. Krusty later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa Simpson.\nIt was later revealed that Krusty did not have a Bar Mitzvah service, because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by \"acting up.\" Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies: a Hollywood gala which Krusty uses to stage a comeback after his show is cancelled, then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father. After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield, Krusty started his show biz career as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi (Elvis Presley's birthplace). Krusty later discovers that he has a daughter named Sophie. He had met Sophie's mother Erin when Erin was a soldier in the Gulf War and he was entertaining the troops. After spending the night together, he prevented Erin from assassinating Saddam Hussein to protect his Saddam-themed comedy act. After that, Erin started hating clowns, and she kept their daughter a secret from Krusty. Krusty and Sophie bonded over time, and while not a full-time father, he is known to acknowledge her birthdays and occasionally references his daughter publicly.\nKrusty has his own show on Channel 6 in Springfield: \"The Krusty the Clown Show\", which is aimed towards a children's audience and has many followers, including Bart. Krusty has licensed the show to dozens of countries that produce localized versions, including Ireland, China, Jamaica, and Romania with the original version being the least popular. Krusty's show has gone through various phases: a clip from 1961 presents the show as a serious talk show featuring Krusty interviewing AFL\u2013CIO president George Meany on the topic of collective bargaining agreements, while a clip from 1963 shows Krusty interviewing Robert Frost, then dumping a load of snow on the poet. The show later takes a different turn, featuring Ravi Shankar as a guest and having Krusty howl a drugged-out version of The Doors' \"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\" in 1973. By the 1980s, the show had devolved into a children's entertainment show, although in one episode Krusty provided updates on the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands. During the series, the \"Krusty the Clown Show\" is shown to be aimed almost entirely at children. It features many characters, including Sideshow Mel, Mr. Teeny, Tina Ballerina, and Corporal Punishment. Sideshow Bob begins the series as Krusty's main sidekick. However, years of constant abuse lead to Bob framing Krusty for armed robbery, although Bob is eventually foiled by Bart. Bob is replaced by Sideshow Mel, who has remained loyal to Krusty despite being constantly abused by Krusty as well.\nKrusty seems to retire from\u2014and then get back into\u2014show business repeatedly throughout his career. One of his retirements is almost made permanent due to just-paroled Sideshow Bob's latest scheme: wiring plastic explosives to a hypnotized Bart and sending Bart onstage. When Krusty makes a tribute to Bob, however, Bob has a change of heart and stops Bart from fulfilling his mission. Bob and Krusty later reconcile, with Krusty exclaiming that Bob's attempts at Krusty's life make his ratings shoot through the roof. This reconciliation remains for the rest of the series, as Bob abandons his attempts for revenge on Krusty in favor of targeting Bart exclusively.\nBart is one of Krusty's biggest fans. In the episode \"Krusty Gets Busted\" he declares, \"I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings,\" and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposes Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helps Krusty return to the air with a comeback special, reigniting his career, and reunites Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but almost immediately forgets about it \u2014 presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits as well as his general conceitedness \u2014 and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attends Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp turns out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp is simply a franchise location to which Krusty has licensed his image. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty will show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brings in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushes Bart over the edge. He decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart.\nKrusty is a multimillionaire who has amassed his fortune mostly by licensing his name and image to a variety of substandard products and services, from Krusty alarm clocks to Krusty crowd control barriers. Many of these products are potentially dangerous, such as Krusty's brand of cereal, Krusty-O's, which in one episode boasts a jagged metal Krusty-O in each box. One of many lawsuits regarding these products is launched by Bart, who eats a jagged metal Krusty-O by mistake and has to have his appendix removed. The \"Krusty Korporation\", the company responsible for Krusty's licensing, has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures, such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfires when the Soviet Union boycotts the games, causing Krusty to lose $44\u00a0million. In the TV series and comic books, Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the fast foods restaurant chain Krusty Burger. It has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half-eaten burgers to make new ones, as well as using beef infected with mad cow disease to save money.\nKrusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his cigarettes with hundred-dollar bills, eating condor-egg omelettes, spending huge sums on pornographic magazines and call girls, and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas and betting against the Harlem Globetrotters.\nKrusty is a hard-living entertainment veteran, sometimes depicted as a jaded, burned-out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and Xanax. He instantly becomes depressed as soon as the cameras stop rolling; Marge states in \"The Sweetest Apu\" that, \"off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man.\" Krusty appears to have used cocaine, one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder under his nose; however, he explains that he was simply researching a part for a film in which he played himself. In his book \"Planet Simpson\", author Chris Turner describes Krusty as \"the wizened veteran, the total pro\" who lives the celebrity life. He is miserable but he needs his celebrity status. In \"Bart the Fink\", Bart inadvertently reports Krusty for tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and, as a result, Krusty loses most of his money. Bart soon discovers that Krusty has faked his death and is living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat. Krusty declares that he is finished with the life of a celebrity and is unconvinced when Bart reminds him of his fans and his entourage. Finally, Bart tells Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status, which convinces Krusty to return. Krusty has been described as \"the consummate showman who can't bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people.\"\nIn \"Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington\", Bart convinces Krusty to run for Congress so that Krusty can introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agrees and runs on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign starts off badly, Lisa suggests that he try connecting with regular families. He does so, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term starts off badly, as he is completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With the help of the Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeds in passing his bill.\nHis body features include a third nipple, a veal-shaped birthmark, and a scar on his chest as a result of having a pacemaker inserted into his heart after suffering from a heart attack on-air in 1986.\nIn the \"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\", Krusty's age is revealed to be 52.\nCharacterization.\nCreation.\nKrusty first appeared in \"The Krusty the Clown Show\", one of the \"Simpsons\" shorts from \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" that first aired on January 15, 1989. The character was partially inspired by TV clown \"Rusty Nails\" whom \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening and director Brad Bird watched as children while growing up in Portland, Oregon. Groening describes Rusty Nails as being a sweet clown whose show sometimes had a Christian message, but whose name scared Groening. Dan Castellaneta based his voice characterization on Chicago television's Bob Bell who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. Krusty has been compared to an earlier incarnation named \"Flunky the Late Night viewer mail clown\" who had appeared on \"Late Night with David Letterman\". Jeff Martin, a writer on Letterman's show, created and played the character. Martin also went on to become a writer on \"The Simpsons\" writing episodes that included Krusty.\nMany events in Krusty's life parallel those of comedian Jerry Lewis, including his Jewish background, addiction to Percodan, hosting of telethons, and appearance in an adaptation of \"The Jazz Singer\". When asked, Groening has simply noted that \"[\"Simpsons\"] characters are collaborations between the writers, animators, and actors\" without specifically confirming or denying the association.\nKrusty's appearance and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that \"The satirical conceit that I was going for at the time was that \"The Simpsons\" was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father\", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a Butterfinger commercial depicting a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. In the episode \"Homie the Clown\", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as\u2014and is confused with\u2014Krusty.\nThe Krusty character was originally conceived as just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that \"at some point, we decided he looked [like a clown] all the time\". The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in \"Krusty Gets Busted\" and \"Like Father, Like Clown\". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In \"Homer's Triple Bypass\", Krusty reveals that his \"grotesque appearance\" is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, \"This ain't makeup.\" In \"Bart the Fink\", he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.\nDevelopment.\nThe third season episode \"Like Father, Like Clown\" is the first to establish that Krusty is Jewish. Krusty's religion had not been part of the original concept, the idea to make Krusty Jewish came from then head writer Jay Kogen. The episode is a parody of \"The Jazz Singer\", which is about a son with a strict religious upbringing who defies his father to become an entertainer. In order to make \"Like Father, Like Clown\" a full parody of \"The Jazz Singer\", the decision was made to make Krusty Jewish and have his father be a rabbi. Krusty's real last name, Krustofsky, was pitched by Al Jean. Krusty's father Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky was played by Jackie Mason, who won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for the episode. It was established in \"Krusty Gets Busted\" that Krusty is illiterate. This was shown in subsequent episodes like \"Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge\" but the trait was dropped after the first few seasons because it was hard for the writers to write for an illiterate character.\nKrusty's design has undergone several subtle changes since the early years. For the episode \"Homie the Clown\", Krusty's design was permanently enhanced and he was given a different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under his eyes in order to distinguish him from Homer. In the episode \"Lisa's Wedding\", which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty's design was significantly altered to make him look considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx.\nKrusty is a favorite character of several of the original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes. Thus, many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.\nIn 1992, Matt Groening and James L. Brooks began planning a live-action spin-off from \"The Simpsons\" that revolved around Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta as Krusty. They pitched the series in 1994. Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot script in which Krusty moved to Los Angeles and hosted his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart, and Groening decided to stop work on the project.\nPrior to Groening's live-action pitch, \"Simpsons\" showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss planned an animated Krusty spin-off in which he would be a single father in New York City. Supporting characters would include a prickly make-up lady and a boss resembling Ted Turner. This unsuccessful pitch was later reworked into the animated series \"The Critic\".\nPromotion and reception.\nKrusty has been included in many \"Simpsons\" publications, toys and other merchandise. Krusty-themed merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, Jack-in-the-boxes, Pint glasses, bobblehead dolls, costumes, and clothing such as T-shirts. Playmates Toys has made a talking evil Krusty doll, based on the one that appeared in \"Treehouse of Horror III\". In 1992, Acclaim Entertainment released the video game \"Krusty's Fun House\" for PC and home consoles. Krusty was made into an action figure, and several different versions were included as part of the \"World of Springfield\" toy line. The first, which shows Krusty in his normal clown attire with several Krusty products, was released in 2000 as part of \"wave one\". The second, released in 2002 as part of \"wave nine\", is called \"busted Krusty\" and shows him in a prison and without his clown makeup, as he was seen in \"Krusty Gets Busted\". The third was released in 2003 as part of \"wave thirteen\" and was called \"Tuxedo Krusty\". Several Krusty themed play sets were also released, including a Krusty-Lu Studios and Krusty Burger playset, both released in 2001. Krusty appears as a playable character in the toys-to-life video game \"Lego Dimensions\", released via a \"Fun Pack\" packaged with a Clown Bike accessory in November 2015. In game, his only ability is being able to spray water, and throw pies. All his voice lines are archive audio from Dan Castellaneta.\nIn The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride opened at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2008, Krusty builds and opens a cartoon theme park called Krustyland. Sideshow Bob makes an appearance and tries to murder the Simpson family. In July 2007, convenience store chain 7-Eleven converted eleven of its stores in the United States and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts to celebrate the release of \"The Simpsons Movie\". Amongst the products sold were \"Krusty-O's\", which were made by Malt-O-Meal. In 2015, Krusty had its first merchandise experience during the AW15 influence.\nIn 2004, Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in \"Today I Am a Clown\", an episode that heavily features Krusty. Several episodes featuring Krusty have been very well received. In 2007, \"Vanity Fair\" named \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\" as the ninth best episode of \"The Simpsons\". John Ortved felt, \"This is Krusty's best episode\u00a0\u2013 better than the reunion with his father, or the Bar Mitzvah episode, which won an Emmy much later on. The incorporation of guest stars as themselves is topnotch, and we get to see the really dark side of Krusty's flailing showbiz career. Hollywood, television, celebrities, and fans are all beautifully skewered here.\" Matt Groening cites \"Krusty Gets Busted\" as his ninth favorite episode and has said that he particularly loves Castellaneta's voice work. Groening claims that he has to leave the room every time Castellaneta records as Krusty for fear of ruining the take. \"Star News Online\" named \"Krusty the Clown's hatred of children\", Kamp Krusty, and Krusty's line \"All these rules, I feel like I'm in a strip club\" as some of the four hundred reasons why they loved \"The Simpsons\". \"The Observer\" listed two Krusty products, \"Krusty's Non-Toxic Kologne\" and \"Krusty's home pregnancy kit\", as part of their list of the three hundred reasons why they loved the show.\nIn 2015, \"The A.V. Club\" stated that Krusty has \"arguably the most pathos of any \"Simpsons\" character not named Moe Szyslak\". In 2021, Meghan Markle reflected on her old memorable haircut being compared to Krusty the Clown at \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Snowballs are often used in games such as snowball fights.\nA snowball may also be a large ball of snow formed by rolling a smaller snowball on a snow-covered surface. The smaller snowball grows by picking up additional snow as it rolls. The terms \"snowball effect\" and \"snowballing\" are derived from this process. The Welsh dance \"Y Gasseg Eira\" also takes its name from an analogy with rolling a large snowball. This method of forming a large snowball is often used to create the components needed to build a snowman.\nThe underlying physical process that makes snowballs possible is sintering, in which a solid mass is compacted while near the melting point. Scientific theories about snowball formation began with a lecture by Michael Faraday in 1842, examining the attractive forces between ice particles. An influential early explanation by James Thomson invoked regelation, in which a solid is melted by pressure and then re-frozen.\nWhen and how.\nWhen forming a snowball by packing, the pressure exerted by the hands on the snow is a determinant for the final result. Reduced pressure leads to a light and soft snowball. Compacting humid or \"packing\" snow by applying a high pressure produces a harder snowball, sometimes called an ice ball, which can injure an opponent during a snowball fight.\nTemperature is important for snowball formation. It is hard to make a good snowball if the snow is too cold. In addition, snowballs are difficult to form with dry powdery snow. In temperatures below , there is little free water in the snow, which leads to crumbly snowballs. At or above, melted water in the snow results in a better cohesion. Above a certain temperature, however, the snowball becomes slush, which lacks mechanical strength and no longer sticks together. This effect is used in the rule that, in skiing areas, there is a high risk of avalanche if it is possible to squeeze water out of a snowball.\nNatural snowballs.\nUnder certain conditions, natural snowballs may form as a result of wind, without human intervention. These conditions are:\nIn Antarctica, small windblown frost balls form through a different process that relies on electrostatic attraction; these wind-rolled frost balls are known as yukimarimo.\nUnder other rare circumstances, in coastal and river areas, wave action on ice and snow may create beach snowballs or ball ice.\nSnow lanterns.\nA snow lantern is a decorative structure made from snowballs, typically shaped into a hollow cone. It is commonly used as a housing for a light source, such as a candle or a Japanese stone garden lantern known as \"Yukimi Gata\". Snow lanterns are part of winter traditions in countries such as Sweden, Finland, and Norway, where they are created and lit during the Christmas season. These structures illuminate the winter landscape and are associated with festive celebrations in snowy regions.\nLiterary allusion.\nA snowball that turns into a child is a protagonist in a 1969 children's fantasy novel, \"The Snowball\", by Barbara Sleigh.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some twenty years later, the walls were decorated with portraits of famous murderers and the place became known as the Cabaret des Assassins. Tradition relates that the cabaret received this name because a band of gangsters broke in and killed the owner's son in a robbery attempt.\nIn 1875, the artist Andre Gill painted the sign that was to suggest its permanent name. It was a picture of a rabbit jumping out of a saucepan, and residents began calling their neighbourhood night-club Le Lapin \u00e0 Gill, meaning \"Gill's rabbit\". Over time, the name had evolved into \"Cabaret Au Lapin Agile\", or the Nimble Rabbit Cabaret. The original painting on canvas was stolen in 1893; a reproduction on timber was painted to take its place.\nThe Lapin Agile was bought in the early twentieth century by the cabaret singer, comedian, and nightclub owner Aristide Bruant to save it from demolition. The Lapin Agile became a favourite spot for struggling artists and writers, including Picasso, Modigliani, Apollinaire, Roman Greco, and Maurice Utrillo.\nThe Lapin Agile is located in the centre of the Montmartre district in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, behind and slightly northwest of Sacre Coeur Basilica. Since this was the heart of artistic Paris at the turn of the twentieth century, there was much discussion at the cabaret about \"the meaning of art\".\nThe Lapin Agile was also popular with Montmartre residents including pimps, eccentrics, poorer people, local anarchists, as well as with students from the Latin Quarter and a sprinkling of upper-class bourgeoisie.\nExisting venue.\nThe Lapin Agile is largely unchanged and maintains its tradition as an informal cabaret venue. It is located in a stone building on the steep and cobbled Rue des Saules and showcases poets and singers who perform French songs dating back as far as the fifteenth century.\nLegacy.\nPablo Picasso's 1905 oil painting, \"Au Lapin Agile\" (\"At the Lapin Agile\") helped to make this cabaret world-famous. The cabaret has been captured on canvas by other Montmartre artists, such as Roman Greco and Maurice Utrillo.\nStage adaptations.\nIn 1993 American comedian and entertainer, Steve Martin, wrote a play, \"Picasso at the Lapin Agile\", which had a successful run in Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere. The play depicted an imagined meeting in 1904 between Pablo Picasso and Albert Einstein at the Lapin Agile.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1919, it was taken over by a group of socialist-oriented Zionists, mainly from Russia. The newspaper was established on 18 June 1919 by a group of businessmen including the philanthropist Isaac Leib Goldberg, initially called \"Hadashot Ha'aretz\" (\"News of the Land\"). Later, the name was shortened to \"Haaretz\". The literary section of the paper attracted leading Hebrew writers of the time.\nThe newspaper was initially published in Jerusalem. From 1919 to 1922, the paper was headed by a succession of editors, among them Leib Yaffe. It was closed briefly due to a budgetary shortfall and reopened in Tel Aviv at the beginning of 1923 under the editorship of Moshe Glickson, who held the post for 15 years. The Tel Aviv municipality granted the paper financial support by paying in advance for future advertisements.\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, \"Haaretz\"'s liberal viewpoint was to some degree associated with the General Zionist \"A\" faction, which later helped form the Progressive Party, though it was nonpartisan and careful not to espouse any specific party line. It was considered the most sophisticated of the Yishuv's dailies.\nSalman Schocken, a Jewish businessman who left Germany in 1934 after the Nazis had come to power, bought the paper in December 1935. Schocken was active in Brit Shalom, also known as the Jewish\u2013Palestinian Peace Alliance, a body supporting co-existence between Jews and Arabs which was sympathetic to a homeland for both peoples. His son, Gershom Schocken, became the chief editor in 1939 and held that position until his death in 1990.\nThe Schocken family were the sole owners of the Haaretz Group until August 2006, when they sold a 25% stake to German publisher M. DuMont Schauberg. The deal was negotiated with the help of the former Israeli ambassador to Germany, Avi Primor. This deal was seen as controversial in Israel as DuMont Schauberg's father, Kurt Neven DuMont, was member of the Nazi Party and his publishing house promoted Nazi ideology.\nOn 12 June 2011, it was announced that Russian-Israeli businessman Leonid Nevzlin had purchased a 20% stake in the Haaretz Group, buying 15% from the family and 5% from M.\u00a0DuMont Schauberg. In December 2019, members of the Schocken family bought all of the Haaretz stock belonging to M.\u00a0DuMont Schauberg. The deal saw the Schocken family reach 75% ownership, with the remaining 25% owned by Leonid Nevzlin.\nIn October 2012, a union strike mobilized to protest planned layoffs by the \"Haaretz\" management, causing a one-day interruption of \"Haaretz\" and its \"TheMarker\" business supplement. According to Israel Radio, it was the first time since 1965 that a newspaper did not go to press on account of a strike.\nOn 24 November 2024, the Israeli government ordered a boycott of \"Haaretz\" by government officials and anyone working for a government-funded body, and banned government advertising with the newspaper. According to \"The Guardian\", \"Haaretz\" \"had published a series of investigations of wrongdoing or abuses by senior officials and the armed forces, and has long been in the crosshairs of the current government.\"\nManagement.\nThe newspaper's editorial policy was defined by Gershom Schocken, who was editor-in-chief from 1939 to 1990. Schocken was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Hanoch Marmari. In 2004 David Landau replaced Marmari and was succeeded by Dov Alfon in 2008. The current editor-in-chief of the newspaper is Aluf Benn, who replaced Alfon in August 2011. Charlotte Halle became editor of the English print edition in February 2008.\nWalter Gross was a member of the governing editorial board and a columnist with the paper from 1951 to 1995.\nEditorial policy and viewpoints.\n\"Haaretz\" describes itself as having \"a broadly liberal outlook both on domestic issues and on international affairs\", and has been summarized as being \"liberal on security, civil rights and economy, supportive of the Supreme Court, very critical of Netanyahu's government\". Others describe it alternatively as liberal, centre-left, left-wing, and the country's only major left-leaning newspaper. The paper opposes continuing the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and consistently supports peace initiatives. The \"Haaretz\" editorial line is supportive of weaker elements in Israeli society, such as sex workers, foreign laborers, Israeli Arabs, Ethiopian immigrants, and Russian immigrants.\nInternational media views.\nIn 2006, the BBC said that \"Haaretz\" takes a moderate stance on foreign policy and security. David Remnick in \"The New Yorker\" described \"Haaretz\" as \"easily the most liberal newspaper in Israel\", its ideology as left-wing and its temper as \"insistently oppositional\". According to Ira Sharkansky, \"Haaretz\"'s op-ed pages are open to a variety of opinions. J. J. Goldberg, the editor of the American \"The Jewish Daily Forward\", describes \"Haaretz\" as \"Israel's most vehemently anti-settlement daily paper\". Stephen Glain of \"The Nation\" described \"Haaretz\" as \"Israel's liberal beacon\", citing its editorials voicing opposition to the occupation, the discriminatory treatment of Arab citizens, and the mindset that led to the Second Lebanon War. A 2003 study in \"The International Journal of Press/Politics\" concluded that \"Haaretz\"'s reporting of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians but less so than that of \"The New York Times\". In 2016, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of \"The Atlantic\", wrote: \"I like a lot of the people at \"Haaretz\", and many of its positions, but the cartoonish anti-Israelism and anti-Semitism can be grating.\"\nPosition on Palestinian statehood.\nThe paper strongly advocated a two-state solution in July 2025, at a high point of the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict. Its editorial welcomed and endorsed the proposal by French President Emmanuel Macron to include France by September 2025 in the number of countries which recognise a Palestinian state.\nFormatting, circulation, and reputation.\nCirculation.\nIn 2022, a TGI survey found that \"Haaretz\" was the newspaper with the third largest readership in Israel, with an exposure rate of 4.7%, below \"Israel Hayom\"'s rate of 31% and 's 23.9%.\nFormatting and image.\n\"Haaretz\" uses smaller headlines and print than other mass circulation papers in Israel. Less space is devoted to pictures, and more to political analysis. Opinion columns are generally written by regular commentators rather than guest writers. Its editorial pages are considered influential among government leaders. Apart from the news, \"Haaretz\" publishes feature articles on social and environmental issues, as well as book reviews, investigative reporting, and political commentary. In 2008, the newspaper itself reported a paid subscribership of 65,000, daily sales of 72,000 copies, and 100,000 on weekends. The English edition has a subscriber base of 15,000.\nReadership and reception.\nDespite its historically relatively low circulation in Israel, \"Haaretz\" has for many years been described as Israel's most influential daily newspaper. In 2006, it exposed a scandal regarding professional and ethical standards at Israeli hospitals. Its readership includes members of Israel's intelligentsia and members of its political and economic elites. In 1999, surveys showed that \"Haaretz\" readership had above-average education, income, and wealth, and that most were Ashkenazi Jews. Some have said that \"Haaretz\" functions in Israel much as \"The New York Times\" does in the United States, as a newspaper of record. In 2007, Shmuel Rosner, \"Haaretz\"'s former U.S. correspondent, told \"The Nation\", \"people who read it are better educated and more sophisticated than most, but the rest of the country doesn't know it exists.\" According to Hanoch Marmari, a former \"Haaretz\" editor, the newspaper has lost its political influence in Israel because it became \"detached\" from the country's political life.\nAndrea Levin, executive director of the pro-Israel Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), said \"Haaretz\" was doing \"damage to the truth\" and sometimes making serious factual errors without correcting them. According to \"The Jerusalem Post\", \"Haaretz\" editor-in-chief David Landau said at the 2007 Limmud conference in Moscow that he had told his staff not to report on criminal investigations against Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in order to promote Sharon's 2004\u20132005 Gaza disengagement plan. In April 2017, \"Haaretz\" published an op-ed by a staff writer that said the Israeli religious right was worse than Hezbollah. Condemnation followed, including from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Reuven Rivlin, and other government ministers and MPs, as well as from Opposition Leader Isaac Herzog.\nOn 31 October 2024, \"Haaretz\"'s publisher Amos Schocken made remarks during a speech at a \"Haaretz\" conference in London, criticising the Netanyahu government for allegedly imposing an apartheid regime on the Palestinian population and referring to \"Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists.\" In response, the Israeli interior, education, diaspora ministries severed ties with \"Haaretz\" while the Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi advocated a boycott of the newspaper covering all government bodies and employees. Schocken distanced himself from parts of comments the next day, saying that \"the use of terrorism is not legitimate\". By 4 November, the newspaper had received hundreds of cancellation and subscription termination requests, and a decline in advertising revenue. Several ministries had requested to cancel their subscriptions, with the Israeli foreign ministry cancelling 90 subscriptions.\nInternet editions.\n\"Haaretz\" operates both Hebrew and English language websites. The two sites offer up-to-the-minute breaking news, live Q&amp;A sessions with newsmakers from Israel, the Palestinian territories and elsewhere, and blogs covering a range of political standpoints and opinions. The two sites fall under the supervision of Lior Kodner, the head of digital media for the Haaretz Group. Individually, Simon Spungin is the editor of Haaretz.com (English) and Avi Scharf is the editor of Haaretz.co.il (Hebrew).\nOffices.\nThe \"Haaretz\" building is on Schocken Street in south Tel Aviv.\nThe former \"Haaretz\" building of 1932\u20131973 was designed by architect Joseph Berlin. It was demolished in the early 1990s, with only part of the facade preserved and integrated into the new building at 56, Maza Street.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64879", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64879", "title": "Lionel Hutz", "text": "Fictional character from The Simpsons franchise\nLionel Hutz is a fictional character in the American animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\". He was voiced by Phil Hartman, and his first appearance was in the season two episode \"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\". Hutz is a stereotypical shady ambulance chasing lawyer in Springfield, with questionable competence and ethics. Nevertheless, he is often hired by the Simpsons. His final speaking role was in the season nine episode \"Realty Bites\" in December 1997; the character was retired five months later following Hartman's death at the hands of his wife. Hutz has since appeared as an occasional non-speaking background character.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nPersonality.\nLionel Hutz is an egotistical ambulance chasing personal injury lawyer and, according to Lisa Simpson, a \"shyster\" whom the Simpsons nonetheless hire as their lawyer in multiple episodes (a fact remarked on by Marge Simpson in a typically self-aware aside), mostly because Hutz is the only legal counsel the Simpsons can afford. His legal practice, shown to be located in a shopping mall, is named \"I Can't Believe It's A Law Firm!\" and also offers \"expert shoe repair.\" He often tries to entice potential clients with gifts, including a \"smoking monkey\" doll, a pen that looks like a cigar, an exotic faux-pearl necklace, a business card that \"turns into a sponge when you put it in water,\" and even an almost-full Orange Julius he had been drinking himself. John G. Browning of the \"Southeast Texas Record\" describes the character of Hutz as a literal ambulance chaser: \"Hutz typifies the sleazy lawyer. He exaggerates his academic credentials ('I've attended Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, the Sorbonne, the Louvre')\" and is \"the very worst in legal marketing\".\nHutz is characterized as both a grossly incompetent lawyer and an unethical individual in general. This is supported in his first appearance in \"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\", an episode which also demonstrates his greed as he wants half of the Simpsons' settlement money. Hutz is disliked and mistrusted by both Marge and Lisa. In \"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\", Marge ultimately testifies against Hutz for hiring Dr. Nick, a quack doctor with a shady reputation, and for making Bart lie about his injuries. Hutz's incompetence and greed are also noted by his rival, the more competent Blue Haired Lawyer. In the episode \"Marge in Chains\" Hutz describes the following as his \"problem\" with Judge Snyder: Well, he's had it in for me ever since I kinda ran over his dog. Well, replace the word \"kinda\" with the word \"repeatedly\" and the word \"dog\" with \"son\".\nHutz is characterized as a recovering alcoholic. In one episode he offers Marge a celebratory \"belt of Scotch\" at 9:30 in the morning, remarking that he had not slept in days. In the same episode, he hastily leaves the courtroom after handling a bottle of bourbon in order to consult his sponsor, David Crosby. He then gives his closing statement, unaware that he is not wearing any pants, and thinks that Clarence Darrow was \"the black guy on \"The Mod Squad\"\". Beyond practicing law, he also tries his hand at selling real estate, reasoning that it was a natural move as most of his clients ended up losing their homes anyway. Out of desperation for work, he has resorted to babysitting. Hutz, left in charge of the children for longer than he was hired, nods off in a sitting position; he produces a switchblade upon awakening suddenly. He burns all of his personal documentation in the Simpsons fireplace, claiming that \"Lionel Hutz\" no longer exists and he is now \"Miguel Sanchez\". His other alias is \"Dr. Nguyen Van Phuoc\". Hutz's incompetence and financial desperation sometimes lead him to resort to rooting through dumpsters, claiming it is client-related. Hutz was briefly married to Selma Bouvier, although this storyline is not shown in an episode and instead mentioned in \"Much Apu About Nothing.\u201d In \u201cSelma's Choice,\u201d Hutz attempts to get his hands on the Bouvier sisters\u2019 Aunt Gladys' inheritance. When he was caught forging Gladys' signature by Marge and Lisa, Hutz was forced to properly read the will and give Marge's family Gladys' inheritance. Hutz has also been known to use a phone booth as an office.\nHutz does not seem to care about conflict of interest; in \"A Streetcar Named Marge\" he represents clients in a lawsuit against the producers of a local production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" for not giving them any roles in the play, although he had a role himself.\nAnother display of his incompetence takes place in \"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\" when, while representing a French waiter who is accusing Mayor Quimby's nephew Freddy of battery, he is surprised when the opposing counsel mentions that Hutz's client is an immigrant (despite the client's French accent). Hutz then demands that his client tell him everything from then on. Browning wrote that his \"courtroom skills leave something to be desired\"; in the episode \"Marge in Chains\", he motions for a \"bad court thingy\", to which the judge replies \"You mean a mistrial?\", and then refers to himself as the \"law-talking guy\".\nCases won.\nAlthough Hutz loses most of his cases in the episodes in which he appears, he does win several cases for the Simpsons. In \"Bart the Murderer\", he represented Bart when the latter was suspected of the supposed murder of Seymour Skinner, and the charges were dropped when Skinner revealed himself to be alive. In \"New Kid on the Block\", he represents Homer in his case against the Sea Captain and the Frying Dutchman restaurant over its \"All You Can Eat\" offer (\"The most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film \"The NeverEnding Story\"\"). He also wins a case for Bart in \"The Day the Violence Died\", by proving that Itchy was created by an old man named Chester J. Lampwick\u2014though the deciding factor of the case is mainly proven by Bart's footwork to collect the crucial piece of evidence, rather than Hutz's competence. Hutz initiates the trial with zero credible evidence. In \"'Round Springfield\", Hutz successfully sues Krusty the Clown after Bart accidentally consumes a jagged metal prize from a box of Krusty-O cereal, resulting in an inflamed appendix. After winning the case, Hutz gives Bart only $500 of the $100,000 settlement. In \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\", Hutz wins a case against Sideshow Bob, who was mayor at that time, for electoral fraud, although Bart and Lisa once again found all the supporting evidence.\nThe only other case technically won by Hutz was in \"Treehouse of Horror IV\", where he represents Homer against Satan (who, in a twist, is revealed to resemble Ned Flanders). In a purportedly-deleted scene for this episode, as subsequently seen in \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\", Hutz's slogan is \"Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza is free\". After he thinks he has lost the case, he gives the Simpsons their pizza. However, Marge informs him that they did win. Then, he tells them that the box was empty anyway. In the video game \"\", billboards can be seen around Downtown Springfield promoting Hutz's free pizza offer.\nCreation and retirement.\nPhil Hartman was first suggested for the role of Lionel Hutz by Simpsons writer Jay Kogen, who liked Hartman's \"great, strong voice.\" Writer Mike Scully described Hutz as a \"combination of overconfidence and incompetence. He never doubted his ability in the courtroom for some reason, even though he had no idea what was going on.\"\nAfter Hartman's murder in 1998, Hutz was going to be recast with Harry Shearer, but the character was retired along with Troy McClure, Hartman's other recurring character. The last episode to feature Hutz speaking was the season 9 episode \"Realty Bites\".\nReception.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" named Hutz as one of their 15 favorite fictional television and film lawyers. His characterization as an ambulance chaser who is only concerned with money has been viewed as part of a trend away from more noble depictions of lawyers in literature, such as Atticus Finch, and towards more critical depictions of lawyers and the United States legal system. Hutz has also been examined as an example of a fictional depiction of a member of the professional service market in popular culture.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64880", "revid": "41044949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64880", "title": "Moe Szyslak", "text": "Fictional character from The Simpsons franchise\nMoe Szyslak ( ) is a recurring character from the animated television series \"The Simpsons\". He is voiced by Hank Azaria and first appeared in the series premiere episode \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\". Moe is the proprietor and bartender of Moe's Tavern, a Springfield bar frequented by Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Sam, Larry, and others.\nGrouchy, lonely, miserable, and prone to violent outbursts, Moe is constantly down on his luck and has attempted suicide numerous times. Other running jokes featuring him include being prank called by Bart Simpson, running illegal activities from his bar, his ugliness and his inconsistent stories about his ethnic origin and what \"Moe\" is short for. Although he is generally quite disagreeable and confrontational, he is frequently shown to have a tender heart beneath his cantankerous exterior.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nMoe's Tavern.\nMoe is the owner and bartender of Moe's Tavern (informally referred to as \"Moe's\"), frequented by Homer Simpson and other characters including Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson, Sam and Larry, and his most loyal customer, Barney Gumble. He is not a very good bartender, at one time expressing surprise that gin and tonic can be mixed together. The bar is noted for its depressing atmosphere and uncleanliness. The regular patrons of the tavern have been abandoned by Moe in several episodes in which he changes its target audience. The first of these was \"Flaming Moe's\", in the third season.\nAs a running joke, Moe is sometimes seen engaging in unlicensed or illegal activities at the tavern, such as smuggling pandas and an orca in \"Cape Feare\" and \"The Springfield Files\", respectively.\nParticularly in earlier episodes, the Tavern was frequently prank called by Bart Simpson, who would ask for a gag name which when said by Moe would involve innuendo or insults (e.g., Mike Rotch/\"My crotch\", Homer Sexual/\"homosexual\", Ivana Tinkle/\"I wanna tinkle\", and Seymour Butz/\"See more butts\"). This backfires once on Bart in \"Flaming Moe's\", where Bart asks for Hugh Jass/\"huge ass,\" leading to a patron named Hugh Jass present at Moe's now popular bar, taking the call. On two occasions following the prank call, Homer will tell Moe that he'll catch that person someday.\nPersonality.\nMoe is one of the darkest secondary characters in the show. He is portrayed with a generally disagreeable personality: he has a short, violent temper, a penurious nature, a crass and undiplomatic manner of speech, and a mood that rapidly vacillates between anger, indifference, and suicidal despair (the latter of which has become more apparent in later episodes of the show). He has an annual Christmas tradition of attempted suicide, but his attempts are comically unsuccessful (landing on a hot-air balloon after jumping out of a plane, for example), and he has already called the suicide hotline so many times that they've blocked his number.\nHe is easily irritated, frequently threatening the patrons at his bar with a shotgun he keeps behind the counter. He is also gullible, and Bart's unending chain of successful prank calls to his bar are particularly infuriating to him, inevitably prompting a torrent of Red Deutsch-style threats of gruesome bodily harm in return.\nHe also is, however, occasionally shown to have a sentimental and caring side to his personality, such as reading to sick children and homeless people, although he is secretive about such behavior. In his interactions with his various girlfriends, he has also shown genuine selflessness and kindness (as well as an unusual improvement in his disposition), although negative elements of his personality inevitably emerge and ruin things. He has also struck up genuine friendships with both of Homer's daughters which have remained in the following episodes. In \"Thank God It's Doomsday\", he asks for salvation, because \"I've done stuff I ain't proud of. And the stuff I \"am\" proud of is disgusting.\" He donated $25,000 to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.\nRelationships.\nMoe has an almost non-existent love life due to his vulgarity towards women and his ugly appearance. Despite this, he has had a number of romantic experiences, including sleeping with his waitress Collette, dating a woman named Renee, and briefly enjoying the company of many women after he had plastic surgery. He also has a relationship and proposed to a dwarf named Maya, but Moe could not adjust to the difference in height, to the point where his ultimate plan to have his own leg bones shortened led Maya to leave him. He has long been infatuated with Marge Simpson, whom he usually calls \"Midge\", and has on occasion tried to win her away from Homer, although later episodes have shown him actively working to keep the two together. He has been romantically involved with Edna Krabappel as well as Marge's sister Selma Bouvier. Moe's romantic attractions have resulted in run-ins with the law; he has stalked Maude Flanders and other townspeople, he must register as a sex offender, and he has a restraining order placed upon him. At one point, he is seen on his way to a \"V.D. clinic\". Despite his disturbing approach, Moe has shown to be a caring and devoted lover. While dating Renee (and previously Edna), he wholeheartedly spoiled them with whatever they wanted and vowed to give up his bar and take them away from Springfield forever, even if it means losing his own money and doing illegal acts to make more money. When he thought he finally won Marge's heart, he promised to be \"the best man she'd ever had\".\nIn \"Pygmoelian\", Moe and his three closest friends assess him as a gargoyle with cauliflower ears, lizard lips, little rat eyes, a caveman brow, and a fish snout, who is not pleasant to look at, listen to or be with.\nIn \"The Wayz We Were\", Maya returns to Springfield, and she and Moe reconnect, but Moe's fear of commitment overpowers him. At Homer's suggestion, Moe proposes to Maya, which she accepts.\nFamily and biography.\nMoe's ethnic origins are a running gag in the show, with his origins always varying. The show's many conflicting stories as to Moe's heritage have been sent up in the tie-in book \"The Book of Moe\" (2008), where Moe is depicted in several different foreign national folk costumes and commenting on them, including Hungarian and Polish. From early in the series, Moe was depicted as a European immigrant to the United States. In \"Much Apu About Nothing\" (1996), Moe is depicted taking his United States citizenship test; previously, \"Bart's Inner Child\" (1993) had depicted Moe's own inner child chastising him for abandoning his native Italian accent. Later, in \"Bart-Mangled Banner\" (2004), he reveals himself to be Dutch; he claims his grandfather was Irish while visiting Ireland in \"In the Name of the Grandfather\" (2009); and in \"Lisa Goes Gaga\" (2012), Moe describes himself as \"half monster, half Armenian\". Moe is also hinted to be Armenian in \"Judge Me Tender\" (2010), claiming that Armenian Idol is his favorite show. Moe is fluent in Macedonian thanks to his Macedonian grandmother \"Baba\" Branka. As for indications, he was born in America, in \"Homer the Heretic\" (1992), Moe claims, \"I was born a snake handler, and I'll die a snake handler\" while in \"Day of the Jackanapes\" (2001) he claims to have been born in Indiana. Azaria has said he sees Moe as being from Queens, New York City and portrays him with a Queens accent.\nNumerous conflicting versions of Moe's childhood have been depicted across the show. In \"Radioactive Man\" (1995), he is depicted as having been one of the original \"Little Rascals\", but was fired after killing the \"original Alfalfa\". However, charges were not pressed against him as the \"original Alfalfa\" was, in fact, an orphan owned by the studio. As Homer's boxing coach in \"The Homer They Fall\" (1996), he shows photographs from throughout his own boxing career, stating that his ugly appearance was the result of competing in the sport. Moe's college years are also depicted in \"Homer the Moe\" (2001), which shows Moe as having attended \"bar-tending school\" at Swigmore University (a play on Skidmore College) before opening what became Moe's Tavern. In \"Springfield Up\" (2007), footage from a documentary called \"Growing Up Springfield\" shows an 8-year-old Moe claiming that his father was a circus freak. He was unsure which one but liked to think it was a little of all of them. This is further reinforced in \"Sleeping With The Enemy\" when he briefly asserts himself as a member of the Muntz family. After Nelson's father returns, blaming his absence on having been stolen away by the circus due to a peanut allergy disfiguring his face. Teenage Moe is shown again in \"She Used to Be My Girl\" (2004), where he is depicted working in the school cafeteria, given as his first job \"since prison\"; Marge is responsible for having him sent back there. \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\" (2006) depicts scenes set years before the series present in which Moe and schoolteacher Edna Krabappel are shown to have had a brief love affair. In \"Them, Robot\" (2012), a flashback scene depicts a child being stomped on by an elephant, and his face then changes to Moe. In \"King Leer\" (2018), Moe's father, Morty, and his siblings, Marty and Minnie, are introduced, and he is shown in flashbacks as a child in Springfield. Another member of his family, Macedonian Baba Branka, was introduced in \"Abe League of Their Moe\"(2025). The latter is on the most probably side of ethnic origins since Moe is shown to still be fluent in Macedonian during the same episode.\nMuch like Moe's ethnic origins, his full name is also treated inconsistently as a gag. In \"Flaming Moe's\" (1991), he is called Morris by his lover. In \"The Springfield Connection\" (1995), Homer refers to Moe in the Arabic \"Moammar\". In \"Eeny Teeny Maya Moe\" (2009), he suggests that he only changed his name to Moe when he purchased Moe's Tavern. His last name Szyslak is Polish in origin, and is written as Szy\u015blak.\nCharacter.\nCreation.\nThe creator of \"The Simpsons\" Matt Groening based Moe on Louis \"Red\" Deutsch, who was made famous when he was repeatedly prank-called by two Jersey City residents. These prank calls were the inspiration for Bart Simpson's repeated prank calls to Moe, and Deutsch's often profane responses inspired Moe's violent temper. Comedian Rich Hall, an acquaintance of \"The Simpsons\" writer George Meyer, has stated that he believes further inspiration was drawn from himself and that Groening has verified this to him. Moe's surname \"Szyslak\" was revealed in \"Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)\". Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein found the name in a phone book and gave it to Moe so that he would have the initials M.S., and hence be a suspect in the Burns shooting. Moe was designed by animator Dan Haskett and his facial appearance was modeled after a gorilla. Animator Mark Kirkland said that he often lets off-model drawings of Moe pass through production because the character is so ugly that no one will notice.\nVoice.\nMoe was the first voice Hank Azaria performed for the show. During the time of his audition, Azaria was doing a play in which he had the part of a drug dealer, basing his voice on actor Al Pacino in \"Dog Day Afternoon\". He used the same voice in the audition and was told by Matt Groening and Sam Simon, who was directing him, to make it more gravelly like Deutsch's voice. Groening and Simon thought that it was perfect and took Azaria over to the Fox network recording studio. The result is Moe's pronounced New York accent. Before he had even seen a script, Azaria recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode \"Some Enchanted Evening\". Moe was originally voiced by Christopher Collins who recorded several lines as Moe which never aired. Azaria explained that he did not discover this fact for several years and that according to Groening, \"that guy's\" acting was fine but other staff and actors found him \"a dick\".\nReception.\nIn 2001 and 2003, Hank Azaria won Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Moe and various other characters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, and first appeared in the episode \"Bart Gets an 'F'\". Quimby is the corrupt mayor of Springfield, and is a composite parody of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and certain other members of the Kennedy family who have entered politics.\nConcept and creation.\nJoe Quimby is a parody of Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy and the Kennedy family. Like the Kennedys, Quimby is of Irish descent, \"speaks with a Boston accent, throws money at political problems, and vacations in a coastal resort called the 'Quimby Compound'\". Dan Castellaneta voices Quimby with a Boston elite accent, resulting in a voice reminiscent of that of President John F. Kennedy.\nAppearances.\nQuimby has long served as the mayor of the city of Springfield. He appears as a slick, opportunistic politician whose chief priorities seem to be keeping himself in office and various other forms of corruption, including embezzling tax money, taking bribes from Fat Tony, and giving monthly kickbacks to Police Chief Wiggum. The seal on the wall of his office reads \"Corruptus in Extremis\", which means \"extremely corrupt\". He is a Democrat.\nLike Kennedy, Quimby is known as a womanizer, and occasionally amuses himself with pornographic playing cards during town meetings. Quimby was once the subject of 27 separate paternity suits. One of the women he impregnated is Cookie Kwan, whose baby is remarkably similar to Quimby in both looks and mannerisms. Quimby also is frequently noticed in bed with the same or similar blonde woman/women, at least one of whom was Miss Springfield. He also once accidentally courted his own niece, which is one of the few things Quimby has ever shown shame over.\nDespite being the mayor for such a long time, Quimby does not know or care much about his city, often privately (or even publicly) showing his outright contempt for Springfield's citizens. He frequently takes overseas vacations, which take him out of town for extended periods of time, leading to the headline \"Mayor Visits City\" in the \"Springfield Shopper\". He once referred to Springfield as \"Springfeld\" at a public meeting. However, he makes frequent, albeit short, public appearances for local festivities, events, business openings, etc.\nIf bending the law will suit Quimby's purposes, he will likely do so. He once arranged Marge Simpson's release after she was arrested for blocking traffic on a bridge after suffering a nervous breakdown, claiming that if she went to jail, Quimby could kiss the \"chick vote\" goodbye. He also resorted to bribing witnesses when assault charges were brought against his nephew, leading Bart Simpson to observe that \"the system works: just ask Claus von B\u00fclow\".\nHis catchphrase is \"Vote Quimby\", which he always finds an opportunity to say, even in situations where it would be disadvantageous to identify himself, like inadvertently being caught by Homer in a motel room with his mistress.\nQuimby was elected Mayor of Springfield in 1986 (three years before the show's debut) and has been re-elected several times since, despite openly admitting to fraud and wrongdoing. In the season 4 episode \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\" he admits to using taxpayer dollars to fund the murder of his enemies, but thanks to a clever use of a popular Gabbo catchphrase (\"I'm a bad wittle boy\"), he is re-elected in a landslide.\nQuimby's political stranglehold on Springfield has earned him the hatred of Springfield's small but vocal Republican elite, themselves portrayed as mostly dark, ghoulish figures who meet in a castle. When the Republicans nominate Sideshow Bob as their mayoral candidate, Bob rigs the election, briefly deposing Quimby. He is re-instated when Bob is found guilty of fraud and imprisoned. Later, when Quimby briefly flees the city in the mistaken belief that his corruption is about to be exposed, he is deemed to have \"abandoned office\" and is replaced by a short-lived \"council of learned citizens\" headed by Lisa Simpson, Professor Frink, Comic Book Guy, Lindsey Naegle, Dr. Hibbert, and Principal Skinner, the members of the Springfield chapter of Mensa International, in accordance with the town charter. He also survives a recall election, with no candidate in the race against him (candidates include Rainier Wolfcastle (a Schwarzenegger reference), Kent Brockman, and even Homer Simpson in character as the Safety Salamander) garnering the five percent necessary to force a recall.\nReception.\nLiterary critic Paul Cantor has cited Mayor Quimby as an example of Springfield's atomistic politics, noting \"Mayor Quimby is a demagogue, but at least he is Springfield's own demagogue. When he buys votes, he buys them directly from the citizens of Springfield.\" During the \"USA Today\" contest to choose which Springfield would host the release of \"The Simpsons Movie\", Ted Kennedy himself appears in a video in which he invited \"Diamond Joe\" Quimby and the film to premiere in Springfield, Massachusetts, and even mocked his own oft-mocked pronunciation of the word \"Chowder\" (as \"Chow-Dah\"); however, Springfield, Vermont was chosen instead. On May 17, 2013, following reporting on a new scandal, Justin Peters, crime reporter for \"Slate\" magazine, compared the highly corrupt gaffe-plagued Mayor of Toronto Rob Ford to Quimby. Peters prepared a list of 20 outrageous statements, and asked readers to guess which ones were uttered by the fictional Quimby, and which were uttered by the real-life Ford.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located on the Chinde River, and is an important fishing center. It exports copra and sugar, and had a population of 16,500 in 1980. Chinde lies in Chinde District of Zambezia Province.\nHistory.\nThe small town of Chinde, located approximately 40 miles south of Quelimane, developed as the main point of entry for passengers and goods for the British Central Africa Protectorate which was proclaimed in 1891. Because of its favourable location on the Chinde River, part of the Zambezi River delta, it had potential for growth, and superseded both Quelimane and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o as the most suitable port of entry .\nUntil the third quarter of the 19th century, Quelimane, which was linked to the Zambezi river by a shallow channel, was the main port giving access to Central Africa. The Congress of Berlin in 1884 established free navigation of the Zambezi and its tributary rivers, and a number of British missionaries and traders who had started to visit and settle in what is now Malawi traveled there using the Zambezi and Shire River. When the channel from Quelimane became blocked, the search for an alternative route led to the discovery of the Chinde mouth of the Zambezi in 1889. As part of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, the Portuguese government granted the British government the Chinde Concession for 99 years to establish a port where seagoing ships could transfer their cargoes to river steamers. The Inner Concession, which was exempt from Portuguese custom duties, had an area of 10 hectares, with a river frontage of 420 yards. This contained the government offices and the commercial warehouses, workshops and stores. A further 50 hectares without customs exemption, the Outer Concession, was designed to house the slowly growing population of Chinde. The site selected was a sandspit with the Indian Ocean to the south and the Chinde river to the north. A tidal creek virtually separated the Concession from the mainland, making it more of an island than a peninsula.\nChinde briefly flourished as the port for British Central Africa, which became Nyasaland in 1907. At the end of the 19th century, ocean-going ships of the Union Castle and German East Africa lines were met at Chinde by small river steamers which took passengers and goods up to the head of navigation on the Shire River at Katunga, the closest point on the river to Blantyre, the main town in the British Central Africa Protectorate, a journey of around seven days. The African Lakes Company had trading station at the Concession and maintained around six steamers of up to 40 tons on the Zambezi and Shire rivers. Two other British companies had five more steamers of 20 to 30 tons in this route.\nFor several years before 1922, the erosion of the soft sand in which the Concession was built became an increasing problem. Many of the earlier buildings had to be taken down and re-erected to avoid being washed away or replaced. By the time the port was severely damaged by a cyclone in February 1922 it was already in decline because only relatively small ships could use it and the port of Beira was a better alternative. It would have been difficult and very expensive to restore Chinde fully, but some attempt was made to repair the worst of the damage. However, once the rail link from Nyasaland to Beira was completed in 1922, the main purpose for the existence of the Concession was removed. The British Concession was abandoned and the lease was cancelled in 1923. Chinde returned to Portuguese control: it ceased to serve as a port for Nyasaland, but continued to act as a local port, particularly for the sugar exports of Sena Sugar Estates from the Zambezi valley."}

He is voiced by Hank Azaria and first appeared in the second-season episode \"Three Men and a Comic Book\", which originally aired on May 9, 1991. Comic Book Guy is the proprietor of a comic book store, The Android's Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop. He is based on \"every comic book store guy in America\" and represents a stereotypical middle-aged comic-book collector with a supercilious attitude and obsessive knowledge of pop culture minutiae. He is known for his distinctive accent, disagreeable personality, and his catchphrase, \"Worst [thing] ever!\"\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nProfile.\nComic Book Guy (who states Jeff Albertson to be his real name in the episode \"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\") is a nerdy, snobby and quarrelsome man. He is best known for his eloquence and crabby, sarcastic quips. He is obsessed with collecting comic books and is an avid science fiction buff. He holds a master's degree in folklore and mythology (having translated \"The Lord of the Rings\" into Klingon as part of his thesis), as well as a degree in chemical engineering, has an IQ of 170, and is a member of the Springfield branch of Mensa. He is morbidly obese and has long hair, which he always keeps tied in a ponytail.\nHis catchphrase is the declaration \"worst/best [subject] ever\", sometimes to the point of breaking the fourth wall. For example, in the episode \"Saddlesore Galactica\", he wears a T-shirt saying \"Worst Episode Ever\". Another example of breaking the fourth wall occurs in an episode when Comic Book Guy's chair collapses, and he sarcastically says \"Ooh, a fat man falls. \"Real\" original.\" Despite his solitary life, in \"The Simpsons Movie\", minutes before his anticipated death, Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting has been a \"life well spent\". However, in \"Treehouse of Horror VIII\", when a nuclear missile homes in on him, he says to himself, \"Oh, I've wasted my life\", although the \"Treehouse of Horror\" episodes are not part of the normal \"Simpsons\" canon. In the 2008 episode \"Any Given Sundance\" it was revealed that he is also a writer and posts to his own site called \"Ain't I Fat News\", a take on the real-life movie review website Ain't It Cool News.\nRomance.\nComic Book Guy was once married in an online role-playing game. He and his Internet wife contemplated having children, but that would have severely drained his \"power crystals\". In Season 16's \"There's Something About Marrying\", he hopes to wed a \"\" cardboard figure. While part of an intellectual junta that briefly ran Springfield in \"They Saved Lisa's Brain\", he proposes plans to limit breeding to once every seven years (a reference to the Vulcan blood fever of mating, called Pon farr), commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most, but for him, \"much, much more\". He was a virgin well into his forties, but becomes sexually and romantically involved with Principal Skinner's mother Agnes. He later dates Edna Krabappel after she leaves Skinner at the altar. They are nearly married at a science fiction convention with Skinner and Bart trying to stop the wedding, but Edna changes her mind, preferring not to be tied down to a relationship. Comic Book Guy is not particularly surprised by this, saying, \"There are a million valid reasons, but which one did you pick?\" When Edna gently explains \"It's like I'm DC Comics, and you're Marvel\", he accepts the comparison without any rancor. In \"Married to the Blob\", Comic Book Guy marries Kumiko Nakamura, a Japanese manga artist. As of \"The Dad-Feelings Limited\", he and Kumiko are trying for a baby.\nThe Android's Dungeon.\nComic Book Guy is the owner of The Android's Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop, a local comic book store. The comics, collectibles, and toys he sells are of wildly varying quality and often have very high prices. His store is his sanctuary, where he holds some level of self-esteem, imperiously lording over pre-teen kids, like Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, using a heavily sarcastic tone and often banning certain customers for minor infractions. His store contains a lower level full of illegal videos (which include Mr. Rogers drunk, \"Alien autopsy\", \"Illegal Alien Autopsy\", a \"good version\" of \"The Godfather Part III\", and Kent Brockman picking his nose).\nIn \"Husbands and Knives\", the store was closed due to bankruptcy when a rival comic book shop opened across the road, run by an owner with significantly better customer service and social skills. Although his old store was bought by Marge Simpson in the same episode and not returned, Comic Book Guy continues running his store in future episodes and the rival store is usually not mentioned, though it was referred to again when its owner showed up in \"Married to the Blob\". Also Bart and Milhouse became managers of The Android's Dungeon for a time in \"Worst Episode Ever\".\nCharacter.\nCreation.\nComic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles comic book shop who often \"[sat] on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam container full of fried clams with a lot of tartar sauce.\" Groening noted: {\nAzaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a college contemporary named Mark who went by the nickname \"F\", short for \"Flounder\" from the film \"National Lampoon's Animal House\", and lived in the room next door to him at Tufts University. Hank Azaria further explained that \"F\" would listen to the song \"867-5309\" all day long and that Mark would keep a list of top five and bottom five people whom he liked and hated in the dorm and post it hourly. Azaria stated that he himself was always on the bottom five of the list because he complained about the playing of the music. Azaria \"loves that the character is an adult who argues with kids as if they're his peers.\"\nDevelopment.\nWithin the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of the newsgroup alt.tv.simpsons. The first such instance occurred in the seventh-season episode \"Radioactive Man\", in which Comic Book Guy is logging on to his favorite newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive. David X. Cohen often read alt.tv.simpsons to gauge audience response to episodes. He decided to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans.\nIn the eighth-season episode \"The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show\" after Comic Book Guy views the \"Itchy &amp; Scratchy\" episode featuring Poochie, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes, \"Worst episode ever\" on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nitpicks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart Simpson:\nThe catchphrase further appears on his T-shirt in the eleventh season episode \"Saddlesore Galactica\", and as the title of the twelfth season episode \"Worst Episode Ever\". The catchphrase can also be used for describing other things by saying, \"Worst. (Noun). Ever.\"\nName.\nA long-running gag on the show was never to reveal the character's name, with other characters referring to him as \"Comic Book Guy\". The writers had intended to name the character as early as his first episode, but they could not think of a name for him, and they called him \"Comic Book Guy\", with the intention of naming the character the next time they used him. However, they continually procrastinated. Finally, in the February 6, 2005 episode, \"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\", Comic Book Guy nonchalantly tells Ned Flanders: \"My name is Jeff Albertson, but everyone calls me 'Comic Book Guy'\". Showrunner Al Jean remarked: \"That was specifically done to make people really mad. We just tried to pick a generic name. It was also the Super Bowl show. We did it so the most people possible would see it.\" Groening stated that he had originally intended him to be called Louis Lane and be \"obsessed and tormented by\" Lois Lane, but Groening was not present when the writers chose the name. His name is also mentioned in \"The Simpsons Game\".\nReception.\nHank Azaria has won several Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work on \"The Simpsons\", winning one in 2001 for voicing Comic Book Guy and various other characters in the episode \"Worst Episode Ever\".\nMerchandising and other media.\nComic Book Guy is featured as a prominent focal character of the \"Bart Simpsons\" spin-off comic-book-series \"\", nominated for an Eisner Award. Comic Book Guy is featured on the cover of the twelfth season DVD. He appears on other media as well, including T-shirts and drinking glasses.\nIn \"The Simpsons Game\", he explains all the clich\u00e9s that the player comes across during the game. Comic Book Guy has appeared in his own five-part comic book, in which his death influenced a nerd and geek gang war. \"The Simpsons Library of Wisdom\" includes a volume entitled \"Comic Book Guy's Book of Pop Culture\". Comic Book Guy appears in ' as a drivable character, the host for bonus mission level four and host for a level seven mission. He is also a passenger in '.\nComic Book Guy makes a cameo appearance in the season two finale of \"The Cleveland Show\" saying the line, \"Worst. Cameo. Ever.\" Comic Book Guy makes a brief appearance in the \"Simpsons\"/\"Family Guy\" crossover episode \"The Simpsons Guy\" to say \"Worst. Chicken Fight. Ever.\" Comic Book Guy makes a brief appearance as the clerk of \"Karl's Komics\" selling comics to Chip Flagston of \"Hi and Lois\", March 25, 2018.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64890", "revid": "1312014784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64890", "title": "Barney Gumble", "text": "Fictional character from The Simpsons franchise\nBarnard Arnold \"Barney\" Gumble Sr. is a recurring character in the American animated TV series \"The Simpsons\". He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared in the series premiere episode \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\".\nBarney is the town drunk of Springfield and one of Homer Simpson's friends. His loud belches and desperation for alcohol serve as frequent sources of humor on the show, though Barney sobered up in the Season 11 episode \"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\" before relapsing three years later. Barney was inspired by the cartoon character Barney Rubble from \"The Flintstones\" and by several barflies from other television programs. In 2004, Castellaneta won an Emmy Award for voicing various characters, including Barney.\nBarney can be seen in \"The Simpsons\" opening credits since 2009, passed out under a pile of leaves (but still holding his beloved bottle of Duff Beer) and being awoken by Bart Simpson skateboarding over his stomach, causing him to let out his trademark belch.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nBarney's father, Arnie Gumble, was a World War II veteran who died in 1979 in a parade float accident. Little is known about his mother, except that she lives in Norway and that she served in the United States Navy, including duty on a submarine. She is seen in the season nine episode \"Simpson Tide\". In \"Treehouse of Horror XVII\", Barney stated that he was Polish, after mistakenly saying he was Irish in a drunken stupor. Barney was born on April 20 (which Homer remembers is also Hitler's birthday in \"Viva Ned Flanders\") In \"A Star Is Burns\", Barney states that he is 40 years old. Several episodes, starting with \"The Way We Was\", depict him as Homer's best friend in high school. In the episode \"$pringfield\", he claims that he studied dance for several years, including modern and tap.\nTwo episodes give different reasons for his alcoholism. \"Mr. Plow\" suggests that Barney was a dedicated student looking forward to a bright future. He had his mind set on going to Harvard University, until Homer peer pressured him into drinking beer the day before the SATs. Season 16's \"She Used to Be My Girl\" attributes his drinking to his high school girlfriend Chloe Talbot leaving Springfield to pursue a journalism career.\nIn \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\", Barney formed a barbershop quartet with Homer, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, and Seymour Skinner called the Be Sharps. Barney was asked to join when the other members heard him singing in a beautiful tenor voice in the restroom of Moe's Tavern, replacing the group's original fourth member, Chief Wiggum, who had been kicked out. In 1986, the Be Sharps won a Grammy Award for Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word, or Barbershop Album of the Year. Soon, creative disputes arose, and Barney left the group in all but name when he began dating a Japanese conceptual artist. The group realized that they were no longer popular and split up.\nBarney was rescued from a tar pit by Bart's pet elephant Stampy in \"Bart Gets an Elephant\" and he also started a snowplowing business rivaling Homer's in \"Mr. Plow\". Barney's commercial defamed Homer, causing Homer to lose his customers. As revenge, Homer fooled Barney into plowing a driveway on Widow's Peak, a treacherous mountain just outside Springfield. When Homer saw a news report showing that Barney had become trapped in an avalanche, Homer immediately drove to the mountain and rescued Barney. The friends resolved their differences and agreed to work together. However, a heat wave hit Springfield at that exact moment, driving them both out of business. However, in the episodes \"O Brother, Where Bart Thou?\" and \"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\" it is shown that Barney still drives his Plow King truck.\nAfter being forced to spend a sober night at Moe's Tavern serving as designated driver, Barney left town in Homer Simpson's car to, among other things, give a guest lecture at Villanova (although, by his own admission, the guest lecture could just have likely occurred on a street corner). He ultimately abandoned the car in New York City and returned to Springfield after a two-month absence. A gag in \"Selma's Choice\" suggests that Barney is the father of many local babies born through (presumably, paid) donation of semen and the resulting artificial insemination.\nBarney made a documentary film about his life as an alcoholic, titled \"Pukahontas\". It won the top prize at the Springfield Film Festival. He was ready to quit drinking after winning the Festival, but the prize he received was a lifetime supply of Duff Beer. In \"Deep Space Homer\", Barney trained to become an astronaut for NASA. Under their alcohol-ban, he quickly regained his balance and diction and was quite appropriately selected to fly with Buzz Aldrin. However, he reverted to his old ways when he was presented with a bottle of non-alcoholic champagne. Barney served in the United States Navy Reserve as a submariner on the USS \"Jebediah\", alongside his mother, in \"Simpson Tide\".\nIn \"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\", after watching a video of his drunken antics at his birthday party, Barney resolves to get sober. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, cleans up his appearance, and attends helicopter-flying lessons. He remains sober by the episode's end, though his alcoholism is replaced by an unhealthy dependence on coffee. It was revealed in the fourteenth season episode \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\" that he had relapsed.\nCharacter.\nCreation.\nBarney was inspired by Barney Rubble, Fred Flintstone's best friend and next-door neighbor from the animated series \"The Flintstones\". The writers originally wanted the character to be Homer Simpson's sidekick and next-door neighbor, but instead, while still portraying him as Homer's best friend, they decided to make him an alcoholic. Ned Flanders would become the next-door neighbor instead. \"Barney was taking the standard sitcom sidekick and just making him as pathetic as possible,\" said Matt Groening, the creator of \"The Simpsons\". The writers drew further inspiration from Crazy Guggenheim, a character played by comedian Frank Fontaine on \"The Jackie Gleason Show\". Part of the reason the writers went in that direction, according to Groening, was because of \"a sort of unspoken rule about not having drinking on television as a source of comedy. So, of course, we went right for it.\" The writers also patterned the character after Norm Peterson (George Wendt), a character from the sitcom \"Cheers\".\nIn some early first season episodes, Barney had yellow hair. Later in the production of that season, the producers had it changed to brown, because they thought that his hair looked like his skin; in addition, during an artistic convention of the show, Groening stated that he wanted only the Simpsons to have yellow hair. Animation director Rich Moore modeled Barney's apartment on one he and several other animators who worked on the show shared, particularly the Farrah Fawcett poster and the cable spool table. The writers originally intended for the character to be the owner of Barney's Bowl-A-Rama. However, after making him \"pathetic\", they could not regard him as a business owner any longer, and it was explained seasons later in \"And Maggie Makes Three\" that his Uncle Al owns the alley and named it after him.\nVoice.\nBarney Gumble is voiced by Dan Castellaneta who said he drew inspiration from Mr. Magoo's nephew Waldo on the 1957 record album \"Magoo in Hi-Fi\" where Waldo was voiced by Daws Butler as well as a little big Frank Fontane's Crazy Guggenheim. Early on in the show, Castellaneta discovered that it was not easy for him to do Barney's trademark belch every time a script called for it, so he identified his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard, the belch also appears on an episode of \"The Pitts\". Castellaneta has voiced Barney every time he has appeared in the series, with the exception of the episode \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\", in which some of Barney's singing is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans, who recorded lines for all four members of the Be Sharps. Their recordings were intermixed with the cast's, often with a cast member singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing backup.\nSobriety.\nCastellaneta thought of the idea of Barney sobering up early in the series. He wrote a script together with his wife Deb Lacusta. They offered their script to showrunner Al Jean. Jean liked the story, but felt that it was too similar to a script the writers were already working on, \"Duffless\", so he turned it down. Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes. Their script became the eleventh season episode \"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\", which first aired April 9, 2000. The episode was directed by Neil Affleck, who said that he had \"a vested interest in getting Barney sober.\" However, some of the writing staff was opposed to the episode as they felt Barney sober would not be funny. Castellaneta commented, \"He's still a goofy man-child...he's still got 15 years of booze left in his veins.\"\nAfter a long discussion about how the episode should end, the writers decided that they did not want Barney to return to being drunk at the end of the episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.\nReception.\nFilmcritic.com ranked Barney 18th on their 2008 list of \"The 21 Best Movie Alcoholics of All Time\". Recognizing the character for his appearance in \"The Simpsons Movie\", Filmcritic called him \"the most awesomely funny town drunk in pop culture\". IGN ranked Barney fifth on their list of the \"Top 25 \"Simpsons\" Peripheral Characters\" in 2006, stating that, \"he's been a dependable source of humor through his many drunken asides, burps included...Occasionally he's sobered up...But let's face it, for comedy's sake, \"The Simpsons\" is better off with a drunken Barney mouthing off at Moe's.\" Author Chris Turner (\"Planet Simpson\") said, \"Making [Barney] sober falls into the trap of all the stuff \"The Simpsons\" satirizes, all those simple sitcom narratives where everything is wrapped up in half an hour and everyone learns a lesson in the end.\"\nBritain's \"The Guardian\" said that Barney \"should be hailed for making compulsive drinking a source of comedy on US TV, a hitherto impossible dream.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed \"Mr. Plow\" sixth on their list of the best 25 \"Simpsons\" episodes in 2003. In 2004, Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing several characters, including Barney, in the episode \"Today I Am a Clown\". \"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\" was nominated for a PRISM Award in 2001.\nMerchandising.\nPlaymates Toys created three Barney Gumble action figures as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first one, released in August 2000, depicts Barney in his usual appearance. The second, Barney in his Plow King jacket from \"Mr. Plow\", was released in January 2003. The third, a Toys \"R\" Us retail exclusive, was released in July 2003 as part of a Be Sharps play set. The song \"A Boozehound named Barney\" from the episode \"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious\" was included on the \"Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons\" album. Barney plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. During the pre-show, Barney appears in a suit of the character Scratchy to entertain the people waiting in line, but he staggers around drunk and drinks in public, which led to Krusty firing him for drinking on the job. Barney later reappears during the ride portion where he appears outside Moe's Tavern, letting out his signature belch as the Simpson family chases an enlarged Maggie through Springfield.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Apu responded by purchasing a forged birth certificate from the Springfield Mafia that listed his parents as American citizens Herb and Judy Nahasapeemapetilon from Green Bay, Wisconsin. When, however, he realized he was forsaking his origins, he abandoned this plan and instead successfully managed to pass his citizenship test with help from Lisa and Homer Simpson. Thus, he refers to himself as a \"semi-legal alien\".\nIn 1985, Apu was a member of the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, along with Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, and Principal Seymour Skinner. Upon the advice of the band manager, Nigel, Apu took the stage name \"Apu de Beaumarchais\" (a reference to Pierre Beaumarchais, author of \"The Barber of Seville\"). Apu is a dietary vegan, as revealed in the season 7 episode \"Lisa the Vegetarian\".\nFamily.\nIn the episode \"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\", Apu enjoys a brief period as Springfield's leading ladies' man after being spontaneously drawn into a bachelor auction. He spends the days following the auction on a whirlwind of dates, which suddenly ends when his mother announces his arranged marriage to a woman named Manjula, whom he had not seen since childhood. Apu tries to get out of the arrangement at first, with Marge Simpson pretending to be his wife, until Apu's mother finds her with Homer. However, he is won over when he meets Manjula at the wedding, and the two decide to give the marriage a try, with Manjula noting nonchalantly that they can always get a divorce. Later, the two actually fall in love.\nIn the episode \"Eight Misbehavin'\", Manjula receives too many doses of fertility drugs, leading to her giving birth to octuplets: Anoop, Uma, Nabendu, Poonam, Pria, Sandeep, Sashi, and Gheet. This causes difficulties for the family but finally they decide to get on with their lives. During the episode \"Bart-Mangled Banner\", when the town changes its name to Libertyville to be patriotic after it is claimed Springfield hates America, Apu temporarily changes his children's names to Lincoln, Freedom, Condoleezza, Coke, Pepsi, Manifest Destiny, Apple Pie, and Superman.\nApu and Manjula have a mostly happy marriage, despite understandable marital problems caused by Apu's workaholic nature and long hours, and the strain of caring for eight children. A strain came up when Manjula learned that Apu works longer than he needs to, resulting in Apu showering Manjula with many gifts. A further strain came up when Apu was unfaithful to Manjula, causing him to briefly move out and even making him contemplate suicide. He and his family are devout Hindus, and he particularly venerates Ganesha.\nSanjay (voiced by Harry Shearer), Apu's brother, helps run the Kwik-E-Mart. Sanjay has a daughter named Pahasatira, and a son named Jamshed, all of whom share the Nahasapeemapetilon surname. Apu has another younger brother, who is only mentioned in \"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\", where Apu was shown on a chart as the oldest of three. Apu also has a cousin living in India named Kavi, also voiced by Azaria, who helped Homer while he was in India. Kavi works for several American companies taking service calls using General American, cowboy, and Jamaican accents.\nOther appearances.\nApu is a playable character in ' (2003) video game. His quest in the game is to redeem himself for unknowingly selling the tainted Buzz Cola that has made the residents of Springfield insane. Apu also makes an appearance in ' (2001) as a passenger and unlockable playable character. He also is a character players acquire fairly early on in the open-ended online game \"\" (2012). In 2015, Apu appeared as a non-playable character in the toys-to-life video game \"Lego Dimensions\". In-game, he only appears in the \"Simpsons\" levels and does not speak at all.\nCharacter.\nApu first appeared in the season one episode \"The Telltale Head\". Al Jean and Mike Reiss claim that while creating the character, the writers decided they would not make him ethnic, as they felt it would be too offensive and stereotypical and did not want to offend viewers, but that the concept stayed because Hank Azaria's reading of the line \"Hello, Mr. Homer\" received a huge laugh from the writers. Azaria, however, has disputed this account, claiming instead that the writers asked him to create a stereotypical Indian accent for the character. Azaria has said that he based Apu's voice on Indian convenience store workers in Los Angeles with whom he had interacted when he first moved to the area. He also loosely based it on Peter Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film \"The Party\" (1968), who Azaria thinks has a similar personality to Apu.\nApu's first name is a homage to the main character in \"The Apu Trilogy\", directed by Satyajit Ray. His surname is a scrambled version of \"Pahasadee Napetilon\", the full name of a schoolmate of \"Simpsons\" writer Jeff Martin. It was first used in the episode \"A Streetcar Named Marge\".\nIn the ninth season of the show, Apu marries Manjula in the episode \"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\". Richard Appel first constructed the idea for Apu's marriage. Andrea Martin provided the voice of Apu's mother in the episode, recording her part in New York. She wanted to get the voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's.\nReception.\nPopularity.\nApu is one of the most prominent South Asian characters on primetime television in the United States. Hank Azaria has won three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, winning in 1998 for his performance as Apu, again in 2001 for \"Worst Episode Ever\", and a third time in 2003 for \"Moe Baby Blues\" for voicing several characters, including Apu.\nApu's image has been widely licensed, on items ranging from board games to automobile air fresheners. In July 2007, convenience store chain 7-Eleven converted 11 of its stores in the United States and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts to celebrate the release of \"The Simpsons Movie\".\nAccusations of racial stereotyping.\nApu's portrayal has been accused by many as being a racist caricature of Indians and South Asians in general and was criticized as showing bias along racial/ethnic lines and called \"brownvoice\" (similar to \"blackface\"). During the 2007 7-Eleven promotion, many Indian Americans voiced concerns that Apu is a caricature and plays on too many negative stereotypes. Despite this, 7-Eleven reported that many of its Indian employees reacted positively to the idea, but noted that it was \"not a 100 percent endorsement\". A 2011 magazine article accused Apu of replicating \"model minority\" stereotypes.\nAccording to Kondabolu, in a \"Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell\" web-exclusive segment, there were negative reactions to Apu in the Indian-American community, as well as the greater Desi community. Pakistani-American comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani has also criticized the character, relating that early in his career, he was asked to do \"the Apu accent\", a stereotyped version of the speech patterns of Indians. In a 2007 interview, Azaria acknowledged some of this criticism when he recalled a conversation with the writers of the show during the inception of the character: \"Right away they were like 'Can you do an Indian accent and how offensive can you make it?' basically. I was like, 'It's not tremendously accurate. It's a little, uh, stereotype,' and they were like, 'Eh, that's all right.'\" In a 2013 interview with \"The Huffington Post\", Azaria said it should not be expected that the character's accent would \"suddenly change now\" or that the character would be written out, saying, \"I'd be surprised if [the show's writers] write him any less frequently because he's offensive.\"\nIn 2016, Kondabolu announced his intention to produce a documentary about \"how this controversial caricature was created, burrowed its way into the hearts and minds of Americans and continues to exist \u2013 intact \u2013 twenty-six years later\". In 2017, Kondabolu released the hour-long documentary \"The Problem with Apu\", in which he interviews actors and comics of South Asian heritage about the impact that the character of Apu has had on their lives and the perception of South Asians in American culture.\nIn April 2018, \"The Simpsons\" reacted to the controversy surrounding Apu in the episode \"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\". Marge introduces Lisa to her favorite childhood book, but is shocked by its racist stereotypes and attempts to rewrite it to suit modern sensitivities. Lisa is bored by this revised version, and Marge asks what she should do; Lisa replies \"It's hard to say. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?\" She then looks at a picture of Apu with \"Don't have a cow, man\" written on it, and the two characters say that the issue will be dealt with later, if at all. Kondabolu said that he was saddened by the show's dismissive take on the controversy. Mike Reiss, \"The Simpsons\"' longtime writer and producer, acknowledged the problem, and pointed out that Apu had not had a line in the show for the last three years.\nDuring an appearance that same month on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\", Azaria said that he would be \"perfectly willing to step aside\" from the role of voicing Apu, saying that he was increasingly worried about the character causing harm by reinforcing stereotypes and that \"the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it ... I really want to see Indian, South Asian writers in the writers' room, genuinely informing whichever direction this character takes.\" Kondabolu had a positive reaction to Azaria's comments.\nIn an interview with \"USA Today\", creator Matt Groening dismissed the criticism of the Apu character, saying, \"I think it's a time in our culture where people love to pretend they're offended\". Dana Walden, the CEO of 20th Century Fox Television, said in an August 2018 interview in regard to the Apu controversy that the network trusts the showrunners \"to handle it in the way that's best for the show\". In October 2018, in the \"South Park\" episode \"The Problem with a Poo\", Mr. Hankey is expelled and sent to a land where \"people don't care about bigotry and hate\" \u2013 Springfield. The episode ended with a title card, #cancelthesimpsons, similar to the promo for \"South Park\" that called for the cancellation of itself. That said, on the DVD commentary \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone stated that the people on \"The Simpsons\" are their friends and that joke was not a jab at \"The Simpsons\" but at the documentary and that they found it amusing how many misinterpreted the joke as an attack on \"The Simpsons\". Al Jean also tweeted about the episode \"It's actually in favor of us saying people are too critical.\"\nIn the UK, Hugo Rifkind criticized in \"The Times\" what he characterized as the prevalent attitude concerning potentially offensive material: that the possibility that somebody \"might be\" offended is enough for material to be considered offensive. He also stated that Apu is portrayed very positively, smarter than every other character except for Lisa, and that the show was much ruder about other characters like Ned Flanders, Krusty and Groundskeeper Willie.\nOn October 26, Adi Shankar stated in an interview with \"IndieWire\" that Apu would be leaving \"The Simpsons\". On October 29, 2018, executive producer Al Jean responded to the speculation and stated that \"Adi Shankar is not a producer on \"The Simpsons\". I wish him the best but he does not speak for our show\". On August 27, 2019, several sources reported that Groening had confirmed Apu's continued position on the show during the \"Simpsons\" panel at Disney's D23 Expo, telling a fan who asked whether or not Apu would remain, \"Yes. We love Apu. We're proud of Apu.\"\nAzaria announced on January 17, 2020, that he and the production team agreed to allow him to step away from voicing Apu, \"unless there's some way to transition it or something\". Azaria had followed the debate over the previous years since Kondabolu's essay and documentary, read up on and attended seminars on racism and social consciousness, and spoken to Indian-American colleagues including fellow actor Utkarsh Ambudkar (who had performed as Apu's nephew in \"Much Apu About Something\") about the situation. He came to understand the issues around the character of Apu compared to the other stereotypical characters on \"The Simpsons\" was the idea of permissible use, which led to his decision to quit voicing Apu. Azaria said, \"There hasn't been an outcry over these [other] characters [that play on non-South Asian stereotypes] because people feel they're represented. They don't take it so personally, nor do they feel oppressed or insulted by it.\"\nOn June 26, 2020, it was stated that \"Moving forward, \"The Simpsons\" will no longer have white actors voice non-white characters.\" This follows Mike Henry stating that he will no longer voice the African-American character Cleveland Brown on fellow Fox animated series \"Family Guy\", and Jenny Slate and Kristen Bell's announcement that they will no longer voice mixed-race characters on \"Big Mouth\" and \"Central Park\", respectively. There were plans for the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon to make an appearance in season 33. However, Groening stated \"we have to see if we can make the stories work\".\nIn the April 12, 2021, episode of Dax Shepard's podcast \"Armchair Expert\", Azaria apologized for \"racism, my participation in racism, or at least in a racist practice or in structural racism, as it relates to showbusiness or...all the above.\" One reaction to Azaria's apology came from actress and writer Mellini Kantayya, who, in a \"Washington Post\" opinion piece, wrote that hearing Azaria's concession \"and for him to say so not in a carefully crafted PR statement, but in a conversation long after the news cycle had moved on, caught me off guard. Azaria reached his conclusions after years of learning and reflection. He recognized how his work had hurt Indian Americans and wanted to start making amends. That's why I cried. His apology was cold comfort, given my past, but the validation and acknowledgment still mattered.\"\nIn 2022, comedian Akaash Singh made a comedy stand up special called \"Bring Back Apu\", where he claims that the character is \"not racist\", and represented the American Dream.\nIn April 2023, Azaria and Kondabolu did a joint interview on the topic with the radio program \"All Things Considered\".\nIn April 2025, Azaria revealed more details on his departure from voicing Apu.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is voiced by Harry Shearer, and first appeared in the episode \"The Telltale Head\".\nRev. Lovejoy is the minister at The First Church of Springfield\u2014the Protestant church (from a fictitious branch called \"presbylutheranism\") in Springfield. Initially kind-hearted and ambitious, Lovejoy has become somewhat bitter and apathetic towards other people and religion because of Ned Flanders's chronic, over-the-top scrupulosity.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nProfile.\nLovejoy is the pastor of the Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism First Church of Springfield, which most of the show's characters regularly attend. He attended Texas Christian University. He initially came to Springfield in the 1970s as an eager, enthusiastic, young man, only to become cynical and disillusioned about his ministry, mostly due to Ned Flanders, who constantly pesters him with minor issues such as \"coveting his own wife\" or thinking that he \"swallowed a toothpick\".\nLovejoy would deal with Flanders' concerns very briefly, so that he could return to playing with his model trains. At one point, Lovejoy \"just stopped caring\", but rediscovered the joy of helping others, though Ned still irritates him. Lovejoy even suggests Ned join another religion, as he believes that \"they are all pretty much the same\". In the season two episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\", Lovejoy helps Lisa with her family's illegal cable hookup.\nHis sermons vary between dreary recitations of more opaque parts of the Old Testament, to the occasional \"fire and brimstone\" about Hell. He disapproves of popular music, as shown in \"Bart Sells His Soul\" when Bart gets the congregation to sing \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" as an opening hymn; he punishes Bart for the prank by making him clean the organ pipes that he has \"befouled\".\nAcceptance for other religions.\nLovejoy demonstrates his acceptance for Hinduism when he performs a Hindu marriage ceremony for Kwik-E-Mart shopkeeper Apu (though Lovejoy does not know much about the faith, referring to it in an earlier episode as \"Miscellaneous\"), co-hosts a religious radio program with Krusty the Klown's rabbi father, and admits evolution may be true. However, he does not tolerate Buddhism, as when Lisa Simpson converted to it, he referred to her as \"Marge Simpson's devil-daughter\". He also appears bitter about the tall Episcopal church across the street, wanting to build a larger steeple, and when mentioning the other church, placing the emphasis on \"pis\". He maintains two rolodexes \u2013 one for Christians, and one for non-Christians. While he seems to have originally accepted evolution, he later advocates for creationism at his church to beef up its membership.\nHe does not accept Roman Catholicism either, as he is shown brawling with a priest. He tells Marge that he might as well do a Voodoo dance for Abe Simpson when asked to give him the last rites. He also helps kidnap Bart to keep him from converting to Catholicism. Lovejoy also claims in \"There's Something About Marrying\" to various same-sex couples who arrive at his church to get married that \"while I have no opinion for or against your sinful lifestyle, I cannot marry two people of the same sex anymore than I could put a hamburger on a hot dog bun\" and tells them to \"go back to behind the scenes of every facade of entertainment.\" When Marge objects, Lovejoy tells her the Bible forbids same-sex relationships, but when Marge asks which book in Bible forbids it, he merely claims \"The Bible\" and then continuously rings the church bell after Marge continues to press him on the matter.\nNegative qualities.\nLovejoy has been shown to do things that would be considered sinful. Lovejoy has been known to exploit his congregation for money, brawl with a Roman Catholic priest, encourage his pet Old English Sheepdog to foul Ned Flanders's lawn, and implied that he once burned down his church for insurance money. In \"Whacking Day\", he made up a passage in the Bible to attempt to convince Lisa that \"even God himself endorses Whacking Day\". In \"The Joy of Sect\", the episode in which the whole town of Springfield is deceived into joining a cult, Lovejoy kidnaps Homer with Groundskeeper Willie from the cult and hits him across the head numerous times hoping to knock him out. Also, when Lovejoy sees the spaceship emerge from the \"forbidden barn\" he throws his religious collar on the ground. After it is revealed that the spaceship is fake, Ned Flanders notices his collar on the ground and informs Lovejoy, who picks it up and puts it back on.\nLovejoy is not always enthusiastic about the Bible, calling it a \"2000-page sleeping pill\". It is unsure if he even owns a Bible, as it was once said he borrows one from the library every week. Sometimes he holds strange positions on the Bible and makes theological errors. In \"Secrets of a Successful Marriage,\" an episode that dealt with marriage counseling, Lovejoy and his gossipy wife, Helen, both recommend that Marge should divorce Homer. Marge objects to this, pointing out how the Bible has strict guidelines against things like divorce, but Lovejoy claims, \"Marge, \"everything\" is a sin. \"(holds up the Bible)\" Have you ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not allowed to go to the bathroom.\" However, despite these opinions, he is still deeply knowledgeable about the Bible, being able to recite a random passage purely from memory after Homer mentioned its number.\nFamily.\nLovejoy's wife Helen was originally portrayed as a moralistic, judgmental gossip, but in voice actress Maggie Roswell's long absence, her character was seen but not heard. The Lovejoys' manipulative daughter Jessica was the focus of the episode \"Bart's Girlfriend\" where she was voiced by guest star Meryl Streep, but is otherwise rarely seen.\nLovejoy's father is briefly shown in the episode \"Bart After Dark\" as an older version of Lovejoy (including clerical collar) who visits the Maison Derri\u00e8re.\nCreation and reception.\nMatt Groening has indicated that Lovejoy is named after Lovejoy Street (which in turn is named for Portland co-founder Asa Lovejoy) in Portland, Oregon, the city where Groening grew up. When the character was created, producer Sam Simon did not want Lovejoy to be a \"cartoony hypocritical preacher\" but rather \"a realistic person who just happened to work as a minister,\" as recalled by writer Al Jean. By season eight, the show had begun to explore secondary characters with Lovejoy being the central character in the episode \"In Marge We Trust\" because, aside from being noted as \"the pastor who didn't care\", he had not had much character development. Author Mark I. Pinsky writes of Lovejoy as \"a foil in the series, personifying many of the failings of organized religion and Christian conservatism,\" and yet still a real human with faults and not simply evil. Harry Shearer has stated that his voice for the character is based on Ernest Angley.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hibbert, M.D. is a recurring character on the television animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\". He is Springfield's most prominent medical professional. Although he has a kind and warm persona, he is also often characterized as greedy and lacking in empathy. His signature character trait is his often-inappropriate chuckling, which is generally cued by misfortune rather than something genuinely amusing. \nA parody of Bill Cosby's character Dr. Cliff Huxtable, the character debuted on December 6, 1990, in the episode Bart the Daredevil. He was voiced from his debut by \"Simpsons\" regular Harry Shearer, and since a recasting of all of the show's non-white characters, by Kevin Michael Richardson from 2021.\nProfile.\nHe is near-genius (with an IQ of 155), a Mensa member, a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and a former stripper. Hibbert is noticeably less dysfunctional than just about everyone else on the show, though he does have a bizarre tendency to chuckle at inappropriate moments which is later revealed to be a coping mechanism. In \"Make Room for Lisa\", Hibbert tells Lisa that \"Before I learned to chuckle mindlessly, I was headed to an early grave.\" He reacts questionably to certain medical problems. For example, when Maggie saves Homer from drowning, Hibbert attributes it to common cases of superhuman strength in children whose parents' lives are in danger. Likewise, he expresses only mild surprise when both of Grandpa Simpson's kidneys are revealed to have exploded. In \"Treehouse of Horror XX\", Dr. Hibbert discusses the possibility of Bart being a \"genetic chosen one\" who can cure a zombie apocalypse over the phone with the Simpsons, while under siege from the aforementioned zombies.\nThere are hints throughout the series that Dr. Hibbert is not above dubious medical practices. After Marge talks him out of buying an unsuitable house, he suggests repaying her with black-market prescriptions. When he realizes that Marge is initially unenthusiastic about having a third child, he implies that a healthy baby could bring in as much as $60,000 on the black market. Hibbert covers for himself against Marge's horrified reaction by saying that if she had replied any other way, she would be sent to prison, claiming that it is \"just a test\". It is also suggested in the episode \"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken\" that he does not in fact have a medical license.\nDespite his seemingly honest and good-hearted personality, there is evidence that he is, at heart, a mercenary. In \"Homer's Triple Bypass\", Hibbert tells Homer that his open heart surgery will cost $30,000. When Homer has a heart attack in front of him in response to this news, he says, unmoved, that the cost is now $40,000 \u2013 hinting the heart attack made him now require a quadruple bypass. In \"Bye Bye Nerdie\", after Homer's baby-proofing business eliminates child injuries in Springfield, Hibbert complains that he is behind in his boat payments because of this. He is a Republican and attends Springfield's Republican meetings alongside Mr Burns, Rainier Wolfcastle, and a Nosferatu-like creature. Hibbert also freely wears fur coats, believing that while fur itself may not be murder, \"paying for it sure is!\"\nHibbert is often seen in flashbacks (for example, Lisa's birth, or Bart's accidents as a toddler), and each time has a different hairstyle (afro, braids, Mr. T-style Mohawk, etc.) appropriate for the time period.\nDr. Hibbert is married; he and his wife Bernice have at least three children, two boys and a girl. When his entire family is seen together, they appear to be a spoof of \"The Cosby Show\". Bernice is known to be something of a heavy drinker; this has been joked about on at least one occasion (in \"Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment\", she faints upon reading the news that Prohibition has been introduced in Springfield) and laughs exactly like her husband. Despite apparent marriage problems, Dr. Hibbert still requests that the Simpsons tell Bernice that he loves her during a zombie apocalypse, though Homer misinterprets the message and resolves to just give her a high-five.\nIn the sixth season episode \"'Round Springfield\", it is implied that he and Bleeding Gums Murphy are long-lost brothers; Hibbert says he has a long-lost brother who is a jazz musician and Murphy says he has a brother who is a doctor that chuckles at inappropriate times, but somehow the two do not put these clues together. However, Murphy later dies, so it will never be known for certain if they are brothers or not. Hibbert also bears a striking resemblance to the director of the Shelbyville orphanage, who mentions a personal quest to find his long-lost twin to an indifferent Homer. In the 1999 episode \"Grift of the Magi\", we learn that Dr. Hibbert lives next door to Police Chief Wiggum.\nIn writers Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky's original script for \"Bart the Daredevil\", Hibbert was a woman, named \"Julia Hibbert\", whom they named after comedic actress Julia Sweeney (Hibbert was her married last name at the time). When Fox moved \"The Simpsons\" to prime time on Thursdays against NBC's top-rated \"The Cosby Show\", the writing staff decided to make Dr. Hibbert a parody of Bill Cosby's character, Dr. Cliff Huxtable. Dr. Hibbert is usually shown wearing colorful sweaters when not on duty, a reference to Huxtable. Like the Cosby character, Dr. Hibbert laughs inappropriately, at pretty much everything. He is one of the few competent characters in the show, and was originally shown as being sympathetic to his patients' conditions, but that was eventually changed to him being less caring about his patients.\nCultural reception.\nA tongue-in-cheek analysis in the \"Canadian Medical Association Journal\" (\"CMAJ\") compares the services of Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick Riviera, a quack physician often used by \"The Simpsons\" as an alternative source of medical advice. While Hibbert is praised for his sense of humor and quality of care, it concludes that Nick is a better role model for physicians; Hibbert is a paternalistic and wasteful physician, unlike Nick, who strives to cut costs and does his best to avoid the coroner. This study was rebutted, also in \"CMAJ\", casting both characters aside as a role model in favor of Dr. Bones McCoy of \"Star Trek\", \"TV's only true physician\" and \"someone who has broken free from the yoke of ethics and practises the art and science of medicine beyond the stultifying opposition of paternalism and autonomy. A free and independent thinker and, indeed, someone even beyond role models\".\nIn mid-2020, amid the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd protests, the \"Simpsons\" producers declared their intentions to no longer use white actors to voice non-white characters; thus, Dr. Hibbert's voice actor was recast. Harry Shearer, the original voice actor, second-guessed this decision, saying all actors are hired to \"play someone who they are not\". This came amid similar recasting on other cartoons such as \"Family Guy\". In February of the following year, it was announced that beginning with the episode \"Wad Goals\", voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson, who is African-American, would replace Shearer as Hibbert.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His more responsible subordinate officers Eddie and Lou play the straight men to his shenanigans.\nCharacter development.\nHis surname \"Wiggum\" is Matt Groening's mother's maiden name and her parents were Norwegian immigrants. As \"a conscious pun\", Wiggum was designed to look like a pig. Hank Azaria first based his voice for Wiggum on David Brinkley, but it was too slow and he switched it to an Edward G. Robinson impression. The first use of his first name being Clancy was in \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\", but in the script for \"The Telltale Head\" his name was Abner Wiggum.\nBiography.\nMany episodes have dealt with the back story of how Wiggum, despite his incompetence, occupies such a high rank in the Springfield Police Department. However, these jokes tend to contradict one another, as is typical with side characters on \"The Simpsons\". Wiggum was temporarily promoted to Commissioner of Police for the state in which Springfield resides during the 2005 episode \"Pranksta Rap\".

Debuting on March 3, 1986, the series aired on NBC until the sixth-season finale on May 8, 1992; it was moved to ABC on November 5, 1992, continuing there for the remainder of its run until the series finale aired on May 7, 1995. The series was produced by The Fred Silverman Company (formerly Intermedia Entertainment Company until 1986) and Dean Hargrove Productions (formerly Strathmore Productions until 1988) in association with Viacom Productions. This series marked Griffith's return to a series for the first time since \"The New Andy Griffith Show\" ended in 1971.\nThe show's format is similar to that of CBS' \"Perry Mason\" (both \"Matlock\" and the 1980s \"Perry Mason\" television films were created by Dean Hargrove), with Matlock identifying the perpetrators and then confronting them in dramatic courtroom scenes. One difference, however, was that whereas Mason usually exculpated his clients at a pretrial hearing, Matlock usually secured an acquittal at trial from the jury.\nA gender flipping reboot, starring Kathy Bates, premiered on CBS on September 22, 2024.\nPremise.\n\"Matlock\" centers on Ben Matlock (Andy Griffith), a widowed and highly respected defense attorney known for his folksy demeanor, sharp intellect, and cantankerous personality. Despite his gruff exterior, Matlock is deeply committed to justice. Most episodes culminate in a courtroom confrontation, where Matlock cross-examines a witness\u2014often the actual perpetrator\u2014and methodically exposes the truth. His goal is typically to establish reasonable doubt or to prove his client's innocence outright.\nMatlock is portrayed as a graduate of Harvard Law School. After working as a public defender, he opened a private law practice in Atlanta, where he resides in a modest farmhouse in the suburbs. Known for his meticulous investigative approach, Matlock often visits crime scenes to uncover overlooked evidence and develop alternative theories about the case, which usually involves homicide.\nA distinctive feature of Matlock's character is his finicky fashion sense; he consistently wears a light gray suit and, over the series' run, drives three successive generations of the all-gray Ford Crown Victoria\u2014a nod to Griffith's longtime association with Ford vehicles, dating back to \"The Andy Griffith Show\".\nMatlock is also characterized by his frugality and love of hot dogs, which are depicted as his favorite food throughout the series. This detail is explored humorously in the season eight episode \"The Diner\". An alternate backstory for his hot dog obsession is presented in a crossover with \"\" (season four, episodes 15\u201316, \"Murder Two\"), where Matlock blames (Dick Van Dyke) for advising a failed investment in 8-track tapes in 1969 that cost him his $5,000 savings (), forcing him into an austere lifestyle.\nDespite his thrift, Matlock typically charges a $100,000 retainer fee (), usually payable upfront. However, he often adjusts or waives his fee if he believes strongly in a client's innocence or if the client cannot afford to pay. In some cases, he reluctantly accepts \"pro bono\" cases. His strict expectations of his staff and investigators, as well as his penny-pinching habits, often serve as sources of comic relief throughout the series.\nChanges.\nThe series premiered with Ben Matlock (played by Andy Griffith) having a law practice with his daughter, Charlene (played by Lori Lethin in the pilot movie; Linda Purl took over the role when the series went to air). Matlock also employed stock market whiz Tyler Hudson (Kene Holliday) as a private investigator. Tyler would often go undercover for Matlock in various guises to gather information. Matlock's most frequent legal adversary was Julie March (Julie Sommars), a Nebraska native. Although their jobs as prosecutor and defense attorney made them professional rivals, their relationship outside of court was very cordial and they often spent time together outside of court with occasional flirtations. Toward the end of the first season, Matlock took on cocky law student Cassie Phillips (played by Kari Lizer) as an office worker.\nAfter the first season ended, Purl departed from the series and her character, Charlene, moved to Philadelphia to start her own law practice. To begin the second season, Matlock went to London to try a case where he met Michelle Thomas (played by Nancy Stafford), a young American lawyer. After the case was over, Michelle followed Matlock to the U.S. and became his new law partner. Cassie stayed on as a file clerk until the end of the season, when she disappeared for reasons never made clear. With Lizer's departure, Julie Sommars became a regular cast member.\nSeveral actors/actresses appeared in the series as different characters prior to becoming regular cast members. In season one's \"The Seduction\", Stafford played Caryn Nelson/Carole Nathan, a high-class prostitute who was paid off to commit perjury against Matlock's client. In \"The Angel\", Lizer appeared as Matlock's client, Margaret Danello, a pop star called \"Angel\". Roebuck played a young physician, Dr. Bobby Shaw, in \"The Doctors\"; lawyer Alex Winthrop in season three's two-part episode, \"The Ambassador\"/\"The Priest\"; and a prosecutor in a two-part episode, \"The Assassination\", before becoming a cast regular in season seven.\nSome actors/actresses appeared as a different character in each appearance on the show. For example, Carolyn Seymour played Christina Harrison Ward in season one (\"The Affair\", episode 4), Dr. Vanessa Sedgwick in season two (\"The Genius\", episode 20) and Iris Vogel in season three (\"The Psychic\", episode 13). Nana Visitor and Roddy McDowall made several guest appearances as well. Holliday was fired after the third season for drug and alcohol abuse, but had a recurring role in season four (\"The Best Seller\", episode 4 and \"The Witness\", episode 14). Matlock hired Conrad McMasters (Clarence Gilyard Jr.), a young, former North Carolina deputy sheriff, to be his new detective. Like Tyler, Conrad would also go undercover to gather information about cases. However, the two characters were different in their personalities and approach to the job. Matlock and McMasters became good friends and were alike in many ways.\nDon Knotts, who co-starred with Griffith on \"The Andy Griffith Show\", began making frequent appearances as Les \"Ace\" Calhoun, Matlock's next-door neighbor. Before replacing Stafford at the start of season seven, Brynn Thayer appeared in two season six episodes (\"The Suspect\", episodes 7\u20138) as Roxanne Windemere, a rich widow charged with murder with whom Ben became smitten. In the season finale (\"The Assassination\", episodes 21\u201322) she appeared as Leanne MacIntyre, Ben's previously unmentioned daughter who takes on the case of a murdered mayor. She joined the cast full-time in season seven. Daniel Roebuck joined Thayer as a new regular for season seven as Cliff Lewis, a naive young lawyer and associate. Warren Frost joined the cast in a recurring role as Billy Lewis, Cliff's father and a personal nemesis from Matlock's past: Ben had abandoned a romance with Billy's sister to pursue his law degree. The move in 1992 to ABC for the remainder of the series caused some cast turnover. Stafford left the series to spend more time with her husband, Larry Myers. Sommars followed, although she would play a recurring role in several later episodes. Knotts followed. With Roebuck joining the cast, Gilyard's role was diminished.\nAfter season seven ended, Gilyard left the series to join the new CBS series \"Walker, Texas Ranger\", although he appeared once in season eight (\"The View\", episode five). Like Silverman and Hargrove's \"Perry Mason\" series revival, \"Matlock\" had largely become a series of movies-of-the-week by season nine. Part of the reason for this was Griffith's advancing age; he was 66 and also wanted to spend more time with his family. At the end of season 8, Thayer departed from the series. In the first episode of season nine (\"The Accused\") Ben tells Billy that Leanne moved to Los Angeles, seems to like her job, and \"has a fella.\" In the final season, Carol Huston joined the series as Jerri Stone, a private investigator helping Cliff in his duties. Like Conrad, Jerri and Ben had shared hobbies including singing. The move also saw a change in filming venue. Shooting in California for its entire run on NBC (which required Griffith to commute from his home in North Carolina to the West Coast), ABC moved production to the EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina, to ease the travel burden on Griffith. The \"whodunit\" format was also adjusted to an \"inverted detective story\" format.\nEpisodes.\n\"Matlock\" aired a total of 193 episodes across nine seasons and began with a TV-movie. 12 two-hour and 15 two-part episodes of the program were aired. Six of the episodes were clip shows with mostly minor plots that paved the way for scenes from previous stories. Although Griffith appeared in more episodes portraying Sheriff Andy Taylor in \"The Andy Griffith Show\" than Ben Matlock in \"Matlock\" (the former has 249 episodes, and the latter has 193), he logged more on-screen time as Ben Matlock than he did as Sheriff Andy Taylor due to the length of each show (\"Matlock\" ran for 45\u201348 minutes, while \"The Andy Griffith Show\" ran for 25\u201326 minutes).\nProgram format.\nA few changes were made in the format of the introduction of the episodes. The introduction of characters was essentially the same, with the only changes being the actors for each season. Griffith, Purl, Holliday, Stafford, Gilyard\u00a0Jr., Thayer, Sommars, Lizer, Roebuck and Huston were all featured in the intros for their respective seasons. The \"Matlock\" commercial screen also changed. The early episodes had a scene of Ben Matlock in front of a brown screen; around 1987, this was changed to gray. In 1992, this was changed once again to the same gray, but with a blue square around the \"M\" in \"Matlock.\" Later in the 1993\u20131994 season, the commercial screen was removed entirely. Nancy Stafford began appearing in a dual role in many opening credits from season three onwards, both as her main character Michelle Thomas, and the high-class call girl she played in the first season (seen on the witness stand, though her face is obscured).\nSpin-offs.\n\"Jake and the Fatman\" was a spin-off on CBS based on a character who originated in \"The Don\" (1986), a two-part \"Matlock\" episode from season one. William Conrad played prosecutor James L. McShane and Joe Penny played Paul Baron, the son of Matlock's client, Mafia don Nicholas Baron. Executive producers Fred Silverman and Dean Hargrove were responsible for both \"Matlock\" and \"Jake and the Fatman,\" as well as \",\" created by Joyce Burditt (which itself was a spin-off of \"Jake and the Fatman\") in 1993, also on CBS; \"Father Dowling Mysteries\" in 1988 on NBC and ABC; and the 30 \"Perry Mason\" made-for-TV movies from 1985 until 1995 on NBC.\nHome media.\nDVD releases.\nCBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released all nine seasons of \"Matlock\" on DVD in Region 1.\nOn April 7, 2015, CBS released \"Matlock: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1.\nStreaming.\nSeason one of the series was made available for purchase through Amazon Video. The series is available on demand through Pluto TV, and as of January 15, 2025, all 9 seasons are made available to stream on Paramount+.\n2024 series.\nIn January 2023, CBS announced development of a new series starring Kathy Bates and Skye P. Marshall, with David Del Rio, Leah Lewis and Jason Ritter supporting and gave a pilot order in February. In May, it was announced that the show had been officially greenlit with a series order. In February 2024, it was announced that Beau Bridges also join the cast in the recurring role of Senior. The series was delayed to the 2024\u201325 television season amidst the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. The show is set to premiere on September 22, 2024, on CBS and streaming on Paramount+, then start airing in its regular timeslot (Thursday 9pm) on October 17, 2024.\nIn the new series, the original TV show exists as an in-universe TV series with Bates' Matlock using the same surname as the TV show character as an alias.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thomas Cairney, the O'Murphys were one of the chiefly families of the U\u00ed Ceinnselaig who in turn were a tribe from the Dumnonii or Laigin who were the third wave of Celts to settle in Ireland during the first century BC. The O'Murphys as one of the chiefly families of the U\u00ed Ceinnselaig is supported by John O'Hart in his 1892 \"Irish Pedigrees; or, The Origin and Stem of The Irish Nation\".\nMurchadh is reported to have been gripped with a boiling awful rage, an extreme elevation and greatness of spirit and intellect when he joined the middle of the action and prepared to assail the foreign invaders, the Danes, after they had repulsed the Dal gCais. A gallantry and championship bird rose inside him and fluttered above his head and on his breath.\nIn modern Irish, \"\u00d3 Murch\u00fa\" or \"Mac Murch\u00fa\" rather than \"Mac\"/\"\u00d3 Murchadha\", is used.\n\"Murphy\" is the most common surname in Ireland, the fourteenth most common surname in Northern Ireland, and the sixty-fourth most common surname in the United States.\nFolklore and legends.\nFolklore in some regions depicts Murphys as protectors of local communities and maritime activities. Tales of heroic deeds, bravery in battle, and protection of fishing routes appear in oral histories, particularly in counties Cork, Kerry, and Mayo. The Murphy name is sometimes linked to legends of sea battles and coastal defense, reinforcing its \"Murchadh\" origin.\nModern distribution and diaspora.\nMurphy remains the most common surname in Ireland and is widespread throughout the Irish diaspora, especially in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Its frequency has made it a widely recognized symbol of Irish heritage abroad.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Dmbox/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Surname listThis page lists people with the surname .

{"id": "64906", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64906", "title": "Troy McClure", "text": "Fictional character from The Simpsons franchise\nTroy McClure is a fictional character in the American animated series \"The Simpsons\". He was originally voiced by Phil Hartman and first appeared in the second season episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\". McClure is a washed-up actor who is usually shown doing low-level work, most notably hosting manipulative infomercials and questionable educational films. He appears as the main character in \"A Fish Called Selma\", in which he marries Selma Bouvier to aid his failing career and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also hosts \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\" and \"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\".\nMcClure was partially based on B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure, as well as Hartman himself. Following Hartman's murder on May 28, 1998, two of his \"Simpsons\" characters were retired, with Hartman's final speaking appearance as McClure occurring in the tenth season episode \"Bart the Mother\" four months after his murder. Since then, he has only occasionally cameoed in the background. Since his retirement, McClure has often been cited as one of the series' most popular characters. In 2006, \"IGN\" ranked McClure No. 1 on their list of the \"Top 25 \"Simpsons\" Peripheral Characters\".\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nTroy McClure is a stereotypical Hollywood has-been. He was a star in the early 1970s, but his career went downhill due to rumors of zoophilia involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos and infomercials. They are often low-quality, highly erroneous and too short and incomplete to be useful, and feature bizarre topics such as \"Dig Your Own Grave and Save\" and \"Smoke Yourself Thin\". McClure introduces himself by saying, \"Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as...,\" mentioning two titles that are similar to his current performance. For example, in the episode \"Bart the Mother\", McClure introduces a film about birds by saying, \"Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as \"Earwigs: Eww!\" and \"Man vs. Nature: The Road to Victory\".\" When he auditions to voice the character Poochie in \"The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show\" (a role he would lose to Homer Simpson), he falls into his introductory style, mentioning his previous role as Christmas Ape.\nMcClure's most prominent role occurs in the seventh-season episode \"A Fish Called Selma\". In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with Selma Bouvier, whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles and agrees to go out on a date as a condition for passing him. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in \"Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!\", a stage musical version of the film \"Planet of the Apes\". To further boost McClure's career, McClure's agent suggests that he get married. Unaware of McClure's motivation, Selma accepts his proposal, and moves into McClure's house, a Modernist building which resembles the Chemosphere. At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure tells Homer Simpson that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing at the wedding, but later offhandedly mentions McClure's admission to Marge, who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but she becomes disturbed when McClure's agent advises the pair to have a child (since \"all the big parts these days are going to family men\"). Having a child will secure McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in \"McBain IV: Fatal Discharge\", but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship and decides to leave McClure. McClure ultimately gets the role, but turns it down in order to direct and star in his own pet project, a 20th Century Fox film called \"The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel\".\nIn addition to his in-story appearances, McClure appears as host of \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\" and \"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\". The first is a behind-the-scenes look at \"The Simpsons\", answering questions and featuring extra \"never-before-seen\" material. The second is an episode presenting three possible spin-offs from \"The Simpsons\".\nIn other media.\nMcClure was made into an action figure as part of the \"World of Springfield\" toy line, and was released in the \"Celebrity Series 1\" wave in 2002. He also features briefly in the video game \"Virtual Springfield\", introducing the town of Springfield to the player.\nCharacter.\nCreation.\nMcClure was based on the typical \"washed up\" Hollywood actor. B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects. Doug McClure found the homage funny and his children called him \"Troy McClure\" when his back was turned. According to show creator Matt Groening, Phil Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull \"the maximum amount of humor\" out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. When he was designed, McClure was given an extra line under his eyes to suggest that the character had gotten a facelift.\nIn a very brief appearance in the season 2 episode \"Bart's Dog Gets an \"F\"\", Troy was voiced by Dan Castellaneta.\nDevelopment.\nAccording to executive producer Al Jean, the writers often used McClure as a \"panic button\" and added the character when they felt an episode needed more humor.\nMcClure's character is most developed in \"A Fish Called Selma\", which provides a more in-depth look into his private life and backstory. Showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give Hartman as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of McClure's marriage to Selma Bouvier, as she was \"always marrying people\". Animator Mark Kirkland was particularly pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting Hartman's voice-over performances, and the episode allowed him and the other animators to \"open [McClure] up visually as a character\".\nThroughout \"A Fish Called Selma\", it is hinted that McClure engages in strange sexual behavior. The writers did not initially know what the \"unsavory\" sexual preference would be, but eventually decided on a fish fetish, using a suggestion from executive producer James L. Brooks. Josh Weinstein described the fish fetish concept as \"so perverted and strange, it was over the top.\"\nRetirement.\nPhil Hartman was murdered in 1998. Rather than re-casting the role with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other recurring character, Lionel Hutz. McClure last appeared in the season ten episode \"Bart the Mother\", which was dedicated to Hartman. Before his death, Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a live-action film about McClure, which would be penned by some of the show's writers. He noted that he was \"looking forward to his live-action movie, publicizing [McClure's] Betty Ford appearances.\" Matt Groening later told \"Empire\" that the idea never \"got further than enthusiasm\", but \"would have been really fun\". Although retired from speaking roles, the character has still appeared in background roles in subsequent episodes, and is also featured on the Digital Purchase cover for season 30.\nReception and cultural influence.\nEven after his retirement, McClure remains a popular supporting character. \"IGN\" ranked McClure first in their 2006 list of the \"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters\", calling him \"a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can be.\" In a 2007 article on \"Simpsons\" guest stars, Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that McClure was \"responsible for some of the funniest moments in \"Simpsons\" history.\" Hartman ranked first on AOL's list of their favorite 25 \"Simpsons\" guest stars. Chris Turner argues in \"Planet Simpson\" that McClure and Lionel Hutz \"together ... represent the most significant contribution to the show outside of its permanent cast,\" adding that \"the show's Golden Age is hard to imagine without them.\" He continues, \"The smarmy Hollywood type ... has been done to death, but Hartman's version breathed new life into it with each appearance. McClure has become the apotheosis of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny reinterpretation whose trademark introduction ... has become a shorthand way to describe any grossly artificial media figure.\"\nMcClure's most prominent episode, \"A Fish Called Selma\", is a favorite of many staff members, and has been cited as one of the series' best episodes by several publications. \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed the episode eighth on their top 25 \"The Simpsons\" episode list, and \"IGN\" named the episode the best of the seventh season, calling it the \"obvious pick\". They also deemed McClure's \"Planet of the Apes\" musical the best moment of the episode and \"maybe even the whole show\".\nMcClure was one of Hartman's best-known roles. He often used his McClure voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of \"NewsRadio\". He remarked, \"My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans.\" He added \"It's the one thing that I do in my life that's almost an avocation. I do it for the pure love of it.\" Many obituaries of Hartman mentioned his work as McClure as one of the highlights of his career. The BBC said that \"[Hartman's] voice was known to millions\" because of McClure and Lionel Hutz.\nThe title of a song on American indie-rock band Yo La Tengo's ninth full-length album, \"And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out\", \"Let's Save Tony Orlando's House\", is based upon a telethon that McClure hosts in the episode \"Marge on the Lam\". In an interview with the A.V. Club, Ira Kaplan, the singer and guitarist of Yo La Tengo, states that James McNew, the band's bassist, titled a series of instrumentals from the Troy McClure filmography.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64907", "revid": "50798845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64907", "title": "Kent Brockman", "text": "Fictional character from The Simpsons franchise\nBrock Kentman, more commonly called Kent Brockman, is a recurring fictional character in the animated television series \"The Simpsons\". He is voiced by Harry Shearer and first appeared in the episode \"Krusty Gets Busted\". He is the grumpy, self-centered, pompous news anchor for the local Springfield news.\nProfile.\nKent Brockman hosts the Channel 6 weekday news, as well as \"Smartline\", a local current-affairs program (a parody of the national current-affairs program \"Nightline\"), \"Bite Back! With Kent Brockman\" (a parody of \"Fight Back! With David Horowitz\"), \"Eye on Springfield\" (a parody of \"Eye on LA\"), which focuses mostly on Springfield's entertainment news, the game show \"Springfield Squares\", \"Springfield Action News,\" and has his own personal commentary segment of the 6:00\u00a0p.m. news, \"My Two Cents\". In the episode \"The Mansion Family\", he co-hosted an award show with pop music singer Britney Spears.\nIt has been hinted that Brockman is ethnically Jewish, having changed his surname from Brockelstein; this was first indicated in a 1960s flashback featured in the episode \"Mother Simpson\", in which Brockman was known as Kenny Brockelstein early in his career. He can sometimes be spotted wearing the Hebrew Chai symbol on a necklace. However, he is seen several times attending Reverend Lovejoy's Protestant church, and in \"Marge on the Lam\" he states his belief in the Book of Revelation, suggesting he professes Christian religious beliefs.\nBrockman has a daughter, Brittany, who may have been the product of his fling with the Channel 6 weather girl. He also has a wife named Stephanie. In \"Kamp Krusty\", Brockman is revealed to have during his career, reported on the Vietnam War, the 1979\u201389 Soviet\u2013Afghan War, and the 1991 Gulf War.\nIn \"Dog of Death\", Brockman won the multimillion-dollar ($130 million) state lottery jackpot and left the news desk while still on the air. However, he remained a news anchor because he was under contract, though he also admitted that he likes making $500,000 a year. He has an ongoing feud with traffic reporter Arnie Pye, and has been shown to criticize Pye's reporting and also even chuckles when it was thought Pye had died in a helicopter accident. When Arnie Pye took Brockman's anchor position he admitted on the air he made out with Brockman's daughter but was sure to note it was with \"the grown up one\", thus revealing Brockman has an adult daughter.\nBrockman's penchant for using offensive language worked against him in the 400th episode, \"You Kent Always Say What You Want\", where, after Homer accidentally spilled coffee on Brockman's crotch, he shouted what Ned Flanders called a \"super swear\" that shocked everyone who watches it. Brockman was demoted to weather man due to the station paying a fine to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and was soon fired when the network executives deliberately mistook a ring of Splenda in Brockman's coffee for cocaine. Brockman was later given his job back to silence him (after doing an expos\u00e9 that was seen on YouTube uncovering the real reason the FCC is cracking down on obscenity in the media), with a 50% raise, making his new salary $750,000 a year.\nCreation and inspirations.\nKent Brockman first appeared on television in the first season episode \"Krusty Gets Busted\", which originally aired April 29, 1990. The character was based on Los Angeles anchormen Hal Fishman and Jerry Dunphy. The director of \"Krusty Gets Busted\", Brad Bird, designed the character and modeled him after anchorman Ted Koppel. Another influence on the character was \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\"'s Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight. Dunphy was proud of the fact that Brockman was based on him and would tell people that he was Kent Brockman.\nCultural influence.\nBrockman is responsible for popularizing the snowclone \"I, for one, welcome our new \"[fill-in-the-blank]\" overlords\", sometimes used to express mock submission, usually for the purpose of humor. Brockman's comment about believing a spacecraft was taken over by a master race of giant space ants in \"Deep Space Homer\" (1994), which generated the meme, is considered one of the show's classic moments. The spacecraft was carrying an ant colony, though the insects were accidentally released by Homer. This led to an ant drifting by the video feed, appearing gigantic due to its proximity to the camera, at which point Brockman contemplates if the \"master race of giant space ants ... will consume the captive earth men or merely enslave them\" and eventually utters the line \"And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords\". Author Chris Turner called it \"perhaps his finest hour as a journalist\" and said the scene is \"simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television.\"\nVariations of the phrase have been used in the media, such as \"New Scientist\" magazine, the \"Houston Chronicle\" and Ken Jennings on the \"Jeopardy! IBM Challenge\" (versus Watson) on February 16, 2011. On May 6, 2014, Stephen Colbert made direct reference to the phrase by using it as the closing line of his television program \"The Colbert Report\".\nReception.\nThe author of the book \"Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation\", Chris Turner, said that \"if the institution of the News has a single iconic face on \"The Simpsons\", it's Brockman's\" and that \"in Brockman's journalism, we see some of the modern news media's ugliest biases\", which he identifies as glibness, amplification, and sensationalism. MSN called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors.\n\"You Kent Always Say What You Want\" was well received by critics. IGN called it the second best episode of the season.\nMerchandise.\nPlaymates Toys created a Kent Brockman action figure for its World of Springfield toy line which was released in July 2001.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is voiced by Kelsey Grammer and first appeared in the episode \"The Telltale Head\". Bob is a self-proclaimed genius who is a graduate of Yale University and a champion of high culture, including the adoption of a transatlantic accent, similar to that of Grammer's portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane from the sitcoms \"Cheers\" and \"Frasier\". He began his career as a sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show, but after enduring constant abuse, Bob framed his employer for armed robbery in \"Krusty Gets Busted\", only to be foiled by Bart Simpson, and sent to prison. Bob started seeking revenge against Bart while in prison, and the two became feuding archenemies.\nBob made his second major appearance in season three's \"Black Widower\"; the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life, threatening to disrupt and end it through murder. Starting with that appearance and thereafter, Bob has assumed the role on \"The Simpsons\" of an evil genius. Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan, usually foiled by Bart and Lisa. His plans often involve death and destruction, usually targeted at Bart or, less often, Krusty, though he starts targeting the entire Simpson family in season 17. In season 27, however, during the first segment of \"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\", entitled \"Wanted: Dead, Then Alive\", Bob finally gets his wish of killing Bart, commenting that he spent 24 years trying to kill a ten-year-old child; however, he becomes bored with Bart dead, so he brings him back to life so that he can repeatedly kill Bart over and over again.\nDespite his villainous deeds, Sideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer character Frasier Crane, and he has been described as \"Frasier pickled in arsenic.\" Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in \"The Simpsons\" between Bob and Frasier Crane\u2014Bob's brother Cecil and his father were played by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney, respectively, echoing the roles they played in \"Frasier\". Grammer, who based Bob's voice on that of actor Ellis Rabb, has been praised for his portrayals of the character. In 2006, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work in the episode \"The Italian Bob\".\nAs of season 36, Sideshow Bob has appeared in more than 40 episodes, had speaking appearances in 25 of these, and been featured as the main character in 15. The most recent of the latter, \"The Yellow Lotus\", aired during the 36th season, and his most recent speaking appearance was in \"Treehouse of Horror XXXIV\" in the 35th season. In addition to his recurring role in the series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other \"Simpsons\" media and is mentioned in several more episodes. He appears in the \"Simpsons Comics\", the 2007 video game \"The Simpsons Game\", and stars as the main antagonist in \"The Simpsons\" Ride at Universal Studios' theme parks. A lover of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, Sideshow Bob is also known for his singing voice; several of Grammer's performances have been included in \"The Simpsons\" musical compilations.\nAppearances.\nOn \"The Simpsons\".\nThe character of Sideshow Bob began his career as the non-speaking sidekick who would only use a \nwhistle \non Krusty the Clown's television show. Bob first appears in \"The Telltale Head\" (season 1, 1990). In the episode, he and Krusty plan a big event for whoever knows information of who captured the head of Jebediah Springfield's statue, and joins in on the town mob when it is discovered that Bart Simpson took it. However, after repeated instances of abuse, including being shot from a cannon and hit constantly with pies, the Yale-educated Bob became angry with Krusty and resentful of the clown's success.\nIn \"Krusty Gets Busted\" (season 1, 1990), Bob disguised himself as Krusty and framed him for armed robbery of the Kwik-E-Mart. After Krusty is arrested, Bob takes control of the show, introducing children to elements of high culture. However, Bob's reign is short-lived; Bart exposes him as the robber, Krusty is released, and Bob is fired and sent to jail.\nIn \"Black Widower\" (season 3, 1992), Bob's first major appearance after framing Krusty, he is released from prison and marries Bart's aunt Selma Bouvier as part of a scheme to inherit money she has invested in the stock market. Bob attempts to blow Selma up during their honeymoon, but Bart again foils the plan and Sideshow Bob returns to prison.\nAfter being paroled from prison in \"Cape Feare\" (season 5, 1993), Bob targets Bart directly, threatening him repeatedly and forcing the Simpsons into hiding as part of the Witness Relocation Program. Bob follows them to their hideout, a houseboat on Terror Lake, and, after subduing the family, prepares to kill Bart. He allows a final request, however, and Bart asks to hear Bob sing the entire score of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\". Although Bob finishes singing and nearly kills Bart, the delaying tactic leads to Bob's third arrest as the houseboat had drifted all the way back to Springfield.\nBob is released from prison once again in \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\" (season 6, 1994), and runs for Mayor of Springfield as the Republican Party candidate (having previously identified himself as \"a life-long Republican\" in \"Black Widower\"). He defeats Democratic Party incumbent Joe Quimby in a landslide, but Bart and Lisa discover from Waylon Smithers that Bob rigged the election by using the names of deceased people. Bob is put on trial and claims himself innocent, but is tricked by Bart and Lisa to expose himself guilty, leading to another incarceration.\nSideshow Bob escapes from prison for the first time in \"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\" (season 7, 1995), and threatens to blow up Springfield with a nuclear bomb unless the city stops broadcasting all television shows. He is thwarted when he finds out that the bomb itself is a dud, then kidnaps Bart and flies the Wright Brothers' plane in an attempt to kill himself, Bart, and Krusty (who is hiding inside a shack, improvising a performance on the Emergency Broadcast System). This too is thwarted, and Bob returns to prison.\nIn the following season, Bob takes advantage of the prison's work release program, and appears to be genuinely redeemed. \"Brother from Another Series\" (season 8, 1997) reveals that Bob only became Krusty's sidekick after his younger brother Cecil failed an audition ten years prior, because Krusty considered Bob to be a perfect comic foil. Reverend Lovejoy declares him a changed man and recommends him for a work release opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of Cecil, who is now Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. However, the scheming Cecil, still smarting over his failed audition for Krusty, tries to frame Bob by sabotaging the Springfield Dam by having it burst across Springfield. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and save the town, and both brothers, despite Bob's genuine innocence, are sent to prison.\nBob returned in \"Day of the Jackanapes\" (season 12, 2001), where he discovers in prison that Krusty has erased all of the early shows featuring Sideshow Bob as Krusty himself is declaring his fifth and final retirement after being annoyed with the network executives. Bob is released from prison and develops a plot to kill Krusty using Bart as a suicide bomber during Krusty's retirement special. Everything goes just as Bob had planned, and just when Bob was about to succeed in murdering both his enemies, he overhears Krusty publicly holding himself responsible for turning Bob into a criminal, expressing his regret of mistreating Bob during his years as Sideshow. To appease things, Krusty sings himself a song on Bob's behalf, and being touched by this, Bob decides to abort his plan of attempted murder and reconciles with Krusty, although he is returned to prison for it.\nBob's aid is sought by Springfield police in \"The Great Louse Detective\" (season 14, 2002). After an attempt is made on Homer Simpson's life, Bob is released from prison to help find the culprit. During the adventure, Bob is given advice to kill Bart without hesitation, instead of being tricked into delay or screwing up on his plots. When the mystery is solved (it was Frank Grimes's son), he returns to murder Bart. However, Bob finds he is \"accustomed to his [Bart's] face\" and cannot do it.\nIn \"The Italian Bob\" (season 17, 2005), it is revealed that Bob had moved to Italy to make a fresh start. He was eventually elected mayor of the village of Salsiccia in Tuscany and marries a local woman named Francesca, with whom he has a son named Gino. The Simpson family, in Italy to retrieve a car for Mr. Burns, encounters him by chance. Bob welcomes them with hospitality on the condition that they not reveal his dark felonious past; however, a drunken Lisa jokes about Bob's criminal deeds and reveals his prison uniform, alienating Bob from his citizens. Bob is angered enough to change his dream of killing Bart to killing the whole Simpson family. Upon catching up to Bob, his wife and his son swear a vendetta with him on all the Simpsons.\nThe entire Terwilliger family returns in \"Funeral for a Fiend\" (season 19, 2007) in which Bob's father, Robert Terwilliger Sr., and mother, Dame Judith Onderdonk, make their first appearances. Cecil also appears a second time on the show. Bob at first attempts to kill the whole family a second time, but his plan fails. Bob fakes his own death during his trial and locks Bart in the coffin, which he attempts to cremate at the otherwise empty funeral home as all the Terwilligers laugh maniacally. They are foiled by Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family and sent to prison.\nIn \"Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes\" (season 20, 2008), Bob is one of the wanted criminals in Homer and Ned Flanders's bounty hunter job despite already being in prison, which he escapes from at the end of the episode. In \"Wedding for Disaster\" (season 20, 2009), Bart and Lisa initially suspect Bob of kidnapping Homer to prevent him from attending his second wedding with Marge (due to a keychain they found had an 'S' and a 'B'), but Krusty provides him with an alibi, explaining to the kids that Bob was with him the whole day. Eventually, Bob and the kids discover the true culprits, Patty and Selma.\nBob also appears in \"Coming to Homerica\", the 21st episode of Season 20, in a joke where the Simpson family enters the Cheers bar dressed as the Cheers cast when Sideshow Bob comes in dressed as Frasier Crane.\nIn \"O Brother, Where Bart Thou?\" (season 21, 2009), Bob makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in Bart's dream sequence while the latter becomes desperate of having a younger brother. Cecil makes his third appearance in \"The Simpsons\" by appearing alongside Bob; the brothers are flying kites together. Bob reappears again in the episode \"The Bob Next Door\" (season 21, 2010). He switches faces with his prison cellmate Walt Warren. Bob returns to Springfield and moves into the house next to the Simpson family, assuming Walt's identity. He exploits this to make his latest attempt to kill Bart legally over state lines, but is foiled again and gets taken away by state police.\nBob appears in \"At Long Last Leave\" (season 23, 2012), the 500th episode of \"The Simpsons\". He attends a town meeting to decide if the Simpson family should be banished from Springfield, and is one of many who express their desire for it to happen. He makes a silent appearance in \"Moonshine River\" (season 24, 2012), where he runs across the train tracks trying to kill Bart, but ends up getting hit by a train.\nIn \"The Man Who Grew Too Much\" (season 25, 2014), he was revealed to be a Chief Scientist for a genetic engineering company named Monsarno, having received the position after he was selected as a test subject and published the results of the experiments to which he was subjected. He and Lisa bond over their interest in Walt Whitman, but Bob reveals that he has also genetically modified himself to give himself various superhuman abilities, intending to acquire DNA from the relics of various historical figures stored in the Springfield Museum to make himself a superhuman dictator. After tempted into a murderous rage, he chases down Bart and Lisa and is about to kill them but however, he is provoked into a fight and he realizes that he has become a crude monster and jumps off the Springfield Dam. The episode ends with Bob underwater in the lake, shown to have survived because the gills he gave himself allow him to live.\nBob also appears in \"Clown in the Dumps\" (season 26, 2014). Having returned to prison, he offered his condolences to Krusty following the death of his father, Rabbi Krustofsky. Several episodes later, Bob returned in \"Blazed and Confused\" (season 26, 2014), where he meets Mr. Lassen, Bart's former teacher, who was now reduced to working in prison as a guard after Bart's earlier actions at a \"Blazing Guy\" festival got him fired. Despite Lassen's offer to get him out, Bob rejects the idea that they team up as Lassen thought that they would take turns gutting Bart.\nIn \"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\" (season 27, 2015), in the first segment called \"Wanted: Dead, then Alive\", Bob uses Milhouse's phone to trap Bart in the band classroom and successfully kills him. In peace with himself, Bob moves on from Bart to pursue other dreams, however, due to Bob chasing down Bart for so long, Bob finds his life so meaningless in Bart's absence that he creates a machine to bring Bart back to life so that he can keep killing his enemy over and over, until the other Simpsons find Bob's location and rescue Bart, and Bart uses the resurrection machine to turn Bob into a twisted amalgamation of creatures. Bob also appears in the episode \"Gal of Constant Sorrow\" (season 27, 2016), grunting in annoyance as he wipes off Bart's graffiti from Hettie Mae Boggs' promo poster on the wall along with Snake Jailbird and other inmates.\nBob returns in \"Treehouse of Horror XXVII\" (season 28, 2016), the 600th episode of \"The Simpsons\". In the opening sequence, he is the self-appointed leader of a four-member group consisting of Homer's enemies, including Bob himself and the ghost of Frank Grimes. Wanting revenge once more, the group attempts to kill the Simpsons but is ultimately killed by Maggie, except Grimes's ghost. In the ending sequence, Bob is one of the characters featured in the \"600\" song played by Judith Owen. In \"Havana Wild Weekend\" (season 28, 2016), Sideshow Bob appeared in the backgrounds at the Cuba's check-in.\nBob also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in \"The Nightmare After Krustmas\" (season 28, 2016); he is amongst the crowd witnessing Krusty nearly drowning in a frozen lake while holding up a sign saying \"Die Clown\". He's had a major appearance in \"Gone Boy\" (season 29, 2017), when he tries to track down the whereabouts of Bart after he goes missing and is presumed dead. Bob finds Bart and proceeds to kill him and Milhouse, but saves them at the last minute due to the influence of the prison therapist's lessons of potentially moving on from wanting to kill Bart. The epilogue features an older Bob, now known as Elder Bob, being a lighthouse keeper and still having regrets of not killing Bart.\nIn \"The Fat Blue Line\" (season 31, 2019), Bob escapes from prison once again, only to be hit by a rake truck. Several episodes later, in \"Bobby, It's Cold Outside\" (season 31, 2019), he is hired to play Santa Claus at a theme park, and later helps the Simpsons discover who is stealing everyone's Christmas gifts. Bob returned in a non-speaking cameo in \"Meat Is Murder\" (season 33, 2022), where he is seen signing the chests of citizens like Milhouse's father Kirk Van Houten at the celebration of Krusty Burger's 50th anniversary, a callback to the \"Die Bart, Die\" scene from \"Cape Feare\".\nIn the \"Treehouse of Horror XXXIV\" segment \"Ei8ht\" (season 35, 2023), in an alternative ending to \"Cape Feare\", Bob realizes that Bart is stalling his death by making him sing \"Pinafore\", and as a result, kills him, traumatizing Lisa. 30 years later, the Springfield Police asks Professor Lisa Simpson to look into a series of murders committed by an unknown serial killer. Perplexed, Lisa seeks Bob's help, but Bob just mocks Lisa. Later, Lisa realizes she herself has done all the murders. Bob is transferred to another prison cell to find Lisa waiting for her, revealing that a split personality emerged after the death of Bart and that she had committed all those murders in hopes of going to prison with Bob. To the music of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", Lisa gleefully slashes Bob to death.\nIn Season 36\u2019s \"The Yellow Lotus\", Bob has a minor role, as he is shown to be married and in the same resort with the Simpsons. When Marge tells Bob's wife about his previous deeds, she throws him off of a cliff, only for Bob to survive and talk with Sideshow Mel.\nOther media.\nIn addition to regular roles in the television series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other \"Simpsons\" media. Kelsey Grammer recorded several Sideshow Bob lines for \"The Simpsons Movie,\" but the scene was cut; the deleted scene shows him amongst the angry mob, intent on killing Bart until he learns that the mob is apparently after Homer only, prompting him to leave in disappointment. Sideshow Bob has made regular appearances in the monthly \"Simpsons Comics\", and several of Kelsey Grammer's singing performances have been included in \"The Simpsons\" CD compilations. His performance of the \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in \"Cape Feare\" was later included on the album \"Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons,\" and the song \"The Very Reason That I Live\" from \"The Great Louse Detective\" was included on \"\". A previously unaired song, \"Hullaba Lula\", originally written for \"Day of the Jackanapes\", was also included on that compilation. The producers modeled the song after \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", but were forced to remove the song from the episode when they were unable to obtain the rights to it.\nIn \"The Simpsons Game\", released in November 2007, Bob has a speaking cameo appearance at the end of the chapter titled \"Invasion of the Yokel-Snatchers\" in which he was working with Kang and Kodos. Sideshow Bob appears in the 1991 \"The Simpsons Arcade Game\", on the fifth level where he is pulling a cart containing a roast chicken health pick up. Bob was also included as a level boss in the 1991 video game \"Bart vs. the Space Mutants\". Sideshow Bob plays a lead role in The Simpsons Ride, which opened at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2008. Voiced by Grammer, he is the main villain in the ride, having escaped from prison to get revenge on the Simpson family.\nIn \"\", a city-building game released in February 2012, Sideshow Bob occurs as a bonus. Popping up every couple hours, the players are given a chance to tap on him to receive a small sum of money, and \"send\" him to jail. In a later update to the game, Sideshow Bob also has a stand in Krusty Land, where players get to pop balloons for a chance to win donuts and Krusty tickets. The Simpsons: Tapped Out Terwilligers content update was released April 14, 2015 and has several references to the Simpsons episodes with Sideshow Bob. This game event was split in 3 acts and ended June 4, 2015. New characters, skins and costumes include Sideshow Bob, Cecil Terwilliger, Gino Terwilliger, Francesca Terwilliger, Dr. Robert Terwilliger Sr., Judith Onderdonk, Captain Bob, and Opera Krusty. Most of the event action takes place at Monsarno Research and Opera House.\nCharacter.\nCreation.\nSideshow Bob first appeared in \"The Telltale Head\", the eighth episode of season 1. His design was relatively simple compared to later incarnations, and his hairstyle was rounded. However, towards the end of the episode, he appears again, in a panning shot of a crowd, with his familiar hairstyle. His second appearance, and first major one, was in season 1's twelfth episode \"Krusty Gets Busted\", written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Bob's design was updated for \"Krusty Gets Busted\"; as the episode's animation style evolved, director Brad Bird made the character of Sideshow Bob sleeker and more refined, to fit Grammer's voice technique. Following the re-design, animators tried to redraw his scenes in \"The Telltale Head\", but had insufficient time before the show was produced.\nBob has no lines of dialogue during the first half of \"Krusty Gets Busted\"; the character's only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would be surprised to hear his sophisticated vocabulary. An early version of the script for \"Krusty Gets Busted\" called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer. For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose \"lamenting tones became [the] foundation for Sideshow Bob\".\nSideshow Bob's full name is Robert Underdunk Terwilliger. His last name was first revealed in \"Black Widower\" while his middle name was first revealed in \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\". Competing theories as to the origin of his name exist; some sources say he was named after the character Dr. Terwilliker, a megalomaniac outwitted by a boy named Bart in the film \"The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.\" co-written by Dr. Seuss, but others say he was named after Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, Oregon. Yet another theory is that he was named after Sergeant Terwilliger and Mrs. Onderdonk in the pilot episode of the TV show \"Hunter\".\nDevelopment.\nFor season three's \"Black Widower\", the writers echoed the premise of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner from \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer Al Jean has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect. For \"Black Widower\", director David Silverman updated the character model to reflect the animation of director Brad Bird. A rule for earlier episodes featuring Bob called for a recap of his evil deeds; this was dropped after season eight's \"Brother from Another Series\" when the chronology became too lengthy. Another rule established by the show's writers mandated Bob's return to prison at the end of each episode, although this pattern was abandoned in later episodes like \"The Great Louse Detective\" and \"The Italian Bob\".\nBill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, the showrunners for the seventh and eighth seasons, believed that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season, Bob had already been the focus of four episodes, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him. Weinstein describes Bob's dialogue as difficult to write, due to his unique and refined style of speaking. Despite these challenges, however, creators of \"The Simpsons\" usually look forward to \"Sideshow Bob episodes\"; the writers consider them enjoyable to write, and former director Dominic Polcino describes them as \"a treat\" to work on.\nKelsey Grammer initially expected Sideshow Bob to be a one-time role, and calls him \"the most popular character I've ever played\". Grammer usually joins the show's \"table readings\" (wherein cast members read each script together for the first time), and former executive producer David Mirkin described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh. In a 2007 interview, \"Simpsons\" executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying \"his voice is so rich.\" Writer George Meyer commented that \"writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give. And he can sing.\"\nThe show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance. Alf Clausen, the primary composer for \"The Simpsons\", commented that \"[Grammer] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it.\" Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in \"Cape Feare\". It is based on the score of the film \"Cape Fear\", composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical score for \"Cape Feare\" earned Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Underscore \u2013 Series in 1994.\nBob's prisoner number is often 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\". Another trademark for Bob is a visual gag of stepping on a rake and being struck in the face with its handle; this joke first appeared in \"Cape Feare\". To fill time, the writers added nine consecutive iterations of the same joke in quick succession. The sequence has become known as the \"rake joke\" and was described by \"Entertainment Weekly\" as showing \"genius in its repetitive stupidity.\"\nFamily.\nThe episode \"Brother from Another Series\" introduces Bob's brother Cecil. After writer Ken Keeler was assigned to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of \"Frasier\". He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on \"Frasier\". Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, \"Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?\" Several of \"Frasier\"'s producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as \"Maris\". In \"Frasier\", Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of \"Frasier\" asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director Pete Michels, it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.\nCecil returns in season 19's \"Funeral for a Fiend\", which introduces the brothers' previously unseen father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, played by John Mahoney. Mahoney portrayed Martin Crane, the father of Grammer's and Pierce's characters in \"Frasier\". Whereas in \"Frasier\", Mahoney played the \"down-to-Earth, average guy\" to Grammer's and Hyde Pierce's \"uppity snobs\", Robert Terwilliger Sr. was portrayed as equally highbrow as Bob. His wife, Bob's mother, is Dame Judith Onderdonk, \"the finest classical actress of her generation.\" She sports the same curly spiked hair as her two sons. Bob also has a wife named Francesca (voiced by Maria Grazia Cucinotta) and a son named Gino, both of whom were introduced in season 17 episode \"The Italian Bob\" and returned for \"Funeral for a Fiend\".\nReception.\nThe character of Sideshow Bob and Grammer's voicework have received many accolades. In 2006, IGN listed him as the second-best \"peripheral character\" on \"The Simpsons\", commenting that Bob is \"a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree like hair, doesn't seem to match up to the well spoken and even musically talented maniac.\" Also that year, \"Wizard\" magazine rated Bob as the 66th-greatest villain of all time. Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote that \"that baritone voice, the Shakespearean delivery, and the ability to go from calm and collected to stark raving mad all within the same second make Sideshow Bob one of the best recurring characters on the show.\"\nKelsey Grammer has consistently received praise for his voicework, and has been described as \"brilliant\", \"inimitable\" and \"a feast of mid-Atlantic anglophilia\". In 2006, Grammer won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his role in \"The Italian Bob\"; he had previously won four awards in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category for his portrayal of the title role on \"Frasier\". In 2008, Grammer was included in \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s list of the sixteen best \"Simpsons\" guest stars; Hyde Pierce was also included in that list. Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that \"Kelsey Grammer's grand voice-performance as Sideshow Bob is Frasier pickled in arsenic.\" In her book \"My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy\", Nancy Cartwright (who performs the voice of Bart Simpson) wrote that \"Kelsey Grammer scores big-time by injecting caustic, bitter, contemptuous and deliciously vile energy into his rendition of Sideshow Bob. Springfield just wouldn't be the same without him.\"\nMost of the episodes featuring Bob have been well received by fans and critics. \"Cape Feare\" is generally regarded as one of the best episodes of \"The Simpsons\" and placed third on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s 2003 list of the show's top 25 episodes. IGN considers it the best episode of the fifth season. In 2007, \"Vanity Fair\" called it the show's fourth-best episode, because of its \"masterful integration of filmic parody and a recurring character\". Ben Rayner of the \"Toronto Star\" listed \"Cape Feare\", \"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\" and \"Brother From Another Series\" among the best episodes of the series, writing \"forget \"Frasier\", these are Kelsey Grammer's best roles.\" \"The Italian Bob\" and its writer John Frink won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2007 in the animation category. In December 2009, Robert Canning of IGN ranked the ten episodes to feature Bob that had aired at the time. The first five Bob episodes took up the top five, with \"Cape Feare\" being ranked first. \"The Italian Bob\" was ranked tenth, with the explanation that \"All the things we love about a Sideshow Bob episode\u2014the vengeance, the familiar settings and characters, the elaborate scheming\u2014were missing from this half-hour. Without it, Bob wasn't nearly as entertaining, and the episode didn't result in a whole lot of laughs.\" He noted that only \"The Italian Bob\" and the ninth ranked \"Funeral for a Fiend\" were \"the only ones I'd consider clunkers. The remaining episodes are all quite fun.\"\nThe character's line in \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\", \"Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel prize for attempted chemistry?\", briefly became an Internet meme after a similar defense of President Donald Trump was repeated after the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal.\nAnalysis.\nIn \"Planet Simpson\", author Chris Turner writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book \"Leaving Springfield\", David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a \"mass-culture upbringing\" and thus is Bob's enemy. Frustrated by his early role as the target of \"Krusty's cheap gags\", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that \"Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents.\" He also tries to \"manipulate the tastes of the masses\" by becoming a criminal mastermind. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, \"Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who'll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! That's why I did this, to protect you from yourselves!\" He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.\nBob's intelligence serves him in many ways. During the episode \"Cape Feare\", for example, the parole board asks Bob why he has a tattoo that says \"Die, Bart, Die\". Bob replies that it is German for \"The, Bart, The\"; members of the board are impressed by his reasoning. Believing that \"nobody who speaks German could be an evil man\", they release him. However, his love of high culture is sometimes used against him. In the same episode, Bob agrees to perform the operetta \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in its entirety as a last request for Bart. The tactic stalls Bob long enough for the police to arrest him.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1957, Weaver hosted his own NBC variety show \"The Doodles Weaver Show\". In addition to his radio work, he also recorded a number of comedy records, appeared in films and guest-starred on numerous television series from the 1950s through the 1970s. Weaver made his last onscreen appearance in 1981. Despondent over poor health, Weaver fatally shot himself in January 1983.\nEarly life.\nWeaver was born in Los Angeles, one of four children born to Sylvester Laflin Weaver, a wealthy roofing contractor, and Nellie Mabel (Amabel) Dixon Weaver. His older brother was Pat Weaver, who served as the president of NBC in the 1950s. Weaver's niece is actress Sigourney Weaver. He was of English and Scottish ancestry with roots in New England. Weaver's mother gave him the nickname \"Doodlebug\" as a child because of his freckles and big ears.\nHe attended Los Angeles High School and Stanford University. At Stanford, Weaver was a contributor to the \"Stanford Chaparral\" humor magazine. He was also known to engage in numerous pranks and practical jokes and earned the nickname \"The Mad Monk\". He was reportedly suspended from Stanford in 1937 (the year he graduated) for pulling a prank on the train home from the Rose Bowl.\nCareer.\nRadio and recordings.\nOn radio during the late 1930s and early 1940s, he was heard as an occasional guest on Rudy Vall\u00e9e's program and on the \"Kraft Music Hall\".\nIn 1946, Weaver signed on as a member of Spike Jones's City Slickers band. Weaver was heard on Jones's 1947\u201349 radio shows, where he introduced his comedic Professor Feetlebaum (which Weaver sometimes spelled as Feitlebaum), a character who spoke in spoonerisms. Part of the Professor's schtick was mixing up words and sentences in various songs and recitations as if he had myopia or dyslexia. Weaver toured the country with the Spike Jones \"Musical Depreciation Revue\" until 1951. The radio programs were often broadcast from cities where the Revue was staged.\nOne of Weaver's most popular recordings is the Spike Jones parody of Rossini's \"William Tell Overture\". Weaver gives a close impression of the gravel-voiced sports announcer Clem McCarthy in a satire of a horse race announcer who forgets whether he's covering a horse race or a boxing match (\"It's Girdle in the stretch! Locomotive is on the rail! Apartment House is second with plenty of room! It's Cabbage by a head!\"). The race features a nag named Beetlebaum, who begins at long odds, runs the race a distant last\u2014and yet suddenly emerges as the winner. The oft-repeated \"Beetlebaum\" became so identified with the record that RCA reprinted the record label, adding \"Beetlebaum\" in parentheses after the song title. Jones and Weaver followed this hit with a 1949 parody of the Indianapolis 500 automobile race, again with Weaver as commentator, set to Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\". The surprise winner? Beetlebaum. When an angry listener named Beetlebaum threatened a lawsuit, Weaver changed the name to Feitlebaum.\nIn 1966, Weaver recorded a novelty version of \"Eleanor Rigby\"\u2014singing, mixing up the words, insulting, and interrupting, while playing the piano.\nWriting.\nWeaver was a contributor to the early \"Mad\", as described by \"Time\"'s Richard Corliss:\nAmong the funny stuff: Doodles Weaver's strict copy editing of the Gettysburg Address, advising Lincoln to change \"fourscore and seven\" to eighty-seven (\"Be specific\"), noting that there are six \"dedicates\" (\"Study your Roget\"), wondering if \"proposition\" isn't misspelled and, finally exasperated, urging the writer to omit \"of the people, by the people, for the people\" as \"superfluous.\"\nFilms and television.\nWeaver made his television debut on \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\" in 1951. He performed an Ajax cleanser commercial with a pig, and the audience reaction prompted the network to give him his own series. In 1951, \"The Doodles Weaver Show\" was NBC's summer replacement for Sid Caesar's \"Your Show of Shows\"; it was telecast from June to September with Weaver, his wife Lois, vocalist Marian Colby, and the comedy team of Dick Dana and Peanuts Mann. The show's premise involved Weaver dealing with an assignment to stage a no-budget television series using only the discarded costumes, sets and props left behind by more popular network television shows away for the summer.\nWeaver went on to guest star on numerous television shows including \"The Spike Jones Show\", \"The Donna Reed Show\", \"Dennis the Menace\", and \"The Tab Hunter Show\". He also hosted several children's television series. In 1965, he starred in \"A Day With Doodles\", a series of six-minute shorts sold as alternative fare to cartoons for locally hosted kiddie television programs. Each episode featured Weaver in a first-person plural adventure (e.g., \"Today we are a movie actor\"), portraying himself and, behind false mustaches and costume hats, all the other characters in slapstick comedy situations with a voice over narration and minimal sets. The ending credits would invariably list \"Doodles... Doodles Weaver\" and \"Everybody Else... Doodles Weaver.\"\nHe portrayed eccentric characters in guest appearances on such television series as \"Batman\" (where he played The Archer's henchman Crier Tuck), \"Land of the Giants\", \"Dragnet 1967\" and \"The Monkees\". He appeared in more than 90 films, including \"The Great Imposter\" (1961), Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" (1963) (as the man helping Tippi Hedren's character with her rental boat), Jerry Lewis's \"The Nutty Professor\" (1963), \"Pocketful of Miracles\" (1961) and, in a cameo, \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963). He appeared in \"Six Pack Annie\" (1975). His last movie was \"Earthbound\" (1981).\nPersonal life.\nWeaver was married four times and had three children. His first marriage was to Beverly Masterman in 1939. His second marriage, to Evelyn Irene Paulsen, ended with a divorce decree on December 22, 1948, but that decree was not recorded at that time. In 1949, Weaver's third marriage was with nightclub dancer Lois Frisell, who had the marriage annulled in 1954.\nWeaver's fourth and final marriage was to actress Reita Anne Green in October 1957. They had two children before divorcing in 1969.\nDeath.\nOn January 16, 1983, Weaver was discovered dead by his son Winston at his Burbank, California, home. He died of two self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the chest. His death was ruled a suicide. Weaver's son said that his father had been despondent over his failing heart health. His funeral service was held on January 22 at Forest Lawn Mortuary in the Hollywood Hills. He was buried in Avalon Cemetery on Santa Catalina Island, California.\nWeaver's memoir, \"Golden Spike\", remains unpublished.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nelson was first introduced in Season 1's \"Bart the General\" as an antagonist, but later became more of an anti-hero, continuing to bully those weaker than him while occasionally showing a friendly and sensitive nature underneath. Nelson lives in poverty with his mother in a run-down home, and often shoplifts from convenience stores to get by.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nNelson is a 12-year-old student and bully at Springfield Elementary School. He is known to have terrorized virtually every child in Springfield at one point or another. Most often, it is the school nerds and less popular students, such as Milhouse and Martin, who are the subjects of his cruelty. Nelson shows the occasional glimpse of humanity, and other characters have warmed to him because of that; Lisa dates him briefly in \"Lisa's Date with Density\", Marge informally adopts him in \"Sleeping with the Enemy\", and Bart is shown as a friend to him several times, such as in \"The Haw-Hawed Couple\".\nHis family is also financially poor resulting in a dysfunctional day-to-day lifestyle. While some early episodes offer inconsistent histories (such as Nelson's dad going insane and abandoning him, Nelson's parents divorcing because of his mom's cough drop addiction, or Nelson's dad in prison while his mom \"has bigger problems\"), the current canon story is that he lives in a dilapidated house with his mother, who works on the fringes of the sex industry, either as a waitress at Hooters or in a topless bar. The character design and voice portrayal of both parents have varied throughout the course of the series.\nIt is shown in many episodes that Nelson's father abandoned him and his mother at an early age when he \"went to pick up some Pop-Tarts,\" although later on in the series he was said to have gone to pick up a pack of cigarettes. In the fourth-season episode \"Brother from the Same Planet,\" Nelson's father is the children's soccer coach who awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele's Soccer and Acting Camp. Nelson's father also appears briefly in the sixth-season episode \"Bart's Girlfriend,\" depicted capturing Nelson with a leash as the children run through the cornfields in an attempt to avoid attending church. He also appears in the ninth-season episode \"Bart Star\" to congratulate Nelson after a football game victory and take him to Hooters (with Nelson turning down the invitation because he \"doesn't want to bother [his] Mom at work\"). Nelson's father returns in the sixteenth-season episode \"Sleeping with the Enemy\". It turns out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts, and had an allergic reaction, covering 90% of his body with large tumors. Confused and facially deformed,he ran out of the store and encountered a circus that made him a part of its freak show. Whenever there are performances, circus attendees threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his reaction, preventing him from returning to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of Nelson (who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge).\nNelson is also a natural athlete. In the episode \"Bart Star\", Nelson almost single-handedly carries the entire Springfield Pee-Wee football team. As the team quarterback, he also on one occasion catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease. In various episodes, he gives out the impression that he is a lot smarter than he may first appear. Nelson often points out painfully obvious things to adults and kids alike that take them longer to grasp. Another example is a running joke where Nelson does a class assignment that is implied to be of high quality. However, he is always brushed off by the teachers before he gets to show them his work. Another running joke, though, is Nelson presenting ridiculously simple assignments, such as repeatedly showing a can of tomato paste in Show and Tell, and a presentation on \"The Grapes of Wrath\", consisting of himself crushing a bunch of grapes with a hammer, stating \"Here's the grapes, and here's the wrath!\" In later episodes, Nelson shows signs of being a tormented artist type, even submitting a film to the Sundance Film Festival about his life as a child living in poverty with a single, unfit mother and no strong father figure. He memorably says in the documentary, \"I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.\"\nIn the episode \"Little Big Girl\", it is revealed that Nelson is German-American. Ironically, in \"Much Apu About Nothing\", Nelson picks on foreign exchange student \u00dcter for being German during Springfield's anti-immigration mania. He is shown to be a big fan of Andy Williams as he, Bart, Milhouse and Martin went to a concert performed by him in \"Bart on the Road\".\nIn The Simpsons Guy, he was captured along with Sideshow Bob, Principal Skinner, Jimbo Jones, and Apu by Stewie Griffin.\nRelationships with other characters.\nEven though in the first season (and for many seasons afterward) Nelson seemed to be Bart's antagonist, he eventually becomes what can be considered Bart's second closest friend after Milhouse.\nIn his debut episode, Lisa was the initial target of Nelson's friend. Nelson had two minions at first one of which snatched a box of cupcakes from Lisa which prompted Bart to defend her. Bart's actions resulted in frequent beatings by Nelson and his gang, but finally ended when Bart received help from Herman, who came up with the idea of standing up to Nelson and his gang by pelting them with water balloons. From that point on, Nelson shows grudging respect for Bart, though he occasionally reverts to his past behaviour towards him.\nAlthough still prone to violence, Nelson hangs out with Bart and his less popular friends, such as Milhouse Van Houten and occasionally even common bullying target Martin Prince. In \"The Debarted\", it is shown that Nelson has become Bart's \"other best friend\", along with Milhouse. Nelson is shown participating in many things with Bart further proving they're friends. Some of the activities they do consist of football, basketball, baseball, lacrosse, going to read comics, and playing pranks on people. They even competed on the same e-sports team and went to the world championship.\nNelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendency, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. In \"Lisa's Date with Density\", Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph, who believe that kissing girls is \"gay\" (despite the events that occurred revolving around Jimbo in \"New Kid On The Block\").\nHe also punishes Sherri and Terri for tormenting Lisa by having a skunk spray on them. Another curious example of his \"good side\" is with Martin, a boy whom Nelson picks on perhaps more so than any other kid in town. Despite the utter cruelty, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any real hatred towards Martin and only does so to maintain his 'tough guy' reputation. In \"Dial 'N' for Nerder\", when it is believed that Martin has died, Nelson endeavors to learn the truth and find Martin's killers. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but also states that he is glad Martin is not dead. In this same episode, however, when Lisa tries to bribe him to not rat her out by offering to get back together with him, he rejects it. In another episode, it is revealed that both Martin and Nelson went to space camp and that Nelson was a loyal officer to Martin. (See \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\")\nIn \"Loan-a Lisa\", Lisa uses $50 to help Nelson fund his bicycle company, which becomes a success. When Nelson almost drops out of school to spend more time on the company, Lisa is saddened and attempts to stop him from doing so, but eventually respects his decision after realizing he will not change despite the money used to fund it. Nelson eventually decides not to drop out after all and takes Lisa skating to make it up to her.\nThough Nelson is often said to not really have friends aside from his on-and-off relationship with Bart and the others, Nelson sometimes hangs out with his fellow school bullies Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney, and (to a lesser extent) two smaller and younger fraternal twin minions known as the Weasels. Though only seen with them occasionally, Nelson is also ironically the leader of the school bullies (possibly by virtue of being the most often seen and most recognizable of the gang).\nIn \"Sleeping with the Enemy\", Moe Szyslak appears briefly during a Muntz family reunion. The facial similarities between Moe and the Muntzes are surprisingly quite apparent and Moe's childhood experiences and behaviour are somewhat relatable with Nelson's. Moe briefly appears and claims that he is part of the family and is then shunned off-screen by the Muntzes' confused looks.\nCharacter.\n\"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening named Nelson after the wrestling hold of the same name. Cast member Nancy Cartwright voices the character, which first appeared in the fifth episode of the first season, \"Bart the General\" (1990). American voice actress Dana Hill was first supposed to provide Nelson's voice and attended the read-through of the episode. However, as Cartwright wrote in her autobiography \"My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy\", \"the producers were still putting together this ensemble of [actors] and, come Monday, at the recording, she was nowhere to be found and the part was assigned to me. I didn't have time to ask why and I still don't have a clue.\" Cartwright also commented that when she first found out she would be voicing Nelson, \"I asked myself, 'What does a bully sound like?' Well... what you hear is what you get. When I first uttered, 'I'll get you after school, man!' I let out a sigh of relief when I got through the line and a double-sigh when it got a laugh.\"\nBy the eighth season of \"The Simpsons\", the writers began to explore the secondary characters of the show. \"Lisa's Date with Density\" (season eight, 1996) was the first episode to center around Nelson and was used to explain why he acts the way he does. The idea of Nelson dating Lisa Simpson had already been around for a while, but this was the first time that the staff worked it into the show. Cartwright said in 2012 that she thinks Nelson \"has evolved the most out of all the characters I do. There's a soft spot in him that the writers have found. He's got this special attraction to Marge, and he sings these songs, and he's got a crush on Lisa. There's something about this poor kid\u00a0\u2013 his mother works at Hooters, his dad went out to buy cigarettes and never came back. I wouldn't want him to come over for dinner, but I really love doing his voice.\"\nReception.\nThe episode \"The Haw-Hawed Couple\" in 2007 was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. The writer of the episode Matt Selman was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award.\nIn his review of the season 22 episode \"Loan-a Lisa\", Rowan Kaiser of \"The A.V. Club\" commented that Nelson's character has undergone a \"Spikeification\", in reference to the bully's near-exclusive portrayal as being likable and vulnerable in later seasons of the program.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64919", "revid": "50052602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64919", "title": "Environmental science", "text": "Study of the environment\nEnvironmental science is an academic field that integrates the physical, biological, and mathematical sciences to study the environment and solve environmental problems. It uses an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to analyze environmental systems and emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during the Enlightenment. It is considered interdisciplinary because it is an integration of various fields such as: biology, chemistry, physics, geology, engineering, sociology, and ecology.\nEnvironmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific investigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by, the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to analyze complex environmental problems, the arrival of substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental protocols of investigation, and the growing public awareness of a need for action in addressing environmental problems. Events that spurred this development included the publication of Rachel Carson's landmark environmental book \"Silent Spring\" along with major environmental issues becoming public, such as the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, and the Cuyahoga River of Cleveland, Ohio \"catching fire\", also in 1969.\nTerminology.\nIn common usage, \"environmental science\" and \"ecology\" are often used interchangeably, but technically, ecology refers only to the study of organisms and their interactions with each other as well as how they interrelate with environment. Ecology could be considered a subset of environmental science, which also could involve purely chemical or public health issues (for example) ecologists would be unlikely to study. In practice, there are considerable similarities between the work of ecologists and other environmental scientists. There is substantial overlap between ecology and environmental science with the disciplines of fisheries, forestry, and wildlife.\n\"Environmental studies\" incorporates more of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect.\nHistory.\nAncient civilizations.\nHistorical concern for environmental issues is well documented in archives around the world. Ancient civilizations were mainly concerned with what is now known as environmental science insofar as it related to agriculture and natural resources. Scholars believe that early interest in the environment began around 6000 BCE when ancient civilizations in Israel and Jordan collapsed due to deforestation. As a result, in 2700 BCE the first legislation limiting deforestation was established in Mesopotamia. Two hundred years later, in 2500 BCE, a community residing in the Indus River Valley observed the nearby river system in order to improve sanitation. This involved manipulating the flow of water to account for public health. In the Western Hemisphere, numerous ancient Central American city-states collapsed around 1500 BCE due to soil erosion from intensive agriculture. Those remaining from these civilizations took greater attention to the impact of farming practices on the sustainability of the land and its stable food production. Furthermore, in 1450 BCE the Minoan civilization on the Greek island of Crete declined due to deforestation and the resulting environmental degradation of natural resources. Pliny the Elder somewhat addressed the environmental concerns of ancient civilizations in the text \"Naturalis Historia\", written between 77 and 79 ACE, which provided an overview of many related subsets of the discipline.\nAlthough warfare and disease were of primary concern in ancient society, environmental issues played a crucial role in the survival and power of different civilizations. As more communities recognized the importance of the natural world to their long-term success, an interest in studying the environment came into existence.\nBeginnings of environmental science.\n18th century.\nIn 1735, the concept of binomial nomenclature is introduced by Carolus Linnaeus as a way to classify all living organisms, influenced by earlier works of Aristotle. His text, \"Systema Naturae\", represents one of the earliest culminations of knowledge on the subject, providing a means to identify different species based partially on how they interact with their environment.\n19th century.\nIn the 1820s, scientists were studying the properties of gases, particularly those in the Earth's atmosphere and their interactions with heat from the Sun. Later that century, studies suggested that the Earth had experienced an Ice Age and that warming of the Earth was partially due to what are now known as greenhouse gases (GHG). The greenhouse effect was introduced, although climate science was not yet recognized as an important topic in environmental science due to minimal industrialization and lower rates of greenhouse gas emissions at the time.\n20th century.\nIn the 1900s, the discipline of environmental science as it is known today began to take shape. The century is marked by significant research, literature, and international cooperation in the field.\nIn the early 20th century, criticism from dissenters downplayed the effects of global warming. At this time, few researchers were studying the dangers of fossil fuels. After a 1.3 degrees Celsius temperature anomaly was found in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1940s, however, scientists renewed their studies of gaseous heat trapping from the greenhouse effect (although only carbon dioxide and water vapor were known to be greenhouse gases then). Nuclear development following the Second World War allowed environmental scientists to intensively study the effects of carbon and make advancements in the field. Further knowledge from archaeological evidence brought to light the changes in climate over time, particularly ice core sampling.\nEnvironmental science was brought to the forefront of society in 1962 when Rachel Carson published an influential piece of environmental literature, \"Silent Spring\". Carson's writing led the American public to pursue environmental safeguards, such as bans on harmful chemicals like the insecticide DDT. Another important work, \"The Tragedy of the Commons\", was published by Garrett Hardin in 1968 in response to accelerating natural degradation. In 1969, environmental science once again became a household term after two striking disasters: Ohio's Cuyahoga River caught fire due to the amount of pollution in its waters and a Santa Barbara oil spill endangered thousands of marine animals, both receiving prolific media coverage. Consequently, the United States passed an abundance of legislation, including the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The following year, in 1970, the first ever Earth Day was celebrated worldwide and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed, legitimizing the study of environmental science in government policy. In the next two years, the United Nations created the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Stockholm, Sweden to address global environmental degradation.\nMuch of the interest in environmental science throughout the 1970s and the 1980s was characterized by major disasters and social movements. In 1978, hundreds of people were relocated from Love Canal, New York after carcinogenic pollutants were found to be buried underground near residential areas. The next year, in 1979, the nuclear power plant on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania suffered a meltdown and raised concerns about the dangers of radioactive waste and the safety of nuclear energy. In response to landfills and toxic waste often disposed of near their homes, the official Environmental Justice Movement was started by a Black community in North Carolina in 1982. Two years later, the toxic methyl isocyanate gas was released to the public from a power plant disaster in Bhopal, India, harming hundreds of thousands of people living near the disaster site, the effects of which are still felt today. In a groundbreaking discovery in 1985, a British team of researchers studying Antarctica found evidence of a hole in the ozone layer, inspiring global agreements banning the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were previously used in nearly all aerosols and refrigerants. Notably, in 1986, the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine released radioactive waste to the public, leading to international studies on the ramifications of environmental disasters. Over the next couple of years, the Brundtland Commission (previously known as the World Commission on Environment and Development) published a report titled \"Our Common Future\" and the Montreal Protocol formed the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as international communication focused on finding solutions for climate change and degradation. In the late 1980s, the Exxon Valdez company was fined for spilling large quantities of crude oil off the coast of Alaska and the resulting cleanup, involving the work of environmental scientists. After hundreds of oil wells were burned in combat in 1991, warfare between Iraq and Kuwait polluted the surrounding atmosphere just below the air quality threshold environmental scientists believed was life-threatening.\n21st century.\nMany niche disciplines of environmental science have emerged over the years, although climatology is one of the most known topics. Since the 2000s, environmental scientists have focused on modeling the effects of climate change and encouraging global cooperation to minimize potential damages. In 2002, the Society for the Environment as well as the Institute of Air Quality Management were founded to share knowledge and develop solutions around the world. Later, in 2008, the United Kingdom became the first country to pass legislation (the Climate Change Act) that aims to reduce carbon dioxide output to a specified threshold. In 2016 the Kyoto Protocol became the Paris Agreement, which sets concrete goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restricts Earth's rise in temperature to a 2 degrees Celsius maximum. The agreement is one of the most expansive international efforts to limit the effects of global warming to date.\nMost environmental disasters in this time period involve crude oil pollution or the effects of rising temperatures. In 2010, BP was responsible for the largest American oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, known as the Deepwater Horizon spill, which killed a number of the company's workers and released large amounts of crude oil into the water. Furthermore, throughout this century, much of the world has been ravaged by widespread wildfires and water scarcity, prompting regulations on the sustainable use of natural resources as determined by environmental scientists.\nThe 21st century is marked by significant technological advancements. New technology in environmental science has transformed how researchers gather information about various topics in the field. Research in engines, fuel efficiency, and decreasing emissions from vehicles since the times of the Industrial Revolution has reduced the amount of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Furthermore, investment in researching and developing clean energy (i.e. wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal power) has significantly increased in recent years, indicating the beginnings of the divestment from fossil fuel use. Geographic information systems (GIS) are used to observe sources of air or water pollution through satellites and digital imagery analysis. This technology allows for advanced farming techniques like precision agriculture as well as monitoring water usage in order to set market prices. In the field of water quality, developed strains of natural and manmade bacteria contribute to bioremediation, the treatment of wastewaters for future use. This method is more eco-friendly and cheaper than manual cleanup or treatment of wastewaters. Most notably, the expansion of computer technology has allowed for large data collection, advanced analysis, historical archives, public awareness of environmental issues, and international scientific communication. The ability to crowdsource on the Internet, for example, represents the process of collectivizing knowledge from researchers around the world to create increased opportunity for scientific progress. With crowdsourcing, data is released to the public for personal analyses which can later be shared as new information is found. Another technological development, blockchain technology, monitors and regulates global fisheries. By tracking the path of fish through global markets, environmental scientists can observe whether certain species are being overharvested to the point of extinction. Additionally, remote sensing allows for the detection of features of the environment without physical intervention. The resulting digital imagery is used to create increasingly accurate models of environmental processes, climate change, and much more. Advancements to remote sensing technology are particularly useful in locating the nonpoint sources of pollution and analyzing ecosystem health through image analysis across the electromagnetic spectrum. Lastly, thermal imaging technology is used in wildlife management to catch and discourage poachers and other illegal wildlife traffickers from killing endangered animals, proving useful for conservation efforts. Artificial intelligence has also been used to predict the movement of animal populations and protect the habitats of wildlife.\nComponents.\nAtmospheric sciences.\nAtmospheric sciences focus on the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis upon its interrelation to other systems. Atmospheric sciences can include studies of meteorology, greenhouse gas phenomena, atmospheric dispersion modeling of airborne contaminants, sound propagation phenomena related to noise pollution, and even light pollution.\nTaking the example of the global warming phenomena, physicists create computer models of atmospheric circulation and infrared radiation transmission, chemists examine the inventory of atmospheric chemicals and their reactions, biologists analyze the plant and animal contributions to carbon dioxide fluxes, and specialists such as meteorologists and oceanographers add additional breadth in understanding the atmospheric dynamics.\nEcology.\nAs defined by the Ecological Society of America, \"Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment; it seeks to understand the vital connections between plants and animals and the world around them.\" Ecologists might investigate the relationship between a population of organisms and some physical characteristic of their environment, such as concentration of a chemical; or they might investigate the interaction between two populations of different organisms through some symbiotic or competitive relationship. For example, an interdisciplinary analysis of an ecological system which is being impacted by one or more stressors might include several related environmental science fields. In an estuarine setting where a proposed industrial development could impact certain species by water and air pollution, biologists would describe the flora and fauna, chemists would analyze the transport of water pollutants to the marsh, physicists would calculate air pollution emissions and geologists would assist in understanding the marsh soils and bay muds.\nEnvironmental chemistry.\nEnvironmental chemistry is the study of chemical alterations in the environment. Principal areas of study include soil contamination and water pollution. The topics of analysis include chemical degradation in the environment, multi-phase transport of chemicals (for example, evaporation of a solvent containing lake to yield solvent as an air pollutant), and chemical effects upon biota.\nAs an example study, consider the case of a leaking solvent tank which has entered the habitat soil of an endangered species of amphibian. As a method to resolve or understand the extent of soil contamination and subsurface transport of solvent, a computer model would be implemented. Chemists would then characterize the molecular bonding of the solvent to the specific soil type, and biologists would study the impacts upon soil arthropods, plants, and ultimately pond-dwelling organisms that are the food of the endangered amphibian.\nGeosciences.\nGeosciences include environmental geology, environmental soil science, volcanic phenomena and evolution of the Earth's crust. In some classification systems this can also include hydrology, including oceanography.\nAs an example study, of soils erosion, calculations would be made of surface runoff by soil scientists. Fluvial geomorphologists would assist in examining sediment transport in overland flow. Physicists would contribute by assessing the changes in light transmission in the receiving waters. Biologists would analyze subsequent impacts to aquatic flora and fauna from increases in water turbidity.\nRegulations driving the studies.\nIn the United States the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 set forth requirements for analysis of federal government actions (such as highway construction projects and land management decisions) in terms of specific environmental criteria. Numerous state laws have echoed these mandates, applying the principles to local-scale actions. The upshot has been an explosion of documentation and study of environmental consequences before the fact of development actions.\nOne can examine the specifics of environmental science by reading examples of Environmental Impact Statements prepared under NEPA such as: \"Wastewater treatment expansion options discharging into the San Diego/Tijuana Estuary\", \"Expansion of the San Francisco International Airport\", \"Development of the Houston, Metro Transportation system\", \"Expansion of the metropolitan Boston MBTA transit system\", and \"Construction of Interstate 66 through Arlington, Virginia\".\nIn England and Wales the Environment Agency (EA), formed in 1996, is a public body for protecting and improving the environment and enforces the regulations listed on the communities and local government site. (formerly the office of the deputy prime minister). The agency was set up under the Environment Act 1995 as an independent body and works closely with UK Government to enforce the regulations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most scholars today identify Bartholomew as Nathanael, who appears in the Gospel of John (1:45\u201351; cf. 21:2).\nNew Testament references.\nThe name \"Bartholomew\" (, transliterated \"Bartholomaios\") comes from the \"bar-Tolmay\" \"son of Tolmai\" or \"son of the furrows\". Bartholomew is listed in the New Testament among the Twelve Apostles of Jesus in the three Synoptic Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and in Acts of the Apostles.\nTradition.\nEusebius of Caesarea's \"Ecclesiastical History\" (5:10) states that after the Ascension, Bartholomew went on a missionary tour to India, where he left behind a copy of the Gospel of Matthew. Tradition narrates that he served as a missionary in Mesopotamia and Parthia, as well as Lycaonia and Ethiopia in other accounts.\nPopular traditions say that Bartholomew preached the Gospel in India and then went to Greater Armenia.\nMission to India.\nTwo ancient testimonies exist about the mission of Saint Bartholomew in India. These are by Eusebius of Caesarea (early 4th century) and by Saint Jerome (late 4th century). Both of these refer to this tradition while speaking of the reported visit of Saint Pantaenus to India in the 2nd century. The studies of Fr A.C. Perumalil SJ and Moraes hold that the Bombay region on the Konkan coast, a region which may also have been known as the ancient city Kalyan, was the field of Saint Bartholomew's missionary activities. Previously the consensus among scholars was at least skeptical about an apostolate of Saint Bartholomew in India. Stallings (1703), Neander (1853), Hunter (1886), Rae (1892), and Zaleski (1915) supported it, while scholars such as Sollerius (1669), Carpentier (1822), Harnack (1903), Medlycott (1905), Mingana (1926), Thurston (1933), Attwater (1935), etc. do not. The main argument is that the India that Eusebius and Jerome refer to should be identified as Ethiopia or Arabia Felix.\nIn Armenia.\nAlong with his fellow apostle Jude \"Thaddeus\", Bartholomew is reputed to have brought Christianity to Armenia in the 1st century; as a result, in 301 the Armenian kingdom became the first state in history to embrace Christianity officially. Thus, both saints are considered the patron saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church. According to these traditions, Bartholomew is the second Catholicos-Patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\nChristian tradition offers three accounts of Bartholomew's death: \"One speaks of his being kidnapped, beaten unconscious, and cast into the sea to drown.\"\nIn the Hellenic tradition, Bartholomew was executed in Albanopolis in Armenia, where he was martyred for having converted Polymius, the local king, to Christianity. Enraged by the monarch's conversion, and fearing a Roman backlash, King Polymius's brother, Prince Astyages, ordered Bartholomew's torture and execution. However, this version of the story appears ahistorical, as there are no records of any Armenian king of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia with the name \"Polymius\". Other accounts of his martyrdom name the king as either Agrippa (identified with Tigranes VI), or Sanatruk, king of Armenia.\nThe 13th-century Saint Bartholomew Monastery was a prominent Armenian monastery constructed at the presumed site of Bartholomew's martyrdom in Vaspurakan, Greater Armenia (now in southeastern Turkey).\nIn present-day Azerbaijan.\nAzerbaijani Christians hold the position that Apostle Bartholomew was the first person to bring Christianity to the lands of modern Azerbaijan and believe that he preached there. Saint Bartholomew Church (Baku) was built in 1892 with donations from the local Christian population on the site where the Apostle Bartholomew was believed to have been martyred. Azerbaijani Christians believe that in the area near the Maiden Tower, the apostle Bartholomew was crucified and killed by pagans around 71 AD. The church continued to operate until 1936, when it was demolished as a part of the Soviet campaign against religion.\nIn the Visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich.\nAccording to the \"Visions of the Apostles, Martyrs and Saints\" recorded by Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774\u20131824), Saint Bartholomew first preached the Christian faith in India, where he made numerous converts and left behind several disciples.\nEmmerich\u2019s account relates that the apostle journeyed eastward, passing through Japan before returning west by way of Arabia and the Red Sea to Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia). There, he is said to have converted King Polymius, raised a man from the dead, and silenced a local idol that had previously spoken to the people. When Bartholomew commanded the demon inhabiting the idol to reveal its deceptions, the spirit confessed that the supposed healings attributed to the idol were illusions meant to maintain idol worship among the populace.\nFollowing this event, the king and his household were baptized, and Bartholomew consecrated the former pagan temple to the worship of the true God. He then healed the sick and became widely loved by the people. However, priests of the old cult later accused him before Astyages, the king\u2019s brother, who ordered his arrest and torture. Emmerich describes Bartholomew\u2019s martyrdom by flaying, during which he continued to preach until his death. His followers are said to have recovered his body and buried it honorably, over which a church was later constructed.\nThe vision concludes with the conversion of Astyages, while the idol priests are depicted as dying miserably soon afterward. Emmerich also notes that some exegetes have erroneously identified Bartholomew with Nathanael; however, in her visions the two were distinct. Bartholomew (son of Tolmai, of the tribe of Naphtali) preached in India and Armenia, while Nathanael evangelized in Mauretania and Brittany, dying in Tr\u00e9guier, Brittany.\nVeneration.\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church honours Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thaddeus as its patron saints.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Bartholomew on June 11. Bartholomew is also venerated on August 25 in commemoration of the transfer of Bartholomew's relics. He is also venerated as one of the twelve apostles on June 30.\nIn the Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Bartholomew's martyrdom is commemorated on the first day of the Coptic calendar (i.e., the first day of the month of Thout), which currently falls on 11 September (corresponding to 29 August in the Julian calendar).\nHence, the Russian Orthodox Eparchy of Baku and Azerbaijan and Catholic Prefecture of Azerbaijan honour Saint Bartholomew as the Patron Saint of Azerbaijan and regard him as the bringer of Christianity to the region of Caucasian Albania, modern-day Azerbaijan. The feast day of the Apostle is solemnly celebrated there on 24 August by the Christian laity and the Church officials alike.\nIn the current Roman General Calendar Saint Bartholomew's feast occurs on 24 August.\nBartholomew the Apostle is remembered in the Church of England and all other Anglican churches with a Festival on 24 August.\nRelics.\nThe 6th-century writer Theodorus Lector asserted that in about 507, the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus gave the body of Bartholomew to the city of Daras, in Mesopotamia, which he had recently refounded. The existence of relics at Lipari, a small island off the coast of Sicily, in the part of Italy controlled from Constantinople, was explained by Gregory of Tours by his body having miraculously washed up there. A large piece of his skin and many bones that were kept in the Cathedral of St. Bartholomew in Lipari, were translated to Benevento in 838, where they are still kept in the Basilica San Bartolomeo. A portion of the relics was given in 983 by Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor, to Rome, where it is conserved at San Bartolomeo all'Isola, which was founded on the site of the temple of Asclepius, in pagan times an important Roman medical centre. This association with medicine caused Bartholomew's name to become associated in course of time with hospitals. A part of Bartholomew's alleged skull was transferred to the Frankfurt Cathedral, while an arm was venerated in Canterbury Cathedral.\nIn 2003, Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople brought some of the remains of St. Bartholomew to Baku as a gift to Azerbaijani Christians, and these remains are now kept in the Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral.\nSaint Bartholomew has been credited with several miracles.\nArt and literature.\nIn artistic depictions, Bartholomew is most commonly depicted holding his flayed skin and the knife with which he was skinned. Of this a well known example is featured in Michelangelo's \"Last Judgement\".\nNot rarely, Bartholomew is shown draping his own skin around his body. Moreover, representations of Bartholomew with a chained demon are common in Spanish painting.\nSt. Bartholomew is the most prominent flayed Christian martyr; During the 16th century, images of the flaying of Bartholomew were popular and this detail came to become a virtual constant of iconography. An echo of concentration on these details is found in medieval heraldry regarding Bartholomew, which depicts \"flaying knives with silver blades and gold handles, on a red field.\"\nSaint Bartholomew is often depicted in lavish medieval manuscripts. Bearing in mind that manuscripts are in fact made from flayed and manipulated skin, they hold a strong visual and cognitive association with the saint during the medieval period.\nFlorentine artist Pacino di Bonaguida, depicts his martyrdom in a complex and striking composition in his Laudario of Sant'Agnese, a book of Italian Hymns produced for the Compagnia di Sant'Agnese c.\u20091340. In the five-scene, narrative-based image, three torturers flay Bartholomew's legs and arms as he is immobilised and chained to a gate. On the right, the saint wears his own skin tied around his neck while he kneels in prayer before a rock, his severed head lying on the ground.\nA further depiction is that of the \"Flaying of St. Bartholomew\" in the Luttrell Psalter c.\u20091325\u20131340. There, Bartholomew is depicted lying on a surgical table, surrounded by tormentors while he is flayed with golden knives.\nDue to the nature of his martyrdom, Bartholomew is the patron saint of tanners, plasterers, tailors, leatherworkers, bookbinders, farmers, housepainters, butchers, and glove makers. In works of art the saint has been depicted being skinned by tanners, as in Guido da Siena's reliquary shutters with the \"Martyrdoms of St. Francis, St. Claire, St. Bartholomew, and St. Catherine of Alexandria\". Popular in Florence and other areas in Tuscany, the saint also came to be associated with salt, oil, and cheese merchants.\n\"The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew\" (1634) by Jusepe de Ribera depicts Bartholomew's final moments before being flayed alive. The viewer is meant to empathize with Bartholomew, whose body seemingly bursts through the surface of the canvas, and whose outstretched arms embrace a mystical light that illuminates his flesh. His piercing eyes, open mouth, and petitioning left hand bespeak an intense communion with the divine; yet this same hand draws our attention to the instruments of his torture, symbolically positioned in the shape of a cross. Transfixed by Bartholomew's active faith, the executioner seems to have stopped short in his actions, and his furrowed brow and partially illuminated face suggest a moment of doubt, with the possibility of conversion. The representation of Bartholomew's demise in the National Gallery painting differs significantly from all other depictions by Ribera. By limiting the number of participants to the main protagonists of the story (the saint, his executioner, one of the priests who condemned him, and one of the soldiers who captured him), and presenting them half-length and filling the picture space, the artist rejected an active, movemented composition for one of intense psychological drama. The cusping along all four edges shows that the painting has not been cut down: Ribera intended the composition to be just such a tight, restricted presentation, with the figures cut off and pressed together.\nAlthough Bartholomew's death is commonly depicted in artworks of a religious nature, his story has also been used to represent anatomical depictions of the human body devoid of flesh. An example of this can be seen in Marco d'Agrate's \"St Bartholomew Flayed\" (1562) where Bartholomew is depicted wrapped in his own skin with every muscle, vein and tendon clearly visible, acting as a clear description of the muscles and structure of the human body.\nThis idea has influenced some contemporary artists to create an artwork depicting an anatomical study of a human body is found amongst with Gunther Von Hagens's \"The Skin Man\" (2002) and Damien Hirst's \"Exquisite Pain\" (2006). Within Gunther Von Hagens's body of work called \"Body Worlds\" a figure reminiscent of Bartholomew holds up his skin. This figure is depicted in actual human tissues (made possible by Hagens's plastination process) to educate the public about the inner workings of the human body and to show the effects of healthy and unhealthy lifestyles. In \"Exquisite Pain\" 2006, Damien Hirst depicts St Bartholomew with a high level of anatomical detail with his flayed skin draped over his right arm, a scalpel in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other. The inclusion of scissors was inspired by Tim Burton's film \"Edward Scissorhands\" (1990).\nBartholomew plays a part in Francis Bacon's Utopian tale \"New Atlantis\", about a mythical isolated land, Bensalem, populated by a people dedicated to reason and natural philosophy. Some twenty years after the ascension of Christ the people of Bensalem find an ark floating off their shore. The ark contains a letter as well as the books of the Old and New Testaments. The letter is from Bartholomew the Apostle and declares that an angel told him to set the ark and its contents afloat. Thus the scientists of Bensalem receive the revelation of the Word of God.\nCulture.\nThe festival in August has been a traditional occasion for markets and fairs, such as the Bartholomew Fair which was held in Smithfield, London, from the Middle Ages, and which served as the scene for Ben Jonson's 1614 homonymous comedy.\nSt Bartholomew's Street Fair is held in Crewkerne, Somerset, annually at the start of September. The fair dates back to Saxon times and the major traders' market was recorded in the Domesday Book. St Bartholomew's Street Fair, Crewkerne is reputed to have been granted its charter in the time of Henry III (1207\u20131272). The earliest surviving court record was made in 1280, which can be found in the British Library.\nIn Islam.\nThe Qur'anic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more or less agrees with the New Testament list and holds that the disciples included Peter, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Andrew, James, Jude, James the Less, John and Simon the Zealot.\nQuoting Ibn Ishaq, the Andalusian scholar al-Qurtubi gives the following details concerning the mission of the disciples of Jesus Christ: He sent Peter and Paul to the Roman lands; Andrew and Matthew to Cannibals; Thomas to Babylon; Philip to Africa; John to Damascus the town of the seven-sleeper; Jacob to Jerusalem; Ibn Talma (i.e., Bartholomew) to the Arab world; Simon to the Berbers; Yehuda and Bard to Alexandria. Allah aided them with points of right argument and they prevailed.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the pet greyhound of the Simpson family. He was previously voiced by Frank Welker, and is currently voiced by Dan Castellaneta. The dog was introduced in the first episode of the show, the 1989 Christmas special \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\", in which his owner abandons him for finishing last in a greyhound race. Homer Simpson and his son Bart, who are at the race track in hope of winning some money for Christmas presents, see this and decide to adopt the dog.\nSanta's Little Helper has since appeared frequently on \"The Simpsons\", and is the center of the plots of several episodes. During the course of the show, he has fathered litters of puppies, passed obedience school, had surgery for bloat, replaced Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer, and been trained as a police dog at Springfield's Animal Police Academy. Some of the episodes that focus on Santa's Little Helper have been inspired by popular culture or real experiences that staff members of the show have gone through.\nAlthough most cartoon animals are often humanized, Santa's Little Helper generally exhibits canine behavior. Santa's Little Helper has become a popular character following his appearances on \"The Simpsons\". He ranked 27th in Animal Planet's 2003 television special \"50 Greatest TV Animals\" that was based on popularity, name recognition, and the longevity of the shows. He has also been featured in merchandise relating to \"The Simpsons\", such as video games, board games, and comics.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nSanta's Little Helper is a greyhound dog that appears on the animated television sitcom series \"The Simpsons\" and is the pet dog of the Simpson family. He can often be seen on the show in minor appearances, although there have been some episodes that feature him heavily, including the first episode of \"The Simpsons\". In that episode, \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" (season one, 1989), Homer discovers that he has no money to buy Christmas presents for the family. Desperate for a miracle, he and Bart go to the greyhound racing track on Christmas Eve in hopes of winning some money. Although Homer has inside information on which dog is the most likely to win, he instead bets on a last-minute entry, Santa's Little Helper (here despite being brown), believing the dog's Christmas-inspired name to be a sign. However, the greyhound finishes last. As Homer and Bart leave the track, they watch the dog's owner abandon him for losing the race. Bart pleads with Homer to keep the dog as a pet and he agrees after it affectionately licks him on the cheek. When Bart and Homer return home, Santa's Little Helper is assumed by the rest of the family to be a Christmas present. Years later, the family would find breeder and trainer Les Moore and reunite their pet with his mother She-Biscuit.\nIn various episodes, Santa's Little Helper can be seen chewing on newspapers and other objects in the Simpsons' household, destroying furniture, and digging holes in the backyard. In \"Bart's Dog Gets an \"F\"\" (season two, 1991), he manages to infuriate the entire family by destroying valued items in the home. As a result, Homer and Marge want to get rid of the dog, but Bart and Lisa convince them that he can be trained at an obedience school. Santa's Little Helper does not do well there as Bart is unwilling to use a choke chain suggested by the instructor. The night before the final exam, Bart and Santa's Little Helper play, thinking it will be their last few hours together. This bonding breaks down the communication barrier, allowing the dog to understand Bart's commands, and consequently pass the obedience school.\nSanta's Little Helper has fathered several puppies. In \"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\" (season six, episode twenty, 1995), he runs away to the dog racing track where he mates with a female hound named She's the Fastest. She later gives birth to 25 puppies and when the Simpsons cannot take care of them any longer, they decide to sell them; however, Mr. Burns steals the puppies and decides to make a tuxedo out of them. Before he does this, however, he becomes emotionally touched by them. This convinces him to never wear fur again and instead raise the puppies to be world-class racing dogs. Santa's Little Helper sires another litter of puppies with Dr. Hibbert's poodle in the episode \"Today I Am a Clown\" (season 15, 2003). These puppies are given away to townspeople.\nThe dog has been neglected or treated unfavorably by the family in some episodes. In \"Dog of Death\" (season three, 1992), he nearly dies of bloat and they decide to make budget cuts in order to pay for the required operation. Although the dog's life is saved, the family begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices and starts treating him badly, causing him to run away. He ends up in the possession of Mr. Burns, who trains him to become a vicious attack dog. Several days later, Bart stumbles upon the trained Santa's Little Helper and is attacked, but the greyhound eventually recognizes his old friend and stops. In \"The Canine Mutiny\" (season eight, 1997), Bart uses a fake charge card to buy a well-trained rough collie named Laddie from a mail-order catalog. Laddie learns many tricks that Santa's Little Helper is completely unable to perform, and the Simpson family nearly forgets about their old pet. Bart eventually gives Santa's Little Helper away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tries to get him back. When he finally finds him, Santa's Little Helper is serving as a seeing-eye dog for a blind man, but eventually decides to return to the family.\nIn \"Stop or My Dog Will Shoot\" (season 18, 2007), Santa's Little Helper becomes a local hero after finding a lost Homer, and the Simpsons decide to enroll him in the Animal Police Academy. However, his new crime-fighting job makes him jaded and one day at home he bites Bart. The Simpsons must therefore send the dog away to live with officer Lou. However, he gets to return after saving Bart from a toxic smoke cloud at school and then leaving the police force. In \"How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?\" (season 22, 2010), after Santa's Little Helper devours a pigeon with a broken leg that Bart was nursing, Bart gets mad at the dog and is unable to forgive him. The Simpsons therefore give him away to an ostrich farm. There, Bart says goodbye to him and explains that he should never, ever devour a bird. Bart then gets into a fight with an angry ostrich. After remembering that he was told that it's wrong to kill birds, he ceases to aid Bart in the fight, confused at his own loyalty (for Bart's sake or his orders) leaving Bart to strangle the ostrich. Bart then realizes that he could not help killing the pigeon and apologizes. Afterwards, the family goes back home with the dog.\nThe dog once replaced Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer in the episode \"Old Yeller Belly\" (season 14, 2003), after he was seen drinking from a can of beer by balancing it on his nose. He becomes known as Suds McDuff and boosts sales of Duff Beer, making the family's fortunes explode. However, this prompts his original sleazy owner and racing trainer to visit the Simpsons and prove that he's the owner of the dog. The family later figures that if they can get Duffman to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, they can get their dog back. They plan to turn Duffman into a hero at a Duff Beer-sponsored beach volleyball event; however, their plan fails and a drunk shark that's discovered at the event becomes the new mascot instead. Santa's Little Helper gladly returns to the Simpson family.\nCreation and development.\nSanta's Little Helper's initial appearance on \"The Simpsons\" was in the first episode of the series, \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\", which aired on December 17, 1989. Since then, he has become a recurring character. \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening told \"TV Guide\" in 2000 that \"we [the staff] painted ourselves into a corner with our Christmas episode. Once we wrote the dog into the show, we were stuck with him.\" The name \"Santa's Little Helper\" was chosen because, according to writer Al Jean in the same \"TV Guide\" article, \"we needed a name that would inspire Homer to bet on him, an omen, a Christmas name since he was betting on Christmas Eve. But, at that point, nobody was thinking long-term. We weren't considering what might happen in ten years, when we've got to use this name.\" Although \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" was the first episode of the series to air on TV, it was the eighth episode produced by the staff. It was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with the others. Jean told the \"Houston Chronicle\" in 2001 that after the first episode was broadcast and \"the next seven didn't have the dog, people wondered why.\" He also said in 2003 that the staff enjoyed the first episodes that centered on him, particularly \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\", which is the reason that more episodes about him were written.\nWriter John Swartzwelder has noted that the staff members of the show write the character Homer in the same way that they write Santa's Little Helper: \"Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food.\" Although animals in cartoons often behave with \"semi-human awareness\", Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode \"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\" that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly the way they do in real life. As a result, Santa's Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show. There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, but most of the time the staff of \"The Simpsons\" tries to keep animals acting realistically. Several journalists have commented on the greyhound's lack of intelligence. In an article that compared \"The Simpsons\" to the animated series \"Family Guy\", Todd Camp of the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" noted that \"though Santa's Little Helper may be the only Simpson who's dumber than Homer, the Griffins' pooch [Brian Griffin] is the brainiest member of the household\". In 1991, Copley News Service's Alison Ashton described Santa's Little Helper as a \"sweet and stupid dog\". Tom Coombe of \"The Morning Call\" wrote in 2002 that \"fans of \"The Simpsons\" will tell you that the cartoon family's dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish. Fans of the real-life breed will paint a different picture \u2014 of dogs that are peaceful, affectionate, [and] not given to drooling, panting\".\nSome ideas for episodes featuring Santa's Little Helper come from reality. The plot of \"Dog of Death\" was based on Swartzwelder's experiences with his own dog, which had also suffered from bloat. However, unlike the events in the episode, Swartzwelder's dog did not receive treatment as the operation was too expensive and the dog was too old. \"The Gold Coast Bulletin\"'s Ryan Ellem commented in 2005 that the Simpson family's dilemma with the cost of the veterinary procedure is a realistic dilemma faced by many families who own dogs. Other episode ideas come from popular culture. For example, Santa's Little Helper fathering 25 puppies in \"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\" is a parody of the Disney film \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\", and Mr. Burns' technique of brainwashing him into an attack dog in \"Dog of Death\" parodies \"A Clockwork Orange\". Susan McHugh, who teaches theories of animals, literature, and culture at the University of New England, wrote in her 2004 book \"Dog\" that, \"remaining loyal to his unlikely saviours, the boy Bart and his father Homer, this greyhound has prompted satires of contemporary dog culture, from Barbara Woodhouse's authoritarian training methods [in \"Bart's Dog Gets an 'F'\"] to Lassie's flawless service to the status quo [in \"The Canine Mutiny\"].\"\nSounds.\nAlthough cast member Dan Castellaneta occasionally voiced Santa's Little Helper for bit parts, American voice artist Frank Welker most often provided the sounds of the dog and other animals on the show from \"Bart's Dog Gets an 'F'\", which aired on March 7, 1991, to \"Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily\", which aired on October 1, 1995. He said on his official website in 2007 that he liked portraying Santa's Little Helper because the dog was a \"sympathetic\" character. Welker has been praised by staff members for his performances on the show. David Mirkin has noted that \"he can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you're listening to a guy, and he's a pleasure to work with.\" Groening has commented that he was \"unbelievably good\" at doing animal noises. After 1995, Castellaneta voiced Santa's Little Helper on his own while Welker performed other animal noises until his full departure in 2002, when he was denied a pay raise. In the \"questions and answers\" section on his website, Welker revealed that the reason he stopped performing as Santa's Little Helper was because \"The producers thought... 'Hmmm, Dan barks pretty good, and we are already paying him and he seems to like doing the dog thing... why do we need to pay Welker who comes in here, spends less than an hour, eats all the doughnuts, refuses to come to rehearsals... let's just give the damn dog to Dan!'\"\nReception.\nSanta's Little Helper has become a well-known dog because of his appearances in the series. A writer for \"The Grand Rapids Press\" wrote in 2002 that \"we all know who Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie are\u2014heck, most Americans probably recognize their pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II\". McHugh wrote in \"Dog\" that while Master McGrath was the most famous greyhound of the 19th century, \"the most popular greyhound a hundred years later\" is Santa's Little Helper. In the television special \"50 Greatest TV Animals\" that was hosted by Mario Lopez and aired on Animal Planet in 2003, the dog ranked 27th. Other dogs featured on the list were Lassie (first), Eddie (fifth), Snoopy (sixth), Scooby-Doo (13th), Rin Tin Tin (14th), Max (20th), Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (24th), Buck (29th), Chipper (44th), and Tiger (50th). According to a writer for McClatchy News Service, the rankings were \"determined by popularity, name recognition and how long the show lasted.\"\nAmong fans and critics, Santa's Little Helper has been mostly well received. He ranked seventh in a 2008 poll by \"Dog Whisperer\"'s Cesar Millan that determined the \"best-loved television dog of all time.\" Lassie ranked first in the poll. In addition, he was voted the tenth favorite \"Simpsons\" character by readers of \"Simpsons Comics\" in the United Kingdom in 2010. In a list of their top twelve favorite dogs from cartoons, comics, and animation, writers for \"The Tampa Tribune\" listed Santa's Little Helper at number six, writing: \"We admire his upbeat nature even after having his legs broken by Mr. Burns and being abandoned by Bart for another dog, Laddie.\" He also ranked 75th on Retrocrush author Robert Berry's list of \"The 100 Greatest Dogs of Pop Culture History\" in 2006. The character has attracted some criticism too, though. While reviewing the episode \"Bart's Dog Gets an 'F'\" in 2010, Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote:\n\"As cartoon dogs go, Santa\u2019s Little Helper is spectacularly unspectacular. In a realm of aggressively anthropomorphic canines, some of whom, admittedly, have strong speech impediments, he doesn\u2019t talk or wisecrack or engage in shenanigans. His abilities and powers begin and end with masticating, defecating, and regular napping. You know, just like a real dog. Consequently, episodes devoted to Santa\u2019s Little Helper tend to be a little on the sleepy side, even the \"Simpsons\" Christmas special that launched the series.\"\nIn 2022, \"Yard Barker\" named Santa's Little Helper as 12th most memorable TV pets.\nInfluence.\nSince his first appearance on \"The Simpsons\", Santa's Little Helper has appeared in merchandise relating to the show. On the board art of \"The Simpsons Clue\", a 2000 board game by USAopoly based on \"Clue\", he is shown drinking Duff Beer that has been spilled on the floor. In another board game published by USAopoly called \"The Simpsons Monopoly\", based on \"Monopoly\" and released in 2001, the dog is featured as one of the six pewter playing pieces. Santa's Little Helper has also appeared in issues of \"Simpsons Comics\", in the 2007 film \"The Simpsons Movie\", and in video games based on \"The Simpsons\" such as \"Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror\" and \"The Simpsons Game\". In addition, the dog has been made into action figures by McFarlane Toys, action figures by Playmates Toys in the World of Springfield series, and plush toys. In the Springfield section surrounding The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood, one carnival game is themed as \"Help Santa's Little Helper\".\nSanta's Little Helper has made an impact on real life in that an espresso-based drink has been named after him at the award-winning restaurant and bar Bambara in Salt Lake City's Hotel Monaco. Bartender Ethan Moore told \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" in 2004 that it is \"one of the most popular holiday drinks\" at Bambara. In addition, a dog walking and pet sitting company in New York City, called \"Santa's Little Helper Dog Walking and Pet Sitting\", has been named after him. The greyhound has also appeared by himself on the cover of the October 16, 2000 issue of \"TV Guide\". This issue was released with 24 different covers, all featuring different characters from \"The Simpsons\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Danelaw originated in the conquest and occupation of large parts of eastern and northern England by Danish Vikings in the late ninth century. The term applies to the areas in which English kings allowed the Danes to keep their own laws following the early tenth-century Anglo-Saxon conquest of Danish ruled eastern and northern England in return for the Danish settlers' loyalty to the English crown. \"Danelaw\" is first recorded in the early 11th century as \"Dena lage\". \nThe Danelaw originated from the invasion of the Great Heathen Army into England in 865, but the term was not used to describe a geographic area until the 11th century. With the increase in population and productivity in Scandinavia, Viking warriors, having sought treasure and glory in the nearby British Isles, \"proceeded to plough and support themselves\", in the words of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" for 876.\nThe Danelaw can describe the set of legal terms and definitions created in the treaties between Alfred the Great, the king of Wessex, and Guthrum, the Danish warlord, written following Guthrum's defeat at the Battle of Edington in 878, starting with the Treaty of Wedmore.\nBetween the aftermath of the Treaty of Wedmore and Guthrum's death in 890, the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum was formalised, defining the boundaries of their kingdoms, with provisions for peaceful relations between the Danes and the Anglo-Saxons, including allowing the self-governance of the Danes in exchange of loyalty to England. The language spoken in England was affected by this clash of cultures, with the emergence of Anglo-Norse dialects.\nThe Danelaw approximately covered Yorkshire, the central and eastern Midlands, and the East of England.\nBackground.\nScandinavian York.\nFrom around 800, there had been waves of Norse raids on the coastlines of Britain and Ireland. In 865, instead of raiding, the Danes landed a large army in East Anglia, with the intention of conquering the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England. The armies of various Danish leaders had collaborated to make one combined force under a leadership that included Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, the sons of the legendary Viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok. The combined army was described in the annals as the Great Heathen Army. In 867 they captured Northumbria and its capital, York (\"J\u00f3rv\u00edk\"), defeating both the recently deposed King Osberht of Northumbria and the usurper \u00c6lla of Northumbria. The Danes then placed an Englishman, Ecgberht I of Northumbria, on the throne of Northumbria as a puppet ruler.\nKing \u00c6thelred of Wessex and his brother, Alfred, led their army against the Danes at Nottingham, but the Danes refused to leave their fortifications. King Burgred of Mercia negotiated peace with Ivar, with the Danes keeping Nottingham in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia alone.\nUnder Ivar the Boneless, the Danes continued their invasion in 869 by defeating King Edmund of East Anglia at Hoxne and conquering the Kingdom of East Anglia. Once again, the brothers \u00c6thelred and Alfred attempted to stop Ivar by attacking the Danes at Reading. They were repelled with heavy losses. The Danes pursued, and on 7 January 871, \u00c6thelred and Alfred defeated the Danes at the Battle of Ashdown. The Danes retreated to Basing (in Hampshire), where \u00c6thelred attacked and was, in turn, defeated. Ivar was able to follow up this victory with another in March at Meretum (now Marton, Wiltshire).\nOn 23 April 871, King \u00c6thelred died and Alfred succeeded him as King of Wessex. His army was weak and he was forced to pay tribute to Ivar in order to make peace with the Danes. During this peace, the Danes turned to the north and attacked Mercia, a campaign that lasted until 874. The Danish leader Ivar died during this campaign. Ivar was succeeded by Guthrum, who finished the campaign against Mercia. In ten years, the Danes had gained control over East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, leaving just Wessex resisting.\nGuthrum and the Danes brokered peace with Wessex in 876, when they captured the fortresses of Wareham and Exeter. Alfred laid siege to the Danes, who were forced to surrender after reinforcements were lost in a storm. Two years later, Guthrum again attacked Alfred, surprising him by attacking his forces wintering in Chippenham. King Alfred was saved when the Danish army coming from his rear was destroyed by inferior forces at the Battle of Cynuit. The modern location of \"Cynuit\" is disputed but suggestions include Countisbury Hill, near Lynmouth, Devon, or Kenwith Castle, Bideford, Devon, or Cannington, near Bridgwater, Somerset. Alfred was forced into hiding for a time, before returning in early 878 to gather an army and attack Guthrum at Edington. The Danes were defeated and retreated to Chippenham, where King Alfred laid siege and soon forced them to surrender. As a term of surrender, King Alfred demanded that Guthrum be baptised a Christian; King Alfred served as his godfather.\nEdward the Elder and his sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, the Lady of the Mercians, conquered Danish territories in the Midlands and East Anglia in a series of campaigns in the 910s, and some Danish jarls who submitted were allowed to keep their lands. Viking rule ended when Eric Bloodaxe was driven out of Northumbria in 954.\nThe reasons for the waves of immigration were complex and bound to the political situation in Scandinavia at that time; they occurred when Viking settlers were also establishing their presence in the Hebrides, Isle of Man, Orkney, Shetland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, L'Anse aux Meadows, France (Normandy), the Baltics, Russia and Ukraine (see Kievan Rus').\nCnut and his successors.\nThe Danes did not give up their designs on England. From 1016 to 1035, Cnut the Great ruled over a unified English kingdom, itself the product of a resurgent Wessex, as part of his North Sea Empire, together with Denmark, Norway and part of Sweden. Cnut was succeeded in England on his death by his son Harold Harefoot, until he died in 1040, after which another of Cnut's sons, Harthacnut, took the throne. Since Harthacnut was already on the Danish throne, this reunited the North Sea Empire. Harthacnut lived only another two years, and from his death in 1042 until 1066 the monarchy reverted to the English line in the form of Edward the Confessor.\nEdward died in January 1066 without an obvious successor, and an English nobleman, Harold Godwinson, took the throne. Later that year, two rival claimants to the throne led invasions of England in short succession. First, Harald Hardrada of Norway took York in September, but was defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, in Yorkshire. Then, three weeks later, William of Normandy defeated Harold at the Battle of Hastings, in Sussex, and in December he accepted the submission of Edgar the \u00c6theling, last in the line of Anglo-Saxon royal succession, at Berkhamsted.\nThe Danelaw appeared in legislation as late as the early 12th century with the \"Leges Henrici Primi\", where it is referred to as one of the laws together with those of Wessex and Mercia into which England was divided.\nChronology.\n793 \u2212 Viking raid on Lindisfarne\n800 \u2212 Waves of Danish assaults on the coastlines of the British Isles.\n865 \u2212 Danish raiders first began to settle in England. Led by the brothers Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless, they wintered in East Anglia, where they demanded and received tribute in exchange for a temporary peace. From there, they moved north and attacked Northumbria, which was in the midst of a civil war between the deposed king Osberht and a usurper \u00c6lla. The Danes used the civil turmoil as an opportunity to capture York, which they sacked and burned.\n867 \u2212 Following the loss of York, Osberht and \u00c6lla formed an alliance against the Danes. They launched a counter-attack, but the Danes killed both Osberht and \u00c6lla and set up a puppet king on the Northumbrian throne. In response, King \u00c6thelred of Wessex, along with his brother Alfred, marched against the Danes, who were positioned behind fortifications in Nottingham, but were unable to draw them into battle. In order to effect peace, King Burgred of Mercia ceded Nottingham to the Danes in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia undisturbed.\n868 \u2212 Danes captured Nottingham.\n869 \u2212 Ivar the Boneless returned and demanded tribute from King Edmund of East Anglia.\n870 \u2212 King Edmund refused Ivar's demand. Ivar defeated and captured Edmund at Hoxne, adding East Anglia to the area controlled by the invading Danes. King \u00c6thelred and Alfred attacked the Danes at Reading, but were repulsed with heavy losses. The Danes pursued them.\n871 \u2212 On 7 January, \u00c6thelred and Alfred made their stand at Ashdown (on what is the Berkshire/North Wessex Downs now in Oxfordshire). \u00c6thelred could not be found at the start of battle, as he was busy praying in his tent, so Alfred led the army into battle. \u00c6thelred and Alfred defeated the Danes, who counted among their losses five jarls (nobles). The Danes retreated and set up fortifications at Basing (Basingstoke) in Hampshire, a mere from Reading. \u00c6thelred attacked the Danish fortifications and was routed. The Danes followed up with another victory in March at Meretum (now Marton, Wiltshire).\nKing \u00c6thelred died on 23 April 871 and Alfred took the throne of Wessex. For the rest of the year Alfred concentrated on attacking with small bands against isolated groups of Danes. He was moderately successful in this endeavour and was able to score minor victories against the Danes, but his army was on the verge of collapse. Alfred responded by paying off the Danes for a promise of peace. During the peace, the Danes turned north and attacked Mercia, which they finished off in short order, and captured London in the process. King Burgred of Mercia fought in vain against Ivar the Boneless and his Danish invaders for three years until 874, when he fled to Europe. During Ivar's campaign against Mercia, he died and was succeeded by Guthrum the Old. Guthrum quickly defeated Burgred and placed a puppet on the throne of Mercia. The Danes now controlled East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, with only Wessex continuing to resist.\n875 \u2212 The Danes settled in Dorset, well inside Alfred's Kingdom of Wessex, but Alfred quickly made peace with them.\n876 \u2212 The Danes broke the peace when they captured the fortress of Wareham, followed by a similar capture of Exeter in 877.\n877 \u2212 Alfred laid in a siege, while the Danes waited for reinforcements from Scandinavia. Unfortunately for the Danes, the fleet of reinforcements encountered a storm and lost more than 100 ships, and the Danes were forced to return to East Mercia in the north.\n878 \u2212 In January, Guthrum led an attack against Wessex that sought to capture Alfred while he wintered in Chippenham. Another Danish army landed in south Wales arrived and moved south with the intent of intercepting Alfred should he flee from Guthrum's forces. However, they stopped during their march to capture a small fortress at Countisbury Hill, held by a Wessex ealdorman named Odda. The Saxons, led by Odda, attacked the Danes while they slept and defeated their superior forces, saving Alfred from being trapped between the two armies. Alfred was forced to go into hiding for the rest of the winter and spring of 878 in the Somerset marshes in order to avoid the superior Danish forces. In the spring, Alfred was able to gather an army and attacked Guthrum and the Danes at Edington. The Danes were defeated and retreated to Chippenham, where the English pursued and laid siege to Guthrum's forces. The Danes were unable to hold out without relief and soon surrendered. Alfred demanded, as a term of the surrender, that Guthrum become baptised as a Christian, which Guthrum agreed to do, with Alfred acting as his godfather. Guthrum was true to his word and settled in East Anglia, at least for a while.\nBetween 886 and 890, \u2212 The Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum formally comes into action, establishing the boundaries of the Danelaw and allowed for Danish self-rule in the region.\n902 \u2212 Essex submitted to \u00c6thelwald.\n903 \u2212 \u00c6thelwald incited the East Anglian Danes into breaking the peace. They ravaged Mercia before winning a pyrrhic victory that saw the death of \u00c6thelwald and the Danish King Eohric; this allowed Edward the Elder to consolidate power.\n911 \u2212 The English defeated the Danes at the Battle of Tettenhall. The Northumbrians ravaged Mercia but were trapped by Edward and forced to fight.\n917 \u2212 In return for peace and protection, the Kingdoms of Essex and East Anglia accepted Edward the Elder as their suzerain overlord.\n\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, Lady of the Mercians, took the borough of Derby.\n918 \u2212 The borough of Leicester submitted peaceably to \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's rule. The people of York promised to accept her as their overlord, but she died before this could come to fruition. She was succeeded by her brother, the Kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex united in the person of King Edward.\n919 \u2212 Norwegian Vikings under King Ragnvald Sygtryggsson of Dublin took York.\n920 \u2212 Edward was accepted as father and lord by the King of the Scots, by R\u00e6gnold, the sons of Eadulf, the English, Norwegians, Danes and others all of whom dwelt in Northumbria and the King and people of the Strathclyde Welsh.\n954 \u2212 King Eric was driven out of Northumbria, his death marking the end of the prospect of a Northern Viking Kingdom stretching from York to Dublin and the Isles.\n1002 \u2013 St. Brice's Day massacre of the Danes\n1066 \u2212 Harald Hardrada landed with an army, hoping to take control of York and the English crown. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. This event is often cited as the end of the Viking era. The same year, William the Conqueror, himself a descendant of Vikings, successfully took the English throne and became the first Norman king of England.\n1069 \u2212 Sweyn II of Denmark landed with an army, in much the same way as Harald Hardrada. He took control of York after defeating the Norman garrison and inciting a local uprising. King William eventually defeated his forces and devastated the region in the Harrying of the North.\n1075 \u2212 One of Sweyn's sons, Cnut, set sail for England to support an English rebellion, but it had been crushed before he arrived, so he settled for plundering the city of York and surrounding area, before returning home.\n1085 \u2212 Cnut, now king, assembled a fleet for a major invasion against England. Informed of his planned crossing, William hurried back to England to prepare a defence, but internal threats forced Cnut to cancel his plan. Other than Eystein II of Norway taking advantage of the civil war during Stephen's reign, to plunder the east coast of England,\u00a0there were no serious invasions or raids of England by the Danes after this.\nGeography.\nThe area occupied by the Danelaw was roughly the area to the north of a line drawn between London and Chester, excluding the portion of Northumbria to the east of the Pennines. \nFive fortified towns became particularly important in the Danelaw: Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Stamford and Lincoln, broadly delineating the area now called the East Midlands. These strongholds became known as the \"Five Boroughs\". \"Borough\" derives from the Old English word (cognate with German , meaning castle), meaning a fortified and walled enclosure containing several households, anything from a large stockade to a fortified town. The meaning has since developed further.\nLegal concepts.\nThe Danelaw was an important factor in the establishment of a civilian peace in the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon and Viking communities. It established, for example, equivalences in areas of legal contentiousness, such as the amount of reparation that should be payable in \"wergild\".\nMany of the legalistic concepts were compatible; for example, the Viking \"wapentake\", the standard for land division in the Danelaw, was effectively interchangeable with the hundred. The use of the execution site and cemetery at Walkington Wold in east Yorkshire suggests a continuity of judicial practice.\nUnder the Danelaw, between 30% and 50% of the population in the countryside had the legal status of 'sokeman', occupying an intermediate position between the free tenants and the bond tenants. This tended to provide more autonomy for the peasants. A sokeman was a free man within the lord's \"soke\", or jurisdiction.\nAccording to many scholars, \"... the Danelaw was an especially 'free' area of Britain because the rank and file of the Danish armies, from whom sokemen were descended, had settled in the area and imported their own social system.\"\nLegacy.\nThe influence of this period of Scandinavian settlement can still be seen in the North of England and the East Midlands, and is particularly evident in place-names, endings such as \"-howe\", \"-by\" (meaning \"village\") or \"-thorp\" (\"hamlet\") having Old Norse origins. There seems to be a remarkable number of \"Kirby/Kirkby\" names, thought to stem from Old Norse \"kirk\" (\"church\", compare for church) and -\"by\" (\"village\"), some with remains of Anglo-Saxon buildings, indicating both a Norse origin and early church building.\nOld East Norse and Old English were still somewhat mutually comprehensible. The contact between these languages in the Danelaw caused the incorporation of many Norse words into the English language, including the word law itself, \"sky\" and \"window,\" and the third person pronouns \"they\", \"them\" and \"their\". Many Old Norse words still survive in the dialects of Northern England. Contact with Old Norse is also understood to have encouraged or accelerated the reduction of the Old English inflectional system and the transition to the more analytic grammar of Middle and Modern English.\nFour of the five boroughs became county towns\u2014of the counties of Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Stamford failed to gain such status\u2014perhaps because of the nearby autonomous territory of Rutland.\nGenetic heritage.\nIn 2000, the BBC commissioned a genetic survey of the British Isles by a team from University College London led by Professor David Goldstein for its programme 'Blood of the Vikings'. It concluded that Norse (Norwegian) invaders settled sporadically throughout the British Isles with a particular concentration in certain areas, such as Orkney and Shetland. The study did not set out to genetically distinguish descendants of Danish Vikings from descendants of Anglo-Saxon settlers. That was decided on the basis that the latter two groups originated from areas that overlap each other on the continental North Sea coast (ranging from the Jutland Peninsula to Belgium) and were therefore considered too difficult to genetically distinguish. A 10-year genetic study published in 2020 found evidence of a major influx of Danish settlers into England during the Viking period.\nArchaeology.\nMajor archaeological sites that bear testimony to the Danelaw are few. The most famous is the site at York. Another Danelaw site is the cremation site at Heath Wood, Ingleby, Derbyshire.\nArchaeological sites do not bear out the historically defined area as being a real demographic or trade boundary. This could be due to misallocation of the items and features on which this judgement is based as being indicative of either Anglo-Saxon or Norse presence. Otherwise, it could indicate that there was considerable population movement between the areas, or simply that after the treaty was made, it was ignored by one or both sides.\nThynghowe was an important Danelaw meeting place, today located in Sherwood Forest, in Nottinghamshire. The word \"howe\" often indicates a prehistoric burial mound. Howe is derived from the Old Norse word meaning mound. The site's rediscovery was made by Lynda Mallett, Stuart Reddish and John Wood. The site had vanished from modern maps and was essentially lost to history until the local history enthusiasts made their discoveries. Experts think the rediscovered site, which lies amidst the old oaks of an area known as the Birklands in Sherwood Forest, may also yield clues as to the boundary of the ancient Anglo Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. English Heritage recently inspected the site and believes it is a national rarity. Thynghowe was a place where people came to resolve disputes and settle issues. It is a Norse word, although the site may be older still, perhaps even from the Bronze Age.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64951", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64951", "title": "Berkshire", "text": "County of England\nBerkshire ( ; abbreviated Berks.), officially the Royal County of Berkshire, is a ceremonial county in South East England. It is bordered by Oxfordshire to the north, Buckinghamshire to the north-east, Greater London to the east, Surrey to the south-east, Hampshire to the south, and Wiltshire to the west. Reading is the largest settlement and the county town.\nThe county has an area of and a population of 911,403. The population is concentrated in the east, the area closest to Greater London, which includes the county's largest towns: Reading (174,224), Slough (164,793), Bracknell (113,205), and Maidenhead (70,374). The west is rural, and its largest town is Newbury (33,841). For local government purposes Berkshire comprises six unitary authority areas: Bracknell Forest, Reading, Slough, West Berkshire, Windsor and Maidenhead, and Wokingham. The historic county included the parts of Oxfordshire south of the River Thames, which formed its northern border, but excluded Caversham and Slough.\nThe Berkshire Downs, a chalk downland and area of outstanding natural beauty, occupy the west of the county. They are the source of the River Kennet, which flows east through Newbury before meeting the Thames at Reading. The Thames then forms Berkshire's northern border, flowing past Maidenhead, before entering the county and flowing past Slough and Windsor. The south-east of the county contains Swinley Forest, a remnant of Windsor Forest now used as a forestry plantation.\nThere is evidence of prehistoric settlement on the Berkshire Downs, including the Iron Age Uffington White Horse, now in Oxfordshire. In the Anglo-Saxon period the region was contested by Mercia and Wessex, and Alfred the Great was born in Wantage, also now in Oxfordshire. Windsor Castle, which would become the official country residence of the British monarch, was built after the Norman Conquest. The county has been the site of several battles, particularly during the First English Civil War, when Reading and Wallingford were besieged two battles took place at Newbury, in 1643 and 1644. The proximity of the east of the county to London led to development from the nineteenth century, when Slough became an industrial centre and Bracknell was designated a new town. Software development and high-tech industry dominate the economy in the east, but the west remains an agricultural region.\nHistory.\nAccording to Asser's biography of King Alfred, written in 893 AD, Berkshire takes its name from a wood of box trees, which was called \"Bearroc\" (a Celtic word meaning \"hilly\"). This wood, perhaps no longer extant, was west of Frilsham, near Newbury.\nMuch of the county's early history is recorded in the \"Chronicles\" of the Abingdon Abbey, which at the time of the survey was second only to the crown in the extent and number of its possessions, such as The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay. The abbot exercised considerable judicial and administrative powers, and his court was endowed with the privileges of the hundred court and freed from liability to interference by the sheriff. Berkshire and Oxfordshire had a common sheriff until the reign of Elizabeth I, and the shire court was held at Grandpont. The assizes were formerly held at Reading, Abingdon, and Newbury, but by 1911 were held entirely at Reading.\nBerkshire has been the scene of notable battles. Alfred the Great's campaign against the Danes included the battles of Englefield, Ashdown and Reading. Newbury was the site of English Civil War battles: the First Battle of Newbury, at Wash Common in 1643, and the Second Battle of Newbury, at Speen in 1644. Donnington Castle was reduced to a ruin in the aftermath of the second battle. Another Battle of Reading took place on 9 December 1688. It was the only substantial military action in England during the Glorious Revolution and ended in a decisive victory for forces loyal to William of Orange.\nReading became the new county town in 1867, taking over from Abingdon, which remained in the county. Under the Local Government Act 1888, Berkshire County Council took over functions of the Berkshire Quarter Sessions, covering the administrative county of Berkshire, which excluded the county borough of Reading. Boundary alterations in the late 19th century and early 20th century were relatively rare, but included ceding the parts of the borough of Oxford south of the Thames in 1889, and gaining Caversham from Oxfordshire in 1911. The administrative county's full legal name was \"Berks\" rather than \"Berkshire\" until 1967, when the government changed the name to Berkshire at the county council's request.\nBerkshire received the title \"Royal County\" in 1957 due to the presence of Windsor Castle. The area has historical ties to royalty dating back to the Norman Conquest, when William the Conqueror established Windsor as a royal residence. On 1 April 1974, Berkshire's boundaries changed under the Local Government Act 1972. Berkshire took over administration of Slough and Eton and part of the former Eton Rural District from Buckinghamshire. The northern part of the county came under governance of Oxfordshire, with Faringdon, Wantage and Abingdon and their hinterland becoming the Vale of White Horse district, and Didcot and Wallingford added to South Oxfordshire district. 94 (Berkshire Yeomanry) Signal Squadron still keep the Uffington White Horse in their insignia, even though the White Horse is now within the ceremonial county of Oxfordshire. The original Local Government White Paper would have transferred Henley-on-Thames from Oxfordshire to Berkshire: this proposal did not make it into the Bill as introduced.\nOn 1 April 1998 Berkshire County Council was abolished under a recommendation of the Banham Commission, and the districts became unitary authorities. Unlike similar reforms elsewhere at the same time, the non-metropolitan county was not abolished. Signs saying \"Welcome to the Royal County of Berkshire\" exist on borders of West Berkshire, on the east side of Virginia Water, on the M4 motorway, on the south side of Sonning Bridge, on the A404 southbound by Marlow, and northbound on the A33 past Stratfield Saye.\nA flag for the historic county of Berkshire was registered with the Flag Institute in 2017.\nGeography.\nAll of the county is drained by the Thames. Berkshire divides into two topological (and associated geological) sections: east and west of Reading. North-east Berkshire has the low calciferous (limestone) m-shaped bends of the Thames south of which is a broader, clayey, gravelly former watery plain or belt from Earley to Windsor and beyond, south, are parcels and belts of uneroded higher sands, flints, shingles and lightly acid soil and in the north of the Bagshot Formation, north of Surrey and Hampshire. Swinley Forest (also known as Bracknell Forest), Windsor Great Park, Crowthorne and Stratfield Saye Woods have many pine, silver birch, and other lightly acid-soil trees. East of the grassy and wooded bends a large minority of East Berkshire's land mirrors the clay belt, being of low elevation and on the left (north) bank of the Thames: Slough, Eton, Eton Wick, Wraysbury, Horton, and Datchet. In the heart of the county Reading's northern suburb Caversham is also on that bank, but rises steeply into the Chiltern Hills.\nTwo main tributaries skirt past Reading, the Loddon and its sub-tributary the Blackwater draining parts of two counties south, and the Kennet draining part of upland Wiltshire in the west. Heading west the reduced, but equally large, part of the county extends further from the Thames which flows from the north-north-west before the Goring Gap; West Berkshire hosts the varying-width plain of the River Kennet rising to high chalk hills by way of and lower clay slopes and rises. To the south, the land crests along the boundary with Hampshire; the highest parts of South-East and Eastern England taken together are here. The highest is Walbury Hill at . To the north of the Kennet are the Berkshire Downs. This is hilly country, with smaller and well-wooded valleys: those of the Lambourn, Pang, and their Thames sub-tributaries. The open upland areas vie with Newmarket, Suffolk for horse racing training and breeding centres and have good fields of barley, wheat, and other cereal crops.\nGeology.\nBerkshire\u2019s surface can be divided into three bands: the county's downlands, south and east of which the London Clay spans almost the whole county, and in the south-east corner sandy Palaeogene heath covers the London Clay. This is an oversimplification, however.\nA gently folded succession of sedimentary rocks dating from the Cretaceous period, with some surviving Palaeogene cover and extensive Quaternary deposits, characterise the downlands, which cover the area to the west of Reading and the western edge of the Chiltern Hills. The lower (early) Cretaceous rocks are sandstones and mudstones (now visible only on the slopes of Walbury Hill) whilst those of the upper (late) Cretaceous are the various formations that comprise the Chalk Group. In Berkshire, White Chalk Formation beds tend to be shallower than those further west (Wiltshire) or those in the Chilterns, and often contain layers of chalk rock. Less consolidated Palaeogene clays, sands, gravels and silts of the Lambeth, Thames and Bracklesham Groups overlie these rocks in some areas. These hills, and the valleys that surround them, were shaped by the rivers Kennet, Lambourn, Pang and Enborne, and the Quaternary sands and gravels they brought with them and (in the case of the Kennet) left behind when they changed course.\nThe early Eocene London Clay (Thames Group) generally gets thinner as we proceed westwards, though the thickness of beds can vary considerably over short distances. Where rivers have cut through these beds Lambeth Group layers are found (notably, the Palaeocene Reading Formation, used for brick-making since Roman times but now increasingly scarce in the area after which it was named).\nThe heaths and woodland south and east of Bracknell are mostly covered by (Eocene) Bracklesham Group sands and clays, and Quaternary sands, silts and gravels. After the Thames broke through the Goring Gap that river and its tributaries the Loddon, Emm Brook, Blackwater and (to some extent) Wey shaped the geography of eastern Berkshire but have not yet eroded away its Eocene cover.\nDemography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to 2003 estimates there were 803,657 people in Berkshire, or 636 people/km2. The population is mostly based in the urban areas to the east and centre of the county: the largest towns here are Reading, Slough, Bracknell, Maidenhead, Woodley, Wokingham, Windsor, Earley, Sandhurst, and Crowthorne. West Berkshire is much more rural and sparsely populated, with far fewer towns: the largest are Newbury, Thatcham, and Hungerford. In recent years, Berkshire has seen consistent population growth, particularly in urban areas like Reading and Slough. Between 2011-21, the population increased by 6.7%, largely due to migration and economic opportunities in the region. Reading has experienced significant growth due to its reputation as a technology and business hub.\nIn 1831, there were 146,234 people living in Berkshire; by 1901 the population had risen to 252,571 (of whom 122,807 were male and 129,764 were female). Below were the largest immigrant groups in 2011.\nGovernance.\nBerkshire is a ceremonial county and non-metropolitan county. It is divided into six districts administered by unitary authorities. Berkshire County Council existed from 1889 until its abolition in 1998. The ceremonial county has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff. The Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire is Andrew Try, and the High Sheriff of Berkshire for 2018/19 was Graham Barker.\nThe six unitary councils formed a joint Berkshire Prosperity Board in February 2024 and submitted an expression of interest in forming a non-mayoral combined authority in September 2024.\nLocal.\nAs of the 2023 local elections, Liberal Democrat groups of local councillors run the unitary authorities of West Berkshire, Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham (in coalition with the Labour Party) with employed executives, whereas Labour Party local councillors run both Bracknell Forest and Reading, with Slough being run by the Conservative Party.\nParliament.\nAfter the 2024 United Kingdom general election, 5 of the elected Members of Parliament (MPs) were Labour, 3 Lib Dem and one conservative.\nThe prime minister between 2016\u201319, Theresa May represented Maidenhead.\nEconomy.\nThis is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Berkshire at current basic prices published by the \"Office for National Statistics\" with figures in millions of British pounds sterling.\nIndustry.\nReading has a historical involvement in the information technology industry, largely as a result of the early presence in the town of sites of International Computers Limited and Digital. These companies have been swallowed by other groups, but their descendants, Fujitsu and Hewlett-Packard respectively, still have local operations. More recently Microsoft and Oracle have established multi-building campuses on the outskirts of Reading. Other technology companies with a presence in the town include Huawei Technologies, Agilent Technologies, Audio &amp; Design (Recording) Ltd, Bang &amp; Olufsen, Cisco, Comptel, Ericsson, Harris Corporation, Intel, Nvidia, Rockwell Collins, Sage, SGI, Symantec, Symbol Technologies, Verizon Business, Virgin Media O2, Websense, Xansa (now Sopra Steria), and Xerox. The financial company ING Direct has its headquarters in Reading, as does the directories company Hibu. The insurance company Prudential has an administration centre in the town. PepsiCo and Holiday Inn have offices. As with most major cities, Reading also has offices of the Big Four accounting firms Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The 110-year old charity, Berkshire Vision is also located within Reading city centre.\nThe global headquarters of Reckitt Benckiser and the UK headquarters of Mars, Incorporated are based in Slough. The European head offices of major IT companies BlackBerry, CA Technologies, are in the town. The town is home to the National Foundation for Educational Research, which is housed in The Mere. Other major brands with offices in the town include Nintendo, Black &amp; Decker, Amazon, HTC, SSE plc and Abbey Business Centres. Dulux paints were manufactured in Slough by AkzoNobel, which bought Imperial Chemical Industries in 2008. Manufacturing ceased in 2018 with operations moving elsewhere, however the UK headquarters is still based there.\nBracknell is a base for high-tech industries, with the presence of companies such as Panasonic, Fujitsu (formerly ICL) and Fujitsu-Siemens Computers, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens (originally Nixdorf), Honeywell, Cable &amp; Wireless, Avnet Technology Solutions and Novell. Firms spread into the surrounding Thames Valley or M4 corridor, attracting IT firms such as Cable &amp; Wireless, DEC (subsequently Hewlett-Packard), Microsoft, Sharp Telecommunications, Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems and Cognos. Bracknell is home to the central Waitrose distribution centre and head office, which is on a site on the Southern Industrial Estate. Waitrose has operated from the town since the 1970s. The town is also home to the UK headquarters of Honda and BMW.\nNewbury is home to the world headquarters of the mobile network operator Vodafone, which is the town's largest employer with over 6,000 people. Before moving to their \u00a3129\u00a0million headquarters in the outskirts of the town in 2002, Vodafone used 64 buildings spread across the town centre. As well as Vodafone, Newbury is also home to National Instruments, Micro Focus, EValue, NTS Express Road Haulage, Jokers' Masquerade and Quantel. It also is home to the Newbury Building Society, which operates in the region.\nIn Compton, a small village, roughly 10 miles from Newbury, a chemical manufacturing company called Carbosynth was founded, in 2006. Since 2019, it has merged with a Swiss company called Biosynth AG to form a key global organisation within the fine chemical industry and operates under name Biosynth Carbosynth\u00ae. Biosynth Carbosynth, along with its acquired companies, vivitide and Pepscan rebranded to Biosynth in 2022.\nLondon Heathrow Airport, in the neighbouring London Borough of Hillingdon, is a major contributor to the economy of Slough in east Berkshire.\nAgricultural produce.\nAbingdon Abbey once had dairy-based granges in the south-east of the county, Red Windsor cheese was developed with red marbling. Some Berkshire cheeses are Wigmore, Waterloo and Spenwood (named after Spencers Wood) in Riseley; and Barkham Blue, Barkham Chase and Loddon Blewe at Barkham.\nMedia.\nLocal news and television programmes are covered by BBC South and ITV Meridian for the Thames Valley from the Hannington TV transmitter. Those parts of Berkshire closest to London such as Maidenhead, Windsor and Slough, receive BBC London and ITV London from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter.\nThe county\u2019s local radio stations are BBC Radio Berkshire, Heart South and Greatest Hits Radio Berkshire &amp; North Hampshire.\nSport.\nHorse racing.\nBerkshire hosts more Group 1 flat horse races than any other county. Ascot Racecourse is used for thoroughbred horse racing. It is one of the leading racecourses in the United Kingdom, hosting 13 of the UK's 35 annual Group 1 races. The course is closely associated with the British royal family, being approximately from Windsor Castle, and owned by the Crown Estate.\nAscot today stages twenty-five days of racing over the course of the year, comprising sixteen flat meetings held between May and October. The Royal Meeting, held in June, remains a major draw; the highlight is the Ascot Gold Cup. The most prestigious race is the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes run in July.\nNewbury Racecourse is in the civil parish of Greenham, adjoining the town of Newbury. It has courses for flat races and over jumps. It hosts one of Great Britain's 32 Group 1 races, the Lockinge Stakes. It also hosts the Ladbrokes Trophy, which is said to be the biggest handicap race of the National Hunt season apart from the Grand National.\nWindsor Racecourse, also known as Royal Windsor Racecourse is a thoroughbred horse racing venue located in Windsor. It is one of only two figure-of-eight courses in the United Kingdom. (The other is at Fontwell Park). It abandoned National Hunt jump racing in December 1998, switching entirely to flat racing.\nLambourn also has a rich history in horse racing, the well drained, spongy grass, open downs and long flats make the Lambourn Downs ideal for training racehorses. This area of West Berkshire is the largest centre of racehorse training in the UK after Newmarket, and is known as the 'Valley of the Racecourse'.\nFootball.\nReading F.C. is the only Berkshire football club to play professional football. Despite being founded in 1871, the club did not join the Football League until 1920, and first played in the top tier of English football in the 2006\u201307 season.\nNewbury was home to A.F.C. Newbury, which was one of only two football clubs to be sponsored by Vodafone (the other being Manchester United). In 2006 Vodafone ended its sponsorship of the club, following which the club collapsed. A local pub team from the Old London Apprentice took over the ground temporarily and now compete in the Hellenic Football League as Newbury F.C.\nThere are several amateur and semi-professional football clubs in the county. These include Maidenhead United, Slough Town, Windsor &amp; Eton F.C., Hungerford Town, Thatcham Town, Ascot United, A.F.C. Aldermaston, Sandhurst Town, Windsor F.C., Wokingham &amp; Emmbrook F.C., Binfield F.C., Bracknell Town F.C. and Reading City.\nBerkshire is well known for being home to the Thames River Derby as it is one of England's oldest footballing rivalries. The fixture is played between Slough Town and Windsor &amp; Eton F.C. on opposite sides of the River Thames.\nRugby.\nReading is a centre for rugby union football. The Premiership team London Irish were for 20 years tenants at the Madejski Stadium before their move back to SW London at a new stadium in Brentford.\nNewbury's rugby union club, Newbury R.F.C. (the Newbury 'Blues'), is based in the town. In the 2004\u201305 season, the club finished second in the National Two division earning promotion to National One. Newbury had previously won National Four South (now renamed as National Three South) in 1996\u201397 with a 100% win record. In 2010\u201311 the club finished bottom of National League 2S, with a single win and twenty-nine defeats. The club was founded in 1928 and in 1996 moved to a new purpose-built ground at Monks Lane, which has since hosted England U21 fixtures.\nIce hockey.\nThe Bracknell Bees Ice Hockey Club are former national champions, who play in the English Premier League.\nSlough Jets also play in the English Premier League winning the title in 2007. Slough Jets also won the play-offs in 2005\u201306, 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310 &amp; 2011\u201312. They also won the EPIH Cup in 2010\u201311. Slough Jets have been in the EPIHL since 1999.\nHockey.\nPhoenix Reading Hockey Club, based at Reading University, has six adult teams and a large junior development section. Reading Hockey Club and Sonning Hockey Club are situated close to each other near Blue Coats School. Slough Hockey Club is home to the Slough Ladies 1XI who play in the Women's Premier League, with five adult teams. In 2016, Bracknell and Wokingham Hockey Clubs merged to form South Berkshire Hockey Club. The team plays at Cantley Park in Wokingham and occasionally at Birch Hill, Bracknell. Other hockey teams in the county include Tadley, Yateley, Maidenhead, Windsor, and Newbury &amp; Thatcham Hockey Clubs.\nEducation.\nBerkshire is home to the following universities: the University of Reading (which includes the Henley Business School), Imperial College (Silwood Park Campus), and the University of West London. It is also home to The Chartered Institute of Marketing, prestigious independent schools Ludgrove School, Eton College and Wellington College, and several grammar schools including Reading School, Kendrick School and Herschel Grammar School.\nTowns and villages.\n\"See the List of places in Berkshire, List of settlements in Berkshire by population and the List of civil parishes in Berkshire\"\nNotable people.\nBerkshire has many notable people associated with it.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Having reigned for nearly 52 years, he was the second longest-reigning monarch in Norwegian history, after Christian IV.\nHe was born in Copenhagen during the reign of his grandfather, King Christian IX of Denmark; he was named Carl at birth and was the second son of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Denmark (later King Frederick VIII and Queen Louise). Carl was educated at the Royal Danish Naval Academy and served in the Royal Danish Navy. After the 1905 dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway, he was offered the Norwegian crown. Following a monarchy referendum, he accepted the offer and was formally elected King of Norway by the Storting and took the Old Norse name \"Haakon\", thus ascended the throne as Haakon VII, becoming the first independent Norwegian monarch since Olav IV in 1387.\nAs king, Haakon gained much sympathy from the Norwegian people. Although the Constitution of Norway vests the King with considerable executive powers, in practice Haakon confined himself to a representative and ceremonial role while rarely interfering in politics, a practice continued by his son and grandson. Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany in April 1940. Haakon rejected German demands to legitimise the Quisling regime's puppet government, vowing to abdicate rather than do so. He refused to abdicate after going into exile in Great Britain. As such, he played a pivotal role in uniting the Norwegian nation in its resistance to the invasion and the subsequent five-year-long occupation during the Second World War. He returned to Norway in June 1945 after the defeat of Germany.\nHaakon became King of Norway when his grandfather Christian IX was still reigning in Denmark, and before his father and elder brother became kings of Denmark. During his reign he saw his father Frederick VIII, his elder brother Christian X, and his nephew Frederik IX ascend the throne of Denmark in 1906, 1912, and 1947 respectively. Haakon died at the age of 85 in September 1957, after having reigned for nearly 52 years. He was succeeded by his only child and son, who ascended to the throne as Olav V.\nEarly life.\nBirth and family.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrince Carl was born on 3 August 1872 at his parents' country residence, Charlottenlund Palace north of Copenhagen, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Christian IX. He was the second son of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark (the future King Frederick VIII), and his wife Louise of Sweden. His father was the eldest son of King Christian IX and Louise of Hesse-Kassel, and his mother was the only daughter of King Charles XV of Sweden (who was also king of Norway as Charles IV), and Louise of the Netherlands. At birth, he was third in the succession to the Danish throne after his father and older brother, but without any real prospect of inheriting the throne. The young prince was baptised at Charlottenlund Palace on 7 September 1872 by the Bishop of Zealand, Hans Lassen Martensen. He was baptised with the names \"Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel\", and was known as Prince Carl (namesake of his maternal grandfather the King of Sweden-Norway, who died only 11 days after his baptism).\nCarl belonged to the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg (often shortened to Gl\u00fccksburg) branch of the House of Oldenburg. The House of Oldenburg had been the Danish royal family since 1448; between 1536 and 1814 it also ruled Norway, which was then part of the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway. The house was originally from northern Germany, where the Gl\u00fccksburg (Lyksborg) branch held their small fief. The family had links with Norway beginning from the 15th century. Several of his paternal ancestors had been kings of Norway in union with Denmark and at times Sweden. They included Christian I, Frederick I, Christian III, Frederick II, Christian IV, and Frederick III. Frederick III integrated Norway into the Oldenburg state with Denmark, Schleswig and Holstein. His subsequent paternal ancestors had been dukes in Schleswig-Holstein. Christian Frederick, who was King of Norway briefly in 1814, the first king of the Norwegian 1814 constitution and struggle for independence, was his great-granduncle.\nChildhood and education.\nCarl was raised with his siblings in the royal household in Copenhagen, and grew up between his parents' residence in Copenhagen, the Frederick VIII's Palace, an 18th-century palace which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen, and their country residence, Charlottenlund Palace, located by the coastline of the \u00d8resund strait north of the city. In contrast to the usual practice of the period, where royal children were brought up by governesses, the children were raised by Crown Princess Louise herself. Under the supervision of their mother, the children received a rather strict Christian-dominated upbringing, which was characterized by severity, the fulfillment of duties, care and order.\nAs a younger son of the Crown Prince, there was little expectation that Carl would become king. He was third in line to the throne after his father and elder brother, Prince Christian, and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother. Carl was less than two years younger than Christian, and the two princes were educated together at home by private tutors and had a joint confirmation at Christiansborg Palace Chapel in 1887.\nAfter his confirmation, as was customary for princes at that time, Carl was expected to start a military education. It was decided that he, in accordance with his own wishes, should enter the Royal Danish Navy. He was educated at the Royal Danish Naval Academy from 1889 to 1893, graduating as a second lieutenant. He subsequently remained in service with the Royal Danish Navy until his appointment as Norwegian king in 1905. In 1894 he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and in 1905 to the rank of admiral. During his naval career, he took part in several naval expeditions, including one in 1904\u20131905 with the protected cruiser to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.\nMarriage.\nOn 28 October 1895, at the age of 23, Carl was engaged to his first cousin Princess Maud of Wales. Princess Maud was the youngest daughter of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom). The Princess of Wales was Carl's aunt, being the eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise. The wedding was celebrated on 22 July 1896, in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace, and was attended by the bride's grandmother, the 77-year-old Queen Victoria.\nAfter the wedding, the couple settled in Copenhagen, where Carl continued his career as a naval officer. They took up residence in the Bernstorff Mansion, an 18th-century Rococo style townhouse owned by their mutual uncle King George I of Greece, situated in Bredgade immediately adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace complex. Furthermore, the bride's father gave them Appleton House on the Sandringham Estate as a country residence for his daughter's frequent visits to England. It was there that the couple's only child, Prince Alexander, the future Crown Prince Olav (and eventually King Olav V of Norway), was born on 2 July 1903.\nAccession to the Norwegian throne.\nBackground and election.\nFollowing several years of disagreements on various topics, the Union between Sweden and Norway which had existed since 1814 was dissolved in 1905. The union was unilaterally dissolved by the Storting (Norwegian parliament) on 7 June, and the dissolution was later confirmed by the Norwegian people in the 1905 Norwegian union dissolution referendum held on 13 August. After weeks of negotiations, the dissolution of the union was then recognized by Sweden on 23 September in the Treaty of Karlstad, mediated by the great powers of Europe. Its provisions included the full recognition of Norway's sovereignty and the abdication of the Swedish King Oscar II from the Norwegian throne. One month later, the union was formally dissolved as King Oscar II on 26 October signed the documents recognizing Norway as an independent state, and abdicated as Norwegian king on the same day.\nSubsequently, a committee of the Norwegian government identified several princes of European royal houses as candidates for the vacant Norwegian crown. Although Norway had legally had the status of an independent state since 1814, it had not had its own king since 1387. Gradually, Prince Carl became the leading candidate, largely because he was descended from independent Norwegian kings. He also had a son, providing an heir-apparent to the throne, and the fact that his wife, Princess Maud, was a member of the British royal family was viewed by many as an advantage to the newly independent Norwegian nation.\nThe democratically minded Prince Carl, aware that Norway was still debating whether to remain a kingdom or to switch instead to a republican system of government, was flattered by the Norwegian government's overtures, but he made his acceptance of the offer conditional on the holding of a referendum to show whether monarchy was the choice of the Norwegian people. After the referendum overwhelmingly confirmed by a 79 percent majority (259,563 votes for and 69,264 against) that Norwegians desired to remain a monarchy, Prince Carl was formally offered the throne of Norway by the Storting (parliament) and was elected on 18 November 1905. When Carl accepted the offer that same evening (after the approval of his grandfather Christian IX of Denmark), he immediately endeared himself to his adopted country by taking the Old Norse name of Haakon, a name which had not been used by kings of Norway for over 500 years. In so doing, he succeeded his maternal great-uncle, Oscar II of Sweden, who had abdicated the Norwegian throne in October.\nTwo days later, on the morning of 20 November, a large crowd gathered outside King Haakon and Queen Maud's residence in Bernstorff's Palace in Copenhagen. The attendees greeted the royal couple as they appeared in the window and started singing the patriotic song \"Ja, vi elsker dette landet\". Later the same day, King Christian IX of Denmark received a delegation from the Storting in an audience in Christian VII's Palace at Amalienborg. The delegation conveyed the message that the king's grandson had been elected King of Norway, while Christian IX expressed his consent to the election of Prince Carl. The head of the delegation, the President of the Storting Carl Berner, conveyed a greeting and congratulations from the Norwegian people, and expressed the people's wishes for a happy cooperation. The king replied: \nMr. President of the Storthing, gentlemen: The first greeting from the Representatives of the Norwegian People, who in their unanimous Storthing decision on 18 November has elected me their King, has touched me very deeply. The people have thereby shown me a confidence which I know how to appreciate, and which I hope will still grow stronger as it gets to know my wife and me. As it will be known to you, gentlemen, it was at my request that the newly concluded referendum took place. I wanted to be sure that it was a people and not a party that wanted me to be king, as my task above all should be to unite, not divide. My life I will devote to the good of Norway, and it is the fervent wish of my wife and I that the people who have chosen us will unite to cooperate and strive towards this great goal, and with full confidence I can then take as my motto: ALL FOR NORWAY!\nArrival in Norway.\nJust three days later, on 23 November, the new Norwegian royal family left Copenhagen for Norway on board the Danish royal yacht, the paddle steamer \"Dannebrog\". After crossing the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, the Dannebrog entered the Oslofjord, where at Oscarsborg Fortress near Dr\u00f8bak, the family boarded the Norwegian naval ship . The \"Heimdal\" then sailed the king the last part of the stretch from Dr\u00f8bak, and after a two-day journey, the family arrived to Kristiania (now Oslo) early on the morning of 25 November 1905.\nThe king was received at the harbour by the Prime Minister of Norway Christian Michelsen. On the deck of the \"Heimdal\", the Prime Minister gave the following speech to the king:\nFor almost 600 years, the Norwegian people have not had their own king. Never has he been completely our own. Always have we had to share him with others. Never has he had his home with us. But where the home is, there will also be the fatherland. Today it is different. Today, Norway's young king comes to build his future home in Norway's capital. Named by a free people as a free man to lead his country, he will be completely our own. Once again, the Norwegians' king will be the strong, unifying mark for all national deeds in the new, independent Norway ...\nTwo days later, on 27 November, Haakon VII took his constitutional oath before parliament as Norway's first independent king in 518 years. However, Norway counts 18 November, the day of his election, as the formal beginning of his reign.\nCoronation.\nOn 22 June 1906, King Haakon and Queen Maud were solemnly crowned and anointed in the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim by the Bishop of Trondheim Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen. The coronation was in keeping with the constitutional mandate, but many Norwegian statesmen had come to regard coronation rites as \"undemocratic and archaic\". The coronation clause was deleted from Norway's constitution in 1908, and although coronations are not expressly banned under current Norwegian legislation, this became the most recent coronation of a Norwegian monarch. In the period before and after the coronation, the King and Queen made an extensive coronation journey through Norway.\nThe King and Queen moved into the Royal Palace in Oslo. Haakon became the first monarch to use the palace permanently and the palace was therefore refurbished for two years before he, Queen Maud and Crown Prince Olav could move in. While the Royal Palace was being refurbished, the King and Queen Maud lived their first year in Norway at the \"Bygd\u00f8y Royal Estate\" in Oslo which they continued to use frequently as a summer residence. After the coronation, King Haakon and Queen Maud also received the estate \"Konges\u00e6teren\" at Holmenkollen in Oslo as a gift from the Norwegian people.\nEarly reign.\nKing Haakon gained much sympathy from the Norwegian people. He travelled extensively through Norway. As king, Haakon endeavored to redefine the role of the monarchy in egalitarian Norway and to find a balance between the informal Norwegian way of life and the monarchy's need for formal representation. Although the Constitution of Norway vested him with considerable executive powers, he was not responsible for exercising them. Parliamentary rule had been established in Norway since 1884, earlier than the rest of the Continent. Thus, in practice nearly all major governmental decisions were made by the Government (the Council of State) acting in Haakon's name. Haakon confined himself to non-partisan and representative roles without interfering in politics, a practice continued by his son and grandson. However, his long rule gave him considerable moral authority as a symbol of the country's unity.\nAt the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the Norwegian government advocated that Norway pursue a policy of neutrality. The King supported the policy of neutrality by participating in the so-called meeting of the Three Kings held on 18 December 1914 in Malm\u00f6 in Sweden. There, the three Scandinavian monarchs King Haakon, King Christian X of Denmark (Haakon's brother) and King Gustav V of Sweden (Haakon's mother's cousin) met along with their foreign ministers to discuss and emphasize the neutrality of the Nordic countries, and in a joint declaration, confirmed the three states' strict neutrality during the war. The meeting in 1914 was followed by another three-kings meeting in Kristiania in November 1917.\nIn 1927, the Labour Party became the largest party in parliament and early the following year Norway's first Labour Party government rose to power. The Labour Party was considered to be \"revolutionary\" by many and the deputy prime minister at the time advised against appointing Christopher Hornsrud as Prime Minister. Haakon, however, refused to abandon parliamentary convention and asked Hornsrud to form a new government. In response to some of his detractors he stated, \"I am also the King of the Communists\" ().\nOn 21 March 1929, Crown Prince Olav married his first cousin Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden at the Oslo Cathedral. Princess M\u00e4rtha was the daughter of Haakon's sister Princess Ingeborg and Prince Carl, Duke of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland. It was the first royal wedding in Norway after the dissolution of the union, and the alliance was met with great enthusiasm, also in Sweden, and it was seen as a sign that all the disharmony after the events of 1905 had now passed. Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess M\u00e4rtha were to have three children: Ragnhild (1930\u20132012), Astrid (born 1932) and Harald (born 1937), who was to become king in 1991.\nDuring the Eastern Greenland Case, a territorial dispute between Norway and Denmark about the sovereignty over Eastern Greenland, a very tense atmosphere prevailed. On 5 April 1933, Norway lost the arbitration case which had been submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. The next day, quoted across the front page the telegram King Haakon had sent to his brother King Christian X: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Have received the wording of the sentence and congratulate Denmark on the result.\nQueen Maud died unexpectedly while visiting the United Kingdom on 20 November 1938. In 1939, King Haakon toured southeast Montana and parts of the proposed secessionist state of Absaroka, with supporters of the secession movement claiming this event as formal recognition of their state.\nResistance during World War II.\nThe German invasion.\nNorway was invaded by the naval and air forces of Nazi Germany during the early hours of 9 April 1940. The German naval detachment sent to capture Oslo was opposed by Oscarsborg Fortress. The fortress fired at the invaders, sinking the heavy cruiser \"Bl\u00fccher\" and damaging the heavy cruiser \"L\u00fctzow\", with heavy German losses that included many soldiers, Gestapo agents, and administrative personnel who were to have occupied the Norwegian capital. This led to the withdrawal of the rest of the German flotilla, preventing the invaders' planned dawn occupation of Oslo. The Germans' delay in occupying Oslo, along with swift action by the president of the Storting, C. J. Hambro, created the opportunity for the royal family, the cabinet, and most of the 150 members of the Storting (parliament) to make a hasty departure from the capital by special train.\nThe Storting first convened at Hamar the same afternoon, but with the rapid advance of German troops, the group moved on to Elverum. The assembled Storting unanimously enacted a resolution, the so-called Elverum Authorization, granting the cabinet full powers to protect the country until such time as the Storting could meet again.\nThe next day, Curt Br\u00e4uer, the German Ambassador to Norway, demanded a meeting with Haakon. The German diplomat called on Haakon to accept Adolf Hitler's demands to end all resistance and appoint Vidkun Quisling as prime minister. Quisling, the leader of Norway's fascist party, the Nasjonal Samling, had declared himself prime minister hours earlier in Oslo as head of what would be a German puppet government; had Haakon formally appointed him, it would effectively have given legal sanction to the invasion. Br\u00e4uer suggested that Haakon follow the example of the Danish government and his brother, Christian X, which had surrendered almost immediately after the previous day's invasion, and threatened Norway with harsh reprisals if it did not surrender. Haakon told Br\u00e4uer that he could not make the decision himself, but could only act on the advice of the Government.\nIn a meeting in Nybergsund, the King reported the German ultimatum to the cabinet sitting as a council of state. Haakon told the cabinet:\nI am deeply affected by the responsibility laid on me if the German demand is rejected. The responsibility for the calamities that will befall people and country is indeed so grave that I dread to take it. It rests with the government to decide, but my position is clear.\nFor my part I cannot accept the German demands. It would conflict with all that I have considered to be my duty as King of Norway since I came to this country nearly thirty-five years ago.\nHaakon went on to say that he could not appoint Quisling as prime minister, since he knew neither the people nor the Storting had confidence in him. However, if the cabinet felt otherwise, the King said he would abdicate so as not to stand in the way of the Government's decision.\nNils Hjelmtveit, Minister of Church and Education, later wrote:\nThis made a great impression on us all. More clearly than ever before, we could see the man behind the words; the king who had drawn a line for himself and his task, a line from which he could not deviate. We had through the five years [in government] learned to respect and appreciate our king, and now, through his words, he came to us as a great man, just and forceful; a leader in these fatal times to our country.\nInspired by Haakon's stand, the government unanimously advised him not to appoint any government headed by Quisling. Within hours, it telephoned its refusal to Br\u00e4uer. That night, NRK broadcast the government's rejection of the German demands to the Norwegian people. In that same broadcast, the government announced that it would resist the German invasion as long as possible, and expressed their confidence that Norwegians would lend their support to the cause.\nAfter Norway was eventually conquered, Quisling \"transformed [the country] into a one-party fascist state and recruited 6,000 Norwegians to fight alongside the Germans on the Russian front\". A very small percentage of the population supported Quisling and many joined the Norwegian resistance movement. After the war, Quisling was convicted of treason and executed.\nNorwegian campaign.\nThe following morning, 11 April 1940, in an attempt to wipe out Norway's unyielding king and government, bombers attacked Nybergsund, destroying the small town where the Government was staying. Neutral Sweden was only away, but the Swedish government decided it would \"detain and incarcerate\" King Haakon if he crossed their border (which Haakon never forgave). The Norwegian king and his ministers took refuge in the snow-covered woods and escaped harm, continuing farther north through the mountains toward Molde on Norway's west coast. As the British forces in the area lost ground under Luftwaffe bombardment, the King and his party were taken aboard the British cruiser HMS \"Glasgow\" at Molde and conveyed a further north to Troms\u00f8, where a provisional capital was established on 1 May. Haakon and Crown Prince Olav took up residence in a forest cabin in M\u00e5lselvdalen valley in inner Troms County, where they would stay until evacuation to the United Kingdom.\nThe Allies had a fairly secure hold over northern Norway until late May. The situation was dramatically altered, however, by their deteriorating situation in the Battle of France. With the Germans rapidly overrunning France, the Allied high command decided that the forces in northern Norway should be withdrawn. The royal family and Norwegian government were evacuated from Troms\u00f8 on 7 June aboard HMS \"Devonshire\" with a total of 461 passengers. This evacuation became extremely costly for the Royal Navy when the German warships \"Scharnhorst\" and \"Gneisenau\" attacked and sank the nearby aircraft carrier HMS \"Glorious\" with its escorting destroyers HMS \"Acasta\" and HMS \"Ardent\". \"Devonshire\" did not rebroadcast the enemy sighting report made by \"Glorious\" as it could not disclose its position by breaking radio silence. No other British ship received the sighting report, and 1,519 British officers and men and three warships were lost. \"Devonshire\" arrived safely in London and King Haakon and his Cabinet set up a Norwegian government in exile in the British capital.\nGovernment in exile.\nInitially, King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav were guests at Buckingham Palace, but at the start of the London Blitz in September 1940, they moved to Bowdown House in Berkshire. The construction of the adjacent RAF Greenham Common airfield in March 1942 prompted another move to Foliejon Park in Winkfield, near Windsor, in Berkshire, where they remained until the liberation of Norway.\nHaakon also spent time at Carbisdale Castle in Sutherland, Scotland, made available for his use by Theodore Salvesen, a ship-owner of Norwegian extraction.\nThe King's official residence was the Norwegian Legation at 10 Palace Green, Kensington, which became the seat of the Norwegian government in exile. Here Haakon attended weekly Cabinet meetings and worked on the speeches which were regularly broadcast by radio to Norway by the BBC World Service. These broadcasts helped to cement Haakon's position as an important national symbol to the Norwegian resistance. Many broadcasts were made from Saint Olav's Norwegian Church in Rotherhithe, where the royal family were regular worshippers.\nMeanwhile, Hitler had appointed Josef Terboven as \"\" for Norway. On Hitler's orders, Terboven attempted to coerce the Storting to depose the King; the Storting declined, citing constitutional principles. A subsequent ultimatum was made by the Germans, threatening to intern all Norwegians of military age in German concentration camps. With this threat looming, the Storting's representatives in Oslo wrote to their monarch on 27 June, asking him to abdicate. The King declined, politely replying that the Storting was acting under duress. The King gave his answer on 3 July, and proclaimed it on BBC radio on 8 July.\nAfter one further German attempt in September to force the Storting to depose Haakon failed, Terboven finally decreed that the royal family had \"forfeited their right to return\" and dissolved the democratic political parties.\nDuring Norway's five years under German control, many Norwegians surreptitiously wore clothing or jewellery made from coins bearing Haakon's \"H7\" monogram as symbols of resistance to the German occupation and of solidarity with their exiled King and Government, just as many people in Denmark wore his brother's monogram on a pin. The King's monogram was also painted and otherwise reproduced on various surfaces as a show of resistance to the occupation.\nNazi Germany controlled Norway until the capitulation of German forces in Europe on 8 May 1945. After the end of the war, Crown Prince Olav and five government ministers returned to a liberated Norway on 13 May 1945. Haakon and the rest of the Norwegian royal family returned to Norway aboard the cruiser , arriving with the First Cruiser Squadron to cheering crowds in Oslo on 7 June 1945, exactly five years after they had been evacuated from Troms\u00f8.\nPost-war years.\nAfter his return, Haakon did not continue the political role that he had played during the war, and limited himself to his constitutional duties as head of state. In the late summer of 1945 he went on an extensive tour of Norway to examine the war damage and to give consolation to the population. Because of his role during the war and his personal integrity, Haakon VII was considered the highest moral authority in the country and enjoyed great esteem in all classes of the population.\nIn 1947, the Norwegian people, by public subscription, purchased the royal yacht \"Norge\" for the King.\nIn 1952, he attended the funeral of his wife's nephew King George VI and openly wept.\nThe King's granddaughter, Princess Ragnhild, married businessman Erling Lorentzen (of the Lorentzen family) on 15 May 1953, being the first member of the new Norwegian royal family to marry a commoner.\nHaakon lived to see two of his great-grandchildren born; Haakon Lorentzen (b. 23 August 1954) and Ingeborg Lorentzen (b. 3 February 1957).\nCrown Princess M\u00e4rtha died of cancer on 5 April 1954.\nKing Haakon VII fell in his bathroom at the Bygd\u00f8y Royal Estate (\"Bygd\u00f8y kongsg\u00e5rd\") in July 1955. This fall, which occurred just a month before his eighty-third birthday, resulted in a fracture to the thighbone and, although there were few other complications resulting from the fall, the King was left using a wheelchair. The once-active King was said to have been depressed by his resulting helplessness and began to lose his customary involvement and interest in current events. With Haakon's loss of mobility, and as his health deteriorated further in the summer of 1957, Crown Prince Olav appeared on behalf of his father on ceremonial occasions and took a more active role in state affairs.\nThe Norwegian Post Office issued three sets of commemorative postage stamps to honour their King:\n1952 \u2013 Two stamps issued 2 August to celebrate the King's 80th birthday.\n1955 \u2013 Two stamps issued 25 November to celebrate the King's 50 years on the throne.\n1957 \u2013 Two stamps issued 3 August to celebrate the King's 85th birthday.\nAn additional set was issued in 1972 to commemorate the late King's 100th anniversary of his birth.\nDeath and succession.\nHaakon died at the Royal Palace in Oslo on 21 September 1957. He was 85 years old. At his death, Olav succeeded him as Olav V. Haakon was buried on 1 October 1957 alongside his wife in the white sarcophagus in the Royal Mausoleum at Akershus Fortress. He was the last surviving son of King Frederick VIII of Denmark.\nLegacy.\nHaakon VII is regarded by many as one of the greatest Norwegian leaders of the pre-war period, managing to hold his young and fragile country together in unstable political conditions. He was ranked highly in the Norwegian of the Century poll in 2005.\nHonours.\nThe King Haakon VII Sea in East Antarctica is named in the king's honour as well as the entire plateau surrounding the South Pole was named \"King Haakon VII Vidde\" by Roald Amundsen when he in 1911 became the first human to reach the South Pole. See Polheim.\nIn 1914 Haakon County in the American state of South Dakota was named in his honour.\nTwo Royal Norwegian Navy ships\u2014\"King Haakon VII\", an escort ship in commission from 1942 to 1951, and \"Haakon VII\", a training ship in commission from 1958 to 1974\u2014have been named after King Haakon VII.\nFor his struggles against the Nazi regime and his effort to revive the Holmenkollen ski festival following World War II, King Haakon VII earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1955 (Shared with Hallgeir Brenden, Veikko Hakulinen, and Sverre Stenersen), one of only 11 people not famous for Nordic skiing to receive this honour. (The others are Norway's Stein Eriksen, Borghild Niskin, Inger Bj\u00f8rnbakken, Astrid Sandvik, King Olav V (his son), Erik H\u00e5ker, Jacob Vaage, King Harald V (his paternal grandson), and Queen Sonja (his paternal granddaughter-in-law), and Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark).\nIn popular culture.\nHaakon was portrayed by Jakob Cedergren in the 2009 NRK drama series \"Harry &amp; Charles\", a series that focused on the events leading up to the election of King Haakon in 1905. Jesper Christensen portrayed the King in the 2016 film \"The King's Choice\" (\"Kongens nei\") which was based on the events surrounding the German invasion of Norway and the King's decision to resist. The film won widespread critical acclaim, and was Norway's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards. The film made the shortlist of nine finalists in December 2016. Haakon was portrayed by S\u00f8ren Pilmark in the 2020 NRK drama series \"Atlantic Crossing\", a series regarding Crown Princess M\u00e4rtha's handling of the royal family exile from 1939 to 1945.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Noun phrases are very common cross-linguistically, and they may be the most frequently occurring phrase type.\nNoun phrases often function as verb subjects and objects, as predicative expressions, and as complements of prepositions. One NP can be embedded inside another NP; for instance, \"some of his constituents\" has as a constituent the shorter NP \"his constituents\".\nIn some theories of grammar, noun phrases with determiners are analyzed as having the determiner as the head of the phrase, see for instance Chomsky (1995) and Hudson (1990).\nIdentification.\nSome examples of noun phrases are underlined in the sentences below. The head noun appears in bold. \nThis election-year's politics are annoying for many people.\nAlmost every sentence contains at least one noun phrase.\nCurrent economic weakness may be a result of high energy prices.\nNoun phrases can be identified by the possibility of pronoun substitution, as is illustrated in the examples below.\na. This sentence contains two noun phrases. \nb. It contains them.\na. The subject noun phrase that is present in this sentence is long. \nb. It is long.\na. Noun phrases can be embedded in other noun phrases. \nb. They can be embedded in them.\nA string of words that can be replaced by a single pronoun without rendering the sentence grammatically unacceptable is a noun phrase. As to whether the string must contain at least two words, see the following section.\nStatus of single words as phrases.\nTraditionally, a phrase is understood to contain two or more words. The traditional progression in the size of syntactic units is \"word &lt; phrase &lt; clause\", and in this approach a single word (such as a noun or pronoun) would not be referred to as a phrase. However, many modern schools of syntax \u2013 especially those that have been influenced by X-bar theory \u2013 make no such restriction. Here many single words are judged to be phrases based on a desire for theory-internal consistency. A phrase is deemed to be a word or a combination of words that appears in a set syntactic position, for instance in subject position or object position.\nOn this understanding of phrases, the nouns and pronouns in bold in the following sentences are noun phrases (as well as nouns or pronouns):\nHe saw someone.\nMilk is good.\nThey spoke about corruption.\nThe words in bold are called phrases since they appear in the syntactic positions where multiple-word phrases (i.e. traditional phrases) can appear. This practice takes the constellation to be primitive rather than the words themselves. The word \"he\", for instance, functions as a pronoun, but within the sentence it also functions as a noun phrase. The phrase structure grammars of the Chomskyan tradition (government and binding theory and the minimalist program) are primary examples of theories that apply this understanding of phrases. Other grammars such as dependency grammars are likely to reject this approach to phrases, since they take the words themselves to be primitive. For them, phrases must contain two or more words.\nComponents.\nA typical noun phrase consists of a noun (the head of the phrase) together with zero or more dependents of various types. (These dependents, since they modify a noun, are called \"adnominal\".) The chief types of these dependents are:\nThe allowability, form and position of these elements depend on the syntax of the language in question. In English, determiners, adjectives (and some adjective phrases) and noun modifiers precede the head noun, whereas the heavier units \u2013 phrases and clauses \u2013 generally follow it. This is part of a strong tendency in English to place heavier constituents to the right, making English more of a head-initial language. Head-final languages (e.g. Japanese and Turkish) are more likely to place all modifiers before the head noun. Other languages, such as French, often place even single-word adjectives after the noun.\nNoun phrases can take different forms than that described above, for example when the head is a pronoun rather than a noun, or when elements are linked with a coordinating conjunction such as \"and\", \"or\", \"but\". For more information about the structure of noun phrases in English, see .\nSyntactic function.\nNoun phrases typically bear argument functions. That is, the syntactic functions that they fulfill are those of the arguments of the main clause predicate, particularly those of subject, object and predicative expression. They also function as arguments in such constructs as participial phrases and prepositional phrases. For example:\nFor us the news is a concern. \nHave you heard the news? \nThat is the news. \nThey are talking about the news. \nThe man reading the news is very tall. \nSometimes a noun phrase can also function as an adjunct of the main clause predicate, thus taking on an adverbial function, e.g.\nMost days I read the newspaper.\nShe has been studying all night.\nWith and without determiners.\nIn some languages, including English, noun phrases are required to be \"completed\" with a determiner in many contexts, and thus a distinction is made in syntactic analysis between phrases that have received their required determiner (such as \"the big house\"), and those in which the determiner is lacking (such as \"big house\").\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that in some contexts a noun phrase may nonetheless be used without a determiner (as in \"I like big houses\"); in this case the phrase may be described as having a \"null determiner\". (Situations in which this is possible depend on the rules of the language in question; for English, see English articles.)\nIn the original X-bar theory, the two respective types of entity are called noun phrase (NP) and N-bar (N, N\u2032). Thus in the sentence \"Here is the big house\", both \"house\" and \"big house\" are N-bars, while \"the big house\" is a noun phrase. In the sentence \"I like big houses\", both \"houses\" and \"big houses\" are N-bars, but \"big houses\" also functions as a noun phrase (in this case without an explicit determiner).\nIn some modern theories of syntax, however, what are called \"noun phrases\" above are no longer considered to be headed by a noun, but by the determiner (which may be null), and they are thus called \"determiner phrases\" (DP) instead of noun phrases. (In some accounts that take this approach, the constituent lacking the determiner \u2013 that called N-bar above \u2013 may be referred to as a noun phrase.)\nThis analysis of noun phrases is widely referred to as the \"DP hypothesis\". It has been the preferred analysis of noun phrases in the minimalist program from its start (since the early 1990s), though the arguments in its favor tend to be theory-internal. By taking the determiner, a function word, to be head over the noun, a structure is established that is analogous to the structure of the finite clause, with a complementizer. Apart from the minimalist program, however, the DP hypothesis is rejected by most other modern theories of syntax and grammar, in part because these theories lack the relevant functional categories. Dependency grammars, for instance, almost all assume the traditional NP analysis of noun phrases.\nFor illustrations of different analyses of noun phrases depending on whether the DP hypothesis is rejected or accepted, see the next section.\nTree representations.\nThe representation of noun phrases using parse trees depends on the basic approach to syntactic structure adopted. The layered trees of many phrase structure grammars grant noun phrases an intricate structure that acknowledges a hierarchy of functional projections. Dependency grammars, in contrast, since the basic architecture of dependency places a major limitation on the amount of structure that the theory can assume, produce simple, relatively flat structures for noun phrases.\nThe representation also depends on whether the noun or the determiner is taken to be the head of the phrase (see the discussion of the DP hypothesis in the previous section).\nBelow are some possible trees for the two noun phrases \"the big house\" and \"big houses\" (as in the sentences \"Here is the big house\" and \"I like big houses\").\n1. Phrase-structure trees, first using the original X-bar theory, then using the current DP approach:\n2. Dependency trees, first using the traditional NP approach, then using the DP approach:\nThe following trees represent a more complex phrase. For simplicity, only dependency-based trees are given.\nThe first tree is based on the traditional assumption that nouns, rather than determiners, are the heads of phrases.\nThe head noun \"picture\" has the four dependents \"the\", \"old\", \"of Fred\", and \"that I found in the drawer\". The tree shows how the lighter dependents appear as pre-dependents (preceding their head) and the heavier ones as post-dependents (following their head).\nThe second tree assumes the DP hypothesis, namely that determiners serve as phrase heads, rather than nouns.\nThe determiner \"the\" is now depicted as the head of the entire phrase, thus making the phrase a determiner phrase. There is still a noun phrase present (\"old picture of Fred that I found in the drawer\") but this phrase is below the determiner.\nHistory.\nAn early conception of the noun phrase can be found in \"First work in English\" by Alexander Murison. In this conception a noun phrase is \"the infinitive of the verb\" (p.\u00a0146), which may appear \"in any position in the sentence where a noun may appear\". For example, \"to be just is more important than to be generous\" has two underlined infinitives which may be replaced by nouns, as in \"justice is more important than generosity\". This same conception can be found in subsequent grammars, such as 1878's \"A Tamil Grammar\" or 1882's \"Murby's English grammar and analysis\", where the conception of an X phrase is a phrase that can stand in for X. By 1912, the concept of a noun phrase as being based around a noun can be found, for example, \"an adverbial noun phrases is a group of words of which the noun is the base word, that tells the time or place of an action, or how long, how far, or how much\". By 1924, the idea of a noun phrase being a noun plus dependents seems to be established. For example, \"Note order of words in noun-phrase--noun + adj. + genitive\" suggests a more modern conception of noun phrases.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nSee also:"}
{"id": "64959", "revid": "51058578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64959", "title": "Poverty", "text": "State of economic hardship and limited necessities\nPoverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living. Poverty can have diverse environmental, legal, social, economic, and political causes and effects. When evaluating poverty in statistics or economics there are two main measures: \"absolute poverty\" which compares income against the amount needed to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter; secondly, \"relative poverty\" measures when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. The definition of \"relative poverty\" varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.\nStatistically, as of 2019[ [update]], most of the world's population live in poverty: in PPP dollars, 85% of people live on less than $30 per day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and 10% live on less than $1.90 per day. According to the World Bank Group in 2020, more than 40% of the poor live in conflict-affected countries. Even when countries experience economic development, the poorest citizens of middle-income countries frequently do not gain an adequate share of their countries' increased wealth to leave poverty. Governments and non-governmental organizations have experimented with a number of different policies and programs for poverty alleviation, such as electrification in rural areas or housing first policies in urban areas. The international policy frameworks for poverty alleviation, established by the United Nations in 2015, are summarized in Sustainable Development Goal 1: \"No Poverty\".\nSocial forces, such as gender, disability, race and ethnicity, can exacerbate issues of poverty\u2014with women, children and minorities frequently bearing unequal burdens of poverty. Moreover, impoverished individuals are more vulnerable to the effects of other social issues, such as the environmental effects of industry or the impacts of climate change or other natural disasters or extreme weather events. Poverty can also make other social problems worse; economic pressures on impoverished communities frequently play a part in deforestation, biodiversity loss and ethnic conflict. For this reason, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and other international policy programs, such as the international recovery from COVID-19, emphasize the connection of poverty alleviation with other societal goals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefinitions and etymology.\nThe word \"poverty\" comes from the old (Norman) French word \"povert\u00e9\" (Modern French: \"pauvret\u00e9),\" from Latin \"paupert\u0101s\" from \"pauper\" (poor).\nThere are several definitions of poverty depending on the context of the situation it is placed in. It usually references a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.\nUnited Nations: Fundamentally, poverty is a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one's food or a job to earn one's living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.\nWorld Bank: Poverty is pronounced deprivation in well-being, and comprises many dimensions. It includes low incomes and the inability to acquire the basic goods and services necessary for survival with dignity. Poverty also encompasses low levels of health and education, poor access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate physical security, lack of voice, and insufficient capacity and opportunity to better one's life.\nEuropean Union (EU): The European Union's definition of poverty is significantly different from definitions in other parts of the world, and consequently policy measures introduced to combat poverty in EU countries also differ from measures in other nations. Poverty is measured in relation to the distribution of income in each member country using relative income poverty lines: an EEC Council Decision in 1984 stated that for EEC purposes, \"the poor\" should be taken to \"mean persons, families and groups of persons whose resources (material, cultural and social) are so limited as to exclude them from the minimum acceptable way of life in the Member States in which they live\". Relative-income poverty rates in the EU are compiled by the Eurostat, in charge of coordinating, gathering, and disseminating member country statistics using European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys.\nMeasuring poverty.\nAbsolute poverty.\nAbsolute poverty, often synonymous with 'extreme poverty' or 'abject poverty', refers to a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries. This set standard usually refers to \"a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also on access to services.\" Having an income below the poverty line, which is defined as an income needed to purchase basic needs, is also referred to as \"primary poverty\".\nThe \"dollar a day\" poverty line was first introduced in 1990 as a measure to meet such standards of living. For nations that do not use the US dollar as currency, \"dollar a day\" does not translate to living a day on the equivalent amount of local currency as determined by the exchange rate. Rather, it is determined by the purchasing power parity rate, which would look at how much local currency is needed to buy the same things that a dollar could buy in the United States. Usually, this would translate to having less local currency than if the exchange rate were used.\nFrom 1993 through 2005, the World Bank defined absolute poverty as $1.08 a day on such a purchasing power parity basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 US dollar In 2009, it was updated as $1.25 a day (equivalent to $1.00 a day in 1996 US prices) and in 2015, it was updated as living on less than US$1.90 per day, and \"moderate poverty\" as less than $2 or $5 a day. Similarly, 'ultra-poverty' is defined by a 2007 report issued by International Food Policy Research Institute as living on less than 54 cents per day. The poverty line threshold of $1.90 per day, as set by the World Bank, is controversial. Each nation has its own threshold for absolute poverty line; in the United States, for example, the absolute poverty line was US$15.15 per day in 2010 (US$22,000 per year for a family of four), while in India it was US$1.0 per day and in China the absolute poverty line was US$0.55 per day, each on PPP basis in 2010. These different poverty lines make data comparison between each nation's official reports qualitatively difficult. Some scholars argue that the World Bank method sets the bar too high, others argue it is too low.\nThere is disagreement among experts as to what would be considered a realistic poverty rate with one considering it \"an inaccurately measured and arbitrary cut off\". Some contend that a higher poverty line is needed, such as a minimum of $7.40 or even $10 to $15 a day. They argue that these levels are a minimum for basic needs and to achieve normal life expectancy.\nOne estimate places the true scale of poverty much higher than the World Bank, with an estimated 4.3 billion people (59% of the world's population) living with less than $5 a day and unable to meet basic needs adequately. Philip Alston, a UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, stated the World Bank's international poverty line of $1.90 a day is fundamentally flawed, and has allowed for \"self congratulatory\" triumphalism in the fight against extreme global poverty, which he asserts is \"completely off track\" and that nearly half of the global population, or 3.4 billion, lives on less than $5.50 a day, and this number has barely moved since 1990. Still others suggest that poverty line misleads because many live on far less than that line.\nOther measures of absolute poverty without using a certain dollar amount include the standard defined as receiving less than 80% of minimum caloric intake whilst spending more than 80% of income on food, sometimes called ultra-poverty.\nRelative poverty.\nRelative poverty views poverty as socially defined and dependent on social context. It is argued that the needs considered fundamental is not an objective measure and could change with the custom of society. For example, a person who cannot afford housing better than a small tent in an open field would be said to live in relative poverty if almost everyone else in that area lives in modern brick homes, but not if everyone else also lives in small tents in open fields (for example, in a nomadic tribe). Since richer nations would have lower levels of absolute poverty, relative poverty is considered the \"most useful measure for ascertaining poverty rates in wealthy developed nations\" and is the \"most prominent and most-quoted of the EU social inclusion indicators\".\nUsually, relative poverty is measured as the percentage of the population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income. This is a calculation of the percentage of people whose family household income falls below the Poverty Line. The main poverty line used in the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU) is based on \"economic distance\", a level of income set at 60% of the median household income. The United States federal government typically regulates this line to three times the cost of an adequate meal.\nThere are several other different income inequality metrics, for example, the Gini coefficient or the Theil Index.\nOther aspects.\nRather than income, poverty is also measured through individual basic needs at a time. Life expectancy has greatly increased in the developing world since World War II and is starting to close the gap to the developed world. Child mortality has decreased in every developing region of the world. The proportion of the world's population living in countries where the daily per-capita supply of food energy is less than decreased from 56% in the mid-1960s to below 10% by the 1990s. Similar trends can be observed for literacy, access to clean water and electricity and basic consumer items.\nPoverty may also be understood as an aspect of unequal social status and inequitable social relationships, experienced as social exclusion, dependency, and diminished capacity to participate, or to develop meaningful connections with other people in society. Such social exclusion can be minimized through strengthened connections with the mainstream, such as through the provision of relational care to those who are experiencing poverty. The World Bank's \"Voices of the Poor\", based on research with over 20,000 poor people in 23 countries, identifies a range of factors which poor people identify as part of poverty. These include abuse by those in power, dis-empowering institutions, excluded locations, gender relationships, lack of security, limited capabilities, physical limitations, precarious livelihoods, problems in social relationships, weak community organizations and discrimination. Analysis of social aspects of poverty links conditions of scarcity to aspects of the distribution of resources and power in a society and recognizes that poverty may be a function of the diminished \"capability\" of people to live the kinds of lives they value. The social aspects of poverty may include lack of access to information, education, health care, social capital or political power. \nRelational poverty is the idea that societal poverty exists if there is a lack of human relationships. Relational poverty can be the result of a lost contact number, lack of phone ownership, isolation, or deliberate severing of ties with an individual or community. Relational poverty is also understood \"by the social institutions that organize those relationships...poverty is importantly the result of the different terms and conditions on which people are included in social life\".\nIn the United Kingdom, the second Cameron ministry came under attack for its redefinition of poverty; poverty is no longer classified by a family's income, but as to whether a family is in work or not. Considering that two-thirds of people who found work were accepting wages that are below the living wage (according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation) this has been criticised by anti-poverty campaigners as an unrealistic view of poverty in the United Kingdom.\nSecondary poverty.\nSecondary poverty refers to those that earn enough income to not be impoverished, but who spend their income on unnecessary pleasures, such as alcoholic beverages, thus placing them below it in practice. In 18th- and 19th-century Great Britain, the practice of temperance among Methodists, as well as their rejection of gambling, allowed them to eliminate secondary poverty and accumulate capital. Factors that contribute to secondary poverty includes but are not limited to: alcohol, gambling, tobacco and drugs. Substance abuse means that the poor typically spend about 2% of their income educating their children but larger percentages of alcohol and tobacco (for example, 6% in Indonesia and 8% in Mexico as of 2006).\nVariability.\nPoverty levels are snapshot pictures in time that omits the transitional dynamics between levels. Mobility statistics supply additional information about the fraction who leave the poverty level. For example, one study finds that in a sixteen-year period (1975 to 1991 in the US) only 5% of those in the lower fifth of the income level were still at that level, while 95% transitioned to a higher income category. Poverty levels can remain the same while those who rise out of poverty are replaced by others. The transient poor and chronic poor differ in each society. In a nine-year period ending in 2005 for the US, 50% of the poorest quintile transitioned to a higher quintile.\nGlobal prevalence.\nAccording to Chen and Ravallion, about 1.76 billion people in the developing world lived \"above\" $1.25 per day and 1.9 billion people lived \"below\" $1.25 per day in 1981. In 2005, about 4.09 billion people in the developing world lived above $1.25 per day and 1.4 billion people lived below $1.25 per day (both 1981 and 2005 data are on inflation adjusted basis). The share of the world's population living in absolute poverty fell from 43% in 1981 to 14% in 2011. The absolute number of people in poverty fell from 1.95 billion in 1981 to 1.01 billion in 2011. The economist Max Roser estimates that the number of people in poverty is therefore roughly the same as 200 years ago. This is the case since the world population was just little more than 1 billion in 1820 and the majority (84% to 94%) of the world population was living in poverty. \nAccording to one study, the percentage of the world population in hunger and poverty fell in absolute percentage terms from 50% in 1950 to 30% in 1970. According to another study the number of people worldwide living in absolute poverty fell from 1.18 billion in 1950 to 1.04 billion in 1977. According to another study, the number of people worldwide estimated to be starving fell from almost 920 million in 1971 to below 797 million in 1997. The proportion of the developing world's population living in extreme economic poverty fell from 28% in 1990 to 21% in 2001. Most of this improvement has occurred in East and South Asia.\nIn 1963, the Third World Food Survey estimated that 10-15% of the world\u2019s population were undernourished and that up to half suffered from general hunger and malnutrition. In subsequent decades, however, estimated levels of malnutrition and undernourshent steadily fell. From 1970 to 1990, the percentage of the world\u2019s population estimated to be suffering from malnutrition fell from 24.8% to 15.9.%. From 1970 to 2015, the percentage of people in developing nations estimated to be undernourished fell from 34.75% to 12.90%. \nIn 2012 it was estimated that, using a poverty line of $1.25 a day, 1.2 billion people lived in poverty. Given the current economic model, built on GDP, it would take 100 years to bring the world's poorest up to the poverty line of $1.25 a day. UNICEF estimates half the world's children (or 1.1 billion) live in poverty. The World Bank forecasted in 2015 that 702.1 million people were living in extreme poverty, down from 1.75 billion in 1990. Extreme poverty is observed in all parts of the world, including developed economies. Of the 2015 population, about 347.1 million people (35.2%) lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and 231.3 million (13.5%) lived in South Asia. According to the World Bank, between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of the world's population living in extreme poverty fell from 37.1% to 9.6%, falling below 10% for the first time. \nDuring the 2013 to 2015 period, the World Bank reported that extreme poverty fell from 11% to 10%, however they also noted that the rate of decline had slowed by nearly half from the 25 year average with parts of sub-saharan Africa returning to early 2000 levels. The World Bank attributed this to increasing violence following the Arab Spring, population increases in Sub-Saharan Africa, and general African inflationary pressures and economic malaise were the primary drivers for this slow down. Many wealthy nations have seen an increase in relative poverty rates ever since the Great Recession, in particular among children from impoverished families who often reside in substandard housing and find educational opportunities out of reach. It has been argued by some academics that the neoliberal policies promoted by global financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank are actually exacerbating both inequality and poverty.\nIn East Asia the World Bank reported that \"The poverty headcount rate at the $2-a-day level is estimated to have fallen to about 27 percent [in 2007], down from 29.5 percent in 2006 and 69 percent in 1990.\" The People's Republic of China accounts for over three quarters of global poverty reduction from 1990 to 2005, which according to the World Bank is \"historically unprecedented\". China accounted for nearly half of all extreme poverty in 1990.\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa extreme poverty went up from 41% in 1981 to 46% in 2001, which combined with growing population increased the number of people living in extreme poverty from 231 million to 318 million. Statistics of 2018 shows population living in extreme conditions has declined by more than 1 billion in the last 25 years. As per the report published by the world bank on 19 September 2018 world poverty falls below 750 million.\nIn the early 1990s some of the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia experienced a sharp drop in income. The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in large declines in GDP per capita, of about 30 to 35% between 1990 and the through year of 1998 (when it was at its minimum). As a result, poverty rates tripled, excess mortality increased, and life expectancy declined. Russian president Boris Yeltsin's IMF-backed rapid privatization and austerity policies resulted in unemployment rising to double digits and half the Russian population falling into destitution by the early to mid 1990s. By 1999, during the peak of the poverty crisis, 191 million people were living on less than $5.50 a day. In subsequent years as per capita incomes recovered the poverty rate dropped from 31.4% of the population to 19.6%. The average post-communist country had returned to 1989 levels of per-capita GDP by 2005, although as of 2015 some are still far behind that. According to the World Bank in 2014, around 80 million people were still living on less than $5.00 a day.\nWorld Bank data shows that the percentage of the population living in households with consumption or income per person below the poverty line has decreased in each region of the world except Middle East and North Africa since 1990:\nIn July 2023, a group of over 200 economists from 67 countries, including Jayati Ghosh, Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty, sent a letter to the United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and World Bank president Ajay Banga warning that \"extreme poverty and extreme wealth have risen sharply and simultaneously for the first time in 25 years.\" In 2024, Oxfam reported that roughly five billion people have become poorer since 2020 and warned that current trends could postpone global poverty eradication for 229 years.\nCharacteristics.\nThe effects of poverty may also be causes of poverty thus creating a cycle of poverty operating across multiple levels, individual, local, national and global.\nHealth.\nOne-third of deaths around the world\u2014some 18 million people a year or 50,000 per day\u2014are due to poverty-related causes. People living in developing nations, among them women and children, are overrepresented among the global poor and these effects of severe poverty. Those living in poverty suffer disproportionately from hunger or even starvation and disease, as well as lower life expectancy. According to the World Health Organization, hunger and malnutrition are the single gravest threats to the world's public health and malnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases.\nAlmost 90% of maternal deaths during childbirth occur in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, compared to less than 1% in the developed world. Those who live in poverty have also been shown to have a far greater likelihood of having or incurring a disability within their lifetime. Infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis can perpetuate poverty by diverting health and economic resources from investment and productivity; malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations and AIDS decreases African growth by 0.3\u20131.5% annually.\nStudies have shown that poverty impedes cognitive function although some of these findings could not be replicated in follow-up studies. One hypothesised mechanism is that financial worries put a severe burden on one's mental resources so that they are no longer fully available for solving complicated problems. The reduced capability for problem solving can lead to suboptimal decisions and further perpetuate poverty. Many other pathways from poverty to compromised cognitive capacities have been noted, from poor nutrition and environmental toxins to the effects of stress on parenting behavior, all of which lead to suboptimal psychological development. Neuroscientists have documented the impact of poverty on brain structure and function throughout the lifespan.\nInfectious diseases continue to blight the lives of the poor across the world. 36.8 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, with 954,492 deaths in 2017.\nPoor people often are more prone to severe diseases due to the lack of health care, and due to living in non-optimal conditions. Among the poor, girls tend to suffer even more due to gender discrimination. Economic stability is paramount in a poor household; otherwise they go in an endless loop of negative income trying to treat diseases. Often when a person in a poor household falls ill it is up to the family members to take care of them due to limited access to health care and lack of health insurance. The household members often have to give up their income or stop seeking further education to tend to the sick member. There is a greater opportunity cost imposed on the poor to tend to someone compared to someone with better financial stability. Increased access to healthcare and improved health outcomes help prevent individuals from falling into poverty due to medical expenses.\nHunger.\nIt is estimated that 1.02 billion people go to bed hungry every night. According to the Global Hunger Index, Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest child malnutrition rate of the world's regions over the 2001\u20132006 period.\nPoor people spend a greater portion of their budgets on food than wealthy people and, as a result, they can be particularly vulnerable to increases in food prices. For example, in late 2007, increases in the price of grains led to food riots in some countries. Threats to the supply of food may also be caused by drought and the water crisis. Intensive farming often leads to a vicious cycle of exhaustion of soil fertility and decline of agricultural yields. Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals is the elimination of hunger and undernutrition by 2030.\nMental health.\nA psychological study has been conducted by four scientists during inaugural Convention of Psychological Science. The results find that people who thrive with financial stability or fall under low socioeconomic status (SES) tend to perform worse cognitively due to external pressure imposed upon them. The research found that stressors such as low income, inadequate health care, discrimination, and exposure to criminal activities all contribute to mental disorders. This study also found that children exposed to poverty-stricken environments have slower cognitive thinking. It is seen that children perform better under the care of their parents and that children tend to adopt speaking language at a younger age. Since being in poverty from childhood is more harmful than it is for an adult, it is seen that children in poor households tend to fall behind in certain cognitive abilities compared to other average families. The World Health Organization highlights that social determinants such as income inequality, lack of access to quality education, unemployment, insecure housing, and exposure to violence are strongly associated with poor mental health outcomes. These structural factors contribute significantly to disparities in mental well-being across different populations.\nFor a child to grow up emotionally healthy, children under three need \"A strong, reliable primary caregiver who provides consistent and unconditional love, guidance, and support. Safe, predictable, stable environments. Ten to 20 hours each week of harmonious, reciprocal interactions. This process, known as attunement, is most crucial during the first 6\u201324 months of infants' lives and helps them develop a wider range of healthy emotions, including gratitude, forgiveness, and empathy. Enrichment through personalized, increasingly complex activities\". \nIn a 1996 survey, 67% of children from disadvantaged inner cities said they had witnessed a serious assault, and 33% reported witnessing a homicide. 51% of fifth graders from New Orleans (median income for a household: $27,133) have been found to be victims of violence, compared to 32% in Washington, DC (mean income for a household: $40,127). Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who live in it. The Great Smoky Mountains Study was a ten-year study that was able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.\nEducation.\nResearch has found that there is a high risk of educational underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This is often a process that begins in primary school. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, children in poverty are at a higher risk than advantaged children for retention in their grade, special deleterious placements during the school's hours and not completing their high school education. Advantage breeds advantage. There are many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. One is the conditions in which they attend school. Schools in poverty-stricken areas have conditions that hinder children from learning in a safe environment. Researchers have developed a name for areas like this: an \"urban war zone\" is a poor, crime-laden district in which deteriorated, violent, even warlike conditions and underfunded, largely ineffective schools promote inferior academic performance, including irregular attendance and disruptive or non-compliant classroom behavior. Because of poverty, \"Students from low-income families are 2.4 times more likely to drop out than middle-income kids, and over 10 times more likely than high-income peers to drop out.\"\nFor children with low resources, the risk factors are similar to others such as juvenile delinquency rates, higher levels of teenage pregnancy, and economic dependency upon their low-income parent or parents.\nFamilies and society who submit low levels of investment in the education and development of less fortunate children end up with less favorable results for the children who see a life of parental employment reduction and low wages. Higher rates of early childbearing with all the connected risks to family, health and well-being are major issues to address since education from preschool to high school is identifiably meaningful in a life.\nPoverty often drastically affects children's success in school. A child's \"home activities, preferences, mannerisms\" must align with the world and in the cases that they do not do these, students are at a disadvantage in the school and, most importantly, the classroom. Therefore, it is safe to state that children who live at or below the poverty level will have far less success educationally than children who live above the poverty line. Poor children have a great deal less healthcare and this ultimately results in many absences from school. Additionally, poor children are much more likely to suffer from hunger, fatigue, irritability, headaches, ear infections, flu, and colds. These illnesses could potentially restrict a student's focus and concentration.\nIn general, the interaction of gender with poverty or location tends to work to the disadvantage of girls in poorer countries with low completion rates and social expectations that they marry early, and to the disadvantage of boys in richer countries with high completion rates but social expectations that they enter the labour force early. At the primary education level, most countries with a completion rate below 60% exhibit gender disparity at girls' expense, particularly poor and rural girls. In Mauritania, the adjusted gender parity index is 0.86 on average, but only 0.63 for the poorest 20%, while there is parity among the richest 20%. In countries with completion rates between 60% and 80%, gender disparity is generally smaller, but disparity at the expense of poor girls is especially marked in Cameroon, Nigeria and Yemen. Exceptions in the opposite direction are observed in countries with pastoralist economies that rely on boys' labour, such as the Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia.\nShelter.\nThe right to housing is argued to be a human right. Higher density and lower cost housing affords low-income families and first-time homebuyers with more and less expensive shelter opportunities, reducing economic inequality.\nThe geographic concentration of poverty is argued to be a factor in entrenching poverty. William J. Wilson's \"concentration and isolation\" hypothesis states that the economic difficulties of the very poorest African Americans are compounded by the fact that as the better-off African Americans move out, the poorest are more and more concentrated, having only other very poor people as neighbors. This concentration causes social isolation, Wilson suggests, because the very poor are now isolated from access to the job networks, role models, institutions, and other connections that might help them escape poverty. Gentrification means converting an aging neighborhood into a more affluent one, as by remodeling homes. Landlords then increase rent on newly renovated real estate; the poor people cannot afford to pay high rent, and may need to leave their neighborhood to find affordable housing. The poor also get more access to income and services, while studies suggest poor residents living in gentrifying neighbourhoods are actually less likely to move than poor residents of non-gentrifying areas.\nPoverty increases the risk of homelessness. Slum-dwellers, who make up a third of the world's urban population, live in a poverty no better, if not worse, than rural people, who are the traditional focus of the poverty in the developing world, according to a report by the United Nations.\nThere are over 100 million street children worldwide. Most of the children living in institutions around the world have a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty. It is speculated that, flush with money, for-profit orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. Many child advocates maintain that this can harm children's development by separating them from their families and that it would be more effective and cheaper to aid close relatives who want to take in the orphans.\nUtilities.\nThe poor tend to pay more for access to utilities and ensuring the availability of water, sanitation, energy, and telecommunication services such as broadband internet service help in reducing poverty in general.\nWater and sanitation.\nAs of 2012, 2.5 billion people lack access to sanitation services and 15% practice open defecation. Even while providing latrines is a challenge, people still do not use them even when available. Bangladesh had half the GDP per capita of India but has a lower mortality from diarrhea than India or the world average, with diarrhea deaths declining by 90% since the 1990s. By strategically providing pit latrines to the poorest, charities in Bangladesh sparked a cultural change as those better off perceived it as an issue of status to not use one. The vast majority of the latrines built were then not from charities but by villagers themselves.\nWater utility subsidies tend to subsidize water consumption by those connected to the supply grid, which is typically skewed towards the richer and urban segment of the population and those outside informal housing. As a result of heavy consumption subsidies, the price of water decreases to the extent that only 30%, on average, of the supplying costs in developing countries is covered.\nThis results in a lack of incentive to maintain delivery systems, leading to losses from leaks annually that are enough for 200 million people.\nThis also leads to a lack of incentive to invest in expanding the network, resulting in much of the poor population being unconnected to the network. Instead, the poor buy water from water vendors for, on average, about 5 to 16 times the metered price. However, subsidies for laying new connections to the network rather than for consumption have shown more promise for the poor.\nFinancial services.\nFor low-income individuals and families, access to credit can be limited, predatory, or both, making it difficult to find the financial resources they need to invest in their futures.\nPrejudice and exploitation.\nCultural factors, such as discrimination of various kinds, can negatively affect productivity such as age discrimination, stereotyping, discrimination against people with physical disability, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, and caste discrimination. Children are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as adults. Women are the group suffering from the highest rate of poverty after children, in what is referred to as the feminization of poverty. In addition, the fact that women are more likely to be caregivers, regardless of income level, to either the generations before or after them, exacerbates the burdens of their poverty. Those in poverty have increased chances of incurring a disability which leads to a cycle where disability and poverty are mutually reinforcing.\nMax Weber and some schools of modernization theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence that suggest that values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement into and out of poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. A 2018 report on poverty in the United States by UN special rapporteur Philip Alston asserts that caricatured narratives about the rich and the poor (that \"the rich are industrious, entrepreneurial, patriotic and the drivers of economic success\" while \"the poor are wasters, losers and scammers\") are largely inaccurate, as \"the poor are overwhelmingly those born into poverty, or those thrust there by circumstances largely beyond their control, such as physical or mental disabilities, divorce, family breakdown, illness, old age, unlivable wages or discrimination in the job market.\" Societal perception of people experiencing economic difficulty has historically appeared as a conceptual dichotomy: the \"good\" poor (people who are physically impaired, disabled, the \"ill and incurable,\" the elderly, pregnant women, children) vs. the \"bad\" poor (able-bodied, \"valid\" adults, most often male).\nAccording to experts, many women become victims of trafficking, the most common form of which is prostitution, as a means of survival and economic desperation. Deterioration of living conditions can often compel children to abandon school to contribute to the family income, putting them at risk of being exploited. For example, in Zimbabwe, a number of girls are turning to sex in return for food to survive because of the increasing poverty. According to studies, as poverty decreases there will be fewer and fewer instances of violence. Some data such as the UNICEF reports and also a research called \"Echo of Silence\" show that there is a close correlation between economic poverty and early marriage. In some developing countries, child marriage is considered an economic measure that can improve the family\u2019s poor condition, strengthen family bonds.\nPoverty reduction.\nVarious poverty reduction strategies are broadly categorized based on whether they make more of the basic human needs available or whether they increase the disposable income needed to purchase those needs. Some strategies such as building roads can both bring access to various basic needs, such as fertilizer or healthcare from urban areas, as well as increase incomes, by bringing better access to urban markets.\nReducing relative poverty would also involve reducing inequality. Oxfam, among others, has called for an international movement to end extreme wealth concentration arguing that the concentration of resources in the hands of the top 1% depresses economic activity and makes life harder for everyone else, particularly for those at the bottom of the economic ladder. And they say that the gains of the world's billionaires in 2017, which amounted to $762 billion, were enough to end extreme global poverty seven times over. Methods to reduce inequality and relative poverty include progressive taxation, which involves increasing tax rates on high-income earners, wealth taxes, which involve taxing a portion of an individual's net worth above a certain threshold, reducing payroll taxes, which are taxes on employees and employers and reducing this provides workers greater take-home pay and allows employers to spend more on wages and salaries, and increasing the labor share, which is the proportion of business income paid as wages and salaries instead of allocated to shareholders as profit.\nIncreasing the supply of basic needs.\nImproving technology.\nAgricultural technologies such as nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, new seed varieties and new irrigation methods have dramatically reduced food shortages in modern times by boosting yields past previous constraints. Before the Industrial Revolution, poverty had been mostly accepted as inevitable as economies produced little, making wealth scarce. Geoffrey Parker wrote that \"In Antwerp and Lyon, two of the largest cities in western Europe, by 1600 three-quarters of the total population were too poor to pay taxes, and therefore likely to need relief in times of crisis.\" The initial industrial revolution led to high economic growth and eliminated mass absolute poverty in what is now considered the developed world. Mass production of goods in places such as rapidly industrializing China has made what were once considered luxuries, such as vehicles and computers, inexpensive and thus accessible to many who were otherwise too poor to afford them.\nOther than technology, advancements in sciences such as medicine help provide basic needs better. For example, Sri Lanka had a maternal mortality rate of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today, but reduced it to 0.5\u20130.6% in the 1950s and to 0.6% in 2006 while spending less each year on maternal health because it learned what worked and what did not. Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive and educational measures have been made to disseminate what works, such as the Copenhagen Consensus. Cheap water filters and promoting hand washing are some of the most cost effective health interventions and can cut deaths from diarrhea and pneumonia. Fortification with micronutrients was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus. For example, iodised salt costs 2 to 3 cents per person a year while even moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy shaves off 10 to 15 IQ points.\nState funding.\nCertain basic needs are argued to be better provided by the state. Universal healthcare can reduce the overall cost of providing healthcare by having a single payer negotiating with healthcare providers and minimizing administrative costs. It is also argued that subsidizing essential goods such as fuel is less efficient in helping the poor than providing that same money as income grants to the poor.\nGovernment revenue can be diverted away from basic services by corruption. Funds from aid and natural resources are often sent by government individuals for money laundering to overseas banks which insist on bank secrecy, instead of spending on the poor. A Global Witness report asked for more action from Western banks as they have proved capable of stanching the flow of funds linked to terrorism.\nIllicit capital flight, such as corporate tax avoidance, from the developing world is estimated at ten times the size of aid it receives and twice the debt service it pays, with one estimate that most of Africa would be developed if the taxes owed were paid. About 60 per cent of illicit capital flight from Africa is from transfer mispricing, where a subsidiary in a developing nation sells to another subsidiary or shell company in a tax haven at an artificially low price to pay less tax. An African Union report estimates that about 30% of sub-Saharan Africa's GDP has been moved to tax havens. Solutions include corporate \"country-by-country reporting\" where corporations disclose activities in each country and thereby prohibit the use of tax havens where no effective economic activity occurs.\nDeveloping countries' debt service to banks and governments from richer countries can constrain government spending on the poor. For example, Zambia spent 40% of its total budget to repay foreign debt, and only 7% for basic state services in 1997. One of the proposed ways to help poor countries has been debt relief. Zambia began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from a 2005 round of debt relief. Since that round of debt relief, private creditors accounted for an increasing share of poor countries' debt service obligations. This complicated efforts to renegotiate easier terms for borrowers during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic because the multiple private creditors involved say they have a fiduciary obligation to their clients such as the pension funds.\nThe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as primary holders of developing countries' debt, attach structural adjustment conditionalities in return for loans which are generally geared toward loan repayment with austerity measures such as the elimination of state subsidies and the privatization of state services. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices. In Malawi, almost 5 million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid but after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as Malawi became a major food exporter.\nDistressed securities funds, also known as \"vulture funds\", buy up the debt of poor nations cheaply and then sue countries for the full value of the debt plus interest which can be ten or 100 times what they paid. They may pursue any companies which do business with their target country to force them to pay to the fund instead. Considerable resources are diverted on costly court cases. For example, a court in Jersey ordered the Democratic Republic of the Congo to pay an American speculator $100 million in 2010. Now, the UK, Isle of Man and Jersey have banned such payments.\nImproving access to available basic needs.\nEven with new products, such as better seeds, or greater volumes of them, such as industrial production, the poor still require access to these products. Improving road and transportation infrastructure helps solve this major bottleneck. In Africa, it costs more to move fertilizer from an African seaport inland than to ship it from the United States to Africa because of sparse, low-quality roads, leading to fertilizer costs two to six times the world average. Microfranchising models such as door-to-door distributors who earn commission-based income or Coca-Cola's successful distribution system are used to disseminate basic needs to remote areas for below market prices.\nThe loss of basic needs providers emigrating from impoverished countries has a damaging effect. As of 2004, there were more Ethiopia-trained doctors living in Chicago than in Ethiopia and this often leaves inadequately less skilled doctors to remain in their home countries. Proposals to mitigate the problem include compulsory government service for graduates of public medical and nursing schools and promoting medical tourism so that health care personnel have more incentive to practice in their home countries. Telehealth is the use of telecommunication technologies to deliver health services. For remotes communities in Alaska, telehealth has been found to reduce travel costs alone for the state by $13 million in 2021 and, according to one study, reduced the life expectancy gap between whites and American Indian population in Alaska from eight to five years.\nPreventing overpopulation.\nPoverty and lack of access to birth control can lead to population increases that put pressure on local economies and access to resources, amplifying other economic inequality and creating increase poverty. Better education for both men and women, and more control of their lives, reduces population growth due to family planning. According to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), those who receive better education can earn money for their lives, thereby strengthening economic security.\nIncreasing personal income.\nThe following are strategies used or proposed to increase personal incomes among the poor. Raising farm incomes is described as the core of the antipoverty effort as three-quarters of the poor today are farmers. Estimates show that growth in the agricultural productivity of small farmers is, on average, at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest half of a country's population as growth generated in nonagricultural sectors.\nIncome grants.\nA guaranteed minimum income ensures that every citizen will be able to purchase a desired level of basic needs. One method is through a basic income (or negative income tax), which is a system of social security, that periodically provides each citizen, rich or poor, with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on. Studies of large cash-transfer programs in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi show that the programs can be effective in increasing consumption, schooling, and nutrition, whether they are tied to such conditions or not. \nEmployment subsidies go to those already employed and this has shown to have little effect on those at the lowest income levels. Proponents argue that a basic income is more efficient than a minimum wage and unemployment benefits, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing losses in efficiency. In 1968, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce a system of income guarantees. Winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics, with often diverse political convictions, who support a basic income include Herbert A. Simon, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Solow, Milton Friedman, Jan Tinbergen, James Tobin\nand James Meade. \nIncome grants are argued to be vastly more efficient in extending basic needs to the poor than subsidizing supplies whose effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. With cars and other appliances, the wealthiest 20% of Egypt uses about 93% of the country's fuel subsidies. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education. A 2008 study concluded that the money spent on in-kind transfers in India in a year could lift all India's poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly. Additionally, in aid models, the famine relief model increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving cash or cash vouchers to the hungry to pay local farmers instead of buying food from donor countries, often required by law, as it wastes money on transport costs. \nThe primary obstacle argued against direct cash transfers is the impractically for poor countries of such large and direct transfers. In practice, payments determined by complex iris scanning are used by war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan, while India modified its subsidies in favor of direct transfers. Central bank digital currencies are argued to be an efficient tool in direct cash transfers to the poor as it can reach the unbanked and be more cost effective without having to physically send money and without needing an intermediary such as a bank.\nEconomic freedoms.\nCorruption often leads to many civil services being treated by governments as employment agencies to loyal supporters and so it could mean going through 20 procedures, paying $2,696 in fees, and waiting 82 business days to start a business in Bolivia, while in Canada it takes two days, two registration procedures, and $280 to do the same. Such costly barriers favor big firms at the expense of small enterprises, where most jobs are created. Often, businesses have to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which is, in effect, a tax on business. Noted reductions in poverty in recent decades has occurred in China and India mostly as a result of the abandonment of collective farming in China and the ending of the central planning model known as the License Raj in India.\nThe World Bank concludes that governments and feudal elites extending to the poor the right to the land that they live and use are 'the key to reducing poverty' citing that land rights greatly increase poor people's wealth, in some cases doubling it. Providing secure tenure to land ownership creates incentives to improve the land and thus improves the welfare of the poor. It is argued that those in power have an incentive to not secure property rights as they are able to then more easily take land or any small business that does well to their supporters.\nGreater access to markets brings more income to the poor. Road infrastructure has a direct impact on poverty. Additionally, migration from poorer countries resulted in $328 billion sent from richer to poorer countries in 2010, more than double the $120 billion in official aid flows from OECD members. In 2011, India got $52 billion from its diaspora, more than it took in foreign direct investment.\nFinancial services.\nMicroloans, made famous by the Grameen Bank, is where small amounts of money are loaned to borrowers who typically lack collateral, steady employment, or a verifiable credit history.. However, microlending has been criticized for making hyperprofits off the poor even from its founder, Muhammad Yunus, and in India, Arundhati Roy asserts that some 250,000 debt-ridden farmers have been driven to suicide.\nThose in poverty place more importance on having a safe place to save money than on receiving loans. Additionally, a large part of microfinance loans are spent not on investments but on products that would usually be paid by a checking or savings account. A large portion of the poor are unbanked because it is often not profitable to open bank accounts for the poor. One altervative option is the postal savings system. Another option is mobile banking which utilizes the wide availability of mobile phones. This usually involves a network of agents of mostly shopkeepers who would take deposits in cash and translate these onto an account on customers' phones. Cash transfers can be done between phones and issued back in cash with a small commission, making remittances safer. Central bank digital currencies could allow, even in areas without internet access, digital transactions with little or no cost using simple feature phones.\nEducation and vocational training.\nFree education through public education or charitable organizations rather than through tuition, from early childhood education through the tertiary level provides children from low-income families who may not otherwise have the financial resources with better job prospects and higher earnings and promotes social mobility. Job training and vocational education programs that target training in technical skills in specific industries or occupations that are in high demand can reduce poverty and wealth concentration.\nStrategies to provide education cost effectively include deworming children, which costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl absenteeism could be cut in half by simply providing free sanitary towels. Paying for school meals is argued to be an efficient strategy in increasing school enrollment, reducing absenteeism and increasing student attention.\nDesirable actions such as enrolling children in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a form of aid known as conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families to stay at home rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.\nObstacles.\nEconomist William Easterly diagnoses a problem with the traditional approach to poverty reduction, whose advocates he calls \"Planners.\" He notes that $2.3 trillion were spent on foreign aid in five decades, yet twelve-cent medicines were not able to be given to children to prevent malaria-related deaths and three dollars were not given to new mothers to help prevent millions of child deaths. He argues that even though the aid was well-meaning, it failed to bring results because \"Planners,\" and not \"Searchers,\" are supplying it.\nAntipoverty institutions.\nIntergovernmental organizations.\nIn 2015 all UN Member States adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as part of the Post-2015 Development Agenda, which sought to create a future global development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals, which were goals set in 2000 and were meant to be achieved by 2015. Most targets are to be achieved by 2030, although some have no end date. Goal 1 is to \"end poverty in all its forms everywhere\". It aims to eliminate extreme poverty for all people measured by daily wages less than $1.25 and at least half the total number of men, women, and children living in poverty. In addition, social protection systems must be established at the national level and equal access to economic resources must be ensured. Strategies have to be developed at the national, regional and international levels to support the eradication of poverty.\nDevelopment banks.\nA \"development financial institution\", also known as a \"development bank\", is a financial institution that provides risk capital for economic development projects on a non-commercial basis. They are often established and owned by governments to finance projects that would otherwise not be able to get financing from commercial lenders. These include international financial institutions such as the World Bank, which is the largest development bank.\nNongovernmental organizations.\nIn recent decades, the number of nongovernmental organizations has increased dramatically. The high level forums on aid effectiveness which were coordinated by the OECD found that this leads to fragmentation where too many agencies were financing too many small projects using too many different procedures and that the civil service of the donor countries were overstretched producing reports for each.\nA major proportion of aid from donor nations is tied, mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the donor country. US law requires food aid be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on transport. Domestic NGOs have more expertise in their respective regions and have less overhead and thus tend to be more efficient in delivering aid but receive less funding. Housing only for a Western aid worker in Ethiopia is enough to pay the salaries of four or five local NGO workers, for example. Bilateral government aid programs such as US Agency for International Development aim to increase their share of funding to go through 'local partners', called 'localizing'. The obstacles include accountability where it is easier to delegate responsibility for spending on one international NGO than having to track tax payer money going to numerous smaller domestic NGOs.\nFor-profit institutions.\nThe \"Poverty industrial complex\" refers to for-profit companies taking over roles previously held by government agencies. The incentive for profit in such companies has been argued to interfere with efficiently providing the needed services. Aid from richer nations increasingly go through for profit institutions. Such hospitals are found to imprison patients and retain corpses for non-payment of fees.\nCauses.\nThe cause of poverty is a highly ideologically charged subject, as different causes point to different remedies. Very broadly speaking, the socialist tradition locates the roots of poverty in problems of distribution and the use of the means of production as capital benefiting individuals, and calls for redistribution of wealth as the solution, whereas the neoliberal school of thought holds that creating conditions for profitable private investment is the solution. Neoliberal think tanks have received extensive funding, and proponents of neoliberalism have been able to apply their ideas in highly indebted countries in the global South as a condition for receiving emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund.\nThe existence of inequality is in part due to a set of self-reinforcing behaviors that all together constitute one aspect of the cycle of poverty. These behaviors, in addition to unfavorable, external circumstances, also explain the existence of the Matthew effect, which not only exacerbates existing inequality, but is more likely to make it multigenerational. Widespread, multigenerational poverty is an important contributor to civil unrest and political instability. For example, Raghuram G. Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, has blamed the ever-widening gulf between the rich and the poor, especially in the US, to be one of the main fault lines which caused the financial institutions to pump money into subprime mortgages\u2014on political behest, as a palliative and not a remedy, for poverty\u2014causing the subprime mortgage crisis. In Rajan's view the main cause of the increasing gap between high income and low income earners was lack of equal access to higher education for the latter.\nA number of articles have found linkages between poverty reduction and good governance. Some find that economic growth is more impactful at reducing poverty in well governed countries. Others find that there is a direct effect of governance on poverty reduction. Research also finds that governance above a certain level contributes to poverty reduction. Others still find a relationship between governance and poverty even controlling for economic growth, indicating an independent association. A data based scientific empirical research, which studied the impact of dynastic politics on the level of poverty of the provinces, found a positive correlation between dynastic politics and poverty; i.e. the higher proportion of dynastic politicians in power in a province leads to higher poverty rate. There is significant evidence that these political dynasties use their political dominance over their respective regions to enrich themselves, using methods such as graft or outright bribery of legislators. \nMost economic historians believe that throughout most of human history, extreme poverty was the norm for roughly 90% of the population, and only with the emergence of industrialization in the 19th century were the masses of people lifted out of it.1 This narrative is advanced by, among others, Martin Ravallion, Nicholas Kristof, and Steven Pinker.\nSome academics, including Dylan Sullivan and Jason Hickel have challenged this contemporary mainstream narrative on poverty, arguing that extreme poverty was not the norm throughout human history, but emerged during \"periods of severe social and economic dislocation\", including high European feudalism and the apex of the Roman Empire, and that it expanded significantly after 1500 with the emergence of colonialism and the beginnings of capitalism, stating that \"the expansion of the capitalist world-system caused a dramatic and prolonged process of impoverishment on a scale unparalleled in recorded history.\" Sullivan and Hickel assert that only with the rise of anti-colonial and socialist political movements in the 20th century did human welfare begin to see significant improvement. However, all scholars and intellectuals, including Hickel, agree that the incomes of the poorest people in the world have increased since 1981. Nevertheless, Sullivan and Hickel argue that poverty persists under contemporary global capitalism (in spite of it being highly productive) because masses of working people are cut off from common land and resources, have no ownership or control over the means of production, and have their labor power \"appropriated by a ruling class or an external imperial power,\" thereby maintaining extreme inequality.\nMarian L. Tupy, a senior fellow of the Cato Institute, a right-libertarian think tank, criticized Hickel's claim that people before industrialization lived well without a lot of monetary income, stating that \"The evidence from contemporary accounts and academic research\" shows that \"Compared to today, Western European living standards prior to industrialization were miserably low.\", that \"poverty was widespread and it was precisely the onset of industrialization and global trade \u2026 which led to poverty alleviation first in the West and then in the Rest.\" and that both Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, while advocating for socialism, recognized that the capitalist system developing around them had improved people's material conditions.\nEthics.\nHuman rights.\nIt is sometimes argued that poverty is a violation of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights state that \u201cEveryone, as a member of society, has the right to social security.\u201d\nEnvironmentalism.\nThe poor tend to suffer most from environmental degradation caused by reckless exploitation of natural resources by the rich. For example, it is estimated that 92% of accumulated greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to countries from the Global North while 8% of emissions are attributed to countries from the Global South. However, developing countries suffer 99% of the casualties attributable to climate change. This unfair distribution of environmental burdens and benefits has generated the global environmental justice and climate justice movement.\nThe Brundtland Report concluded that poverty causes environmental degradation, while other theories like environmentalism of the poor conclude that the global poor may be the most important force for sustainability. A 2013 World Bank report estimated that climate change was likely to hinder future attempts to reduce poverty with a 2016 UN report claiming that by 2030, an additional 122 million more people could be driven to extreme poverty because of climate change. The possible impacts of a temperature rise of 2\u00a0\u00b0C include: regular food shortages in Sub-Saharan Africa; a deficiency in water availability, with droughts predicted to happen much faster and last longer; degradation and loss of reefs in South East Asia, resulting in reduced fish stocks; and coastal communities and cities more vulnerable to increasingly violent storms. \nGreen imperialism is the term used to refer to influencing poorer nations in the name of environmentalism. Green colonialism is grabbing of land in the name of environmentalism. Fortress conservation is the conservation model based on the belief that biodiversity protection is best achieved by creating protected areas in isolation from humans and this has led to the eviction of indigenous people.\nSpirituality.\nAmong some individuals, poverty is considered a necessary or desirable condition, which must be embraced to reach certain spiritual, moral, or intellectual states. Poverty is often understood to be an essential element of renunciation in religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism (only for monks, not for lay persons) and Jainism, whilst in Christianity, in particular Roman Catholicism, it is one of the evangelical counsels. Some Christian communities, such as the Simple Way, the Bruderhof, and the Amish value voluntary poverty; some even take a vow of poverty, similar to that of the traditional Catholic orders, in order to live a more complete life of discipleship. Another example is mendicancy, where one chooses to rely chiefly or exclusively on alms to survive. The main aim of giving up things of the materialistic world is to withdraw oneself from sensual pleasures (as they are considered illusionary and only temporary in some religions\u2014such as the concept of dunya in Islam).\nPope Paul VI referred to \"the spirit of poverty\" as a fundamental characteristic of a Christian life, while Pope Benedict XVI distinguished between \"poverty \"chosen\"\" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and \"poverty \"to be fought\"\" (unjust and imposed poverty).\nVoluntary poverty can also be the result of solidarity with the poor. Benedict XVI considered that such solidarity is a necessary condition to fight effectively to eradicate the non-voluntary poverty.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"Inequality and Poverty \u2013 OECD\".

{"id": "64961", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64961", "title": "Titan (board game)", "text": "Fantasy board game\nTitan is a fantasy board game for two to six players, designed by Jason B. McAllister and David A. Trampier. Each player controls an army of mythological creatures such as gargoyles, unicorns, and griffons, led by a single titan. The titan is analogous to the king in chess in that the death of a titan eliminates that player and his entire army from the game. The player controlling the last remaining titan wins the game. The game was first published in 1980 by \"Gorgonstar\"; the rights were later licensed to \"Avalon Hill\" and \"Valley Games\". Upon its release, the game received positive reviews.\nBackground.\n\"Titan\" was first published in 1980 by \"Gorgonstar\", a small company created by the designers. Soon afterward, the rights were licensed to \"Avalon Hill\", which made several minor revisions and published the game for many years. \"Titan\" went out of print in 1998, when \"Avalon Hill\" was sold and ceased operations. A new edition of \"Titan\", with artwork by Kurt Miller and Mike Doyle and produced by Canadian publisher \"Valley Games\" became available in late 2008. The Valley Games edition was adapted to the Apple iPad and released on December 21, 2011.\nGameplay.\nThe main game board consists of 96 interlocking hexes, each with a specified terrain type and color.\nEach player's army is organized into \"legions\" of one to seven creature tokens stacked face down. The legions move according to die roll, subject to restrictions marked on the board\u2014Most board spaces can only be entered or exited from certain directions. No two legions may occupy the same hex on the game board.\nIf a legion moves into a hex which is occupied by an enemy legion, the two legions must fight to the death on a tactical map specific to that terrain. The terrain usually gives a battle advantage to creatures native there.\nEach time a legion moves, it may recruit one additional creature if the territory to which it moves is native to at least one creature already in the legion. For example, centaurs may recruit in the plains and woods, ogres may recruit in the marsh and hills.\nEach creature may recruit its own kind, but multiple weak creatures may be eligible to recruit more powerful creatures. For example, one ogre in the marsh or hills may recruit only another ogre, but two ogres in the marsh may recruit a troll, while three ogres in the hills may recruit a minotaur.\nThe victor of each battle is awarded points based on strength of the creatures vanquished. For each hundred points a player earns, he is awarded an angel, a strong creature which can teleport from its own legion to aid an attacking legion in future battles. Also, for each one hundred points a player earns, his titan becomes stronger in battle. Finally, at four hundred points, a player's titan gains the ability to teleport on a roll of six, attacking any enemy legion regardless of position.\nStrategy.\nDesigner McAllister writes of the importance of blocking in \"Titan\" and arranging one's legions in a defensive position to prevent another player from easy movement of recruiting. There are a variety of general strategies players use to traverse the map with their legions. One example of this is what McCallister calls \"the caravan\", which is keeping legions following each other on the outer ring of map spaces where they can protect and support each other. Given that the outer ring is not the most desirable place for recruiting, the Caravan is usually used as a short term strategy for protecting forces until a better recruiting area can be found.\nWriter Gerald Lientz emphasizes that the main strategic rule of movement is to keep one's enemies in front of you at all times. Since the movement system often allows movement in one direction but not another, the worst situation a player can find oneself in is one in which an opponent can follow one's legions with no risk of retaliation.\nUnlike many wargames, players are not allowed to examine opposing enemy forces (they are hidden under legion markers) until they engage them in battle. This secrecy allows opportunities for deception and bluffing.\nReception.\nIn the November 1980 edition of \"The Space Gamer\" (No. 33) Jerry Epperson commented that \"If you don't mind having a fragile, 'blood-bath' game in your collection, \"Titan\" is definitely for you. If you do not care for slaughter-type games, the \"Titan\" will be a little rough, especially for [the price].\"\nIn the April 1981 edition of \"Dragon\" (No. 48), Bill Fawcett found the production values of the first edition produced by GorgonStar were questionable, especially the playing pieces silk-screened with a water-soluble ink that came off on fingers as they were handled. But he found the game itself \"is a very sophisticated fantasy game with original ideas, clearly written rules and a very playable game system.\" He did note that the game was not perfect. \"Play occasionally gets bogged down. This is especially true in games where everyone plays conservatively and avoids battles, which will commonly occur the first few times new players try the game.\" Fawcett concluded that \"All in all, \"Titan\" is far higher in quality than were the first efforts some companies that are now major manufacturers.\"\nIn the December 1982 edition of \"The Space Gamer\" (No. 58), Paul Manz commented that \"\"Titan\" is a refreshing change from involved FRP games. For those of you who haven't tried a fantasy game, \"Titan\" is a good one to start out with.\"\nCharles Vasey reviewed \"Titan\" for \"White Dwarf\" #46, and stated that \"The game is not only tightly designed, it is pretty vicious. If you go into a fight, then only one side can survive, and if the attacker does not win within a certain time-frame in each battle he is defeated.\"\nIn the October 1983 edition of \"Imagine\", Paul Cockburn stated that \"in the end, you have an abstracted wargame, attractively packaged, in which the pieces do represent something, as in chess, but where this has no importance to the playing of the game, just to its \"feel\". And \"Titan\" has a very good feel to it indeed. It is the best boardgame I have come across for a while.\"\nIn Issue 4 of \"AGS\", Deke Young noted that the game \"is both easy to learn and impossible to master. A player can build up a tremendous position yet still be eliminated as quickly by another player.\" Young called the movement rules \"hard to understand at first\" but concluded, \"\"Titan\" is a game every gamer can enjoy.\"\nIn a retrospective review of \"Titan\" in \"Black Gate\", John ONeill said \"There are classic fantasy games and there are classic fantasy games. Jai Kamani and David A. Trampier's \"Titan\", a massive game of conflict between mythological armies of ogres, unicorns, griffons, and other creatures, was perhaps the most ubiquitous fantasy game of my youth.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64962", "revid": "48296011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64962", "title": "Fred Astaire", "text": "American dancer, actor and singer (1899\u20131987)\nFred Astaire (born Frederick Austerlitz, May 10, 1899 \u2013 June 22, 1987) was an American dancer, actor, singer, musician, choreographer, and presenter, whose career in stage, film, and television spanned 76 years. He is widely regarded as the \"greatest popular-music dancer of all time\". He received an Honorary Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Grammy Award.\nAs a dancer, he was known for his uncanny sense of rhythm, creativity, effortless presentation, and tireless perfectionism, which was sometimes a burden to co-workers. His dancing showed elegance, grace, originality, and precision. He drew influences from many sources, including tap, classical dance, and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle. His trademark style greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance. He called his eclectic approach \"outlaw style\", a following of an unpredictable and instinctive muse. His motion was economical, yet endlessly nuanced. \nAstaire's most memorable dancing partnership was with Ginger Rogers, with whom he co-starred in ten Hollywood musicals during the classic age of Hollywood cinema, including \"Top Hat\" (1935), \"Swing Time\" (1936), and \"Shall We Dance\" (1937). Astaire's fame grew in films like \"Holiday Inn\" (1942), \"Easter Parade\" (1948), \"The Band Wagon\" (1953), \"Funny Face\" (1957), and \"Silk Stockings\" (1957). For his performance in Irwin Allen and John Guillermin's disaster film, \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), Astaire received his only competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\nAstaire received several honors including an Academy Honorary Award in 1950, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1960, the Film Society of Lincoln Center tribute in 1973, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1978, and AFI Life Achievement Award in 1980. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1972, and the Television Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Astaire the fifth-greatest male star of Classic Hollywood cinema in 100 Years... 100 Stars.\nLife and career.\n1899\u20131916: Early life and career.\nFred Astaire was born Frederick Austerlitz on May 10, 1899, in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of Johanna \"Ann\" (n\u00e9e\u00a0Geilus; 1878\u20131975) and Friedrich \"Fritz\" Emanuel Austerlitz (1868\u20131923), known in the U.S. as Frederic Austerlitz. Astaire's mother was born in the U.S. to Lutheran German immigrants from East Prussia and Alsace. Astaire's father was born in Linz in Upper Austria, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to Catholic parents who had converted from Judaism.\nAstaire's father Fritz Austerlitz arrived in New York City at the age of 25 on October 26, 1893, at Ellis Island. Fritz was seeking work in the brewing trade and moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he was employed by the Storz Brewing Company. Astaire's mother dreamed of escaping Omaha by means of her children's talents. Astaire's older sister Adele was an instinctive dancer and singer early in her childhood. Johanna planned a brother-and-sister act, common in vaudeville at the time, for her two children. Although Fred refused dance lessons at first, he easily mimicked his older sister's steps and learned piano, accordion and clarinet.\nWhen their father lost his job, the family moved to New York City in January 1905 to launch the show business careers of the children. They began training at the Alvieni Master School of the Theatre and Academy of Cultural Arts. Fred and Adele's mother suggested that they change their name to Astaire, as she felt that Austerlitz was reminiscent of the Battle of Austerlitz. Family legend attributes the name to an uncle surnamed L'Astaire.\nThe children were taught dance, speaking and singing in preparation for developing an act. Their first act was called \"Juvenile Artists Presenting an Electric Musical Toe-Dancing Novelty\". Astaire wore a top hat and tails in the first half and a lobster outfit in the second. In an interview, Astaire's daughter Ava Astaire McKenzie, observed that he was often given a top hat to make him look taller. In November 1905, the comedic act debuted in Keyport, New Jersey at a \"tryout theater.\" The local paper wrote that \"the Astaires are the greatest child act in vaudeville.\"\nAs a result of their father's salesmanship, Fred and Adele Astaire landed a major contract and played the Orpheum Circuit in the Midwest, West and some Southern cities in the U.S. Soon Adele grew to at least three inches taller than Fred, and the pair began to look incongruous. The family decided to take a two-year break from show business to let time take its course and to avoid trouble from the Gerry Society and the child-labor laws of the time. In 1912, Astaire became an Episcopalian. The career of the Astaire siblings resumed with mixed fortunes, but with increasing skill and polish, as they began to incorporate tap dancing into their act. From vaudeville dancer Aurelio Coccia they learned the tango, waltz and other ballroom dances popularized by Vernon and Irene Castle. Some sources state that the Astaire siblings appeared in a 1915 film titled \"Fanchon, the Cricket\", starring Mary Pickford, but the Astaires have consistently denied this.\nBy age 14, Astaire had assumed the musical responsibilities for their act. He first met George Gershwin, who was working as a song plugger for Jerome H. Remick's music publishing company, in 1916. Astaire had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas. Their chance meeting was to affect the careers of both artists profoundly. Astaire was always on the lookout for new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his quest for novelty and perfection.\n1917\u20131933: Stage career on Broadway and in London.\nThe Astaires broke into Broadway in 1917 with \"Over the Top\", a patriotic revue, and performed for U.S. and Allied troops at this time as well. They followed up with several more shows. Of their work in \"The Passing Show of 1918\", Heywood Broun wrote: \"In an evening in which there was an abundance of good dancing, Fred Astaire stood out\u00a0... He and his partner, Adele Astaire, made the show pause early in the evening with a beautiful loose-limbed dance.\"\nAdele contributed intuitive talent, whereas Fred's perfectionism provided support, as he took care of the planning behind the choreography and the logistics of the shows. He considered his skills were shadowed by his sister's talent, so he focused on boosting her performance. By the late 1920s he would begin to develop a dancing style of his own, gaining a greater psychological independence from his sister.\nDuring the 1920s, Fred and Adele appeared on Broadway and the London stage. They won popular acclaim with the theater crowd on both sides of the Atlantic in shows such as Jerome Kern's \"The Bunch and Judy\" (1922), George and Ira Gershwin's \"Lady, Be Good\" (1924), and \"Funny Face\" (1927) and later in \"The Band Wagon\" (1931). Astaire's tap dancing was recognized by then as among the best. For example, Robert Benchley wrote in 1930, \"I don't think that I will plunge the nation into war by stating that Fred is the greatest tap-dancer in the world.\" While in London, Fred studied piano at the Guildhall School of Music alongside his friend and colleague No\u00ebl Coward, and in 1926, was one of the judges at the 'Charleston Championship of the World ' competition at the Royal Albert Hall, where Lew Grade was declared the winner.\nAfter the close of \"Funny Face\", the Astaires went to Hollywood for a screen test at Paramount Pictures, but the siblings were unhappy with the results and, although they were close to signing a deal to make a movie adaptation of \"Funny Face,\" the project was abandoned.\nThey split in 1932 when Adele married her first husband, Lord Charles Cavendish, the second son of the 9th Duke of Devonshire. Fred went on to achieve success on his own on Broadway and in London with \"Gay Divorce\" (later made into the film \"The Gay Divorcee\") while considering offers from Hollywood. The end of the partnership was traumatic for Astaire but stimulated him to expand his range.\nFree of the brother-sister constraints of the former pairing and working with new partner Claire Luce, Fred created a romantic partnered dance to Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\", which had been written for \"Gay Divorce\". Luce stated that she had to encourage him to take a more romantic approach: \"Come on, Fred, I'm not your sister, you know.\" The success of the stage play was credited to this number, and when recreated in \"The Gay Divorcee\" (1934), the film version of the play, it ushered in a new era in filmed dance. Recently, film footage taken by Fred Stone of Astaire performing in \"Gay Divorce\" with Luce's successor, Dorothy Stone, in New York in 1933 was uncovered by dancer and historian Betsy Baytos and now represents the earliest known performance footage of Astaire.\n1933\u20131939: Astaire and Ginger Rogers at RKO.\nAccording to Hollywood folklore, a screen test report on Astaire for RKO Radio Pictures, now lost along with the test, is reported to have read: \"Can't sing. Can't act. Balding. Can dance a little.\" The producer of the Astaire\u2013Rogers pictures, Pandro S. Berman, claimed he had never heard the story in the 1930s and that it only emerged years afterward. Astaire later clarified, insisting that the report had read: \"Can't act. Slightly bald. \"Also dances\".\" In any case, the test was clearly disappointing, and David O. Selznick, who had signed Astaire to RKO and commissioned the test, stated in a memo, \"I am uncertain about the man, but I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is so tremendous that it comes through even on this wretched test.\"\nHowever, this did not affect RKO's plans for Astaire. They lent him for a few days to MGM in 1933 for his significant Hollywood debut in the successful musical film \"Dancing Lady\". In the movie, he appeared as himself dancing with Joan Crawford. On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth-billed Ginger Rogers in the 1933 Dolores del R\u00edo vehicle \"Flying Down to Rio\". In a review, \"Variety\" magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire's presence:\nThe main point of \"Flying Down to Rio\" is the screen promise of Fred Astaire\u00a0... He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer, he remains in a class by himself. The latter observation will be no news to the profession, which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.\nHaving already been linked to his sister Adele on stage, Astaire was initially very reluctant to become part of another dance team. He wrote his agent, \"I don't mind making another picture with her, but as for this 'team' idea, it's 'out!' I've just managed to live down one partnership and I don't want to be bothered with any more.\" However, he couldn't help noticing the public appeal of the Astaire\u2013Rogers pairing. Pandro Berman finally persuaded him to continue the partnership by giving him 10% of the Astaire-Rogers profits. After Astaire began receiving these dividend payments, according to Berman, there was no further objection from Astaire.\nAstaire and Rogers made nine films together at RKO: \"Flying Down to Rio\" (1933), \"The Gay Divorcee\" (1934), \"Roberta\" (1935, in which Astaire also demonstrates his oft-overlooked piano skills with a spirited solo on \"I Won't Dance\"), \"Top Hat\" (1935), \"Follow the Fleet\" (1936), \"Swing Time\" (1936), \"Shall We Dance\" (1937), \"Carefree\" (1938), and \"The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle\" (1939). Six out of the nine Astaire\u2013Rogers musicals became the biggest moneymakers for RKO; all of the films brought a certain prestige and artistry that all studios coveted at the time. Their partnership elevated them both to stardom; as Katharine Hepburn reportedly said, \"He gives her class and she gives him sex.\" \nInnovations.\nAstaire revolutionized dance on film by having complete autonomy over its presentation. He is credited with two important innovations in early film musicals. First, he insisted that a closely tracking dolly camera film a dance routine in as few shots as possible, typically with just four to eight cuts, while holding the dancers in full view at all times. This gave the illusion of an almost stationary camera filming an entire dance in a single shot. Astaire famously quipped: \"Either the camera will dance, or I will.\" Astaire maintained this policy from \"The Gay Divorcee\" in 1934 until his last film musical, \"Finian's Rainbow\" in 1968, when director Francis Ford Coppola overruled him.\nAstaire's style of dance sequences allowed the viewer to follow the dancers and choreography in their entirety. This style differed strikingly from those in the Busby Berkeley musicals. Those musicals' sequences were filled with extravagant aerial shots, dozens of cuts for quick takes, and zooms on areas of the body such as a chorus row of arms or legs.\nAstaire's second innovation involved the context of the dance; he was adamant that all song and dance routines be integral to the plotlines of the film. Instead of using dance as a spectacle as Busby Berkeley did, Astaire used it to move the plot along. Typically, an Astaire picture would include at least three standard dances. One would be a solo performance by Astaire, which he termed his \"sock solo\". Another would be a partnered comedy dance routine. Finally, he would include a partnered romantic dance routine.\nAssessment of the Rogers partnership.\nDance commentators Arlene Croce, Hannah Hyam and John Mueller consider Rogers to have been Astaire's greatest dance partner, a view shared by Hermes Pan and Stanley Donen. Film critic Pauline Kael adopts a more neutral stance, while \"Time\" magazine film critic Richard Schickel writes \"The nostalgia surrounding Rogers\u2013Astaire tends to bleach out other partners.\"\nMueller sums up Rogers's abilities as follows:\nRogers was outstanding among Astaire's partners not because she was superior to others as a dancer, but because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began\u00a0... the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable.\nAccording to Astaire, \"Ginger had never danced with a partner before \"Flying Down to Rio\". She faked it an awful lot. She couldn't tap and she couldn't do this and that\u00a0... but Ginger had style and talent and improved as she went along. She got so that after a while everyone else who danced with me looked wrong.\" On p.\u00a0162 of his book \"Ginger: Salute to a Star\", author Dick Richards quotes Astaire saying to Raymond Rohauer, curator of the New York Gallery of Modern Art, \"Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually, she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success.\"\nIn 1976, British talk-show host Michael Parkinson asked Astaire who his favorite dancing partner was, on \"Parkinson\". At first, Astaire refused to answer but ultimately he said \"Excuse me, I must say Ginger was certainly, the one. You know, the most effective partner I ever had. Everyone knows.\"\nRogers described Astaire's uncompromising standards extending to the whole production: \"Sometimes he'll think of a new line of dialogue or a new angle for the story\u00a0... they never know what time of night he'll call up and start ranting enthusiastically about a fresh idea\u00a0... No loafing on the job on an Astaire picture, and no cutting corners.\"\nDespite their success, Astaire was unwilling to have his career tied exclusively to any partnership. He negotiated with RKO to strike out on his own with \"A Damsel in Distress\" in 1937 with an inexperienced, non-dancing Joan Fontaine, unsuccessfully as it turned out. He returned to make two more films with Rogers, \"Carefree\" (1938) and \"The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle\" (1939). While both films earned respectable gross incomes, they both lost money because of increased production costs, and Astaire left RKO after being labeled \"box office poison\" by the \"Independent Theatre Owners of America\". Astaire was reunited with Rogers in 1949 at MGM for their final outing, \"The Barkleys of Broadway\", the only one of their films together to be shot in Technicolor.\n1940\u20131947: Freelance performer, early retirement.\nAstaire left RKO in 1939 to freelance and pursue new film opportunities, with mixed though generally successful outcomes. Throughout this period, Astaire continued to value the input of choreographic collaborators. Unlike the 1930s when he worked almost exclusively with Hermes Pan, he tapped the talents of other choreographers to innovate continually. His first post-Ginger dance partner was the redoubtable Eleanor Powell, considered the most exceptional female tap-dancer of her generation. They starred in \"Broadway Melody of 1940\", in which they performed a celebrated extended dance routine to Cole Porter's \"Begin the Beguine\". In his autobiography \"Steps in Time\", Astaire remarked, \"She 'put 'em down' like a man, no ricky-ticky-sissy stuff with Ellie. She really knocked out a tap dance in a class by herself.\"\nHe was hired by independent producer Boris Morros to star in a musical comedy, \"Second Chorus\" (1940). Morros had released a previous production through RKO, but with RKO no longer interested in Astaire, Morros had to find another distributor. Paramount accepted the film for release. Astaire received strong support from new dancing partner Paulette Goddard, popular bandleader Artie Shaw, and character actors Burgess Meredith and Charles Butterworth, but the lightweight film was only mildly successful and did not lead to further independent productions. \"Second Chorus\" was re-released in 1946 and was an early arrival on broadcast television. It soon became the most frequently revived Fred Astaire picture (to Astaire's bemusement) and has since lapsed into the public domain. Since 1980, with the advent of home video, \"Second Chorus\" has become even more ubiquitous and is probably Fred Astaire's most widely available film.\nHarry Cohn, president of Columbia Pictures, made a practice of hiring talent that rival studios had dropped from their rosters. He engaged Fred Astaire for two pictures, in an effort to promote Cohn's own prospective musical star Rita Hayworth: \"You'll Never Get Rich\" (1941) and \"You Were Never Lovelier\" (1942). These films re-established Astaire as a major-studio attraction and launched Hayworth's starring career.\nAstaire played alongside Bing Crosby in the enormously successful \"Holiday Inn\" (1942), memorable for his virtuoso solo dance to \"Let's Say it with Firecrackers\". He returned to RKO for the wartime comedy \"The Sky's the Limit\" (1943), with 17-year-old Joan Leslie as his co-star. In the film, he introduced Arlen and Mercer's \"One for My Baby\" while dancing on a bar counter in a dark and troubled routine. Astaire choreographed this film alone and achieved modest box office success. It represented a notable departure for Astaire from his usual charming, happy-go-lucky screen persona, and confused contemporary critics.\nHis next partner, Lucille Bremer, was featured in two lavish vehicles, both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In the musical revue \"Ziegfeld Follies\" (filmed in 1944; previewed in November 1944 but held back from release until April 1946), Astaire danced with Gene Kelly to the Gershwin song \"The Babbit and the Bromide\", a song Astaire had introduced with his sister Adele back in 1927. The next film, \"Yolanda and the Thief\" (1945), was a fantasy featuring an avant-garde, surrealistic ballet. \n\"Follies\", according to MGM records, earned $3,569,000 in the United States and Canada, and $1,775,000 elsewhere, but because of its high cost, it incurred a loss to the studio of $269,000. \"Yolanda\" fared even worse, bombing at the box office.\nAlways insecure and believing his career was beginning to falter, Astaire surprised his audiences by announcing his retirement during the production of his next film, \"Blue Skies\" (1946), which reunited him with Bing Crosby. Although reportedly dissatisfied with roles where he lost the girl to Crosby, he carefully planned \"Puttin' On the Ritz\", an innovative song-and-dance routine indelibly associated with him, as his farewell dance. He then concentrated on his horse-racing interests and in 1947 founded the Fred Astaire Dance Studios, which he subsequently sold in 1966.\n1948\u20131957: MGM films and second retirement.\nAstaire's retirement did not last long. He returned to the big screen to replace an injured Gene Kelly in \"Easter Parade\" (1948) opposite Judy Garland, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford. He followed up with a final reunion with Rogers (replacing Judy Garland) in \"The Barkleys of Broadway\" (1949). Both of these films revived Astaire's popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals. \"Three Little Words\" with Vera-Ellen and Red Skelton was for MGM. \"Let's Dance\" with Betty Hutton was on loan-out to Paramount. While \"Three Little Words\" did quite well at the box office, \"Let's Dance\" was a financial disappointment. \"Royal Wedding\" (1951) with Jane Powell and Peter Lawford proved to be very successful, but \"The Belle of New York\" (1952) with Vera-Ellen was a critical and box-office disaster. \"The Band Wagon\" (1953) received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds. However, because of its high cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release.\nSoon after, Astaire, along with most of the other remaining stars at MGM, was dismissed by the studio due to the advent of television and the streamlining of film production. In 1954, Astaire was about to start work on a new musical, \"Daddy Long Legs\" (1955) with Leslie Caron at 20th Century-Fox. Then, his wife Phyllis became ill and died of lung cancer. Astaire was so desolate that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket. However, Johnny Mercer, the film's composer, and Fox studio executives convinced him that continuing to work would be the best thing for him. \"Daddy Long Legs\" was only moderately successful at the box office. His next film for Paramount, \"Funny Face\" (1957), teamed him with Audrey Hepburn and Kay Thompson. Despite the sumptuousness of the production and the good reviews from critics, the movie failed to recover its cost. Astaire's next film, \"Silk Stockings\" (1957), in which he co-starred with Cyd Charisse and his final musical for MGM, also lost money at the box office.\nAfterward, Astaire announced that he was retiring from dancing in films. His legacy at this point was 30 musical films in 25 years.\n1957\u20131981: Television specials, serious roles.\nAstaire did not retire from dancing altogether. He made a series of four highly rated Emmy Award-winning musical specials for television in 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1968. Each featured Barrie Chase, with whom Astaire enjoyed a renewed period of dance creativity. The first of these programs, 1958's \"An Evening with Fred Astaire\", won nine Emmy Awards, including \"Best Single Performance by an Actor\" and \"Most Outstanding Single Program of the Year\". It was also noteworthy for being the first major broadcast to be prerecorded on color videotape. Astaire won the Emmy for Best Single Performance by an Actor. The choice had a controversial backlash because many believed his dancing in the special was not the type of \"acting\" for which the award was designed. At one point, Astaire offered to return the award, but the Television Academy refused to consider it. A restoration of the program won a technical Emmy in 1988 for Ed Reitan, Don Kent, and Dan Einstein. They restored the original videotape, transferring its contents to a modern format and filling in gaps where the tape had deteriorated with kinescope footage.\nAstaire played Julian Osborne, a non-dancing character, in the nuclear war drama \"On the Beach\" (1959). He was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor award for his performance, losing to Stephen Boyd in \"Ben-Hur\". Astaire appeared in non-dancing roles in three other films and several television series from 1957 to 1969.\nAstaire also wrote his own autobiography, titled \"Steps in Time\", which he published in 1959.\nAstaire's last major musical film was \"Finian's Rainbow\" (1968), directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Astaire shed his white tie and tails to play an Irish rogue who believes that if he buries a crock of gold in the shadows of Fort Knox the gold will multiply. Astaire's dance partner was Petula Clark, who played his character's skeptical daughter. He described himself as nervous about singing with her, while she said she was worried about dancing with him. The film was a modest success both at the box office and among critics.\nAstaire continued to act in the 1970s. He appeared on television as the father of Robert Wagner's character, Alexander Mundy, in \"It Takes a Thief\". He appeared as \"The Baltimore Kid\" in the 1970 TV movie The Over-the-Hill Gang Rides Again. In the movie \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), he danced with Jennifer Jones and received his only Academy Award nomination, in the category of Best Supporting Actor. He voiced the mailman narrator S.D Kluger in the 1970s Rankin/Bass animated television specials \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" and \"The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town\". Astaire also appeared in the first two \"That's Entertainment!\" documentaries, in the mid-1970s. In the second compilation, aged seventy-six, he performed brief dance linking sequences with Kelly, his last dance performances in a musical film. In the summer of 1975, he made three albums in London, \"Attitude Dancing\", \"They Can't Take These Away from Me\", and \"A Couple of Song and Dance Men\", the last an album of duets with Bing Crosby. In 1976, Astaire played a supporting role, as a dog owner, in the cult movie \"The Amazing Dobermans\", co-starring Barbara Eden and James Franciscus, and played Dr. Seamus Scully in the French film \"The Purple Taxi\" (1977).\nIn 1978, he co-starred with Helen Hayes in a well received television film \"A Family Upside Down\" in which they played an elderly couple coping with failing health. Astaire won an Emmy Award for his performance. He made a well publicized guest appearance on the science-fiction television series \"Battlestar Galactica\" in 1979, as Chameleon, the possible father of Starbuck, in \"The Man with Nine Lives\", a role written for him by Donald P. Bellisario. Astaire asked his agent to obtain a role for him on \"Galactica\" because of his grandchildren's interest in the series and the producers were delighted at the opportunity to create an entire episode to feature him. This episode marked the final time that he danced on screen, in this case with Anne Jeffreys. He acted in nine different roles in \"The Man in the Santa Claus Suit\" in 1979. His final film was the 1981 adaptation of Peter Straub's novel \"Ghost Story\". This horror film was also the last for two of his most prominent castmates, Melvyn Douglas and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.\nStyle and influence.\n Astaire was a virtuoso dancer, able when called for to convey light-hearted venturesomeness or deep emotion. His technical control and sense of rhythm were astonishing. Long after the photography for the solo dance number \"I Wanna Be a Dancin' Man\" was completed for the 1952 feature \"The Belle of New York\", it was decided that Astaire's humble costume and the threadbare stage set were inadequate and the entire sequence was reshot. The 1994 documentary \"That's Entertainment! III\" shows the two performances side by side in split-screen. Frame for frame, the two performances are identical, down to the subtlest gesture.\nAstaire's execution of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality, and precision. He drew from a variety of influences, including tap, classical dance, and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle. His was a uniquely recognizable dance style that greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged. He termed his eclectic approach \"outlaw style\", an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry. His dances are economical yet endlessly nuanced. As Jerome Robbins stated, \"Astaire's dancing looks so simple, so disarming, so easy, yet the understructure, the way he sets the steps on, over or against the music, is so surprising and inventive.\" Astaire further observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Working out the steps is a very complicated process\u2014something like writing music. You have to think of some step that flows into the next one, and the whole dance must have an integrated pattern. If the dance is right, there shouldn't be a single superfluous movement. It should build to a climax and stop!\nAlthough Astaire was the primary choreographer of all his dance routines, he welcomed the input of collaborators and notably his principal collaborator Hermes Pan. But dance historian John Mueller believes that Astaire acted as the lead choreographer in his solos and partnered dances throughout his career. He notes Astaire's dance style was consistent in subsequent films made with or without the assistance of Pan. Furthermore, Astaire choreographed all the routines during his Broadway career with his sister Adele.\nFrequently, a dance sequence was built around two or three key ideas, sometimes inspired by his steps or by the music itself, suggesting a particular mood or action. Caron said that while Kelly danced close to the ground, she felt like she was floating with Astaire. Many dance routines were built around a \"gimmick\", like dancing on the walls in \"Royal Wedding\" or dancing with his shadows in \"Swing Time\". He or his collaborator would think of these routines earlier and save them for the right situation. They would spend weeks creating all the dance sequences in a secluded rehearsal space before filming would begin. They would work with a rehearsal pianist (often the composer Hal Borne) who in turn would communicate modifications to the musical orchestrators.\nHis perfectionism was legendary, but his relentless insistence on rehearsals and retakes was a burden to some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As Vincente Minnelli stated, \"He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree of all the people in the world. He will not even go to see his rushes\u00a0... He always thinks he is no good.\" As Astaire himself observed, \"I've never yet got anything 100% right. Still, it's never as bad as I think it is.\"\nMichael Kidd, Astaire's co-choreographer on the 1953 film \"The Band Wagon\", found that his own concern about the emotional motivation behind the dance was not shared by Astaire. Kidd later recounted: \"Technique was important to him. He'd say, 'Let's do the steps. Let's add the looks later.'\" Astaire declared that his own tap heroes were the Nicholas Brothers, Fayard and Harold.\nInfluence on popular song.\nExtremely modest about his singing abilities (he frequently claimed that he could not sing, but the critics rated him as among the finest), Astaire introduced some of the most celebrated songs from the Great American Songbook, in particular, Cole Porter's: \"Night and Day\" in \"Gay Divorce\" (1932); \"So Near and Yet So Far\" in \"You'll Never Get Rich\" (1941); Irving Berlin's \"Isn't This a Lovely Day?\", \"Cheek to Cheek\", and \"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\" in \"Top Hat\" (1935); \"Let's Face the Music and Dance\" in \"Follow the Fleet\" (1936); and \"Change Partners\" in \"Carefree\" (1938). He first presented Jerome Kern's \"The Way You Look Tonight\" in \"Swing Time\" (1936), the Gershwins' \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\" in \"Shall We Dance\" (1937), \"A Foggy Day\" and \"Nice Work if You Can Get it\" in \"A Damsel in Distress\" (1937), Johnny Mercer's \"One for My Baby\" from \"The Sky's the Limit\" (1943), \"Something's Gotta Give\" from \"Daddy Long Legs\" (1955); and Harry Warren and Arthur Freed's \"This Heart of Mine\" from \"Ziegfeld Follies\" (1946).\nAstaire also co-introduced a number of song classics via song duets with his partners. For example, with his sister Adele, he co-introduced the Gershwins' \"I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise\" from \"Stop Flirting\" (1923), \"Fascinating Rhythm\" in \"Lady, Be Good\" (1924), \"Funny Face\" in \"Funny Face\" (1927), and, in duets with Ginger Rogers, he presented Irving Berlin's \"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket\" in \"Follow the Fleet\" (1936), Jerome Kern's \"Pick Yourself Up\" and \"A Fine Romance\" in \"Swing Time\" (1936), along with the Gershwins' \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" from \"Shall We Dance\" (1937). With Judy Garland, he sang Irving Berlin's \"A Couple of Swells\" from \"Easter Parade\" (1948); and, with Jack Buchanan, Oscar Levant, and Nanette Fabray he delivered Arthur Schwartz's and Howard Dietz's \"That's Entertainment!\" from \"The Band Wagon\" (1953).\nAlthough he possessed a light voice, he was admired for his lyricism, diction, and phrasing\u2014the grace and elegance so prized in his dancing seemed to be reflected in his singing, a capacity for synthesis which led Burton Lane to describe him as \"the world's greatest musical performer\". Irving Berlin considered Astaire the equal of any male interpreter of his songs\u2014\"as good as Jolson, Crosby or Sinatra, not necessarily because of his voice, but for his conception of projecting a song.\" Jerome Kern considered him the supreme male interpreter of his songs.And while George Gershwin was somewhat critical of Astaire's singing abilities, he wrote many of his most memorable songs for him. In his heyday, Astaire was referenced in lyrics of songwriters Cole Porter, Lorenz Hart and Eric Maschwitz and continues to inspire modern songwriters.\nAstaire was a songwriter, with \"I'm Building Up to an Awful Letdown\" (written with lyricist Johnny Mercer) reaching number four in the Hit parade of 1936. He recorded his own \"It's Just Like Taking Candy from a Baby\" with Benny Goodman in 1940 and nurtured a lifelong ambition to be a successful popular song composer.\nIn 1952, Astaire recorded \"The Astaire Story\", a four-volume album with a quintet led by Oscar Peterson. The album, produced by Norman Granz, provided a musical overview of Astaire's career. \"The Astaire Story\" later won the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, a special Grammy award to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old and that have \"qualitative or historical significance\".\nAstaire was also mentioned by the British rock band Queen in the bridge of the song \"Man on the Prowl\", released on their 1984 album \"The Works\".\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and family.\nIn 1933, Astaire married 25-year-old Phyllis Potter (formerly Phyllis Livingston Baker [1908\u20131954]), a Boston-born New York socialite and former wife of Eliphalet Nott Potter III (1906\u20131981), despite the objections of his mother and sister. Phyllis's death from lung cancer at the age of 46 ended 21 years of marriage and left Astaire devastated. Astaire attempted to drop out of the film \"Daddy Long Legs\" (1955), offering to pay the production costs to date, but was persuaded to stay.\nIn addition to Phyllis Potter's son, Eliphalet IV (known as Peter), the Astaires had two children, Fred, Jr. (1936), and Ava (1942). Astaire's son appeared with him in the movie \"Midas Run\".\nOn June 24, 1980, at the age of 81, he married a second time. Robyn Smith was 45 years his junior and a jockey who rode for Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. (she also dated Vanderbilt in the 1970s), and appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" on July 31, 1972.\nAstaire's life has never been portrayed on film. He always refused permission for such portrayals, saying, \"However much they offer me\u2014and offers come in all the time\u2014I shall not sell.\" Astaire's will included a clause requesting that no such portrayal ever take place; he commented, \"It is there because I have no particular desire to have my life misinterpreted, which it would be.\" On December 5, 2021, Tom Holland announced that he would be portraying Astaire in an upcoming biopic.\nInterests and politics.\nIntensely private, Astaire was rarely seen on the Hollywood social scene. Instead, he devoted his spare time to his family and his hobbies, which included horse racing, playing the drums, songwriting, and golfing. He was good friends with David Niven, Randolph Scott, Clark Gable and Gregory Peck. Niven described him as \"a pixie\u2014timid, always warm-hearted, with a penchant for schoolboy jokes.\" In 1946, his horse Triplicate won the Hollywood Gold Cup and San Juan Capistrano Handicap. He remained physically active well into his eighties. He took up skateboarding in his late seventies and was awarded a life membership in the National Skateboard Society.

She is widely regarded as France's greatest popular singer and one of the most celebrated performers of the 20th century.\nHaving begun her career touring with her father at age fourteen, she was discovered in 1935 in Paris by night club owner Louis Lepl\u00e9e, and achieved her first successes in the \"Theatre de l'ABC\" among others with the song \"Mon L\u00e9gionnaire\". Owner of the ABC music hall Mitty Goldin also wrote songs for her, e.g. \"Demain\", and produced some of her songs. Her fame increased during the German occupation of France, shortly after which (in 1945) she wrote the lyrics to her signature song, \"La Vie en rose\" ('life in pink'). She became France's most popular entertainer in the late 1940s, also touring Europe, South America and the United States, where her popularity led to eight appearances on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"\nPiaf continued to perform, including several series of concerts at the Paris Olympia music hall, until a few months before her death in 1963 at age 47. Her last song, \"L'Homme de Berlin\", was recorded with her husband Th\u00e9o Sarapo in April 1963. Since her death, several documentaries and films have been produced about Piaf's life as a touchstone of French culture.\nPiaf's music was often autobiographical, and she specialized in and torch ballads about love, loss and sorrow. In addition to her signature song, her most widely known songs include \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (1960), \"Hymne \u00e0 l'amour\" (1949), \"Milord\" (1959), \"La Foule\" (1957), \"L'Accord\u00e9oniste\" (1940), and \"Padam, padam...\" (1951).\nEarly life.\n\u00c9dith Piaf's birth certificate indicates she was born in Paris on 19 December 1915, at the H\u00f4pital Tenon.\nHer birth name was \u00c9dith Giovanna Gassion. The name \"\u00c9dith\" was inspired by British nurse Edith Cavell, who was executed 2 months before \u00c9dith's birth for helping French soldiers escape from German captivity during World War I. Twenty years later, \u00c9dith's stage surname \"Piaf\" was created by her first promoter, based on a French term for 'sparrow'.\n\u00c9dith's father Louis Alphonse Gassion (1881\u20131944) was an acrobatic street performer from Normandy with a theater background. Louis's father was Victor Alphonse Gassion (1850\u20131928) and his mother was L\u00e9ontine Louise Descamps (1860\u20131937), who ran a brothel in Normandy and was known professionally as \"Maman Tine\". \u00c9dith's mother, Annetta Giovanna Maillard (1895\u20131945) was a singer and circus performer born in Italy who performed under the stage name \"Line Marsa\". Annetta's father was Auguste Eug\u00e8ne Maillard (1866\u20131912) of French descent and \u00c9dith's grandmother was Emma (A\u00efcha) Sa\u00efd Ben Mohammed (1876\u20131930), an acrobat of Kabyle and Italian descent. Annetta and Louis divorced on 4 June 1929.\nPiaf's mother abandoned her at birth, and she lived for a short time with her maternal grandmother, Emma (A\u00efcha), in Bethandy, Normandy. Her father enlisted with the French Army in 1916 to fight in World War I. By the end of the war, she was in the care of his mother, at her brothel in Bernay, Normandy. There, prostitutes helped look after Piaf. The bordello had two floors and seven rooms, and the prostitutes were not very numerous \u2013 \"about ten poor girls\", as she later described. In fact, five or six were permanent while a dozen others would join the brothel during market days and other busy days. The sub-mistress of the brothel was called \"Madam Gaby\" and Piaf considered her almost like family; later, she became godmother of Denise Gassion, Piaf's half-sister born in 1931.\nFrom the age of three to seven, Piaf was allegedly blind as a result of keratitis. According to one of her biographers, she recovered her sight after her grandmother's prostitutes pooled money to accompany her on a pilgrimage honouring Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux. Piaf claimed this resulted in a miraculous healing.\nCareer.\nEarly years (1929\u20131939).\nAt age 14, Piaf was taken by her father to join him in his acrobatic street performances all over France, where she first began to sing in public. The following year, Piaf met Simone \"M\u00f4mone\" Berteaut, who became a companion for most of her life. In a memoir, Berteaut later falsely represented herself as Piaf's half-sister. Together they toured the streets singing and earning money for themselves. She and Berteaut rented their own place. Piaf took a room at the \"Grand H\u00f4tel de Clermont\" in Paris and worked with Berteaut as a street singer around Paris and its suburbs.\nPiaf met a young man named Louis Dupont in 1932 and lived with him for a time; she became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, Marcelle \"C\u00e9celle\" Dupont, on 11 February 1933, when Piaf was seventeen. After Piaf's relationship with Dupont ended, Marcelle, who had been living with her father, contracted meningitis and died in July 1935, aged two.\nIn 1935, Piaf (then still known by her birth name of \u00c9dith Gassion) was discovered by nightclub owner Louis Lepl\u00e9e. Her singing when she met Lepl\u00e9e has been described as \"Comme un moineau\" (\"Like a Sparrow\"). Lepl\u00e9e persuaded Piaf to sing despite her extreme nervousness. This nervousness and her height of only , inspired Lepl\u00e9e to give her the nickname \"La M\u00f4me Piaf\", which is Paris slang for \"The Sparrow Kid\". Lepl\u00e9e taught Piaf about stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, which became her trademark apparel.\nPrior to Piaf's opening night, Lepl\u00e9e ran an intense publicity campaign, resulting in the attendance of many celebrities. The bandleader that evening was Django Reinhardt, with his pianist, Norbert Glanzberg. Her nightclub gigs led to her first two records produced that same year, with one of them penned by Marguerite Monnot, a collaborator throughout Piaf's life and one of her favourite composers.\nOn 6 April 1936, Lepl\u00e9e was murdered. Piaf was questioned and accused as an accessory, but acquitted. Lepl\u00e9e had been killed by mobsters with previous ties to Piaf. A barrage of negative media attention now threatened Piaf's career. To rehabilitate her image, she recruited Raymond Asso, with whom she would become romantically involved. He changed her stage name to \"\u00c9dith Piaf\", barred undesirable acquaintances from seeing her, and commissioned Monnot to write songs that reflected or alluded to Piaf's previous life on the streets.\nSecond World War (1940\u20131944).\nIn 1940, Piaf co-starred in Jean Cocteau's one-act play \"Le Bel Indiff\u00e9rent\".\nPiaf's career and fame gained momentum during the German occupation of France in World War II. She began forming friendships with prominent people, such as actor and singer Maurice Chevalier and poet Jacques Bourgeat. Piaf also performed in various nightclubs and brothels, which flourished between 1940 and 1945. Various top Paris brothels, including Le Chabanais, Le Sphinx, One Two Two, La rue des Moulins, and Chez Marguerite, were reserved for German officers and collaborating Frenchmen. Piaf was invited to take part in a concert tour to Berlin, sponsored by the German officials, together with artists such as Loulou Gast\u00e9, Raymond Souplex, Viviane Romance and Albert Pr\u00e9jean. In 1942, she was able to afford a luxury flat in a house in the upmarket 16th arrondissement of Paris area. She lived above the L'\u00c9toile de Kl\u00e9ber, a famous nightclub and bordello close to the Paris Gestapo headquarters. She was persuaded to move from there prior to the liberation.\nIn 1944, Piaf performed in the Moulin Rouge cabaret venue in Paris, where she worked with singer/actor Yves Montand and began an affair with him. \nPiaf was accused of collaborating with the German occupying forces and in October 1944 she had to testify before an \u00c9puration l\u00e9gale (post-war legal trial), as there were plans to ban her from appearing on radio transmissions. One source suggests that she was blacklisted for a period. However, her secretary Andr\u00e9e Bigard, a member of the French Resistance, spoke in her favour after the Liberation. According to Bigard, she performed several times at prisoner-of-war camps in Germany and was instrumental in helping a number of prisoners escape. In particular, at the beginning of the war, Piaf had met Michel Emer, a Jewish musician famous for the song \"L'Accord\u00e9oniste\". Piaf paid for Emer to travel into France before German occupation, where he lived in safety until the liberation. Following the trial, Piaf was quickly back performing in benefit concerts. In December 1944, she performed for the Allied forces in Marseille, alongside Montand.\nPost-war (1945\u20131955).\nPiaf wrote and performed her signature song, \"\" in 1945. This song was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.\nIn 1947, she wrote the lyrics to the song \"What Can I Do?\". It was premiered and recorded by her former lover Montand. Within a year, Montand became one of the most famous singers in France.\nDuring this time, she was in great demand and very successful in Paris as France's most popular entertainer. After the war, she became known internationally, touring Europe, the United States, and South America. In Paris, she gave Argentinian guitarist-singer Atahualpa Yupanqui \u2013 a central figure in the Argentine folk music tradition \u2013 the opportunity to share the scene, making his debut in July 1950. Piaf also helped launch the career of Charles Aznavour in the early 1950s, taking him on tour with her and recording some of his songs. At first she met with little success with American audiences, who expected a gaudy spectacle and were disappointed by Piaf's simple presentation. However, after a glowing review by influential New York critic Virgil Thomson in 1947, her popularity in the U.S. grew to the point where she eventually appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" eight times, and at Carnegie Hall twice (in 1956 and 1957).\nLater years (1955\u20131963).\nBetween January 1955 and October 1962, Piaf performed several series of concerts at the Paris Olympia music hall. Excerpts from five of these concerts (1955, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1962) were issued on vinyl record (and later on CD), and have never been out of print. In the 1961 concerts, promised by Piaf in an effort to save the venue from bankruptcy, she first sang \"Non, je ne regrette rien\". In early 1963, Piaf recorded her last song before her death, titled \"L'Homme de Berlin\".\nPersonal life.\nDuring a tour of America in 1947, Piaf met French boxing champion Marcel Cerdan and fell in love. They had an affair, which made international headlines since Cerdan was the former middleweight world champion, and at the time was married with three children. In October 1949, Cerdan boarded a flight from Paris to New York to meet Piaf. While on approach to land at Santa Maria in the Azores for a scheduled stopover, the aircraft crashed into a mountain, killing Cerdan and the other 47 people on board. In May 1950, Piaf recorded the hit song \"Hymne \u00e0 l'amour\" dedicating it to Cerdan.\nPiaf was injured in a car accident that occurred in 1951. Both Piaf and singer Charles Aznavour (her then-assistant) were passengers in the vehicle, with Piaf suffering a broken arm and two broken ribs. Her doctor prescribed the drug morphine as a treatment for arthritis, which became a dependency alongside her alcohol problems. Two more near-fatal car crashes exacerbated the situation.\nIn 1952, Piaf married her first husband, singer Jacques Pills (real name Ren\u00e9 Ducos), with Marlene Dietrich performing the matron of honour duties. During their marriage, on three occasions Pills succeeded in having Piaf attend a detox clinic. Piaf and Pills divorced in 1957. \nIn 1962, she wed Th\u00e9o Sarapo (Theophanis Lamboukas), a singer, actor, and former hairdresser who was born in France of Greek descent. Sarapo was 20 years younger than Piaf and, although latterly separated, the two remained married until Piaf's death.\nDeath.\nIn early 1963, soon after recording \"L'Homme de Berlin\" with her husband Th\u00e9o Sarapo, Piaf slipped into a coma due to liver cancer. She was taken to her villa in Plascassier on the French Riviera where she was nursed by Sarapo and her friend Simone Berteaut. Over the next few months she drifted in and out of consciousness, before dying at age 47 on 10 October 1963.\nHer last words were \"Every damn thing you do in this life, you have to pay for.\" It is said that Sarapo drove her body from Plascassier to Paris secretly, so that fans would think she had died in her hometown.\nPiaf's body is buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where her grave is among the most visited.\nFuneral and 2013 Requiem Mass.\nShortly after her death, Piaf's funeral procession drew tens of thousands of mourners onto the streets of Paris, and the ceremony at the cemetery was attended by more than 100,000 fans. According to Piaf's colleague Charles Aznavour, Piaf's funeral procession was the only time since the end of World War II that the traffic in Paris had come to a complete stop.\nHowever, at the time, Piaf had been denied a Catholic Requiem Mass by Cardinal Maurice Feltin, since she had remarried after divorce in the Orthodox Church. Fifty years later, the French Catholic Church recanted and gave Piaf a Requiem Mass in the St. Jean-Baptiste Church in Belleville, Paris (the parish into which she was born) on 10 October 2013.\nLegacy.\nFrench media have continually published magazines, books, plays, television specials and films about the star, often on the anniversary of her death. In 1969, her longtime friend Simone \"M\u00f4mone\" Berteaut published a biography titled \"Piaf.\" This biography contained the false claim that Berteaut was Piaf's half-sister. In 1967, the Association of the Friends of \u00c9dith Piaf was formed, followed by the inauguration of the Place \u00c9dith Piaf in Belleville in 1978. Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina named a small planet, 3772 Piaf, in her honor.\nA fan and author of two Piaf biographies operates the Mus\u00e9e \u00c9dith Piaf, a two-room museum in Paris. The museum is located in the fan's apartment and has operated since 1977.\nA concert titled \"Piaf: A Centennial Celebration\" was held at The Town Hall in New York City on 19 December 2015, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Piaf's birth. The events was hosted by Robert Osborne and produced by Daniel Nardicio and Andy Brattain. Performers included Little Annie, Gay Marshall, Amber Martin, Marilyn Maye, Meow Meow, Elaine Paige, Molly Pope, Vivian Reed, Kim David Smith, and Aaron Weinstein.\nAt the 2024 Olympic Summer Games opening ceremony, Canadian singer Celine Dion performed \"L'Hymne \u00e0 l'amour\".\nBiographies.\nPiaf's life has been the subject of numerous films, including:\nDocumentaries about Piaf's life include:\nIn 1978, a play titled \"Piaf\" (by English playwright Pam Gems) began a run of 165 performances in London and New York.\nIn 2023, Warner Music Group (WMG) announced a new biopic of Piaf that would be narrated by an artificial intelligence program that has been trained to replicate Piaf's voice. The project has been conducted in partnership with the Piaf estate, which supplied the recordings used in the process.\nDiscography.\nIn the pre-LP era Piaf recorded singles for Polydor, Columbia Graphophone and Decca.\nThe following titles are compilations of Piaf's songs and not reissues of the titles released while Piaf was active.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prolific in film since the late 1970s, she is known for her pioneering portrayals of action heroines in blockbusters and for her various roles in independent films. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including a British Academy Film Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Grammy Award, in addition to nominations for three Academy Awards, four Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Tony Award.\nBorn in New York City, Weaver is the daughter of American television executive Pat Weaver and English actress Elizabeth Inglis. She made her screen debut with a minor role in the romantic comedy film \"Annie Hall\" (1977), before landing her breakthrough role as Ellen Ripley in the science fiction horror film \"Alien\" (1979). She reprised the role in the sequel \"Aliens\" (1986) earning a landmark nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and in two more films for the franchise. Ripley is regarded as a significant female protagonist in cinema history. Her other franchise roles include Dana Barrett in the \"Ghostbusters\" films (1984\u20132021) and Dr. Grace Augustine and Kiri in the \"Avatar\" film series (2009\u2013present), which rank among the highest-grossing films of all time.\nIn 1989, Weaver won two Golden Globes and two simultaneous Oscar nominations for her roles as Dian Fossey in \"Gorillas in the Mist\" and an executive in \"Working Girl\" (both 1988); she also became the first actor to win two Golden Globes for acting in the same year. She then won the British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in \"The Ice Storm\" (1997). Her other film roles include \"The Year of Living Dangerously\" (1982), \"Copycat\" (1995), \"Galaxy Quest\" (1999), \"The Village\" (2004), \"Vantage Point\" (2008), \"Chappie\" (2015), and \"A Monster Calls\" (2016). She also had voice roles in the Pixar animated films \"WALL-E\" (2008) and \"Finding Dory\" (2016).\nOn stage, Weaver's Broadway performances include \"The Constant Wife\" (1975), \"Hurlyburly\" (1984), \"Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike\" (2013), and \"The Tempest\" (2025); her performance in \"Hurlyburly\" earned her a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. On television, she received Emmy Award nominations for her roles in the horror film \"\" (1998), the drama film \"Prayers for Bobby\" (2009), the miniseries \"Political Animals\" (2013), and for narrating the National Geographic documentary \"Secrets of the Whales\" (2021). Her other television projects include the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero miniseries \"The Defenders\" (2017) and the drama miniseries \"The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart\" (2023).\nEarly life and education.\nSusan Alexandra Weaver was born in New York City on October 8, 1949, the daughter of English actress Elizabeth Inglis (1913\u20132007) and American television executive Pat Weaver (1908\u20132002). Her father served as president of NBC from 1953 to 1955, during which time he created \"The Today Show\". Pat's brother, Doodles Weaver, was a comedian and contributor to \"Mad\". She is of Dutch, English, German, Irish and Scottish descent through her father.\nAt the age of 14, Weaver began using the name \"Sigourney\" after she took it from a minor character in \"The Great Gatsby\". She briefly attended the Brearley School and Chapin School in New York before arriving at the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she developed an early interest in performing. One of her early roles was in a school adaptation of the poem \"The Highwayman\", and on another occasion she played a Rudolph Valentino character in an adaptation of \"The Sheik\". She was also involved in theatrical productions of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"You Can't Take It with You\" during one summer in Southbury, Connecticut. Known for her height, she reportedly reached by the age of 11, which had a negative impact on her self-esteem; she recalled feeling like \"a giant spider\" and never having \"the confidence to ever think [she] could act\".\nIn 1967, shortly before turning 18, Weaver visited Israel and volunteered on a kibbutz for several months. Upon returning to the United States, she attended Sarah Lawrence College. After her freshman year, she transferred to Stanford University as an English major. At Stanford, she was extensively involved in theater. She performed with a group in Palo Alto named \"The Company\", doing Shakespeare plays and \"commedia dell'arte in a covered wagon\" around the Bay Area, the nature of which she considered \"outrageous\". She \"dressed like an elf and lived in a tree house\" and avoided Stanford's drama department as she believed their productions were too \"stuffy\" and \"safe\". She had planned to enter Stanford's Ph.D. English program and eventually pursue a career as a writer or a journalist, but changed her mind after getting frustrated by the \"deadly dry\" honors courses. She eventually graduated in 1972 with a BA in English. She subsequently applied to the Yale School of Drama, performing Bertolt Brecht's \"Saint Joan of the Stockyards\" at her audition, and was accepted.\nWeaver admitted that she had a difficult time at Yale. She was not fond of the shows at Yale Repertory Theatre, and had little luck getting lead roles in school productions. Some of her acting teachers referred to her as \"talentless\" and advised her to stick to comedy. She later said she pulled through due to her time at the Yale Cabaret, and with the help of friends such as Christopher Durang, who kept casting her in his plays. She graduated from Yale with an MFA in 1974.\nCareer.\n1970s: Initial work and breakthrough.\nWeaver performed in the first production of the Stephen Sondheim musical \"The Frogs\" while at Yale in 1974, alongside Larry Blyden and fellow students Meryl Streep and Durang. She was briefly an understudy in a John Gielgud production of \"Captain Brassbound's Conversion\" thereafter. She also acted in numerous original plays by Durang. In 1974 she made her Broadway debut in the William Somerset Maugham play \"The Constant Wife\" acting opposite Ingrid Bergman. Before her on-screen breakthrough, she had appeared only in commercials, a few television roles (including an appearance in the soap opera \"Somerset\"), and had a small part in the Woody Allen-directed romantic comedy-drama \"Annie Hall\" (1977). Her originally more substantial \"Annie Hall\" role was scaled back due to her commitment to the Durang play \"Titanic\". &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"One of the real pleasures of \"Alien\" is to watch the emergence of both Ellen Ripley as a character and Sigourney Weaver as a star.\"\n- Ty Burr, \"The Boston Globe\", 29 October 2003\nWeaver appeared two years later as Warrant Officer / Lieutenant Ripley in Ridley Scott's blockbuster film \"Alien\" (1979), in a role initially designated to co-star British-born actress Veronica Cartwright until a late change in casting. Cartwright stated to World Entertainment News Network (WENN) that she was in England ready to start work on \"Alien\" when she discovered that she would be playing the navigator Lambert in the project, and Weaver had been given the lead role of Ellen Ripley. Reviews of the film were initially mixed, but it has since been ranked among the greatest science fiction horror films and is Weaver's first film to be inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Film critic Gene Siskel called Weaver \"an actress who should become a major star,\" and Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" said that Weaver \"begins the action looking girlish and serious, but changes into the toughly self-reliant woman who defined her subsequent roles. Her career evolves before our very eyes.\" Among other accolades, she was nominated for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles at the 33rd British Academy Film Awards.\n1980s: Stardom and acclaim.\nWeaver appeared in an off-Broadway production of Durang's comedy \"Beyond Therapy\" in 1981, which was directed by then-fledgling director Jerry Zaks. She next appeared opposite Mel Gibson as British Embassy officer Jill Bryant in the Peter Weir directed romantic drama \"The Year of Living Dangerously\" (1982) which was released to critical acclaim. Roger Ebert opined, \"Weaver has a less interesting role but is always an interesting actress\". In 1984 she returned to Broadway acting in the David Rabe play \"Hurlyburly\" acting opposite William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Cynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller, Ron Silver, and Judith Ivey. The production was directed by Mike Nichols with Weaver taking on the role of Darlene, a scatterbrained photojournalist who gets involved with two roommates. The role earned Weaver a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. That same year she took the female leading role Dana Barrett in the comedy films \"Ghostbusters\" (1984) and reprised her role in \"Ghostbusters II\" (1989) acting alongside Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.\nWeaver reprised the role of Ellen Ripley seven years later in the sequel to \"Alien\", similarly titled \"Aliens\" (1986) directed by James Cameron. Critic Roger Ebert wrote \"Weaver, who is onscreen almost all the time, comes through with a very strong, sympathetic performance: She's the thread that holds everything together.\" \"Variety\" said that, at that point, she was the only actress who could \"open\" an action movie. For \"Aliens\", she won the Saturn Award for Best Actress and earned her first nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.\nIn 1988, Weaver starred as primatologist Dian Fossey in the biographical drama \"Gorillas in the Mist\". The same year, she appeared opposite Harrison Ford in a supporting role as main antagonist Katharine Parker in the comedy-drama \"Working Girl\". Both these films earned Weaver Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture for her two roles that year. At the Golden Globes that year, Weaver was one of three actresses to win in Best Actress, alongside Jodie Foster and Shirley MacLaine, in a three-way tie. Weaver received simultaneous Academy Award nominations in 1988\u2014Best Actress for \"Gorillas in the Mist\" and Best Supporting Actress for \"Working Girl\". She was the first of four actresses (as of 2023) to have won two Golden Globes in the same year.\n1990s: Continued awards success.\nWeaver returned to the big screen with \"Alien 3\" (1992) and Ridley Scott's \"\" (1992) in which she played the role of Queen Isabella. In the early 1990s, Weaver appeared in several films including \"Dave\" opposite Kevin Kline and Frank Langella. In 1994, she starred in Roman Polanski's drama \"Death and the Maiden\" as Paulina Escobar. She played the role of agoraphobic criminal psychologist Helen Hudson in the film \"Copycat\" (1995).
