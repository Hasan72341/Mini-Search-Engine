Many critics praised her \"bel canto\" technique, wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations. Her repertoire ranged from classical \"opera seria\" to the \"bel canto\" operas of Donizetti, Bellini, and Rossini, and further to the works of Verdi and Puccini, and in her early career to the music dramas of Wagner. Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as \"La Divina\" (\"The Divine One\").\nBorn in Manhattan and raised in Astoria, Queens, New York City, to Greek immigrant parents, she was raised by an overbearing mother who had wanted a son. Maria received her musical education in Greece at age 13 and later established her career in Italy. Forced to deal with the exigencies of 1940s wartime poverty and with near-sightedness that left her nearly blind on stage, she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career. She underwent a mid-career weight loss, which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career.\nThe press exulted in publicizing Callas's temperamental behavior, the alleged Callas\u2013Tebaldi rivalry, and her love affair with Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Onassis's wife, Athina \"Tina\" Onassis Niarchos, divorced him when she discovered that he was having an affair with Callas. \nAlthough her dramatic life and personal tragedy have often overshadowed Callas the artist in the popular press, her artistic achievements were such that Leonard Bernstein called her \"the Bible of opera\", and her influence so enduring that, in 2006, \"Opera News\" wrote of her: \"Nearly thirty years after her death, she's still the definition of the diva as artist\u2014and still one of classical music's best-selling vocalists.\"\nHer ashes were scattered over the Aegean Sea on 3 June 1979, fulfilling one of her last wishes.\nEarly life and education.\nFamily life, childhood and move to Greece.\nThe name on Callas's New York birth certificate is Sophie Cecilia Kalos, although she was christened Maria Anna Cecilia Sophia Kalogeropoulou (). She was born at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital (now the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center) on December 2, 1923, to Greek parents Elmina Evangelia \"Litsa\" (n\u00e9e\u00a0Demes, originally Dimitriadou; c.\u20091894\u20131982) and George Kalogeropoulos (c.\u20091881\u20131972). Callas's father had shortened the surname Kalogeropoulos, first to Kalos and subsequently to Callas to make it more manageable.\nGeorge and Litsa Callas were an ill-matched couple from the beginning. George was easy-going and unambitious, with no interest in the arts, and Litsa was vivacious and socially ambitious and had dreamed of a life in the arts, which her middle-class parents had stifled in her childhood and youth. Litsa's father, Petros Dimitriadis (1852\u20131916), was in failing health when Litsa introduced George to her family. Petros, distrustful of George, warned his daughter, \"You will never be happy with him. If you marry that man, I will never be able to help you.\" Litsa ignored his warning but soon realized that her father was right. The situation was aggravated by George's philandering and was improved neither by the birth of their daughter Yakinthi (later called \"Jackie\"), in 1917, nor the birth of their son Vassilis, in 1920. Vassilis's death from meningitis in the summer of 1922 dealt another blow to the marriage.\nIn 1923, after realizing that Litsa was pregnant again, George moved his family to the United States, a decision that Yakinthi recalled was greeted with Litsa \"shouting hysterically\" followed by George \"slamming doors\". The family left for New York in July 1923, moving first into an apartment in the heavily immigrant neighborhood of Astoria, Queens.\nLitsa was convinced that her third child would be a boy, and her disappointment at the birth of another daughter was so great that she refused even to look at her new baby for four days. Maria was christened three years later, in 1926, at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. When Maria was four, George Callas opened his own pharmacy, settling the family in Manhattan on 192nd Street in Washington Heights, where Callas grew up. Around the age of three, Maria's musical talent began to manifest itself, and after Litsa discovered that her younger daughter also had a voice, she began pressing \"Mary\" to sing. Callas later recalled, \"I was made to sing when I was only five, and I hated it.\" George was unhappy with his wife favoring their elder daughter, as well as the pressure put upon young Mary to sing and perform, and Litsa was increasingly embittered with George and his absences and infidelity and often violently reviled him in front of their children. The marriage continued to deteriorate, and in 1937 Litsa returned to Athens with her two daughters.\nRelationship with mother.\nCallas's relationship with her mother continued to erode during the years in Greece, and in the prime of her career it became a matter of great public interest, especially after a 1956 cover story in \"Time\" magazine, which focused on their relationship, and later by Litsa's book, \"My Daughter Maria Callas\" (1960). In public, Callas recalls the strained relationship with Litsa and her unhappy childhood spent singing and working at her mother's insistence, saying,\nMy sister was slim and beautiful and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted\u00a0... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years, I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.\nIn 1957, she told Chicago radio host Norman Ross Jr, \"There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.\"\nBiographer Nicholas Petsalis-Diomidis says that Litsa's hateful treatment of George in front of their young children led to resentment and dislike on Callas's part. According to both Callas's husband and her close friend Giulietta Simionato, Callas related to them that her mother, who did not work, pressed her to \"go out with various men\", mainly Italian and German soldiers, to bring home money and food during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Simionato was convinced that Callas \"managed to remain untouched\" but never forgave her mother for what she perceived as a kind of prostitution forced on her. Litsa, beginning in New York and continuing in Athens, had adopted a questionable lifestyle that included not only pushing her daughters into degrading situations to support her financially but also entertaining Italian and German soldiers during the Axis occupation.\nIn an attempt to patch things up with her mother, Callas took Litsa along on her first visit to Mexico in 1950, but this only reawakened the old frictions and resentments, and after leaving Mexico, they never met again. After a series of angry and accusatory letters from Litsa lambasting Callas's father and husband, Callas ceased communication with her mother altogether.\nA 1955 \"Time\" magazine story covered Callas's response to her mother's request for $100, \"for my daily bread.\" Callas had replied, \"Don't come to us with your troubles. I had to work for my money, and you are young enough to work, too. If you can't make enough money to live on, you can jump out of the window or drown yourself.\" Callas justified her behavior\u00a0... \"They say my family is very short of money. Before God, I say why should they blame me? I feel no guilt and I feel no gratitude. I like to show kindness, but you mustn't expect thanks, because you won't get any. That's the way life is. If some day I need help, I wouldn't expect anything from anybody. When I'm old, nobody is going to worry about me.\"\nEducation.\nCallas received her musical education in Athens. Initially, her mother tried to enroll her at the prestigious Athens Conservatoire, without success. At the audition, her voice, still untrained, failed to impress, and the conservatoire's director https:// refused to accept her without her satisfying the theoretic prerequisites (solfege). In the summer of 1937, her mother visited Maria Trivella at the younger Greek National Conservatoire, asking her to take Mary, as she was then called, as a student for a modest fee. In 1957, Trivella recalled her impression of \"Mary, a very plump young girl, wearing big glasses for her myopia\":\nThe tone of the voice was warm, lyrical, intense; it swirled and flared like a flame and filled the air with melodious reverberations like a carillon. It was by any standards an amazing phenomenon, or rather it was a great talent that needed control, technical training and strict discipline in order to shine with all its brilliance.\nTrivella agreed to tutor Callas, completely waiving her tuition fees, but no sooner had Callas started her formal lessons and vocal exercises than Trivella began to feel that Callas was not a contralto, as she had been told, but a dramatic soprano. Subsequently, they began working on raising the tessitura of her voice and to lighten its timbre. Trivella recalled Callas as\nA model student. Fanatical, uncompromising, dedicated to her studies heart and soul. Her progress was phenomenal. She studied five or six hours a day.\u00a0... Within six months, she was singing the most difficult arias in the international opera repertoire with the utmost musicality.\nOn April 11, 1938, in her public debut, Callas ended the recital of Trivella's class at the Parnassos music hall with a duet from \"Tosca\". Callas recalled that Trivella\nhad a French method, which was placing the voice in the nose, rather nasal\u00a0... and I had the problem of not having low chest tones, which is essential in \"bel canto\"\u00a0... And that's where I learned my chest tones.\nHowever, when interviewed by Pierre Desgraupes on the French program \"L'invit\u00e9e du dimanche\", Callas attributed the development of her chest voice not to Trivella but to her next teacher, the Spanish coloratura soprano Elvira de Hidalgo.\nCallas studied with Trivella for two years before her mother secured another audition at the Athens Conservatoire, with de Hidalgo. Callas auditioned with \"Ocean, Thou Mighty Monster\" from Weber's \"Oberon\". De Hidalgo recalled hearing \"tempestuous, extravagant cascades of sounds, as yet uncontrolled but full of drama and emotion\". She agreed to take her as a pupil immediately, but Callas's mother asked de Hidalgo to wait for a year, as Callas would be graduating from the National Conservatoire and could begin working. On April 2, 1939, Callas undertook the part of Santuzza in a student production of Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\" by the Greek National Opera at the Olympia Theatre, and that autumn she enrolled at the Athens Conservatoire in Elvira de Hidalgo's class.\nIn 1968 Callas told Lord Harewood,\nDe Hidalgo had the real great training, maybe even the last real training of the real \"bel canto\". As a young girl\u2014thirteen years old\u2014I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this \"bel canto\", which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it is a sort of a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, whether you like it or not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real \"bel canto\" way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the \"bel canto\" embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.\nDe Hidalgo later recalled Callas as \"a phenomenon\u00a0... She would listen to all my students, sopranos, mezzos, tenors\u00a0... She could do it all.\" Callas said that she would go to \"the conservatoire at 10 in the morning and leave with the last pupil\u00a0... devouring music\" for 10 hours a day. When asked by her teacher why she did this, her answer was that even \"with the least talented pupil, he can teach you something that you, the most talented, might not be able to do.\"\nCareer.\nEarly operatic career in Greece.\nAfter several appearances as a student, Callas began appearing in secondary roles at the Greek National Opera. De Hidalgo was instrumental in securing roles for her, allowing Callas to earn a small salary, which helped her and her family get through the difficult war years.\nCallas made her professional debut in February 1941, in the small role of Beatrice in Franz von Supp\u00e9's \"Boccaccio\". Soprano Galatea Amaxopoulou, who sang in the chorus, later recalled, \"Even in rehearsal, Maria's fantastic performing ability had been obvious, and from then on, the others started trying ways of preventing her from appearing.\" Fellow singer Maria Alkeou similarly recalled that the established sopranos Nafsika Galanou and Anna (Zoz\u00f3) Remmoundou \"used to stand in the wings while [Callas] was singing and make remarks about her, muttering, laughing, and point their fingers at her\".\nDespite these hostilities, Callas managed to continue and made her debut in a leading role in August 1942 as Tosca, going on to sing the role of Marta in Eugen d'Albert's \"Tiefland\" at the Olympia Theatre. Callas's performance as Marta received glowing reviews. Critic Spanoudi declared Callas \"an extremely dynamic artist possessing the rarest dramatic and musical gifts\", and Evangelos Magkliveras evaluated Callas's performance for the weekly \"To Radiophonon\":\nThe singer who took the part of Marta, that new star in the Greek firmament, with a matchless depth of feeling, gave a theatrical interpretation well up to the standard of a tragic actress. About her exceptional voice with its astonishing natural fluency, I do not wish to add anything to the words of Alexandra Lalaouni: 'Kalogeropoulou is one of those God-given talents that one can only marvel at.'\nFollowing these performances, even Callas's detractors began to refer to her as \"The God-Given\". Some time later, watching Callas rehearse Beethoven's \"Fidelio\", rival soprano Anna Remoundou asked a colleague \"Could it be that there is something divine and we haven't realized it?\" Following \"Tiefland\", Callas sang the role of Santuzza in \"Cavalleria rusticana\" again and followed it with \"O Protomastoras\" (Manolis Kalomiris) at the ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus at the foot of the Acropolis.\nDuring August and September 1944 Callas performed the role of Leonore in a Greek-language production of \"Fidelio\", again at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. German critic Friedrich Herzog, who attended the performances, declared Leonore Callas's \"greatest triumph\":\nWhen Maria Kaloyeropoulou's Leonore let her soprano soar out radiantly in the untrammelled jubilation of the duet, she rose to the most sublime heights\u00a0... Here she gave bud, blossom and fruit to that harmony of sound that also ennobled the art of the prima donna.\nAfter the liberation of Greece, de Hidalgo advised Callas to establish herself in Italy. Callas proceeded to give a series of concerts around Greece, and then, against her teacher's advice, she returned to America to see her father and to further pursue her career. When she left Greece on September 14, 1945, two months short of her 22nd birthday, Callas had given 56 performances in seven operas and had appeared in around 20 recitals. Callas considered her Greek career as the foundation of her musical and dramatic upbringing, saying \"When I got to the big career, there were no surprises for me.\"\nMain operatic career.\nAfter returning to the United States and reuniting with her father in September 1945, Callas made the round of auditions. In December of that year, she auditioned for Edward Johnson, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, and was favorably received: \"Exceptional voice\u2014ought to be heard very soon on stage\".\nCallas said that the Metropolitan Opera offered her \"Madama Butterfly\" and \"Fidelio\", to be performed in Philadelphia and sung in English, both of which she declined, saying that she felt too fat for \"Butterfly\" and did not like the idea of opera in English. Although this offer is not documented in the Met's records, in a 1958 interview with the \"New York Post\", Johnson confirmed that a contract was offered: \"...\u00a0but she didn't like it\u2014because of the contract, not because of the roles. She was right in turning it down\u2014it was frankly a beginner's contract.\"\nItaly, Meneghini, and Serafin.\nIn 1946, Callas was engaged to re-open the opera house in Chicago as \"Turandot\", but the company folded before opening. Basso Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, who also was to star in this opera, was aware that Tullio Serafin was looking for a dramatic soprano to cast as \"La Gioconda\" at the Arena di Verona. He later recalled the young Callas as being \"amazing\u2014so strong physically and spiritually; so certain of her future. I knew in a big outdoor theatre like Verona's, this girl, with her courage and huge voice, would make a tremendous impact.\" Subsequently he recommended Callas to retired tenor and impresario Giovanni Zenatello. During her audition, Zenatello became so excited that he jumped up and joined Callas in the act 4 duet.\nIt was in this role that Callas made her Italian debut. Upon her arrival in Verona, Callas met Giovanni Battista Meneghini, an older, wealthy industrialist, who began courting her. They married in 1949, which gave her automatic Italian citizenship, and he assumed control of her career until 1959, when the marriage dissolved. It was Meneghini's love and support that gave Callas the time needed to establish herself in Italy, and throughout the prime of her career, she went by the name of Maria Meneghini Callas.\nAfter \"La Gioconda\", Callas had no offers, and when Serafin, looking for someone to sing Isolde, called on her, she told him that she already knew the score, even though she had looked at only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory. She sight-read the opera's second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she admitted to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas's mentor and supporter.\nLord Harewood stated \"Very few Italian conductors have had a more distinguished career than Tullio Serafin, and perhaps none, apart from Toscanini, more influence\". In 1968, Callas recalled that working with Serafin was the \"really lucky\" opportunity of her career because \"he taught me that there must be an expression; that there must be a justification. He taught me the depth of music, the justification of music. That's where I really really drank all I could from this man\".\n\"I puritani\" and path to \"bel canto\".\nThe great turning point in Callas's career occurred in Venice in 1949. She was engaged to sing the role of Br\u00fcnnhilde in \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in \"I puritani\" in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas that she would be singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Br\u00fcnnhildes to sing, he told her \"I guarantee that you can\". Michael Scott's words, \"the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner's Br\u00fcnnhilde and Bellini's Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like \"folie de grandeur\"\".\nBefore the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, \"We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct \"I puritani\" with a dramatic soprano\u00a0... When can we expect a new edition of \"La traviata\" with [male baritone] Gino Bechi's Violetta?\" After the performance, one critic wrote, \"Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished\u00a0... the flexibility of her limpid, beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras.\" Franco Zeffirelli recalled, \"What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the size of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, who is one of the great coloratura sopranos of our time.\"\nScott asserts that \"Of all the many roles Callas undertook, it is doubtful if any had a more far-reaching effect.\" This initial foray into the bel canto repertoire changed the course of Callas's career and set her on a path leading to \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", \"La traviata\", \"Armida\", \"La sonnambula\", \"Il pirata\", \"Il turco in Italia\", \"Medea\", and \"Anna Bolena\", and reawakened interest in the long-neglected operas of Cherubini, Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini.\nIn the words of soprano Montserrat Caball\u00e9:\nShe opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was sleeping not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has given us the chance, those who follow her, to do things that were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.\nAs with \"I puritani\", Callas learned and performed Cherubini's \"Medea\", Giordano's \"Andrea Ch\u00e9nier\" and Rossini's \"Armida\" on a few days' notice. Throughout her career, Callas displayed her vocal versatility in recitals that juxtaposed dramatic soprano arias alongside coloratura pieces, including in a 1952 RAI recital in which she opened with \"Lady Macbeth's\" letter scene, followed by the \"Mad Scene\" from \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", then Abigaille's treacherous recitative and aria from \"Nabucco\", finishing with the \"Bell Song\" from \"Lakm\u00e9\" capped by a ringing high E \"in alt\" (E6).\nImportant debuts.\nAlthough by 1951, Callas had sung at all the major theatres in Italy, she had not yet made her official debut at Italy's most prestigious opera house, Teatro alla Scala in Milan. According to composer Gian Carlo Menotti, Callas had substituted for Renata Tebaldi in the role of \"Aida\" in 1950, and La Scala's general manager, Antonio Ghiringhelli, had taken an immediate dislike to Callas.\nMenotti recalls that Ghiringhelli had promised him any singer he wanted for the premiere of \"The Consul\", but when he suggested Callas, Ghiringhelli said that he would never have Callas at La Scala except as a guest artist. However, as Callas's fame grew, and especially after her great success in \"I vespri siciliani\" in Florence, Ghiringhelli had to relent: Callas made her official debut at La Scala in Verdi's \"I vespri siciliani\" on opening night in December 1951, and this theatre became her artistic home throughout the 1950s. La Scala mounted many new productions specially for Callas by directors including Herbert von Karajan, Margherita Wallmann, Franco Zeffirelli and, most importantly, Luchino Visconti. Visconti stated later that he began directing opera only because of Callas, and he directed her in lavish new productions of \"La vestale\", \"La traviata\", \"La sonnambula\", \"Anna Bolena\" and \"Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride\". Callas was instrumental in arranging Franco Corelli's debut at La Scala in 1954, where he sang Licinio in Spontini's \"La vestale\" opposite Callas's Julia. The two had sung together for the first time the year previously in Rome in a production of \"Norma\". Anthony Tommasini wrote that Corelli had \"earned great respect from the fearsomely demanding Callas, who, in Mr Corelli, finally had someone with whom she could act.\" The two collaborated several more times at La Scala, singing opposite each other in productions of \"Fedora\" (1956), \"Il pirata\" (1958) and \"Poliuto\" (1960). Their partnership continued throughout the rest of Callas's career.\nThe night of the day she married Meneghini in Verona, she sailed for Argentina to sing at the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires. Callas made her South American debut in Buenos Aires on May 20, 1949, during the European summer opera recess. \"Aida\", \"Turandot\" and \"Norma\" roles were directed by Serafin, supported by Mario Del Monaco, Fedora Barbieri and Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. These were her only appearances on this world-renowned stage. Her debut in the United States was five years later in Chicago in 1954, and \"with the Callas \"Norma\", Lyric Opera of Chicago was born.\"\nHer Metropolitan Opera debut, opening the Met's seventy-second season on October 29, 1956, was again with \"Norma\", but was preceded by an unflattering cover story in \"Time\" magazine, which rehashed all of the Callas clich\u00e9s, including her temper, her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi, and especially her difficult relationship with her mother. As she had done with Lyric Opera of Chicago, on November 21, 1957, Callas gave a concert to inaugurate what then was billed as the Dallas Civic Opera, and helped establish that company with her friends from Chicago, Lawrence Kelly and Nicola Rescigno. She further consolidated this company's standing when, in 1958, she gave \"a towering performance as Violetta in \"La traviata\", and that same year, in her only American performances of \"Medea\", gave an interpretation of the title role worthy of Euripides.\"\nIn 1958, a feud with general manager Rudolf Bing led to Callas's Metropolitan Opera contract being cancelled. Impresario Allen Oxenburg realised that this situation provided him with an opportunity for his own company, the American Opera Society, and he accordingly approached her with a contract to perform Imogene in \"Il pirata\". She accepted and sang the role in a January 1959 performance that according to opera critic Allan Kozinn \"quickly became legendary in operatic circles\". Bing and Callas later reconciled their differences, and she returned to the Met in 1965 to sing the title role in two performances as Tosca opposite Franco Corelli as Cavaradossi for one performance (March 19, 1965) and Richard Tucker (March 25, 1965) with Tito Gobbi as Scarpia for her final performances at the Met.\nIn 1952, she made her London debut at the Royal Opera House in \"Norma\" with veteran mezzo-soprano Ebe Stignani as Adalgisa, a performance which survives on record and also features the young Joan Sutherland in the small role of Clotilde. Callas and the London public had what she called \"a love affair\", and she returned to the Royal Opera House in 1953, 1957, 1958, 1959, and 1964 to 1965. It was at the Royal Opera House where, on July 5, 1965, Callas ended her stage career in the role of \"Tosca\", in a production designed and mounted for her by Franco Zeffirelli and featuring her friend and colleague Tito Gobbi.\nWeight loss.\nIn the early years of her career, Callas was a heavy woman; in her own words, \"Heavy\u2014one can say\u2014yes I was; but I'm also a tall woman, 5' &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;8+1\u20442\" (), and I used to weigh no more than .\" Tito Gobbi relates that during a lunch break while recording \"Lucia\" in Florence, Serafin commented to Callas that she was eating too much and allowing her weight to become a problem. When she protested that she was not so heavy, Gobbi suggested she should \"put the matter to test\" by stepping on the weighing machine outside the restaurant. The result was \"somewhat dismaying, and she became rather silent.\" In 1968, Callas told Edward Downes that during her initial performances in Cherubini's \"Medea\" in May 1953, she realized that she needed a leaner face and figure to do dramatic justice to this as well as the other roles she was undertaking. She added,\nI was getting so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I was tired of playing a game, for instance playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right\u2014I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.\nDuring 1953 and early 1954, she lost almost , turning herself into what Rescigno called \"possibly the most beautiful lady on the stage.\" Various rumors spread regarding her weight loss method; one had her swallowing a tapeworm, and Rome's Panatella Mills pasta company claimed she lost weight by eating their \"physiologic pasta,\" prompting Callas to file a lawsuit. Callas stated that she lost the weight by eating a sensible low-calorie diet of mainly salads and chicken. Callas never regained the weight she lost and kept her slim figure until her death.\nSome believe that the loss of body mass made it more difficult for her to support her voice, triggering the vocal strain that became apparent later in the decade, and others believed the weight loss effected a newfound softness and femininity in her voice, as well as a greater confidence as a person and performer. Tito Gobbi said,\nNow she was not only supremely gifted both musically and dramatically\u2014she was a beauty too. And her awareness of this invested with fresh magic every role she undertook. What it eventually did to her vocal and nervous stamina I am not prepared to say. I only assert that she blossomed into an artist unique in her generation and outstanding in the whole range of vocal history.\nAlleged Callas\u2013Tebaldi rivalry.\nDuring the early 1950s, an alleged rivalry arose between Callas and Renata Tebaldi, an Italian lyrico spinto soprano. The contrast between Callas's often unconventional vocal qualities and Tebaldi's classically beautiful sound resurrected a debate, namely, beauty of sound versus the expressive use of sound.\nIn 1951, Tebaldi and Maria Callas were jointly booked for a vocal recital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although the singers agreed that neither would perform encores, Tebaldi took two, and Callas was reportedly incensed. This incident began the rivalry, which reached a fever pitch in the mid-1950s, at times even engulfing the two women themselves, who were said by their more fanatical followers to have engaged in verbal barbs in each other's direction.\nTebaldi was quoted as saying, \"I have one thing that Callas doesn't have: a heart\", and Callas was quoted in \"Time\" magazine as saying that comparing her with Tebaldi was like \"comparing Champagne with Cognac\u00a0... No\u00a0... with Coca Cola\". However, witnesses to the interview stated that Callas had said only \"champagne with cognac\", and that it was a bystander who had quipped: \"...\u00a0No\u00a0... with Coca-Cola.\" Nevertheless, the \"Time\" reporter attributed the latter comment to Callas.\nAccording to John Ardoin, these two singers never should have been compared. Tebaldi was trained by Carmen Melis, a noted verismo specialist, and she was rooted in the early 20th century Italian school of singing just as firmly as Callas was rooted in 19th century bel canto. Callas was a dramatic soprano, whereas Tebaldi was considered essentially a lyric soprano. Callas and Tebaldi generally sang a different repertoire: In the early years of her career, Callas concentrated on the heavy dramatic soprano roles and later in her career on the bel canto repertoire, whereas Tebaldi concentrated on late Verdi and verismo roles, where her limited upper extension and her lack of a florid technique were not issues. They shared a few roles, including Tosca in Puccini's opera and \"La Gioconda\", which Tebaldi performed only late in her career.\nThe alleged rivalry aside, Callas made remarks appreciative of Tebaldi, and vice versa. During an interview with Norman Ross Jr. in Chicago, Callas said, \"I admire Tebaldi's tone; it's beautiful\u2014also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice.\" Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of \"La Gioconda\" in order to help her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry, he recommended Zinka Milanov's version. A few days later, he went to visit Tebaldi, only to find her sitting by the speakers, listening intently to Callas's recording. She then looked up at him and asked, \"Why didn't you tell me Maria's was the best?\"\nCallas visited Tebaldi after a performance of \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" at the Met in 1968, and the two were reunited. In 1978, Tebaldi spoke warmly of her late colleague and summarized this rivalry:\nThis rivality [\"sic\"] was really building from the people of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality [\"sic\"], because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.\nVocal decline.\nIn the opinion of several singers, the heavy roles undertaken in her early years damaged Callas's voice. The mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato, Callas's close friend and frequent colleague, stated that she told Callas that she felt that the early heavy roles led to a weakness in the diaphragm and subsequent difficulty in controlling the upper register.\nLouise Caselotti, who worked with Callas in 1946 and 1947, prior to her Italian debut, felt that it was not the heavy roles that hurt Callas's voice, but the lighter ones. Several singers have suggested that Callas's heavy use of the chest voice led to stridency and unsteadiness with the high notes. In his book, Callas's husband Meneghini wrote that Callas suffered an unusually early onset of menopause, which could have affected her voice. Soprano Carol Neblett once said, \"A woman sings with her ovaries\u2014you're only as good as your hormones.\"\nCritic Henry Pleasants has stated that it was a loss of physical strength and breath-support that led to Callas's vocal problems, saying,Singing, and especially opera singing, requires physical strength. Without it, the singer's respiratory functions can no longer support the steady emissions of breath essential to sustaining the production of focused tone. The breath escapes, but it is no longer the power behind the tone, or is only partially and intermittently. The result is a breathy sound\u2014tolerable but hardly beautiful\u2014when the singer sings lightly, and a voice spread and squally when under pressure.\nIn the same vein, Joan Sutherland, who heard Callas throughout the 1950s, said in a BBC interview,\n[Hearing Callas in \"Norma\" in 1952] was a shock, a wonderful shock. You just got shivers up and down the spine. It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances, before she lost weight. I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of \"fatness\" of the sound which she had when she was as fat as she was. But when she lost the weight, she couldn't seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don't think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.\nMichael Scott has proposed that Callas's loss of strength and breath support was directly caused by her rapid and progressive weight loss, something that was noted even in her prime. Of her 1958 recital in Chicago, Robert Detmer wrote, \"There were sounds fearfully uncontrolled, forced beyond the too-slim singer's present capacity to support or sustain.\"\nPhotos and videos of Callas during her heavy era show a very upright posture with the shoulders relaxed and held back. Of a television broadcast from May 1960 of a recital in Hamburg, \"The Opera Quarterly\" noted, \"[W]e [can] watch\u00a0... the constantly sinking, depressed chest and hear the resulting deterioration\". This continual change in posture has been cited as visual proof of a progressive loss of breath support.\nCommercial and bootleg recordings of Callas from the late 1940s to 1953\u2014the period during which she sang the heaviest dramatic soprano roles\u2014show no decline in the fabric of the voice, no loss in volume and no unsteadiness or shrinkage in the upper register. Of her December 1952 Lady Macbeth\u2014coming after five years of singing the most strenuous dramatic soprano repertoire\u2014Peter Dragadze wrote for \"Opera\", \"Callas' voice since last season has improved a great deal, the second passagio on the high B-natural and C has now completely cleared, giving her an equally colored scale from top to bottom.\" And of her performance of Medea a year later, John Ardoin writes, \"The performance displays Callas in as secure and free a voice as she will be found at any point in her career. The many top B's have a brilliant ring, and she handles the treacherous tessitura like an eager thoroughbred.\"\nIn recordings from 1954 (immediately after her weight loss) and thereafter, \"not only would the instrument lose its warmth and become thin and acidulous, but the altitudinous passages would to her no longer come easily.\" It was at this time that unsteady top notes first begin to appear. Walter Legge, who produced nearly all of Callas's EMI/Angel recordings, states that Callas \"ran into a patch of vocal difficulties as early as 1954\": during the recording of \"La forza del destino\", done immediately after the weight loss, the \"wobble had become so pronounced\" that he told Callas they \"would have to give away seasickness pills with every side\".\nThere were others, however, who felt that the voice had benefitted from the weight loss. Of her performance of \"Norma\" in Chicago in 1954, Claudia Cassidy wrote that \"there is a slight unsteadiness in some of the sustained upper notes, but to me her voice is more beautiful in color, more even through the range, than it used to be\". And at her performance of the same opera in London in 1957 (her first performance at Covent Garden after the weight loss), critics again felt her voice had changed for the better, that it had now supposedly become a more precise instrument, with a new focus. Many of her most critically acclaimed appearances are from 1954\u20131958 (\"Norma\", \"La traviata\", \"Sonnambula\" and \"Lucia\" of 1955, \"Anna Bolena\" of 1957, \"Medea\" of 1958, among others).\nCallas's close friend and colleague Tito Gobbi thought that her vocal problems all stemmed from her state of mind:\nI don't think anything happened to her voice. I think she only lost confidence. She was at the top of a career that a human being could desire, and she felt enormous responsibility. She was obliged to give her best every night, and maybe she felt she wasn't [able] any more, and she lost confidence. I think this was the beginning of the end of this career.\nIn support of Gobbi's assertion, a bootleg recording of Callas rehearsing Beethoven's aria \"Ah! perfido\" and parts of Verdi's \"La forza del destino\" shortly before her death shows her voice to be in much better shape than much of her 1960s recordings and far healthier than the 1970s concerts with Giuseppe Di Stefano.\nSoprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming posited that videos of Callas in the late 1950s and early 1960s reveal a posture that betrays breath-support problems:\nI have a theory about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from watching her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss \"per se\"\u2014you know, Deborah Voigt has lost a lot of weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [allowed her] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.\nHowever, writing about dramatic soprano Deborah Voigt in 2006 shortly after her weight loss after gastric bypass surgery, music critic Peter G. Davis brings up comparisons with Callas and notes an increasing acidity and thinning in Voigt's voice that recall the changes in Callas's voice after her weight loss:\nA change has also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's hard to tell if it's from weight loss or normal aging\u2014controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas' drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet exhibits any of Callas' technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however\u2014earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca\u2014is a marked thinning of quality at the very center of the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.\nVoigt explained how her dramatic weight loss affected her breathing and breath support:\nMuch of what I did with my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a different body\u2014there's not as much of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do have to think about it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.\nCallas attributed her problems to a loss of confidence brought about by a loss of breath support, even though she does not make the connection between her weight and her breath support. In an April 1977 interview with journalist Philippe Caloni, she stated,\nMy best recordings were made when I was skinny, and I say skinny, not slim, because I worked a lot and couldn't gain weight back; I became even too skinny\u00a0... I had my greatest successes \u2013 \"Lucia\", \"Sonnambula\", \"Medea\", \"Anna Bolena\" \u2013 when I was skinny as a nail. Even for my first time here in Paris in 1958 when the show was broadcast through Eurovision, I was skinny. Really skinny.\"\nAnd shortly before her death, Callas confided her own thoughts on her vocal problems to Peter Dragadze:\nI never lost my voice, but I lost strength in my diaphragm.\u00a0... Because of those organic complaints, I lost my courage and boldness. My vocal cords were and still are in excellent condition, but my 'sound boxes' have not been working well even though I have been to all the doctors. The result was that I overstrained my voice, and that caused it to wobble. (\"Gente\", October 1, 1977)\nWhether Callas's vocal decline was due to ill health, early menopause, over-use and abuse of her voice, loss of breath-support, loss of confidence, or weight loss will continue to be debated. Whatever the cause may have been, her singing career was effectively over by age 40, and even at the time of her death at age 53, according to Walter Legge, \"she ought still to have been singing magnificently\".\nFussi and Paolillo report.\nA 2010 study by Italian vocal researchers Franco Fussi and Nico Paolillo revealed Callas was very ill at the time of her death and her illness was related to her vocal deterioration. According to their findings, presented at the University of Bologna in 2010, Callas had dermatomyositis, a rare connective tissue disease that causes a failure of the muscles and ligaments, including the larynx. They believe she was showing signs of this disease as early as the 1960s. Fussi and Paolillo cite an initial report by physician Mario Giacovazzo, who in 2002 revealed he had diagnosed Callas with dermatomyositis in 1975. Treatment included corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, which affect heart function.\nAt an event hosted by the journal \"Il Saggiatore Musicale\", Fussi and Paolillo presented documentation showing when and how her voice changed over time. Using modern audio technology, they analyzed live Callas studio recordings from the 1950s through the 1970s, looking for signs of deterioration. Spectrographic analysis showed that she was losing the top half of her range. Fussi observed video recordings in which Callas's posture seemed strained and weakened. He felt that her drastic weight loss in 1954 further contributed to reduced physical support of her voice.\nFussi and Paolillo also examined restored footage of the infamous 1958 \"Norma\" \"walkout\" in Rome, which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage, the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control and that she had bronchitis and tracheitis as she claimed, and that the dermatomyositis was already causing her muscles to deteriorate.\nScandals and later career.\nThe latter half of Callas's career was marked by a number of scandals. Following a performance of \"Madama Butterfly\" in Chicago in 1955, Callas was confronted by a process server who handed her papers about a lawsuit brought by Eddy Bagarozy, who claimed he was her agent. Callas was photographed with her mouth turned in a furious snarl. The photo was sent around the world and gave rise to the myth of Callas as a temperamental prima donna and a \"Tigress\".\nIn 1956, just before her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, \"Time\" ran a damaging cover story about Callas, with special attention paid to her difficult relationship with her mother and some unpleasant exchanges between the two.\nIn 1957, Callas was starring as Amina in \"La sonnambula\" at the Edinburgh International Festival with the forces of La Scala. Her contract was for four performances, but due to the great success of the series, La Scala decided to put on a fifth performance. Callas told the La Scala officials that she was physically exhausted and that she had already committed to a previous engagement, a party thrown for her by her friend Elsa Maxwell in Venice. Despite this, La Scala announced a fifth performance, with Callas billed as Amina. Callas refused to stay and went on to Venice. Despite the fact that she had fulfilled her contract, she was accused of walking out on La Scala and the festival. La Scala officials did not defend Callas or inform the press that the additional performance was not approved by Callas. Renata Scotto took over the part, which was the start of her international career.\nIn January 1958, Callas was to open the Rome Opera House season with \"Norma\", with Italy's president, Giovanni Gronchi, in attendance. The day before the opening night, Callas alerted the management that she was not well and that they should have a standby ready. She was told \"No one can double Callas\". After being treated by doctors, she felt better on the day of performance and decided to go ahead with the opera. A surviving bootleg recording of the first act reveals Callas sounding ill. Feeling that her voice was slipping away, she felt that she could not complete the performance, and consequently, she cancelled after the first act. She was accused of walking out on the president of Italy in a fit of temperament, and pandemonium broke out. Doctors confirmed that Callas had bronchitis and tracheitis, and the President's wife called to tell her they knew she was sick. However, they made no statements to the media, and the endless stream of press coverage aggravated the situation.\nA newsreel included file footage of Callas from 1955 sounding well, intimating the footage was of rehearsals for the Rome \"Norma\", with the voiceover narration, \"Here she is in rehearsal, sounding perfectly healthy\", followed by \"If you want to hear Callas, don't get all dressed up. Just go to a rehearsal; she usually stays to the end of those.\"\nCallas's relationship with La Scala had also started to become strained after the Edinburgh incident, and this effectively severed her major ties with her artistic home. Later in 1958, Callas and Rudolf Bing were in discussion about her season at the Met. She was scheduled to perform in Verdi's \"La traviata\" and in \"Macbeth\", two very different operas which almost require totally different singers. Callas and the Met could not reach an agreement, and before the opening of \"Medea\" in Dallas, Bing sent a telegram to Callas terminating her contract. Headlines of \"Bing Fires Callas\" appeared in newspapers around the world. Nicola Rescigno later recalled, \"That night, she came to the theater, looking like an empress: she wore an ermine thing that draped to the floor, and she had every piece of jewellery she ever owned. And she said, 'You all know what's happened. Tonight, for me, is a very difficult night, and I will need the help of every one of you.' Well, she proceeded to give a performance [of \"Medea\"] that was historical.\"\nBing later said that Callas was the most difficult artist he ever worked with, \"because she was so much more intelligent. Other artists, you could get around. But Callas you could not get around. She knew exactly what she wanted, and why she wanted it.\" Despite this, Bing's admiration for Callas never wavered, and in September 1959, he sneaked into La Scala in order to listen to Callas record \"La Gioconda\" for EMI. Callas and Bing reconciled in the mid 1960s, and Callas returned to the Met for two performances of \"Tosca\" with her friend Tito Gobbi.\nIn her final years as a singer, she sang in \"Medea\" and \"Norma\", and \"Tosca\" in Paris, New York, and London from January\u2013February 1964. Her last stage performance was July 5, 1965, at Covent Garden. A live television transmission of act 2 of the Covent Garden \"Tosca\" of 1964 was broadcast in Britain on February 9, 1964, giving a rare view of Callas in performance and of her on-stage collaboration with Tito Gobbi, directed by Carlo Felice Cillario.\nIn 1969, the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini cast Callas in her only non-operatic acting role, as the Greek mythological character of Medea, in his film by that name. The production was grueling, and according to the account in Ardoin's \"Callas, the Art and the Life\", Callas is said to have fainted after a day of strenuous running back and forth on a mudflat in the sun. The film was not a commercial success, but as Callas's only film appearance, it documents something of her stage presence.\nFrom October 1971 to March 1972, Callas gave a series of master classes at the Juilliard School in New York. These classes later formed the basis of Terrence McNally's 1995 play \"Master Class\". Callas staged a series of joint recitals in Europe in 1973 and in the U.S., South Korea, and Japan in 1974 with the tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano. Critically, this was a musical disaster owing to both performers' worn-out voices. However, the tour was an enormous popular success. Audiences thronged to hear the two performers, who had so often appeared together in their prime. Her final public performance was on November 11, 1974, in Sapporo, Japan. Callas and Di Stefano were to have appeared together in four staged performances of \"Tosca\" in Japan in late 1975 but Callas cancelled.\nOnassis, final years, and death.\nIn 1957, while still married to husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini, Callas was introduced to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis at a party given in her honor by Elsa Maxwell after a performance in Donizetti's \"Anna Bolena\". The affair that followed received much publicity in the popular press, and in November 1959, Callas left her husband. Michael Scott asserts that Onassis was not sure why Callas largely abandoned her career, but that he offered her a way out of a career that was made increasingly difficult by scandals and by vocal resources that were diminishing at an alarming rate. Franco Zeffirelli, on the other hand, recalls asking Callas in 1963 why she had not practiced her singing, and Callas responding that \"I have been trying to fulfill my life as a woman.\"\nAccording to one of her biographers, Nicholas Gage, Callas and Onassis had a child, a boy, who died hours after he was born on March 30, 1960. In his book about his wife, Meneghini states categorically that Maria Callas was unable to bear children. Various sources also dismiss Gage's claim, as they note that the birth certificates Gage used to prove this \"secret child\" were issued in 1998, twenty-one years after Callas's death. Still other sources claim that Callas had at least one abortion while involved with Onassis.\nIn 1966, Callas renounced her U.S. citizenship at the American Embassy in Paris, to facilitate the end of her marriage to Meneghini. This was because after her renunciation, she was only a Greek citizen, and under Greek law of that time, a Greek could legally marry only in a Greek Orthodox church. As she had married in a Roman Catholic church, this divorced her in Greece. The renunciation also helped her finances, as she no longer had to pay U.S. taxes on her income. Her relationship with Onassis ended two years later in 1968, when he left Callas for Jacqueline Kennedy. However, the Onassis family's private secretary Kiki writes in her memoir that even while Aristotle was with Jackie, he frequently met with Maria in Paris, where they resumed what had now become a clandestine affair.\nCallas spent her last years living largely in isolation in Paris and died of a heart attack at age 53 on September 16, 1977.\nA funerary liturgy was held at St Stephen's Greek Orthodox Cathedral on rue Georges-Bizet, Paris on September 20, 1977. She was later cremated at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery and her ashes were placed in the columbarium there. After being stolen and later recovered, they were scattered over the Aegean Sea, off the coast of Greece, according to her wish, in the spring of 1979.\nDuring a 1978 interview, upon being asked \"Was it worth it to Maria Callas? She was a lonely, unhappy, often difficult woman\", music critic and Callas's friend John Ardoin replied:That's such a difficult question. There are times, you know, when there are people \u2013 certain people who are blessed, and cursed, with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. And Callas was one of these people. It was almost as if her wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us all \u2013 taught us things about music we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that's why singers admire her so; I think that's why conductors admire her so; I know that's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did. She knew she had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something that she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her, \"It must be very enviable to be Maria Callas.\" And she said, \"No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand.\" Because she couldn't explain what she did \u2013 it was all done by instinct; it was something, incredibly, embedded deep within her.\nEstate.\nAccording to several Callas biographers, Vasso Devetzi, a Greek pianist near the same age as Callas, insinuated herself into Callas's trust during her last years and acted virtually as her agent. This claim is corroborated by Callas' sister Yakinthi \"Jackie\" in her 1990 book \"Sisters\", wherein she asserts that Devetzi conned Maria out of control of half of her estate while promising to establish the Maria Callas Foundation to provide scholarships for young singers; after hundreds of thousands of dollars had allegedly vanished, Devetzi finally did establish the foundation.\nVoice.\nThe Callas sound.\nCallas's voice elicited widely diverging reactions. Walter Legge stated that Callas possessed that most essential ingredient for a great singer: an instantly recognizable voice.\nDuring \"The Callas Debate\", Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated, \"The timbre of Callas' voice, considered purely as sound, was essentially ugly: it was a thick sound, which gave the impression of dryness, of aridity. It lacked those elements which, in a singer's jargon, are described as velvet and varnish\u00a0... yet I really believe that part of her appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish, velvet and richness, this voice could acquire such distinctive colours and timbres as to be unforgettable.\" However, in his review of Callas's 1951 live recording of \"I vespri siciliani\", Ira Siff writes, \"Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed, even early on, a flawed voice, unattractive by conventional standards\u2014an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich, spinning sound, ravishing by any standard, capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble, chest tones unforced, and the middle register displays none of the 'bottled' quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured.\"\nNicola Rossi-Lemeni relates that Callas's mentor Serafin used to refer to her as \"Una grande vociaccia\"; he continues, \"\"Vociaccia\" is a little bit pejorative\u2014it means an ugly voice\u2014but \"grande\" means a big voice, a great voice. A great ugly voice, in a way.\" Callas did not like the sound of her own voice; in one of her last interviews, answering whether or not she was able to listen to her own voice, she replies,\nYes, but I don't like it. I have to do it, but I don't like it at all because I don't like the kind of voice I have. I really hate listening to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording \"San Giovanni Battista\" by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing\u00a0... Also now even though I don't like my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, \"Oh, that was really well sung,\" or \"It was nearly perfect.\"\nCarlo Maria Giulini has described the appeal of Callas's voice:\nIt is very difficult to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments\u2014violin, viola, cello\u2014where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.\nVocal category.\nCallas's voice has been difficult to place in the modern vocal classification or Fach system, especially as in her prime her repertoire contained the heaviest dramatic soprano roles as well as roles usually undertaken by the highest, lightest and most agile coloratura sopranos. Regarding this versatility, Serafin said, \"This woman can sing anything written for the female voice\". Michael Scott argues that Callas's voice was a natural high soprano, and going by evidence of Callas's early recordings Rosa Ponselle likewise felt that \"At that stage of its development, her voice was a pure but sizable dramatic coloratura\u2014that is to say, a sizable coloratura voice with dramatic capabilities, not the other way around.\" On the other hand, music critic John Ardoin has argued that Callas was the reincarnation of the 19th-century \"soprano sfogato\" or \"unlimited soprano\", a throwback to Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta, for whom many of the famous bel canto operas were written. He avers that like Pasta and Malibran, Callas was a natural mezzo-soprano whose range was extended through training and willpower, resulting in a voice which \"lacked the homogeneous color and evenness of scale once so prized in singing. There were unruly sections of their voices never fully under control. Many who heard Pasta, for example, remarked that her uppermost notes seemed produced by ventriloquism, a charge which would later be made against Callas\". Ardoin points to the writings of Henry Chorley about Pasta which bear an uncanny resemblance to descriptions of Callas:\nThere was a portion of the scale which differed from the rest in quality and remained to the last 'under a veil.'\u00a0... out of these uncouth materials she had to compose her instrument and then to give it flexibility. Her studies to acquire execution must have been tremendous; but the volubility and brilliancy, when acquired, gained a character of their own\u00a0... There were a breadth, an expressiveness in her roulades, an evenness and solidity in her shake, which imparted to every passage a significance totally beyond the reach of lighter and more spontaneous singers\u00a0... The best of her audience were held in thrall, without being able to analyze what made up the spell, what produced the effect\u2014as soon as she opened her lips.\nCallas appears to have been in agreement not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice: \"The timbre was dark, almost black\u2014when I think of it, I think of thick molasses\", and in 1968 she added, \"They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo\". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood,\nIt's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even \"Lucia\", \"Anna Bolena\", \"Puritani\", all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang \"Norma\", \"Fidelio\", which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing \"Anna Bolena\" and \"Sonnambula\", same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century\u00a0... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist not to be able to play everything; he has to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods\u00a0... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.\nVocal size and range.\nRegarding the sheer size of Callas's instrument, Rodolfo Celletti says, \"Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it frequently contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium.\" Celletti wrote that Callas had \"a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice\" (\"una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro\"). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for \"Musical Courier\" wrote that \"she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience.\" In a 1982 \"Opera News\" interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, \"But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad's did\u00a0... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, at the bottom of the range you could barely tell who was who\u00a0... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top.\" In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas's pre-1954 voice was a \"dramatic soprano with an exceptional top\", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in \"Lucia\", a \"huge soprano leggiero\".\nIn performance, Callas's vocal range was just short of three octaves, from F-sharp (F\u266f3) below middle C (C4) heard in \"Arrigo! Ah parli a un core\" from \"I vespri siciliani\" to E-natural (E6) above high C (C6), heard in the aria \"Merc\u00e8, dilette amiche\" in the final act of the same opera, as well as in Rossini's \"Armida\" and \"Lakm\u00e9\"'s Bell Song. Whether or not Callas ever sang a high F-natural in performance has been open to debate. After her June 11, 1951, concert in Florence, Rock Ferris of \"Musical Courier\" said, \"Her high E's and F's are taken full voice.\" Although no definite recording of Callas singing high Fs has surfaced, the presumed E-natural at the end of Rossini's \"Armida\"\u2014a poor-quality bootleg recording of uncertain pitch\u2014has been referred to as a high F by Italian musicologists and critics Eugenio Gara and Rodolfo Celletti. Callas expert Dr. Robert Seletsky, however, stated that since the finale of \"Armida\" is in the key of E, the final note could not have been an F, as it would have been dissonant. Author Eve Ruggieri has referred to the penultimate note in \"Merc\u00e8, dilette amiche\" from the 1951 Florence performances of \"I vespri siciliani\" as a high F; however, this claim is refuted by John Ardoin's review of the live recording of the performance as well as by the review of the recording in \"Opera News\", both of which refer to the note as a high E-natural.\nIn a 1969 French television interview with Pierre Desgraupes on the program \"L'invit\u00e9e du dimanche\", Francesco Siciliani speaks of Callas's voice going to high F (he also talked about her lower register extending to C3), but within the same program, Callas's teacher, Elvira de Hidalgo, speaks of the voice soaring to a high E-natural but does not mention a high F. Callas remained silent on the subject, neither confirming nor denying either claim.\nVocal registers.\nCallas's voice was noted for its three distinct registers: Her low or chest register was extremely dark and powerful, and she used this part of her voice for dramatic effect, often going into this register much higher on the scale than most sopranos. Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound\u2014\"part oboe, part clarinet\", as Claudia Cassidy described it\u2014and was noted for its veiled or \"bottled\" sound, as if she were singing into a jug. Walter Legge, husband of diva Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, attributed this sound to the \"extraordinary formation of her upper palate, shaped like a Gothic arch, not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth\".\nThe upper register was ample and bright, with an impressive extension above high C, which\u2014in contrast to the light flute-like sound of the typical coloratura, \"she would attack these notes with more vehemence and power\u2014quite differently therefore, from the very delicate, cautious, 'white' approach of the light sopranos.\" Legge adds, \"Even in the most difficult fioriture there were no musical or technical difficulties in this part of the voice which she could not execute with astonishing, unostentatious ease. Her chromatic runs, particularly downwards, were beautifully smooth and staccatos almost unfailingly accurate, even in the trickiest intervals. There is hardly a bar in the whole range of nineteenth-century music for high soprano that seriously tested her powers.\" And as she demonstrated in the finale of \"La sonnambula\" on the commercial EMI set and the live recording from Cologne, she was able to execute a diminuendo on the stratospheric high E-flat, which Scott describes as \"a feat unrivaled in the history of the gramophone.\"\nRegarding Callas's soft singing, Celletti says, \"In these soft passages, Callas seemed to use another voice altogether, because it acquired a great sweetness. Whether in her florid singing or in her \"canto spianato\", that is, in long held notes without ornamentation, her \"mezza voce\" could achieve such moving sweetness that the sound seemed to come from on high\u00a0... I don't know, it seemed to come from the skylight of La Scala.\"\nThis combination of size, weight, range and agility was a source of amazement to Callas's own contemporaries. One of the choristers present at her La Scala debut in \"I vespri siciliani\" recalled, \"My God! She came on stage sounding like our deepest contralto, Cloe Elmo. And before the evening was over, she took a high E-flat. And it was twice as strong as Toti Dal Monte's!\" In the same vein, mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato said: \"The first time we sang together was in Mexico in 1950, where she sang the top E-flat in the second-act finale of \"Aida\". I can still remember the effect of that note in the opera house\u2014it was like a star!\" For Italian soprano Renata Tebaldi, \"the most fantastic thing was the possibility for her to sing the soprano coloratura with this big voice! This was something really special. Fantastic absolutely!\"\nCallas's vocal registers, however, were not seamlessly joined; Walter Legge writes, \"Unfortunately, it was only in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill.\" Rodolfo Celletti states,\nIn certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano's voice\u2014for instance where the lower and middle registers merge, between G and A. I would go so far as to say that here her voice had such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist\u00a0... or else the voice could sound as though it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot\u00a0... between the middle and upper registers. Here, too, around the treble F and G, there was often something in the sound itself which was not quite right, as though the voice were not functioning properly.\nAs to whether these troublesome spots were due to the nature of the voice or to technical deficiencies, Celletti says: \"Even if, when passing from one register to another, Callas produced an unpleasant sound, the technique she used for these transitions was perfect.\" Musicologist and critic Fedele D'Amico adds, \"Callas' 'faults' were in the voice and not in the singer; they are so to speak, faults of departure but not of arrival. This is precisely Celletti's distinction between the natural quality of the voice and the technique.\" In 2005, Ewa Podle\u015b said of Callas, \"Maybe she had three voices, maybe she had three ranges, I don't know\u2014I am a professional singer. Nothing disturbed me, nothing! I bought everything that she offered me. Why? Because all of her voices, her registers, she used how they should be used\u2014just to tell us something!\"\nEugenio Gara states, \"Much has been said about her voice, and no doubt the discussion will continue. Certainly no one could in honesty deny the harsh or \"squashed\" sounds, nor the wobble on the very high notes. These and others were precisely the accusations made at the time against Pasta and Malibran, two geniuses of song (as they were then called), sublime, yet imperfect. Both were brought to trial in their day.\u00a0... Yet few singers have made history in the annals of opera as these two did.\"\nArtistry.\nCallas's own thoughts regarding music and singing can be found .\nThe musician.\nAdored by many opera enthusiasts, Callas was a controversial artist. Although Callas was the great singer often dismissed simply as an actress, Callas considered herself foremost a musician, that is, the first instrument of the orchestra.\" Grace Bumbry has stated, \"If I followed the musical score when [Callas] was singing, I would see every tempo marking, every dynamic marking, everything being adhered to, and at the same time, it was not antiseptic; it was something that was very beautiful and moving.\" Victor de Sabata confided to Walter Legge , \"If the public could understand, as we do, how deeply and utterly musical Callas is, they would be stunned\", and Serafin assessed Callas's musicality as \"extraordinary, almost frightening.\" Callas possessed an innate architectural sense of line-proportion and an uncanny feel for timing and for what one of Callas\u2019s colleagues described as \"a sense of the rhythm within the rhythm\".\nRegarding Callas's technical prowess, Celletti says, \"We must not forget that she could tackle the whole gamut of ornamentation: staccato, trills, half-trills, gruppetti, scales, etc.\" D'Amico adds, \"The essential virtue of Callas' technique consists of supreme mastery of an extraordinarily rich range of tone colour (that is, the fusion of dynamic range and timbre). And such mastery means total freedom of choice in its use: not being a slave to one's abilities, but rather, being able to use them at will as a means to an end.\" While reviewing the many recorded versions of \"perhaps Verdi's ultimate challenge\", the aria \"D'amor sull'ali rosee\" from \"Il trovatore\", Richard Dyer writes,\nCallas articulates all of the trills, and she binds them into the line more expressively than anyone else; they are not an ornament but a form of intensification. Part of the wonder in this performance is the chiaroscuro through her tone\u2014the other side of not singing full-out all the way through. One of the vocal devices that create that chiaroscuro is a varying rate of vibrato; another is her portamento, the way she connects the voice from note to note, phrase to phrase, lifting and gliding. This is never a sloppy swoop, because its intention is as musically precise as it is in great string playing. In this aria, Callas uses more portamento, and in greater variety, than any other singer\u00a0... Callas is not creating \"effects\", as even her greatest rivals do. She sees the aria as a whole, \"as if in an aerial view\", as Sviatoslav Richter's teacher observed of his most famous pupil; simultaneously, she is on earth, standing in the courtyard of the palace of Aliaferia, floating her voice to the tower where her lover lies imprisoned.\nIn addition to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language and the use of language in music. In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes, \"If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text.\" Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states, \"What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something\u2014it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art.\" Walter Legge states that,\nMost admirable of all her qualities, however, were her taste, elegance and deeply musical use of ornamentation in all its forms and complications, the weighting and length of every appoggiatura, the smooth incorporation of the turn in melodic lines, the accuracy and pacing of her trills, the seemingly inevitable timing of her portamentos, varying their curve with enchanting grace and meaning. There were innumerable exquisite felicities\u2014minuscule portamentos from one note to its nearest neighbor, or over widespread intervals\u2014and changes of color that were pure magic. In these aspects of bel canto she was supreme mistress of that art.\nThe actress.\nRegarding Callas's acting ability, vocal coach and music critic Ira Siff remarked, \"When I saw the final two \"Tosca\"s she did in the old [Met], I felt like I was watching the actual story on which the opera had later been based.\" Callas was not, however, a realistic or verismo style actress: her physical acting was merely \"subsidiary to the heavy \"Kunst\" of developing the psychology of the roles under the supervision of the music, of singing the acting\u00a0... Suffering, delight, humility, hubris, despair, rhapsody\u2014all this was musically appointed, through her use of the voice flying the text upon the notes.\" Seconding this opinion, verismo specialist soprano Augusta Oltrabella said, \"Despite what everyone says, [Callas] was an actress in the expression of the music, and not vice versa.\"\nMatthew Gurewitsch adds,\nIn fact the essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a performer whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas was not one of them. She found all she needed in the notes.\nEwa Podle\u015b likewise stated that \"It's enough to hear her, I'm positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! I can imagine everything, I can see everything in front of my eye.\" Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, \"For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human\u2014but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms\u00a0... She was wasted in verismo roles, even \"Tosca\", no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles.\" Scott adds, \"Early nineteenth-century opera\u00a0... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance.\"\nIn regard to Callas's physical acting style, Nicola Rescigno states, \"Maria had a way of even transforming her body for the exigencies of a role, which is a great triumph. In \"La traviata\", everything would slope down; everything indicated sickness, fatigue, softness. Her arms would move as if they had no bones, like the great ballerinas. In \"Medea\", everything was angular. She'd never make a soft gesture; even the walk she used was like a tiger's walk.\" Sandro Sequi recalls, \"She was never in a hurry. Everything was very paced, proportioned, classical, precise\u00a0... She was extremely powerful but extremely stylized. Her gestures were not many\u00a0... I don't think she did more than 20 gestures in a performance. But she was capable of standing 10 minutes without moving a hand or finger, compelling everyone to look at her.\" Edward Downes recalled Callas watching and observing her colleagues with such intensity and concentration as to make it seem that the drama was all unfolding in her head. Sir Rudolf Bing similarly recalled that in \"Il trovatore\" in Chicago, \"it was Callas' quiet listening, rather than Bj\u00f6rling's singing that made the dramatic impact\u00a0... He didn't know what he was singing, but she knew.\"\nCallas stated that, in opera, acting must be based on the music, quoting Serafin's advice to her:\nWhen one wants to find a gesture, when you want to find how to act onstage, all you have to do is listen to the music. The composer has already seen to that. If you take the trouble to really listen with your Soul and with your Ears\u2014and I say 'Soul' and 'Ears' because the Mind must work, but not too much also\u2014you will find every gesture there.\nThe artist.\nCallas's most distinguishing quality was her ability to breathe life into the characters she portrayed, or in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch, \"Most mysterious among her many gifts, Callas had the genius to translate the minute particulars of a life into tone of voice.\" Italian critic Eugenio Gara adds:\nHer secret is in her ability to transfer to the musical plane the suffering of the character she plays, the nostalgic longing for lost happiness, the anxious fluctuation between hope and despair, between pride and supplication, between irony and generosity, which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would like to say, that psychological sonority, which is the primary attraction of opera.\nEthan Mordden writes, \"It was a flawed voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity, and within her system, the flaws feed the feeling, the sour plangency and the strident defiance becoming aspects of the canto. They were literally defects of her voice; she bent them into advantages of her singing.\" Giulini believes, \"If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, it is impossible to imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas.\" He recalls that during Callas's performances of \"La traviata\", \"reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself.\" Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments:Once one heard and saw Maria Callas\u2014one can't really distinguish it\u2014in a part, it was very hard to enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of her hand was more than another artist could do in a whole act.\nTo Antonino Votto, Callas was:The last great artist. When you think this woman was nearly blind, and often sang standing a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect\u00a0... She was not just a singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally\u2014as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.\nRepertoire.\nCallas's stage repertoire included the following roles:\nNotable recordings.\nAll recordings are in mono unless otherwise indicated. Live performances are typically available on multiple labels. In 2014, Warner Classics (formerly EMI Classics) released the \"Maria Callas Remastered Edition\", consisting of her complete studio recordings totaling 39 albums in a boxed set remastered at Abbey Road Studios in 24-bit/96\u00a0kHz digital sound from original master tapes.\nNotes and references.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

They were inspired by the Little People soft sculptured dolls sold by Xavier Roberts as collectibles. The brand was renamed 'Cabbage Patch Kids' by Roger L. Schlaifer when he acquired the exclusive worldwide licensing rights in 1982.\nThe doll brand set every toy industry sales record for three years running, was one of the most popular lines of children's licensed products in the 1980s, and has become one of the longest-running doll franchises in the United States. Additional Cabbage Patch products include children's apparel, bedding, infants' wear, record albums and board games.\nProduction history.\nCreation and development.\nAccording to court records, Roberts, a 21-year-old art student at a missionary school in North Georgia, discovered craft artist Martha Nelson's Doll Babies. They came with a birth certificate and adoption papers. With the help of artist Debbie Moorehead, he hand-stitched dolls called \"The Little People\". Roberts modified the look of Nelson's dolls, birth certificate and adoption papers sufficiently to get a copyright, and told potential customers his Little People were not for sale; however, they could be \"adopted\" for prices ranging from $60 to $1,000.\nThe Little People were first sold at arts and crafts shows, then later at Babyland General Hospital, an old medical clinic that Roberts and his friends-turned-employees converted into a toy store, in Cleveland, Georgia.\nIn 1981, at the height of Roberts's success, he was approached by Atlanta designer and licensing agent, Roger L. Schlaifer about licensing The Little People. As Fisher-Price owned the name \"Little People\", the name was changed to \"Cabbage Patch Kids\". His goal was to build the first and largest mass-market children's brand in history. In order to attract potential doll manufacturers and to create the entertainment and publishing businesses he envisioned, Schlaifer and his partner/wife wrote the \"Legend of the Cabbage Patch Kids\". To make sense of how special cabbages gave birth to Cabbage Patch Kids, Schlaifer invented BunnyBees\u2014the bee-like creatures that use their rabbit ears to fly about and pollinate cabbages with magical crystals. Since Roberts insisted on being a character in the story, Schlaifer created him as a curious ten-year-old boy who discovered the Cabbage Patch Kids by following a BunnyBee behind a waterfall into a magical Cabbage Patch, where he found the Cabbage Patch babies being born in a neglected garden. To save them from being abducted to work in the gold mines operated by the villainess Lavender McDade and her two cohorts in crime, Cabbage Jack and Beau Weasel, young Roberts tried to save them by finding loving parents who would adopt them and keep them safe in their homes.\nIn 1982, Coleco's design team, headed by famed doll designer Judy Albert, devised an industry first: one-of-a-kind, plastic-headed Cabbage Patch Kids dolls with cuter features, softer bodies and a normal toddler's proportions instead of the obese bodies of Roberts' originals. It was those comparatively inexpensive ($18 to $28) dolls, branded in packaging designed by Schlaifer and produced in Coleco's factories in China, that succeeded commercially. Coleco cancelled all of its advertising as they tried to keep up with demand\u2014shipping a doll-industry record, 3.2 million dolls. Sales of dolls in 1984, along with Cabbage Patch branded merchandise generated $2,000,000,000 in retail sales across North America, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\nColeco's sales continued to climb right through 1986, when they reportedly over-shipped and lost ground in a legal battle with Schlaifer and Roberts over his introduction of \"Furskins Bears\"\u2014a collection of hillbilly bears that competed with the Cabbage Patch dolls. Coleco's sales plummeted from over $800 million in 1986 to nothing in 1988 when the company went out of business.\nColeco years.\nAfter changing the dolls' name to Cabbage Patch Kids, Schlaifer contacted all the major doll companies in the country. Most declined, commenting that the look of the Little People was too ugly to sell on the mass-market. Coleco, then famous for its success with electronic toys, were sold on becoming the Master Toy licensee, including an advertising guarantee.\nAt the peak of their popularity, between 1983 and 1986, the dolls were highly sought-after toys for Christmas. Cabbage Patch riots occurred as parents literally fought to obtain the dolls for children. In later years, Coleco introduced variants on the original Cabbage Patch Kids, and derivatives of the original line of dolls continued to be marketed.\nInternational variations.\nWhen Coleco was producing the dolls for the North American market during the 1980s, they provided technical assistance to other doll manufacturers in Panama, Europe, Australia and Japan who wanted to use their molds.\nHasbro years.\nHasbro took over the rights to produce Cabbage Patch dolls in 1988 after Coleco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and continued to make the dolls with various gimmicks, including dolls that played kazoos. Some of the more popular doll lines to come out under the Cabbage Patch Kids name included the \"Birthday Kids\", \"Splash 'n' Tan Kids\", and \"Pretty Crimp and Curl\". Hasbro produced a 10th anniversary doll, reintroducing Schlaifer's original packaging \u2013 a practice that other CPK doll manufacturers would do to give sales a boost on various anniversaries. Hasbro gradually began making the dolls for younger children, which led to smaller and smaller dolls.\nMattel years.\nIn 1994, Mattel acquired the licensing rights to the dolls from Original Appalachian Artworks. Their first Cabbage Patch dolls hit the stores in 1995.\nThe Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls were not limited to cloth bodies and included dolls made from vinyl, resulting in a more durable play doll. The Mattel dolls are mostly sized 14\" or smaller, and most variants were individualized with a gimmick to enhance their collectibility, e.g. some dolls played on water toys, swam, ate food, or brushed their teeth.\nSome Mattel lines include the updated Kids line of basic cloth dolls that came with birth certificates, the OlympiKids that were made to coincide with the 1996 Olympics, and the Cabbage Patch Fairies. In January 1997, Mattel recalled the franchise's Snacktime Kids dolls after numerous complaints that they were chewing on children's hair and fingers. Also, to celebrate the dolls' 15th anniversary, Mattel created a line of exclusively female dolls with reproduction face molds, dressed in a reproduction dresses reminiscent of the original line and packaged in retro style box. These were 16 inches tall, the same measurement of the first Coleco Cabbage Kids.\nToys \"R\" Us Kids.\nIn 2001, with Mattel's sales stalling, a former Coleco marketing employee, Al Kahn, acquired Original Appalachian's licensing rights and sold retailer Toys \"R\" Us on producing 20-inch (50.8\u00a0cm) Kids dolls and 18-inch (45.7\u00a0cm) baby dolls, both with cloth bodies and vinyl heads. They were packaged in cardboard cabbage leaf seats. In 2001, the 20-inch dolls debuted in the Times Square flagship store. These were created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the line, and were available both online and in stores around the US. Expensive and deemed too cumbersome for most young children to play with, they did not last long at the retailer.\nPlay Along Toys.\nPlay Along toys next obtained exclusive licensing rights to produce the Cabbage Patch Kids doll line. In 2004, again using Schlaifer's original packaging, Play Along launched a Cabbage Patch Kids 25th Anniversary collection using some of the original head sculpts from the very first Coleco editions. Play Along also partnered with Carvel in a co-branding campaign. The resulting co-branded Cabbage Patch Kids were packaged with a Carvel-branded ice cream cone.\nJakks Pacific.\nJAKKS Pacific acquired Play Along Toys and assumed the master toy licensee for the Cabbage Patch Kids in 2011. Jakks introduced a 14-inch (35.6\u00a0cm) Cabbage Patch Kids Fashionality line and other Cabbage Patch Kid products. In 2013, Jakks Pacific released the Celebration edition to commemorate the 30th Birthday of the licensed Cabbage Patch Kids. \nWicked Cool Toys.\nWicked Cool Toys is the master toy licensee for Cabbage Patch Kids as of 2015.\nWicked Cool Toys released new additions like Little Sprouts, a line of tiny collectable dolls, only 1.5 inches tall. They also released Adoptimals, 8-inch plus pets that a Cabbage Patch Kid can adopt.\nCabbage Patch Kids brand.\nThe original 1982 Cabbage Patch Kids license agreement with Coleco Industries was negotiated by Roger L. Schlaifer, doing business as Schlaifer Nance &amp; Company (SN&amp;C), the exclusive worldwide licensor for Original Appalachian Artworks, Roberts' company at the time.\nFollowing Schlaifer Nance &amp; Company's signing of Coleco Industries, SN&amp;C designed and/or directed the design and quality of virtually all CPK branded products produced by its over one hundred and fifty CPK licensed manufacturers, including Coleco. They included the first children's licensed character diapers and low-sugar cereal, children's apparel, bedding, stationery products, books, backyard pools, and thousands of other children's products\u2014generating over $2 billion in retail sales for 1984, alone. Total sales during the Schlaifer's six-year tenure exceeded $4.5 billion, more than ten times the total revenues of Cabbage Patch Kids merchandise and entertainment in the thirty years since\u2014the latter of which never made the impact Roberts claimed it would under his direction in the November 1983 edition of Esquire magazine. And while sales of the dolls and other licensed products declined precipitously in the late 1980s, the dolls have become a mainstay of the toy industry, and one of the few long-running doll brands in history.\nPorcelain Cabbage Patch Kids.\nThese limited edition dolls were available from Applause gifts and later by direct mail from the Danbury Mint. They have a rigid fabric body with porcelain legs, arms, and head.\nTalking Cabbage Patch Kids.\n\"Talking Cabbage Patch Kids\" were among the last new CPK lines introduced by Coleco. They were equipped with a voice chip, touch sensors, a microphone, short range 49\u00a0MHz AM transmitter and receiver for communicating with other dolls. Touch sensors in the hands enabled the toy to detect when and how it was being played with in response to its vocalizations. For example, the doll might say \"hold my hand\" and give an appropriate speech response when the touch sensor in either hand detected pressure. It also had a movement detector to show the positioning of the doll and whether it was sensed to be on its belly, back, or even upside down. A special plastic drinking cup containing a hidden magnet, which could be identified with the aid a small reed relay in the built into the head of the toy above the mouth, to signify when it should be seen to be drinking. A more remarkable effect occurred when one doll detected the presence of another through its 49\u00a0MHz AM transmitter/receiver. The dolls were programmed to signal their \"awareness\" of each other with a short phrase, e.g. \"I think there's someone else to play with here!\", and then to initiate simple conversations \"between the dolls themselves\" with enough randomness to sound somewhat natural, the joint synchronised singing of 'rounds' being particularly impressive. The inclusion of the microphone was to delay the search and communication with another of its type when the ambient noise was above a certain level.\nBabyland General Hospital.\nBabyland General Hospital is the \"birthplace\" of Little People and is located in Cleveland, Georgia. With the help of local friends, Roberts converted an old doctor's clinic into a general store/souvenir shop and \"doll hospital\" from which to sell his original \"Little People\". The facility is presented as a birthing, nursery, and adoption center for the Cabbage Patch Kids. In accordance with the theme, employees dressed and pretended to be doctors and nurses caring for the dolls as if they were real. Babyland General moved to a new facility on the outskirts of Cleveland, Georgia, in 2010 and has been voted one of the Travel Channel's top 10 toylands.\nAdaptations.\nThe Cabbage Patch Kids' First Christmas.\nUnder the direction of ABC V.P. of programming, Squire Rushnell, and produced by Ruby-Spears with music by Joe Raposo, \"The Cabbage Patch Kids' First Christmas\", premiered on ABC on December 7, 1984, and was the top-rated show in its time-slot.\nCast.\nAdditional shows include \"Cabbage Patch Kids: The New Kid\", a stop-motion animated special produced by Goldhill Entertainment, and aired on the FOX Kids Network programming block on August 26, 1995. It was followed by four other stop-motion animated specials, \"Cabbage Patch Kids: The Club House\" in 1996; \"Cabbage Patch Kids: The Screen Test\" in 1997; \"Cabbage Patch Kids: Saturday Night\" in 1998; and \"Cabbage Patch Kids: Vernon's Christmas\" in 1999.\nRoberts rejected an offer from ABC for an hour Saturday show combining Cabbage Patch Kids and Furskins Bears.\nIn 2024, MeTV Toons aired the Christmas special as part of the network's \"Tis' the Season for Toons\" event.\nControversies.\nLawsuits.\nThough Xavier Roberts originated the look of Little People, many of Little People's defining characteristics\u2014such as the dolls' overly round faces and that they came with an adoption certificate\u2014were taken from Martha Nelson Thomas, an American folk artist from Kentucky. Before Roberts became involved in the toy industry, Thomas had created and marketed her own line of dolls, called Doll Babies, which she sold at local arts and craft shows and markets. Roberts began purchasing Thomas' dolls in 1976 to sell at a profit at his own store in Georgia. Thomas later stopped selling additional dolls to Roberts, prompting him to turn to a manufacturing company in Hong Kong to mass produce dolls similar in appearance to Thomas' at a cheaper cost. Thomas brought suit against Roberts and eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in 1985. She and her husband, Tucker Thomas, told the press that she was more upset by the corruption of her dolls, for which she cared deeply, than the money she'd lost as the result of Roberts' actions. Thomas died in 2013, at the age of 62, with her favorite dolls attending her funeral alongside her family members and friends.\nRoberts' company, Original Appalachian Artworks, later brought a $30 million lawsuit against Topps, the company that produced grotesque trading cards parodying his company's dolls called the Garbage Pail Kids, for copyright infringement. Having sold over $70 million worth of the cards, Topps settled with OAA for $7 million\u2014tantamount to a license\u2014and retained the right to continue producing the Garbage Pail Kids cards.\nIn a bitter legal battle with SN&amp;C over whether OAA had violated their licensing Agreement with SN&amp;C and Coleco's exclusivity by producing a Cabbage Patch bear as a line of \"Furskins Bears\", and failing to pay SN&amp;C its share of the Topps settlement and refusing to allow ABC TV from doing a Saturday morning animated TV show, Roberts worked out a side deal with Coleco for tens of millions of dollars for a renewal of Schlaifer's Cabbage Patch agreement, and jointly litigated against SN&amp;C.\u00a0The suit was settled in 1988 by OAA and Coleco paying SN&amp;C an undisclosed amount of money. In addition, Paula Osborne, OAA president until Roberts worked out the deal with Coleco, sued over the share she was entitled to as a stockholder of OAA and received a seven-figure settlement. Six months after settling with SN&amp;C, Coleco was out of business.\nProduct safety.\nOne of Mattel's line of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids, was designed to \"eat\" plastic snacks. The mechanism enabling this was a pair of one-way smooth metal rollers behind plastic lips. The snacks would exit the doll's back and \"magically\" appear into a backpack. The mechanism could be de-activated by releasing the backpack. They were extremely popular during Christmas 1996. The line was voluntarily withdrawn from the market following an agreement between Mattel and the Consumer Product Safety Commission in January 1997 following several incidents where children got their fingers or hair stuck in the dolls' mouths leading to safety warnings from Connecticut's consumer protection commissioner.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go, and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.\nThe playing pieces are called \"stones\". One player uses the white stones and the other black stones. The players take turns placing their stones on the vacant intersections (\"points\") on the board. Once placed, stones may not be moved, but \"captured stones\" are immediately removed from the board. A single stone (or connected group of stones) is \"captured\" when surrounded by the opponent's stones on all orthogonally adjacent points. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move.\nWhen a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also end by resignation.\nThe standard Go board has a 19\u00d719 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9\u00d79 or 13\u00d713 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17\u00d717 grid. The 19\u00d719 board had become standard by the time the game reached Korea in the 5th century CE and Japan in the 7th century CE.\nGo was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal \"Zuo Zhuan\" (c.\u20094th century BCE).\nDespite its relatively simple rules, Go is extremely complex. Compared to chess, Go has a larger board with more scope for play, longer games, and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately , which is far greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which is estimated to be on the order of 1080.\nNames of the game.\nThe name \"Go\" is a short form of the Japanese word (; ), which derives from earlier (), in turn from Middle Chinese (, Mandarin: , lit.\u2009'encirclement board game' or 'board game of surrounding'). In English, the name \"Go\" when used for the game is often capitalized to differentiate it from the common word \"go\". In events sponsored by the Ing Chang-ki Foundation, it is spelled \"goe\".\nThe Korean name () is a native derived term, most likely originally consisting of \ubc2d (Yale: p\u00e0th, \u201ccultivated field\u201d) + *\ub3cd\u302f (Yale: tw\u01d2lk, \u201cstone\u201d, presumed dialectal variant of Seoul \ub3d3\u302f tw\u01d2lh, \u201cstone\u201d). Less plausible etymologies include a derivation of , referring to the playing pieces of the game, or a derivation from Chinese (), meaning 'to arrange pieces'.\nOverview.\nGo is an adversarial game between two players with the objective of capturing territory. That is, occupying and surrounding a larger total empty area of the board with one's stones than the opponent. As the game progresses, the players place stones on the board creating stone \"formations\" and enclosing spaces. Once placed, stones are never moved on the board, but when \"captured\" are removed from the board. Stones are linked together into a formation by being adjacent along the black lines, not on diagonals (of which there are none). Contests between opposing formations are often extremely complex and may result in the expansion, reduction, or wholesale capture and loss of formations and their enclosed empty spaces (called \"eyes\"). Another essential component of the game is control of the \"sente\" (that is, controlling the offense, so that one's opponent is forced into defensive moves); this usually changes several times during play.\nInitially the board is bare, and players alternate turns to place one stone per turn. As the game proceeds, players try to link their stones together into \"living\" formations (meaning that they are permanently safe from capture), as well as threaten to capture their opponent's stones and formations. Stones have both offensive and defensive characteristics, depending on the situation.\nAn essential concept is that a formation of stones must have, or be capable of making, at least two enclosed open points known as \"eyes\" to preserve itself from being captured. A formation having at least two eyes cannot be captured, even after it is surrounded by the opponent on the outside, because each eye constitutes a \"liberty\" that must be filled by the opponent as the final step in capture. A formation having two or more eyes is said to be unconditionally \"alive\", so it can evade capture indefinitely, and a group that cannot form two eyes is said to be \"dead\" and can be captured.\nThe general strategy is to place stones to fence-off territory, attack the opponent's weak groups (trying to kill them so they will be removed), and always stay mindful of the life status of one's own groups. Situations where mutually opposing groups must capture each other or die are called capturing races, or semeai. In a capturing race, the group with more liberties will ultimately be able to capture the opponent's stones. Capturing races and the elements of life or death are the primary challenges of Go.\nIn the end game players may pass rather than place a stone if they think there are no further opportunities for profitable play. The game ends when both players pass or when one player resigns. In general, to score the game, each player counts the number of unoccupied points surrounded by their stones and then subtracts the number of stones that were captured by the opponent. The player with the greater score (after adjusting for handicapping called komi) wins the game.\nIn the opening stages of the game, players typically establish groups of stones (or \"bases\") near the corners and around the sides of the board, usually starting on the third or fourth line in from the board edge rather than at the very edge of the board. The edges and corners make it easier to develop groups which have better options for \"life\" (self-viability for a group of stones that prevents capture) and establish formations for potential territory. Players usually start near the corners because establishing territory is easier with the aid of two edges of the board. Established corner opening sequences are called joseki and are often studied independently. However, in the mid-game, stone groups must also reach in towards the large central area of the board to capture more territory.\nDame are points that lie in between the boundary walls of black and white, and as such are considered to be of no value to either side. Seki are mutually alive pairs of white and black groups where neither has two eyes.\n\"Ko\" (Chinese and Japanese: ) is a potentially indefinitely repeated stone-capture position. The rules do not allow a board position to be repeated. Therefore, any move which would restore the previous board position would not be allowed, and the next player would be forced to play somewhere else. If the play requires a strategic response by the first player, further changing the board, then the second player could \"retake the ko,\" and the first player would be in the same situation of needing to change the board before trying to take the ko back. And so on. Some of these \"ko fights\" may be important and decide the life of a large group, while others may be worth just one or two points. Some ko fights are referred to as \"picnic kos\" when only one side has a lot to lose. In Japanese, it is called a \"hanami\" ko.\nPlaying with others usually requires a knowledge of each player's strength, indicated by the player's rank (increasing from 30\u00a0kyu to 1\u00a0kyu, then 1\u00a0dan to 7\u00a0dan, then 1\u00a0dan pro to 9\u00a0dan pro). A difference in rank may be compensated by a handicap\u2014Black is allowed to place two or more stones on the board to compensate for White's greater strength. There are different rulesets (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, AGA, etc.), which are almost entirely equivalent, except for certain special-case positions and the method of scoring at the end.\nBasic concepts.\nBasic strategic aspects include the following:\nThe strategy involved can become very abstract and complex. High-level players spend years improving their understanding of strategy, and a novice may play many hundreds of games against opponents before being able to win regularly.\nStrategy.\nStrategy deals with global influence, the interaction between distant stones, keeping the whole board in mind during local fights, and other issues that involve the overall game. It is therefore possible to allow a tactical loss when it confers a strategic advantage.\nNovices often start by randomly placing stones on the board, as if it were a game of chance. An understanding of how stones connect for greater power develops, and then a few basic common opening sequences may be understood. Learning the ways of life and death helps in a fundamental way to develop one's strategic understanding of \"weak groups\". A player who both plays aggressively and can handle adversity is said to display kiai, or fighting spirit, in the game.\nOpening strategy.\nIn the opening of the game, players usually play and gain territory in the corners of the board first, as the presence of two edges makes it easier for them to surround territory and establish the eyes they need. From a secure position in a corner, it is possible to lay claim to more territory by extending along the side of the board. The opening is the most theoretically difficult part of the game and takes a large proportion of professional players' thinking time. The first stone played at a corner of the board is generally placed on the third or fourth line from the edge. Players tend to play on or near the 4\u20134 star point during the opening. Playing nearer to the edge does not produce enough territory to be efficient, and playing further from the edge does not safely secure the territory.\nIn the opening, players often play established sequences called joseki, which are locally balanced exchanges; however, the joseki chosen should also produce a satisfactory result on a global scale. It is generally advisable to keep a balance between territory and influence. Which of these gets precedence is often a matter of individual taste.\nMiddlegame and endgame.\nThe middle phase of the game is the most combative, and usually lasts for more than 100 moves. During the middlegame, the players invade each other's territories, and attack formations that lack the necessary \"two eyes\" for viability. Such groups may be saved or sacrificed for something more significant on the board. It is possible that one player may succeed in capturing a large weak group of the opponent's, which often proves decisive and ends the game by a resignation. However, matters may be more complex yet, with major trade-offs, apparently dead groups reviving, and skillful play to attack in such a way as to construct territories rather than kill.\nThe end of the middlegame and transition to the endgame is marked by a few features. Near the end of a game, play becomes divided into localized fights that do not affect each other, with the exception of \"ko\" fights, where previously, the central area of the board related to all parts of it. No large weak groups are still in serious danger. Moves can reasonably be attributed some definite value, such as 20 points or fewer, rather than simply being necessary to compete. Both players set limited objectives in their plans, in making or destroying territory, capturing or saving stones. These changing aspects of the game usually occur at much the same time, for strong players. In brief, the middlegame switches into the endgame when the concepts of strategy and influence need reassessment in terms of concrete final results on the board.\nRules.\nAside from the order of play (alternating moves, Black moves first or takes a handicap) and scoring rules, there are essentially only two rules in Go:\nAlmost all other information about how the game is played is heuristic, meaning it is learned information about how the patterns of the stones on the board function, rather than a rule. Other rules are specialized, as they come about through different rulesets, but the above two rules cover almost all of any played game.\nAlthough there are some minor differences between rulesets used in different countries, most notably in Chinese and Japanese scoring rules, these differences do not greatly affect the tactics and strategy of the game.\nExcept where noted, the basic rules presented here are valid independent of the scoring rules used. The scoring rules are explained separately. Go terms for which there is no ready English equivalent are commonly called by their Japanese names.\nBasic rules.\nThe two players, Black and White, take turns placing stones of their color on the intersections of the board, one stone at a time. The usual board size is a 19\u00d719 grid, but for beginners or for playing quick games, the smaller board sizes of 13\u00d713 and 9\u00d79 are also popular.\nThe board is empty to begin with. Black plays first unless given a handicap of two or more stones, in which case White plays first. The players may choose any unoccupied intersection to play on except for those forbidden by the ko and suicide rules (see below). Once played, a stone can never be moved and can be taken off the board only if it is captured. A player may pass their turn, declining to place a stone, though this is usually only done at the end of the game when both players believe nothing more can be accomplished with further play. When both players pass consecutively, the game ends and is then scored.\nLiberties and capture.\nVertically and horizontally adjacent stones of the same color form a chain (also called a \"string\" or \"group\"), forming a discrete unit that cannot then be divided. Only stones connected to one another by the lines on the board create a chain; stones that are diagonally adjacent are not connected. Chains may be expanded by placing additional stones on adjacent intersections, and they can be connected together by placing a stone on an intersection that is adjacent to two or more chains of the same color.\nA vacant point adjacent to a stone, along one of the grid lines of the board, is called a \"liberty\" for that stone. Stones in a chain share their liberties. A chain of stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board. When a chain is surrounded by opposing stones so that it has no liberties, it is captured and removed from the board.\nKo rule.\nAn example of a situation in which the ko rule applies\nPlayers are not allowed to make a move that returns the game to the immediately prior position. This rule, called the ko rule, prevents unending repetition (a stalemate). As shown in the example pictured: White had a stone where the red circle was, and Black has just captured it by playing a stone at 1 (so the White stone has been removed). However, it is readily apparent that now Black's stone at 1 is immediately threatened by the three surrounding White stones. If White were allowed to play again on the red circle, it would return the situation to the original one, but the \"ko\" rule forbids that kind of endless repetition. Thus, White is forced to move elsewhere, or pass. If White wants to recapture Black's stone at 1, White must attack Black somewhere else on the board so forcefully that Black moves elsewhere to counter that, giving White that chance. If White's forcing move is successful, it is termed \"gaining the \"sente\"\"; if Black responds elsewhere on the board, then White can retake Black's stone at 1, and the \"ko\" continues, but this time Black must move elsewhere. A repetition of such exchanges is called a \"ko fight\". To stop the potential for \"ko fights\", two stones of the same color would need to be added to the group, making either a group of 5 Black or 5 White stones.\nWhile the various rulesets agree on the ko rule prohibiting returning the board to an \"immediately\" previous position, they deal in different ways with the relatively uncommon situation in which a player might recreate a past position that is further removed. See for further information.\nSuicide.\nA player may not place a stone such that it or its group immediately has no liberties unless doing so immediately deprives an enemy group of its final liberty. In the second case, the enemy group is captured, leaving the new stone with at least one liberty, so the new stone can be placed. This rule is responsible for the all-important difference between one and two eyes: if a group with only one eye is fully surrounded on the outside, it can be killed with a stone placed in its single eye. (An eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by a group of stones).\nThe Ing and New Zealand rules do not have this rule, and there a player might destroy one of its own groups (commit suicide). This play would only be useful in limited sets of situations involving a small interior space or planning. In the example at right, it may be useful as a ko threat.\nKomi.\nBecause Black has the advantage of playing the first move, the idea of awarding White some compensation came into being during the 20th century. This is called komi, which gives white a 5.5-point compensation under Japanese rules, 6.5-point under Korean rules, and 15/4 stones, or 7.5-point under Chinese rules (number of points varies by rule set). Under handicap play, White receives only a 0.5-point komi, to break a possible tie (\"jigo\").\nScoring rules.\nTwo general types of scoring procedures are used, and players determine which to use before play. Both procedures almost always give the same winner.\nBoth procedures are counted after both players have passed consecutively, the stones that are still on the board but unable to avoid capture, called \"dead\" stones, are removed. Given that the number of stones a player has on the board is directly related to the number of prisoners their opponent has taken, the resulting net score, that is, the difference between Black's and White's scores is identical under both rulesets (unless the players have passed different numbers of times during the course of the game). Thus, the net result given by the two scoring systems rarely differs by more than a point.\nLife and death.\nWhile not actually mentioned in the rules of Go (at least in simpler rule sets, such as those of New Zealand and the U.S.), the concept of a \"living\" group of stones is necessary for a practical understanding of the game.\nExamples of eyes (marked). The black groups at the top of the board are alive, as they have at least two eyes. The black groups at the bottom are dead as they only have one eye. The point marked \"a\" is a false eye, thus the black group with false eye \"a\" can be killed by white in two turns.\nWhen a group of stones is mostly surrounded and has no options to connect with friendly stones elsewhere, the status of the group is either alive, dead or \"unsettled\". A group of stones is said to be alive if it cannot be captured, even if the opponent is allowed to move first. Conversely, a group of stones is said to be dead if it cannot avoid capture, even if the owner of the group is allowed the first move. Otherwise, the group is said to be unsettled: the defending player can make it alive or the opponent can \"kill\" it, depending on who gets to play first.\nAn eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by a group of stones. If the eye is surrounded by Black stones, White cannot play there unless such a play would take Black's last liberty and capture the Black stones. (Such a move is forbidden according to the suicide rule in most rule sets, but even if not forbidden, such a move would be a useless suicide of a White stone.)\nIf a Black group has two eyes, White can never capture it because White cannot remove both liberties simultaneously. If Black has only one eye, White can capture the Black group by playing in the single eye, removing Black's last liberty. Such a move is not suicide because the Black stones are removed first. In the \"Examples of eyes\" diagram, all the circled points are eyes. The two black groups in the upper corners are alive, as both have at least two eyes. The groups in the lower corners are dead, as both have only one eye. The group in the lower left may seem to have two eyes, but the surrounded empty point marked \"a\" is not actually an eye. White can play there and take a black stone. Such a point is often called a \"false eye\".\nSeki (mutual life).\nThere is an exception to the requirement that a group must have two eyes to be alive, a situation called \"seki\" (or \"mutual life\"). Where different colored groups are adjacent and share liberties, the situation may reach a position when neither player wants to move first because doing so would allow the opponent to capture; in such situations therefore both players' stones remain on the board (in seki). Neither player receives any points for those groups, but at least those groups themselves remain living, as opposed to being captured.\nSeki can occur in many ways. The simplest are:\nIn the \"Example of seki (mutual life)\" diagram, the two circled points are liberties shared by both a black and a white group. Both of these interior groups are at risk, and neither player wants to play on a circled point, because doing so would allow the opponent to capture their group on the next move. The outer groups in this example, both black and white, are alive. Seki can result from an attempt by one player to invade and kill a nearly settled group of the other player.\nTactics.\n\"Tactics\" deal with immediate fighting between stones, capturing and saving stones, life, death and other issues localized to a specific part of the board. Larger issues which encompass the territory of the entire board and planning stone-group connections are referred to as \"Strategy\" and are covered in the \"Strategy\" section above.\nCapturing tactics.\nThere are several tactical constructs aimed at capturing stones. These are among the first things a player learns after understanding the rules. Recognizing the possibility that stones can be captured using these techniques is an important step forward.\nA ladder. Black cannot escape unless the ladder connects to black stones further down the board that will intercept with the ladder or if one of white's pieces has only one liberty.\nThe most basic technique is the \"ladder\". This is also sometimes called a \"running attack\", since it unfolds as one player trying to outrun the other's attack. To capture stones in a ladder, a player uses a constant series of capture threats (atari), giving the opponent only one place to place their stone to keep their group alive. This forces the opponent to move into a zigzag pattern (surrounding the ladder on the outside) as shown in the adjacent diagram to keep the attack coming. Unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way, the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture. However, if the ladder can run into other black stones, thus saving them, then experienced players recognize the futility of continuing the attack. These stones can also be saved if a suitably strong threat can be forced elsewhere on the board, so that two Black stones can be placed here to save the group.\nA net. The chain of three marked Black stones cannot escape in any direction, since each Black stone attempting to extend the chain outward (on the red circles) can be easily blocked by one White stone.\nAnother technique to capture stones is the so-called \"net\", also known by its Japanese name, \"geta\". This refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones, preventing their escape in all directions. An example is given in the adjacent diagram. It is often better to capture stones in a net than in a ladder, because a net does not depend on the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way, nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker. However, the ladder only requires one turn to kill all the opponent's stones, whereas a net requires more turns to do the same.\nA snapback. Although Black can capture the white stone by playing at the circled point, the resulting shape for Black has only one liberty (at 1), thus White can then capture the three black stones by playing at 1 again (\"snapback\").\nA third technique to capture stones is the \"snapback\". In a snapback, one player allows a single stone to be captured, then immediately plays on the point formerly occupied by that stone; by so doing, the player captures a larger group of their opponent's stones, in effect \"snapping back\" at those stones. An example can be seen on the right. As with the ladder, an experienced player does not play out such a sequence, recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately.\nReading ahead.\nOne of the most important skills required for strong tactical play is the ability to read ahead. Reading ahead includes considering available moves to play, the possible responses to each move, and the subsequent possibilities after each of those responses. Some of the strongest players of the game can read up to 40 moves ahead even in complicated positions.\nAs explained in the scoring rules, some stone formations can never be captured and are said to be alive, while other stones may be in a position where they cannot avoid being captured and are said to be dead. Much of the practice material available to players of the game comes in the form of life and death problems, also known as tsumego. In such problems, players are challenged to find the vital move sequence that kills a group of the opponent or saves a group of their own. Tsumego are considered an excellent way to train a player's ability at reading ahead, and are available for all skill levels, some posing a challenge even to top players.\nKo fighting.\nIn situations when the Ko rule applies, a ko fight may occur. If the player who is prohibited from capture is of the opinion that the capture is important because it prevents a large group of stones from being captured for instance, the player may play a \"ko threat\". This is a move elsewhere on the board that threatens to make a large profit if the opponent does not respond. If the opponent does respond to the ko threat, the situation on the board has changed, and the prohibition on capturing the ko no longer applies. Thus the player who made the ko threat may now recapture the ko. Their opponent is then in the same situation and can either play a ko threat as well or concede the ko by simply playing elsewhere. If a player concedes the ko, either because they do not think it important or because there are no moves left that could function as a ko threat, they have \"lost\" the ko, and their opponent may connect the ko.\nInstead of responding to a ko threat, a player may also choose to \"ignore\" the threat and connect the ko. They thereby win the ko, but at a cost. The choice of when to respond to a threat and when to ignore it is a subtle one, which requires a player to consider many factors, including how much is gained by connecting, how much is lost by not responding, how many possible ko threats both players have remaining, what the optimal order of playing them is, and what the \"size\"\u2014points lost or gained\u2014of each of the remaining threats is.\nFrequently, the winner of the ko fight does not connect the ko but instead captures one of the chains that constituted their opponent's side of the ko. In some cases, this leads to another ko fight at a neighboring location.\nHistory.\nOrigin in China.\nThe earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal \"Zuo Zhuan\" (c.\u20094th century BCE), referring to a historical event of 548\u00a0BCE. It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the \"Analects of Confucius\" and in two books written by Mencius (c.\u20093rd century BCE). In all of these works, the game is referred to as (). Today, in China, it is known as weiqi (), lit.\u2009'encirclement board game'.\nGo was originally played on a 17\u00d717 line grid, but a 19\u00d719 grid became standard by the time of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 CE). Legends trace the origin of the game to the mythical Chinese emperor Yao (2337\u20132258 BCE), who was said to have had his counselor Shun design it for his unruly son, Danzhu, to favorably influence him. Other theories suggest that the game was derived from Chinese tribal warlords and generals, who used pieces of stone to map out attacking positions.\nIn China, Go had an important status among elites and was associated with ideas of self-cultivation, wisdom, and gentlemanly ideals.23 It was considered one of the four cultivated arts of the Chinese scholar gentleman, along with calligraphy, painting and playing the musical instrument guqin. In ancient times the rules of Go were passed on verbally, rather than being written down.\nSpread to Korea and Japan.\nGo was introduced to Korea sometime between the 5th and 7th centuries CE, and was popular among the higher classes. In Korea, the game is called baduk (Korean:\u00a0), and a variant of the game called Sunjang baduk was developed by the 16th century. Sunjang baduk became the main variant played in Korea until the end of the 19th century, when the current version was reintroduced from Japan.\nThe game reached Japan in the 7th century CE\u2014where it is called or . It became popular at the Japanese imperial court in the 8th century, and among the general public by the 13th century. The game was further formalized in the 15th century. In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu re-established Japan's unified national government. In the same year, he assigned the then-best player in Japan, a Buddhist monk named Nikkai (n\u00e9 Kan\u014d Yosaburo, 1559), to the post of Godokoro (Minister of Go).\nNikkai took the name Hon'inb\u014d Sansa and founded the Hon'inb\u014d Go school. Several competing schools were founded soon after. These officially recognized and subsidized Go schools greatly developed the level of play and introduced the dan/kyu style system of ranking players. Players from the four schools (Hon'inb\u014d, Yasui, Inoue and Hayashi) competed in the annual castle games, played in the presence of the sh\u014dgun.\nInternationalization.\nDespite its widespread popularity in East Asia, Go has been slow to spread to the rest of the world. Although there are some mentions of the game in western literature from the 16th century forward, Go did not start to become popular in the West until the end of the 19th century, when German scientist Oskar Korschelt wrote a treatise on the game. By the early 20th century, Go had spread throughout the German and Austro-Hungarian empires. In 1905, Edward Lasker learned the game while in Berlin. When he moved to New York, Lasker founded the New York Go Club together with (amongst others) Arthur Smith, who had learned of the game in Japan while touring the East and had published the book \"The Game of Go\" in 1908. Lasker's book \"Go and Go-moku\" (1934) helped spread the game throughout the U.S., and in 1935, the American Go Association was formed. Two years later, in 1937, the German Go Association was founded.\nWorld War II put a stop to most Go activity, since it was a popular game in Japan, but after the war, Go continued to spread. For most of the 20th century, the Japan Go Association (Nihon Ki-in) played a leading role in spreading Go outside East Asia by publishing the English-language magazine \"Go Review\" in the 1960s, establishing Go centers in the U.S., Europe and South America, and often sending professional teachers on tour to Western nations. Internationally, the game had been commonly known since the start of the twentieth century by its shortened Japanese name, and terms for common Go concepts are derived from their Japanese pronunciation.\nIn 1996, NASA astronaut Daniel Barry and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata became the first people to play Go in space. They used a special Go set, which was named Go Space, designed by Wai-Cheung Willson Chow. Both astronauts were awarded honorary dan ranks by the Nihon Ki-in.\nAs of December\u00a02015[ [update]], the International Go Federation has 75 member countries, with 67 member countries outside East Asia. Chinese cultural centres across the world are promoting Go, and cooperating with local Go associations, for example the seminars held by the Chinese cultural centre in Tel Aviv, Israel, together with the Israeli Go association.\nCompetitive play.\nRanks and ratings.\nIn Go, rank indicates a player's skill in the game. Traditionally, ranks are measured using \"kyu\" and \"dan\" grades, a system also adopted by many martial arts. More recently, mathematical rating systems similar to the Elo rating system have been introduced. Such rating systems often provide a mechanism for converting a rating to a kyu or dan grade. Kyu grades (abbreviated \"k\") are considered student grades and decrease as playing level increases, meaning 1st kyu is the strongest available kyu grade. Dan grades (abbreviated \"d\") are considered master grades, and increase from 1st dan to 7th dan. First dan equals a black belt in eastern martial arts using this system. The difference among each amateur rank is one handicap stone. For example, if a 5k plays a game with a 1k, the 5k would need a handicap of four stones to even the odds. Top-level amateur players sometimes defeat professionals in tournament play. Professional players have professional dan ranks (abbreviated \"p\"). These ranks are separate from amateur ranks.\nThe rank system comprises, from the lowest to highest ranks:\nTournament and match rules.\nTournament and match rules deal with factors that may influence the game but are not part of the actual rules of play. Such rules may differ between events. Rules that influence the game include: the setting of compensation points (komi), handicap, and time control parameters. Rules that do not generally influence the game are the tournament system, pairing strategies, and placement criteria.\nCommon tournament systems used in Go include the McMahon system, Swiss system, league systems and the knockout system. Tournaments may combine multiple systems; many professional Go tournaments use a combination of the league and knockout systems.\nTournament rules may also set the following:\nTime control.\nA game of Go may be timed using a game clock. Formal time controls were introduced into the professional game during the 1920s and were controversial. Adjournments and sealed moves began to be regulated in the 1930s. Go tournaments use a number of different time control systems. All common systems envisage a single main period of time for each player for the game, but they vary on the protocols for continuation (in \"overtime\") after a player has finished that time allowance. The most widely used time control system is the so-called byoyomi system. The top professional Go matches have timekeepers so that the players do not have to press their own clocks.\nTwo widely used variants of the byoyomi system are:\nNotation and recording games.\nGo games are recorded with a simple coordinate system. This is comparable to algebraic chess notation, except that Go stones do not move and thus require only one coordinate per turn. Coordinate systems include purely numerical (4\u20134 point), hybrid (K3), and purely alphabetical. The Smart Game Format uses alphabetical coordinates internally, but most editors represent the board with hybrid coordinates as this reduces confusion.\nAlternatively, the game record can also be noted by writing the successive moves on a diagram, where odd numbers mean black stones, even numbers mean white stones (or conversely when playing with a handicap), and a notation like \"25=22\" in the margin means that the 25th stone was played at the same location as the 22nd one, which had been captured in the meantime.\nThe Japanese word kifu is sometimes used to refer to a game record.\nIn Unicode, Go stones can be represented with black and white circles from the block Geometric Shapes:\nThe block Miscellaneous Symbols includes \"Go markers\" that were likely meant for mathematical research of Go:\nTop players and professional Go.\nA Go professional is a professional player of the game of Go. There are six areas with professional go associations, these are: China (Chinese Weiqi Association), Japan (Nihon Ki-in, Kansai Ki-in), South Korea (Korea Baduk Association), Taiwan (Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation), the United States (AGA Professional System) and Europe (European Professional System).\nAlthough the game was developed in China, the establishment of the Four Go houses by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the start of the 17th century shifted the focus of the Go world to Japan. State sponsorship, allowing players to dedicate themselves full-time to study of the game, and fierce competition between individual houses resulted in a significant increase in the level of play. During this period, the best player of his generation was given the prestigious title Meijin (master) and the post of Godokoro (minister of Go). Of special note are the players who were dubbed Kisei (Go Sage). The only three players to receive this honor were D\u014dsaku, J\u014dwa and Sh\u016bsaku, all of the house Hon'inb\u014d.\nAfter the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Restoration period, the Go houses slowly disappeared, and in 1924, the Nihon Ki-in (Japanese Go Association) was formed. Top players from this period often played newspaper-sponsored matches of 2\u201310 games. Of special note are the (Chinese-born) player Go Seigen (Chinese: Wu Qingyuan), who scored 80% in these matches and beat down most of his opponents to inferior handicaps, and Minoru Kitani, who dominated matches in the early 1930s. These two players are also recognized for their groundbreaking work on new opening theory (Shinfuseki).\nFor much of the 20th century, Go continued to be dominated by players trained in Japan. Notable names included Eio Sakata, Rin Kaiho (born in Taiwan), Masao Kato, Koichi Kobayashi and Cho Chikun (born Cho Ch'i-hun, from South Korea). Top Chinese and Korean talents often moved to Japan, because the level of play there was high and funding was more lavish. One of the first Korean players to do so was Cho Namchul, who studied in the Kitani Dojo 1937\u20131944. After his return to Korea, the Hanguk Kiwon (Korea Baduk Association) was formed and caused the level of play in South Korea to rise significantly in the second half of the 20th century. In China, the game declined during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976) but quickly recovered in the last quarter of the 20th century, bringing Chinese players, such as Nie Weiping and Ma Xiaochun, on par with their Japanese and South Korean counterparts. The Chinese Weiqi Association (today part of the China Qiyuan) was established in 1962, and professional dan grades started being issued in 1982. Western professional Go began in 2012 with the American Go Association's Professional System. In 2014, the European Go Federation followed suit and started their professional system. \nWith the advent of major international titles from 1989 onward, it became possible to compare the level of players from different countries more accurately. Cho Hunhyun of South Korea won the first edition of the Quadrennial Ing Cup in 1989. His disciple Lee Chang-ho was the dominant player in international Go competitions for more than a decade spanning much of 1990s and early 2000s; he is also credited with groundbreaking works on the endgame. Cho, Lee and other South Korean players such as Seo Bong-soo, Yoo Changhyuk and Lee Sedol between them won the majority of international titles in this period. Several Chinese players also rose to the top in international Go from 2000s, most notably Ma Xiaochun, Chang Hao, Gu Li and Ke Jie. As of 2016[ [update]], Japan lags behind in the international Go scene.\nHistorically, more men than women have played Go. Special tournaments for women exist, but until recently, men and women did not compete together at the highest levels; however, the creation of new, open tournaments and the rise of strong female players, most notably Rui Naiwei, have in recent years highlighted the strength and competitiveness of emerging female players.\nThe level in other countries has traditionally been much lower, except for some players who had preparatory professional training in East Asia. Knowledge of the game has been scant elsewhere up until the 20th century. A famous player of the 1920s was Edward Lasker. It was not until the 1950s that more than a few Western players took up the game as other than a passing interest. In 1978, Manfred Wimmer became the first Westerner to receive a professional player's certificate from an East Asian professional Go association. In 2000, American Michael Redmond became the first Western player to achieve a 9 dan rank.\nEquipment.\nIt is possible to play Go with a simple paper board and coins, plastic tokens, or white beans and coffee beans for the stones; or even by drawing the stones on the board and erasing them when captured. More popular midrange equipment includes cardstock, a laminated particle board, or wood boards with stones of plastic or glass. More expensive traditional materials are still used by many players. The most expensive Go sets have black stones carved from slate and white stones carved from translucent white shells (traditionally \"Meretrix lamarckii\"), played on boards carved in a single piece from the trunk of a tree.\nTraditional equipment.\nBoards.\nThe Go board (generally referred to by its Japanese name \"goban\" ) typically measures between in length (from one player's side to the other) and in width. Chinese boards are slightly larger, as a traditional Chinese Go stone is slightly larger to match. The board is not square; there is a 15:14 ratio in length to width, because with a perfectly square board, from the player's viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board. The added length compensates for this. There are two main types of boards: a table board similar in most respects to other gameboards like that used for chess, and a floor board, which is its own free-standing table and at which the players sit.\nThe traditional Japanese \"goban\" is between thick and has legs; it sits on the floor (see picture). It is preferably made from the rare golden-tinged Kaya tree (\"Torreya nucifera\"), with the very best made from Kaya trees up to 700\u00a0years old. More recently, the related California Torreya (\"Torreya californica\") has been prized for its light color and pale rings as well as its reduced expense and more readily available stock. The natural resources of Japan have been unable to keep up with the enormous demand for the slow-growing Kaya trees; both \"T. nucifera\" and \"T. californica\" take many hundreds of years to grow to the necessary size, and they are now extremely rare, raising the price of such equipment tremendously. As Kaya trees are a protected species in Japan, they cannot be harvested until they have died. Thus, an old-growth, floor-standing Kaya \"goban\" can easily cost in excess of $10,000 with the highest-quality examples costing more than $60,000.\nOther, less expensive woods often used to make quality table boards in both Chinese and Japanese dimensions include Hiba (\"Thujopsis dolabrata\"), Katsura (\"Cercidiphyllum japonicum\"), Kauri (\"Agathis\"), and Shin Kaya (various varieties of spruce, commonly from Alaska, Siberia and China's Yunnan Province). So-called \"Shin Kaya\" is a potentially confusing merchant's term: \"shin\" means 'new', and thus \"shin kaya\" is best translated 'faux kaya', because the woods so described are biologically unrelated to Kaya.\nStones.\nA full set of Go stones (\"goishi\") usually contains 181 black stones and 180 white ones; a 19\u00d719 grid has 361 points, so there are enough stones to cover the board, and Black gets the extra odd stone because that player goes first. However it may happen, especially in beginners' games, that many back-and-forth captures empty the bowls before the end of the game: in that case an exchange of prisoners allows the game to continue.\nTraditional Japanese stones are double-convex, and made of clamshell (white) and slate (black). The classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in Wakayama Prefecture and the clamshell from the Hamaguri clam (\"Meretrix lusoria\") or the Korean hard clam; however, due to a scarcity in the Japanese supply of these clams, the stones are most often made of shells harvested from Mexico. Historically, the most prized stones were made of jade, often given to the reigning emperor as a gift.\nIn China, the game is traditionally played with single-convex stones made of a composite called Yunzi. The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by sintering a proprietary and trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds derived from the local stone. This process dates to the Tang dynasty and, after the knowledge was lost in the 1920s during the Chinese Civil War, was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now state-run Yunzi company. The material is praised for its colors, its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as melamine, and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate/shell. The term \"yunzi\" can also refer to a single-convex stone made of any material; however, most English-language Go suppliers specify Yunzi as a material and single-convex as a shape to avoid confusion, as stones made of Yunzi are also available in double-convex while synthetic stones can be either shape.\nTraditional stones are made so that black stones are slightly larger in diameter than white; this is to compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equal-sized white stones appear larger on the board than black stones.\nBowls.\nThe bowls for the stones are shaped like a flattened sphere with a level underside. The lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game. Chinese bowls are slightly larger, and a little more rounded, a style known generally as \"Go Seigen\"; Japanese \"Kitani\" bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a snifter glass, such as for brandy. The bowls are usually made of turned wood. Mulberry is the traditional material for Japanese bowls, but is very expensive; wood from the Chinese jujube date tree, which has a lighter color (it is often stained) and slightly more visible grain pattern, is a common substitute for rosewood, and traditional for Go Seigen-style bowls. Other traditional materials used for making Chinese bowls include lacquered wood, ceramics, stone and woven straw or rattan. The names of the bowl shapes, \"Go Seigen\" and \"Kitani\", were introduced in the last quarter of the 20th century by the professional player Janice Kim as homage to two 20th-century professional Go players by the same names, of Chinese and Japanese nationality, respectively, who are referred to as the \"Fathers of modern Go\".\nPlaying technique and etiquette.\nThe traditional way to place a Go stone is to first take one from the bowl, gripping it between the index and middle fingers, with the middle finger on top, and then placing it directly on the desired intersection. One can also place a stone on the board and then slide it into position under appropriate circumstances (where it does not move any other stones). It is considered respectful towards White for Black to place the first stone of the game in the upper right-hand corner. (Because of symmetry, this has no effect on the game's outcome.)\nIt is considered poor manners to run one's fingers through one's bowl of unplayed stones, as the sound, however soothing to the player doing this, can be disturbing to one's opponent. Similarly, clacking a stone against another stone, the board, or the table or floor is also discouraged. However, it is permissible to emphasize select moves by striking the board more firmly than normal, thus producing a sharp clack. Additionally, hovering one's arm over the board (usually when deciding where to play) is also considered rude as it obstructs the opponent's view of the board.\nManners and etiquette are extensively discussed in 'The Classic of WeiQi in Thirteen Chapters', a Song dynasty manual to the game. Apart from the points above it also points to the need to remain calm and honorable, in maintaining posture, and knowing the key specialised terms, such as titles of common formations. Generally speaking, much attention is paid to the etiquette of playing, as much as to winning or actual game technique.\nComputers and Go.\nSoftware players.\nGo long posed a daunting challenge to computer programmers, putting forward \"difficult decision-making tasks, an intractable search space, and an optimal solution so complex it appears infeasible to directly approximate using a policy or value function\". Prior to 2015, the best Go programs only managed to reach amateur dan level. On smaller 9\u00d79 and 13x13 boards, computer programs fared better, and were able to compare to professional players. Many in the field of artificial intelligence consider Go to require more elements that mimic human thought than chess.\nThe reasons why computer programs had not played Go at the professional dan level prior to 2016 include:\nIt was not until August 2008 that a computer won a game against a professional level player at a handicap of 9 stones, the greatest handicap normally given to a weaker opponent. It was the Mogo program, which scored this first victory in an exhibition game played during the US Go Congress. By 2013, a win at the professional level of play was accomplished with a four-stone advantage. In October 2015, Google DeepMind's program AlphaGo beat Fan Hui, the European Go champion and a 2 dan (out of 9 dan possible) professional, five times out of five with no handicap on a full size 19\u00d719 board. AlphaGo used a fundamentally different paradigm than earlier Go programs; it included very little direct instruction, and mostly used deep learning where AlphaGo played itself in hundreds of millions of games such that it could measure positions more intuitively. In March 2016, Google next challenged Lee Sedol, a 9 dan considered the top player in the world in the early 21st century, to a five-game match. Leading up to the game, Lee Sedol and other top professionals were confident that he would win; however, AlphaGo defeated Lee in four of the five games. After having already lost the series by the third game, Lee won the fourth game, describing his win as \"invaluable\". In May 2017, AlphaGo beat Ke Jie, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years, winning each game in a three-game match during the Future of Go Summit. In October 2017, DeepMind announced a significantly stronger version called AlphaGo Zero which beat the previous version by 100 games to 0.\nIn February 2023, Kellin Pelrine, an amateur American Go player, won 14 out of 15 games against a top-ranked AI system in a significant victory over artificial intelligence. Pelrine took advantage of a previously unknown flaw in the Go computer program, which had been identified by another computer. He exploited this weakness by slowly encircling the opponent's stones and distracting the AI with moves in other parts of the board.\nSoftware assistance.\nAn abundance of software is available to support players of the game. This includes programs that can be used to view or edit game records and diagrams, programs that allow the user to search for patterns in the games of strong players, and programs that allow users to play against each other over the Internet.\nSome web servers provide graphical aids like maps, to aid learning during play. These graphical aids may suggest possible next moves, indicate areas of influence, highlight vital stones under attack and mark stones in atari or about to be captured.\nThere are several file formats used to store game records, the most popular of which is SGF, short for Smart Game Format. Programs used for editing game records allow the user to record not only the moves, but also variations, commentary and further information on the game.\nElectronic databases can be used to study life and death situations, joseki, fuseki and games by a particular player. Programs are available that give players pattern searching options, which allow players to research positions by searching for high-level games in which similar situations occur. Such software generally lists common follow-up moves that have been played by professionals and gives statistics on win\u2013loss ratio in opening situations.\nInternet-based Go servers allow access to competition with players all over the world, for real-time and turn-based games. Such servers also allow easy access to professional teaching, with both teaching games and interactive game review being possible.\nIn popular culture.\nApart from technical literature and study material, Go and its strategies have been the subject of several works of fiction, such as \"The Master of Go\" by Nobel Prize in Literature-winning author Yasunari Kawabata and \"The Girl Who Played Go\" (2001) by Shan Sa. Other books have used Go as a theme or minor plot device. For example, the 1979 novel \"Shibumi\" by Trevanian centers around the game and uses Go metaphors. Go features prominently in the \"Chung Kuo\" series of novels by David Wingrove, being the favourite game of the main villain.\nThe manga series \"Hikaru no Go\" and its anime adaptation, first released in Japan in 1998 and 2001 respectively, had a large impact in popularizing Go among young players, both in Japan and\u2014as translations were released\u2014abroad.\nSimilarly, Go has been used as a subject or plot device in film, such as \"Pi (\u03c0)\", \"A Beautiful Mind\", \"\", \"Knives Out\", and \"The Go Master\" (a biopic of Go professional Go Seigen). 2013's \"T\u00f4ky\u00f4 ni kita bakari\" or \"Tokyo Newcomer\" portrays a Chinese foreigner Go player moving to Tokyo. In King Hu's wuxia film \"The Valiant Ones\", the characters are color-coded as Go stones (black or other dark shades for the Chinese, white for the Japanese invaders), Go boards and stones are used by the characters to keep track of soldiers prior to battle, and the battles themselves are structured like a game of Go.\nGo has also been featured as a plot device in a number of television series. Examples include Starz's science fiction thriller \"Counterpart\", which is rich in references (the opening itself featuring developments on a Go board), and includes Go matches, accurately played, relevant to the plot. Also, in 2024 Netflix released the historical-fictional Korean series \"Captivating the King\".\nThe corporation and brand Atari was named after the Go term, Atari.\nHedge fund manager Mark Spitznagel used Go as his main investing metaphor in his investing book \"The Dao of Capital\". \"The Way of Go: 8 Ancient Strategy Secrets for Success in Business and Life\" by Troy Anderson applies Go strategy to business. \"GO: An Asian Paradigm for Business Strategy\" by Miura Yasuyuki, a manager with Japan Airlines, uses Go to describe the thinking and behavior of business men.\nPsychological perspectives.\nA 2004 review of literature by Fernand Gobet, de Voogt and Jean Retschitzki showed that relatively little scientific research had been carried out on the psychology of Go, compared with other traditional board games such as chess. Computer Go research has shown that given the large search tree, knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in Go than in other strategy games, such as chess. A study of the effects of age on Go-playing has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players. According to the review of Gobet and colleagues, the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as PET and fMRI does not show large differences between Go and chess. On the other hand, a study by Xiangchuan Chen et al. showed greater activation in the right hemisphere among Go players than among chess players, but the research was inconclusive because strong players from Go were hired while very weak chess players were hired in the original study. There is some evidence to suggest a correlation between playing board games and reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.\nArthur Mary, a French researcher in clinical psychopathology, reports on his psychotherapeutic approaches using the game of Go with patients in private practice and in a psychiatric ward. Drawing on neuroscience research and employing a psychoanalytic (Lacanian) and phenomenological approach, he demonstrates how drives are expressed on the goban. He offers some suggestions to therapists for defining ways of playing go that lead to therapeutic effects.\nAnalyses of the game.\nIn formal game theory terms, Go is a non-chance, combinatorial game with perfect information. Informally that means there are no dice used (and decisions or moves create discrete outcome vectors rather than probability distributions), the underlying math is combinatorial, and all moves (via single vertex analysis) are visible to both players (unlike some card games where some information is hidden). Perfect information also implies sequence\u2014players can theoretically know about all past moves.\nOther theoretical taxonomy elements include:\nIn the endgame, it can often happen that the state of the board consists of several subpositions that do not interact with the others. The whole board position can then be considered as a mathematical sum, or composition, of the individual subpositions. It is this property of Go endgames that led John Horton Conway to the discovery of surreal numbers.\nIn combinatorial game theory terms, Go is a zero-sum, perfect-information, partisan, deterministic strategy game, putting it in the same class as chess, draughts (checkers), and Reversi (Othello).\nThe game emphasizes the importance of balance on multiple levels: to secure an area of the board, it is good to play moves close together; however, to cover the largest area, one needs to spread out, perhaps leaving weaknesses that can be exploited. Playing too \"low\" (close to the edge) secures insufficient territory and influence, yet playing too \"high\" (far from the edge) allows the opponent to invade. Decisions in one part of the board may be influenced by an apparently unrelated situation in a distant part of the board (for example, ladders can be broken by stones at an arbitrary distance away). Plays made early in the game can shape the nature of conflict a hundred moves later.\nThe game complexity of Go is such that describing even elementary strategy fills many introductory books. In fact, numerical estimates show that the number of possible games of Go far exceeds the number of atoms in the observable universe.\nGo also contributed to the development of combinatorial game theory (with Go infinitesimals being a specific example of its use in Go).\nComparisons to other games.\nGo begins with an empty board. It is focused on building from the ground up (nothing to something) with multiple, simultaneous battles leading to a point-based win. Chess is tactical rather than strategic, as the predetermined strategy is to trap one individual piece (the king). This comparison has also been applied to military and political history, with Scott Boorman's book \"The Protracted Game\" (1969) and, more recently, Robert Greene's book \"The 48 Laws of Power\" (1998) exploring the strategy of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War through the lens of Go.\nA similar comparison has been drawn among Go, chess and backgammon, perhaps the three oldest games that enjoy worldwide popularity. Backgammon is a \"man vs. fate\" contest, with chance playing a strong role in determining the outcome. Chess, with rows of soldiers marching forward to capture each other, embodies the conflict of \"man vs. man\". Because the handicap system tells Go players where they stand relative to other players, an honestly ranked player can expect to lose about half of their games; therefore, Go can be seen as embodying the quest for self-improvement, \"man vs. self\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nIntroductory books.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical interest.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Angiogenesis continues the growth of the vasculature mainly by processes of sprouting and splitting, but processes such as coalescent angiogenesis, vessel elongation and vessel cooption also play a role. Vasculogenesis is the embryonic formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors, and from neovascularization, although discussions are not always precise (especially in older texts). The first vessels in the developing embryo form through vasculogenesis, after which angiogenesis is responsible for most, if not all, blood vessel growth during development and in disease.\nAngiogenesis is a normal and vital process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. However, it is also a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign to malignant state, leading to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. The essential role of angiogenesis in tumor growth was first proposed in 1971 by Judah Folkman, who described tumors as \"hot and bloody,\" illustrating that, at least for many tumor types, flush perfusion and even hyperemia are characteristic.\nTypes.\nSprouting angiogenesis.\nSprouting angiogenesis was the first identified form of angiogenesis and because of this, it is much more understood than intussusceptive angiogenesis. It occurs in several well-characterized stages. The initial signal comes from tissue areas that are devoid of vasculature. The hypoxia that is noted in these areas causes the tissues to demand the presence of nutrients and oxygen that will allow the tissue to carry out metabolic activities. Because of this, parenchymal cells will secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) which is a proangiogenic growth factor. These biological signals activate receptors on endothelial cells present in pre-existing blood vessels. Second, the activated endothelial cells, also known as tip cells, begin to release enzymes called proteases that degrade the basement membrane to allow endothelial cells to escape from the original (parent) vessel walls. The endothelial cells then proliferate into the surrounding matrix and form solid sprouts connecting neighboring vessels. The cells that are proliferating are located behind the tip cells and are known as stalk cells. The proliferation of these cells allows the capillary sprout to grow in length simultaneously.\nAs sprouts extend toward the source of the angiogenic stimulus, endothelial cells migrate in tandem, using adhesion molecules called integrins. These sprouts then form loops to become a full-fledged vessel lumen as cells migrate to the site of angiogenesis. Sprouting occurs at a rate of several millimeters per day, and enables new vessels to grow across gaps in the vasculature. It is markedly different from splitting angiogenesis because it forms entirely new vessels as opposed to splitting existing vessels.\nIntussusceptive angiogenesis.\nIntussusceptive angiogenesis, also known as \"splitting angiogenesis\", is the formation of a new blood vessel by splitting an existing blood vessel into two.\nIntussusception was first observed in neonatal rats. In this type of vessel formation, the capillary wall extends into the lumen to split a single vessel in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish a zone of contact. Second, the endothelial cell junctions are reorganized and the vessel bilayer is perforated to allow growth factors and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the 2 new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with pericytes and myofibroblasts. These cells begin laying collagen fibers into the core to provide an extracellular matrix for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception is important because it is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast increase in the number of capillaries without a corresponding increase in the number of endothelial cells. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich microvasculature with new cells every time a new vessel develops.\nCoalescent angiogenesis.\nCoalescent angiogenesis is a mode of angiogenesis, considered to be the opposite of intussusceptive angiogenesis, where capillaries fuse, or coalesce, to make a larger bloodvessel, thereby increasing blood flow and circulation. Coalescent angiogenesis has extended out of the domain of embryology. It is assumed to play a role in the formation of neovasculature, such as in a tumor.\nPhysiology.\nMechanical stimulation.\nMechanical stimulation of angiogenesis is not well characterized. There is a significant amount of controversy with regard to shear stress acting on capillaries to cause angiogenesis, although current knowledge suggests that increased muscle contractions may increase angiogenesis. This may be due to an increase in the production of nitric oxide during exercise. Nitric oxide results in vasodilation of blood vessels.\nChemical stimulation.\nChemical stimulation of angiogenesis is performed by various angiogenic proteins e.g. integrins and prostaglandins, including several growth factors e.g. VEGF, FGF.\nFGF.\nThe fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family with its prototype members FGF-1 (acidic FGF) and FGF-2 (basic FGF) consists to date of at least 22 known members. Most are single-chain peptides of 16-18 kDa and display high affinity to heparin and heparan sulfate. In general, FGFs stimulate a variety of cellular functions by binding to cell surface FGF-receptors in the presence of heparin proteoglycans. The FGF-receptor family is composed of seven members, and all the receptor proteins are single-chain receptor tyrosine kinases that become activated through autophosphorylation induced by a mechanism of FGF-mediated receptor dimerization. Receptor activation gives rise to a signal transduction cascade that leads to gene activation and diverse biological responses, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and matrix dissolution, thus initiating a process of mitogenic activity critical for the growth of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.\nFGF-1, unique among all 22 members of the FGF family, can bind to all seven FGF-receptor subtypes, making it the broadest-acting member of the FGF family, and a potent mitogen for the diverse cell types needed to mount an angiogenic response in damaged (hypoxic) tissues, where upregulation of FGF-receptors occurs. FGF-1 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of all cell types necessary for building an arterial vessel, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells; this fact \"distinguishes FGF-1 from other pro-angiogenic growth factors\", such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which primarily drives the formation of new capillaries.\nBesides FGF-1, one of the most important functions of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2 or bFGF) is the promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and the physical organization of endothelial cells into tube-like structures, thus promoting angiogenesis. FGF-2 is a more potent angiogenic factor than VEGF or PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor); however, it is less potent than FGF-1. As well as stimulating blood vessel growth, aFGF (FGF-1) and bFGF (FGF-2) are important players in wound healing. They stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells that give rise to angiogenesis and developing granulation tissue; both increase blood supply and fill up a wound space/cavity early in the wound-healing process.\nVEGF.\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been demonstrated to be a major contributor to angiogenesis, increasing the number of capillaries in a given network. Initial \"in vitro\" studies demonstrated bovine capillary endothelial cells will proliferate and show signs of tube structures upon stimulation by VEGF and bFGF, although the results were more pronounced with VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the physiological response to exercise and its role in angiogenesis is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. \"In vitro\" studies clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis because, in the presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually forming tube structures resembling capillaries.\nVEGF causes a massive signaling cascade in endothelial cells. Binding to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) starts a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade that stimulates the production of factors that variously stimulate vessel permeability (eNOS, producing NO), proliferation/survival (bFGF), migration (ICAMs/VCAMs/MMPs) and finally differentiation into mature blood vessels. Mechanically, VEGF is upregulated with muscle contractions as a result of increased blood flow to affected areas. The increased flow also causes a large increase in the mRNA production of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The increase in receptor production means muscle contractions could cause upregulation of the signaling cascade relating to angiogenesis. As part of the angiogenic signaling cascade, NO is widely considered to be a major contributor to the angiogenic response because inhibition of NO significantly reduces the effects of angiogenic growth factors. However, inhibition of NO during exercise does not inhibit angiogenesis, indicating there are other factors involved in the angiogenic response.\nAngiopoietins.\nThe angiopoietins, Ang1 and Ang2, are required for the formation of mature blood vessels, as demonstrated by mouse knock out studies. Ang1 and Ang2 are protein growth factors which act by binding their receptors, Tie-1 and Tie-2; while this is somewhat controversial, it seems that cell signals are transmitted mostly by Tie-2; though some papers show physiologic signaling via Tie-1 as well. These receptors are tyrosine kinases. Thus, they can initiate cell signaling when ligand binding causes a dimerization that initiates phosphorylation on key tyrosines.\nMMP.\nAnother major contributor to angiogenesis is matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). MMPs help degrade the proteins that keep the vessel walls solid. This proteolysis allows the endothelial cells to escape into the interstitial matrix as seen in sprouting angiogenesis. Inhibition of MMPs prevents the formation of new capillaries. These enzymes are highly regulated during the vessel formation process because destruction of the extracellular matrix would decrease the integrity of the microvasculature.\nDll4.\nDelta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) is a protein with a negative regulatory effect on angiogenesis. Dll4 is a transmembrane ligand, for the notch family of receptors. There have been many studies conducted that have served to determine consequences of the Delta-like Ligand 4. One study in particular evaluated the effects of Dll4 on tumor vascularity and growth. In order for a tumor to grow and develop, it must have the proper vasculature. The VEGF pathway is vital to the development of vasculature that in turn, helps the tumors to grow. The combined blockade of VEGF and Dll4 results in the inhibition of tumor progression and angiogenesis throughout the tumor. This is due to the hindrance of signaling in endothelial cell signaling which cuts off the proliferation and sprouting of these endothelial cells. With this inhibition, the cells do not uncontrollably grow, therefore, the cancer is stopped at this point. if the blockade, however, were to be lifted, the cells would begin their proliferation once again.\nClass 3 semaphorins.\nClass 3 semaphorins (SEMA3s) regulate angiogenesis by modulating endothelial cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival and the recruitment of pericytes. Furthermore, semaphorins can interfere with VEGF-mediated angiogenesis since both SEMA3s and VEGF-A compete for neuropilin receptor binding at endothelial cells. The relative expression levels of SEMA3s and VEGF-A may therefore be important for angiogenesis.\nChemical inhibition.\nAn angiogenesis inhibitor can be endogenous or come from outside as drug or a dietary component.\nApplication in medicine.\nAngiogenesis as a therapeutic target.\nAngiogenesis may be a target for combating diseases such as heart disease characterized by either poor vascularisation or abnormal vasculature. Application of specific compounds that may inhibit or induce the creation of new blood vessels in the body may help combat such diseases. The presence of blood vessels where there should be none may affect the mechanical properties of a tissue, increasing the likelihood of failure. The absence of blood vessels in a repairing or otherwise metabolically active tissue may inhibit repair or other essential functions. Several diseases, such as ischemic chronic wounds, are the result of failure or insufficient blood vessel formation and may be treated by a local expansion of blood vessels, thus bringing new nutrients to the site, facilitating repair. Other diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, may be created by a local expansion of blood vessels, interfering with normal physiological processes.\nThe modern clinical application of the principle of angiogenesis can be divided into two main areas: anti-angiogenic therapies, which angiogenic research began with, and pro-angiogenic therapies. Whereas anti-angiogenic therapies are being employed to fight cancer and malignancies, which require an abundance of oxygen and nutrients to proliferate, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardiovascular diseases, the number one cause of death in the Western world. One of the first applications of pro-angiogenic methods in humans was a German trial using fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) for the treatment of coronary artery disease.\nRegarding the mechanism of action, pro-angiogenic methods can be differentiated into three main categories: gene therapy, targeting genes of interest for amplification or inhibition; protein replacement therapy, which primarily manipulates angiogenic growth factors like FGF-1 or vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF; and cell-based therapies, which involve the implantation of specific cell types.\nThere are still serious, unsolved problems related to gene therapy. Difficulties include effective integration of the therapeutic genes into the genome of target cells, reducing the risk of an undesired immune response, potential toxicity, immunogenicity, inflammatory responses, and oncogenesis related to the viral vectors used in implanting genes and the sheer complexity of the genetic basis of angiogenesis. The most commonly occurring disorders in humans, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, are most likely caused by the combined effects of variations in many genes, and, thus, injecting a single gene may not be significantly beneficial in such diseases.\nBy contrast, pro-angiogenic protein therapy uses well-defined, precisely structured proteins, with previously defined optimal doses of the individual protein for disease states, and with well-known biological effects. On the other hand, an obstacle of protein therapy is the mode of delivery. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intramuscular routes of protein administration are not always as effective, as the therapeutic protein may be metabolized or cleared before it can enter the target tissue. Cell-based pro-angiogenic therapies are still early stages of research, with many open questions regarding best cell types and dosages to use.\nTumor angiogenesis.\nCancer cells are cells that have lost their ability to divide in a controlled fashion. A malignant tumor consists of a population of rapidly dividing and growing cancer cells that progressively accrues mutations. However, tumors need a dedicated blood supply to provide the oxygen and other essential nutrients they require in order to grow beyond a certain size (generally 1\u20132\u00a0mm3).\nTumors induce blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) by secreting various growth factors (e.g. VEGF) and proteins. Growth factors such as bFGF and VEGF can induce capillary growth into the tumor, which some researchers suspect supply required nutrients, allowing for tumor expansion. Unlike normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are dilated with an irregular shape. Other clinicians believe angiogenesis really serves as a waste pathway, taking away the biological end products secreted by rapidly dividing cancer cells. In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be about the size of the metal ball at the end of a ball-point pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or metastasis. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of endothelial cells and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies. The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and oxygen and a waste disposal pathway.\nEndothelial cells have long been considered genetically more stable than cancer cells. This genomic stability confers an advantage to targeting endothelial cells using antiangiogenic therapy, compared to chemotherapy directed at cancer cells, which rapidly mutate and acquire drug resistance to treatment. For this reason, endothelial cells are thought to be an ideal target for therapies directed against them.\nFormation of tumor blood vessels.\nThe mechanism of blood vessel formation by angiogenesis is initiated by the spontaneous dividing of tumor cells due to a mutation. Angiogenic stimulators are then released by the tumor cells. These then travel to already established, nearby blood vessels and activates their endothelial cell receptors. This induces a release of proteolytic enzymes from the vasculature. These enzymes target a particular point on the blood vessel and cause a pore to form. This is the point where the new blood vessel will grow from. The reason tumour cells need a blood supply is because they cannot grow any more than 2-3 millimeters in diameter without an established blood supply which is equivalent to about 50-100 cells. Certain studies have indicated that vessels formed inside the tumor tissue are of higher irregularity and bigger in size, which is as well associated with poorer prognosis.\nAngiogenesis for cardiovascular disease.\nAngiogenesis represents an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely \"neoangiogenesis\": the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world with these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.\nThese failures suggested that either these are the wrong molecular targets to induce neovascularization, that they can only be effectively used if formulated and administered correctly, or that their presentation in the context of the overall cellular microenvironment may play a vital role in their utility. It may be necessary to present these proteins in a way that mimics natural signaling events, including the concentration, spatial and temporal profiles, and their simultaneous or sequential presentation with other appropriate factors.\nExercise.\nAngiogenesis is generally associated with aerobic exercise and endurance exercise. While arteriogenesis produces network changes that allow for a large increase in the amount of total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery over a long period of time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery.\nMacular degeneration.\nOverexpression of VEGF causes increased permeability in blood vessels in addition to stimulating angiogenesis. In wet macular degeneration, VEGF causes proliferation of capillaries into the retina. Since the increase in angiogenesis also causes edema, blood and other retinal fluids leak into the retina, causing loss of vision. Anti-angiogenic drugs targeting the VEGF pathways are now used successfully to treat this type of macular degeneration\nTissue engineered constructs.\nAngiogenesis of vessels from the host body into an implanted tissue engineered constructs is essential. Successful integration is often dependent on thorough vascularisation of the construct as it provides oxygen and nutrients and prevents necrosis in the central areas of the implant. PDGF has been shown to stabilize vascularisation in collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds.\nHistory.\nThe first report of angiogenesis can be traced back to the book \"A treatise on the blood, inflammation, and gun-shot wounds\" published in 1794, where Scottish anatomist John Hunter's research findings were compiled. In his study, Hunter observed the growth process of new blood vessels in rabbits. However, he did not coin the term \"Angiogenesis,\" which is now widely used by scholars. Hunter also erroneously attributed the growth process of new blood vessels to the effect of an innate vital principle within the blood. The term \"angiogenesis\" is believed to have emerged not until the 1900s. The inception of modern angiogenesis research is marked by Judah Folkman's report on the pivotal role of angiogenesis in tumor growth.\nQuantification.\nQuantifying vasculature parameters such as microvascular density has various complications due to preferential staining or limited representation of tissues by histological sections. Recent research has shown complete 3D reconstruction of tumor vascular structure and quantification of vessel structures in whole tumors in animal models.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the final Amiga model based on the Motorola 68000 and the 1990 Amiga Enhanced Chip Set. A redesign of the Amiga 500 Plus, it adds the option of an internal hard disk drive and a PCMCIA port. Lacking a numeric keypad, the A600 is only slightly larger than an IBM PC keyboard, weighing approximately 6 pounds (2.72kg). It shipped with AmigaOS 2.0, which was considered more user-friendly than earlier versions of the operating system.\nLike the A500, the A600 was aimed at the lower end of the market. Commodore intended it to revitalize sales of the A500-related line before the introduction of the 32-bit Amiga 1200. According to Dave Haynie, the A600 \"was supposed to be US$50\u201360 cheaper than the A500, but it came in at about that much more expensive.\" The A600 was originally to have been numbered the A300, positioning it as a lower-budget version of the Amiga 500 Plus.\nAn A600HD model was sold with an internal 2.5\" ATA hard disk drive of either 20 or 40\u00a0MB.\nDue to the inclusion of Kickstart 2.05, many software titles made for A1000 or A500 do not work properly or at all on A600 or later. A program, Relokick, was released (and included with the March 1993 issue of CU Amiga) which loaded a Kickstart 1.3 ROM image into memory and booted the machine into Kickstart 1.3, allowing most incompatible software to run. Because Relokick itself occupies 512 KB of memory, some titles would not work unless the A600 was fitted with a 1 MB trapdoor memory expansion.\nDevelopment and release.\nAfter the release of the Amiga 3000T, Commodore's next project was a next-generation Amiga chipset, which became the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA). Concurrently, engineers Dave Haynie, Jeff Porter, and Eric Lavitsky began work on Amiga 3000+, which would have been the first computer to use the AGA chipset, and Joe Augenbraun was behind the Amiga 1000+, which also would have used the chipset. Meanwhile, George Robbins designed another low-end project called the Amiga 300. The computer, codenamed \"June Bug\", had a floppy drive built in and was roughly the same size and weight as a Commodore 64. Development took a turn on all three projects when Ali dismissed the engineering management team and appointed former IBM executive Bill Sydnes as the company's engineering manager. Sydnes canceled the A1000+ and A3000+ models and delayed the AGA chipset, but simply changed the A300's design goals.\nThe model was launched in mid-March 1992 as the Amiga 600, superseding the A500. Units were manufactured in Commodore's production plants in Irvine, Scotland; Braunschweig, Germany; Kwai Chung, Hong Kong; and the Philippines. In the United States, it and its hard disk drive variant, the Amiga 600HD, sold for $ and $, respectively, the former of which was about $50 more than an A500 while the two systems were on sale, although the A600 was supposed to be sold for about that much less. Snydes canceled the still-popular A500 that year to ensure demand for the new system, and development on the Amiga series stalled for the first six months as he and Ali focused on targeting the PC marketplace while selling the new model. The Amiga 600 was discontinued in late 1993.\nThe machine is reported to have sold 193,000 units in Germany.\nBundled software.\nIn addition to the stock A600, mouse, power supply, and Workbench disk package, the A600 was available with the following software and hardware bundles:\nTechnical information.\nThe A600 shipped with a Motorola 68000 CPU, running at 7.09\u00a0MHz (PAL) or 7.16\u00a0MHz (NTSC) and 1 MB \"chip\" RAM with 80\u00a0ns access time.\nGraphics and sound.\nThe A600 is the last Amiga model to use Commodore's Enhanced Chip Set (ECS), which can address 2\u00a0MB of Amiga Chip RAM and adds higher resolution display modes. The so-called Super Agnus display chip can drive screen modes varying from 320\u00d7200 pixels to 1280\u00d7512 pixels, with different frequency sync. As with the original Amiga chipset, up to 32 colors can be displayed from a 12-bit (4096 color) palette at lower display resolutions. An extra-half-bright mode offers 64 simultaneous colors by allowing each of the 32 colors in the palette to be dimmed to half brightness. Additionally, a 4096-color \"HAM\" mode can be used at lower resolutions. At higher resolutions, such as 800\u00d7600i, only 4 simultaneous colors can be displayed.\nSound was unchanged from the original Amiga design, namely, 4 DMA-driven 8-bit channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.\nThe A600 was the first Amiga model since the original Amiga 1000 with built-in color composite video (RCA), which allowed the A600 to be used with a standard CRT television without the need for a Commodore A520 RF Modulator adaptor.\nPeripherals and expansion.\nThe A600 features Amiga-specific connectors including two DE9M ports for joysticks, mice, and light pens, a standard 25-pin RS-232 serial port and a 25-pin Centronics parallel port. As a result, the A600 is compatible with many peripherals available for earlier Amiga models, such as MIDI, sound samplers and video-capture devices.\nExpansion capabilities new to the Amiga line were the PCMCIA Type II slot and the internal 44-pin ATA interface both most commonly seen on laptop computers. Both interfaces are controlled by the 'Gayle' custom chip. The A600 has internal housing for one 2.5\" internal hard disk drive connecting to the ATA controller.\nThe A600 is the first of only two Amiga models to feature a PCMCIA Type II interface. This connector allows use of a number of compatible peripherals available for the laptop-computer market, although only 16-bit PCMCIA cards are hardware-compatible; newer 32-bit PC Card (CardBus) peripherals are incompatible. Mechanically, only Type I and Type II cards fit in the slot; thicker Type III cards will not fit (although they may connect if the A600 is removed from its original case). The port is also not fully compliant with the PCMCIA Type II standard as the A600 was developed before the standard was finalized. The PCMCIA implementation on the A600 is almost identical to the one featured on a later Amiga, the 1200. A number of Amiga peripherals were released by third-party developers for this connector including SRAM cards, CD-ROM controllers, SCSI controllers, network cards, sound samplers, and video-capture devices. Although PCMCIA was similar in spirit to Commodore's expansion architecture for its earlier systems, the intended capability for convenient external expansion through this connector was largely unrealized at the time of release because of the prohibitive expense of PCMCIA peripherals for a lower-budget personal computer. Later, a number of compatible laptop-computer peripherals have been made to operate with the A600, including network cards (both wired and wireless), serial modems and CompactFlash adapters.\nOperating system.\nThe A600 shipped with AmigaOS 2.0, consisting of Workbench 2.0 and a Kickstart ROM revision 37.299, 37.300 or 37.350 (Commodore's internal revision numbers). Confusingly, all three ROM revisions were officially designated as version \"2.05\". Some early A600s shipped with Kickstart 37.299, which had neither support for the internal ATA controller, nor for the PCMCIA interface. Although it is possible to load the necessary drivers from floppy disk, it is not possible to boot directly from ATA or PCMCIA devices. Models fitted with Kickstart 37.300 or 37.350 can utilize those devices at boot time. Version 37.350 improved compatibility with ATA hard disks by increasing the wait time for disks to spin up during boot.\nUpgrades.\nCPU.\nDespite that the 68000 is soldered to the motherboard, unofficial CPU upgrades include the Motorola 68000 (at higher clock speeds than the default 7.16\u00a0MHz or 7.09\u00a0MHz), 68010, 68020 (at up to 25\u00a0MHz), 68030 (at up to 50\u00a0MHz) and FPGA-based processors which are programmed to utilize the Motorola 680x0 instruction set. The processor is upgraded not by replacing the 68000, but rather by fitting a connector over the CPU and commandeering the system bus. \nMemory.\nRAM can be upgraded to a maximum of 2\u00a0MB Chip RAM using the trap-door expansion slot. An additional 4\u00a0MB of Fast RAM can be added in the PC Card slot using a suitable SRAM card to reach a capacity of 6\u00a0MB. However, additional Fast RAM can be added with unofficial memory or CPU upgrades. For example, the A608 board adds up to a maximum of 8\u00a0MB additional RAM by connecting over the original 68000. Likewise, CPU upgrades can accommodate up to 512\u00a0MB.\nOperating system.\nIt is possible to upgrade the A600 to Workbench 2.1. This features a localization of the operating system in several languages and has a \"CrossDOS\" driver providing read/write support for FAT (MS-DOS)-formatted media such as floppy disks or hard drives. Workbench 2.1 was a software only update which runs on all Kickstart ROMs of the 2.0x family.\nFollowing the release of AmigaOS 3.1 in 1994 it is possible to upgrade the A600 by installing a compatible revision 40.63 Kickstart ROM.\nThe A600 also supports AmigaOS 3.2.x, which is maintained by Hyperion Entertainment. This requires the installation of a compatible revision 47.96 Kickstart ROM and additional memory over and above the default 1 MB.\nOther.\nThe FPGA-driven Apollo Vampire V2 adds 128\u00a0MB Fast RAM, HDMI output, SD card for HDD storage and a 64-bit core with full 32-bit compatibility.\nAdditionally, the Apollo Manticore (Apollo Vampire V4) adds 512 MB DD3 RAM (500Mb Fast RAM and 12Mb Chip RAM), HDMI output, SD card for HDD storage (this device cannot be booted from), 64-bit \"68080\" core with full 32-bit compatibility, 2 x USB ports, 8/16-bit, 56 kHz, 24-bit audio with 16 DMA voices, 44-pin FastIDE for Compact Flash or 2.5\" IDE hard disk support, 10/100 RJ45 Ethernet port, RTC support and RTG video capable of 3D graphics up to 1920x1080 resolution at 60Hz. The Apollo Manticore also includes a \"Super AGA\" FPGA-driven chipset. Apart from providing RTG, it allows the Amiga 600 to run AGA software titles which would normally only run on the Amiga 1200, Amiga 4000 or Amiga 4000T.\nReception.\nContemporaneous reviews of the Amiga 600 were mixed. The magazine \"Amazing Computing\" called it \"an Amiga Warrior that offers an enormous opportunity to Amiga computing and the consumer market\", saying that it struck a balance between two markets of cartridge-based game consoles and home and business computers. It wrote that the changes to the model were incremental, rather than revolutionary, as only its design was substantially revised and not the Amiga computer itself\u2014an important consideration for potential buyers who already owned an Amiga 500. The decision to solder all circuitry other than the ROM chip on the motherboard, it said, allowed Commodore to manufacture a model that was more compact and more reliable, albeit with new hurdles on internal upgrading. The PCMCIA slot was viewed as an advantageous measure eliminating almost all possibilities of software piracy, and while the magazine noted that a majority of expansion hardware for the A500 would not work with this model, it believed the same community that reversed the expansion hardware's A1000 ports for use by A500 systems would supply the A600 with many peripherals.\n\"Amiga Computing\" reviewed the original and hard drive models and was more favorable to the latter. It found that the A600 model performed about as fast as an Amiga 500 Plus computer, but it praised the A600HD variant's use of a hard drive as offering the user more storage space and functionality than any other low-end Amiga model. Regarding both models, it praised the addition of an RF port, but criticized the power supply brick as the only impediment to the computers' advertised portability. It considered compatibility issues arising from software requiring the numeric keypad to be insignificant. However, while writing that the move to use surface-mounted technology made the computer more reliable and less prone to error, it conceded that it also meant that attempts to upgrade it internally had more obstacles. It also criticized the lack of the DMA expansion slot. Nevertheless, the magazine predicted that the A600HD model would capture the hobbyist market and stimulate the production of hard drive-installable games.\nConversely, editor-in-chief of \"Amiga World\" Doug Barney took a more negative stance on the A600. He similarly criticized the need for the power brick, and also questioned Commodore's design choices, in particular, removing the expansion slot, retaining the Motorola 68000 processor, and replacing an A501 connector with an A601 one, although not minding the loss of the numeric keypad. He further took issue with the barriers to upgrading the machine internally. He said the model was best suited for users who needed to travel with it and are not interested in expanding their systems but saw no incentive for users who wanted upgradeability.\nInternal reception among Commodore employees was also negative. The managing director of Commodore UK, David Pleasance, described the A600 as a \"complete and utter screw-up\". Disgruntled Commodore engineers nicknamed the model the \"Amiga Junior\", a reference to Sydnes' previous project of which he was in charge while at IBM, the IBM PCjr, which was a critical and commercial failure. Nonetheless, in Germany, it became the second-best-selling Amiga model, with 193,000 units sold. Dave Haynie, who worked as a senior engineer for Commodore, described the new features the A600 provided as bloat and noted its compatibility issues with A500 peripherals and lack of numeric keypad. Another Commodore engineer Bil Herd, pointed to a disconnect between the company's design team, its marketing team, and the demands of the marketplace. \"Ars Technica\" considers it to be the worst of Commodore's Amiga models, citing its higher price and fewer features compared to the Amiga 500, while also noting that markets were overstocked with A600 units at the same time that the more popular A500 and A1200 models were under-manufactured.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

ADHD symptoms arise from executive dysfunction.\nImpairments resulting from deficits in self-regulation such as time management, inhibition, task initiation, and sustained attention can include poor professional performance, relationship difficulties, and numerous health risks, collectively predisposing to a diminished quality of life and a reduction in life expectancy. It is associated with other mental disorders as well as non-psychiatric disorders, which can cause additional impairment.\nWhile ADHD involves a lack of sustained attention to tasks, inhibitory deficits also can lead to difficulty interrupting an already ongoing response pattern, manifesting in the perseveration of actions despite a change in context whereby the individual intends the termination of those actions. This symptom is known colloquially as hyperfocus and is related to risks such as addiction and types of offending behaviour. ADHD can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions. ADHD represents the extreme lower end of the continuous dimensional trait (bell curve) of executive functioning and self-regulation, which is supported by twin, brain imaging and molecular genetic studies.\nThe precise causes of ADHD are unknown in most individual cases. Meta-analyses have shown that the disorder is primarily genetic with a heritability rate of 70\u201380%, where risk factors are highly accumulative. The environmental risks are not related to social or familial factors; they exert their effects very early in life, in the prenatal or early postnatal period. However, in rare cases, ADHD can be caused by a single event including traumatic brain injury, exposure to biohazards during pregnancy, or a major genetic mutation. As it is a neurodevelopmental disorder, there is no biologically distinct adult-onset ADHD except for when ADHD occurs after traumatic brain injury.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nInattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behaviour, and impulsivity are common in ADHD. Academic difficulties are frequent, as are problems with relationships. The signs and symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin.\nAccording to the fifth edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5) and its text revision (DSM-5-TR), symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the same age. This requires at least six symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity for those under 17 and at least five symptoms for those 17 years or older. The symptoms must be present in at least two settings (e.g., social, school, work, or home), and must directly interfere with or reduce quality of functioning. Additionally, several symptoms must have been present before age 12 as per DSM-5 criteria. However, research indicates the age of onset should not be interpreted as a prerequisite for diagnosis given contextual exceptions.\nPresentations.\nADHD is divided into three primary presentations:\nThe table \"Symptoms\" lists the symptoms for ADHD-I and ADHD-HI from two major classification systems. Symptoms which can be better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition which an individual has are not considered to be a symptom of ADHD for that person. In DSM-5, subtypes were discarded and reclassified as presentations of the disorder that change over time.\nGirls and women with ADHD tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms of inattention and distractibility.\nSymptoms are expressed differently and more subtly as the individual ages. Hyperactivity tends to become less overt with age and turns into inner restlessness, difficulty relaxing or remaining still, talkativeness or constant mental activity in teens and adults with ADHD. Impulsivity in adulthood may appear as thoughtless behaviour, impatience, irresponsible spending and sensation-seeking behaviours, while inattention may appear as becoming easily bored, difficulty with organisation, remaining on task and making decisions, and sensitivity to stress.\nCharacteristics in childhood.\nDifficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD, as are delays in speech, language and motor development. Poorer handwriting is more common in children with ADHD. Poor handwriting can be a symptom of ADHD in itself due to decreased attentiveness. When this is a pervasive problem, it may also be attributable to dyslexia or dysgraphia. There is significant overlap in the symptomatologies of ADHD, dyslexia, and dysgraphia, and 3 in 10 people diagnosed with dyslexia experience co-occurring ADHD. Although it causes significant difficulty, many children with ADHD have an attention span equal to or greater than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find interesting.\nEmotional dysregulation.\nAlthough not listed as an official symptom, emotional dysregulation or mood lability is generally understood to be a common symptom of ADHD.\nRelationship difficulties.\nPeople with ADHD of all ages are more likely to have problems with social skills, such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships. This is true for all presentations. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10\u201315% of non-ADHD children and adolescents. People with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction. They may also drift off during conversations, miss social cues, and have trouble learning social skills.\nHyperfocus.\nAn association between ADHD and hyperfocus, a state characterised by intense and narrow concentration on a specific stimulus, object or task for a prolonged period of time, has been widely reported in the popular science press and media. The phenomenon generally occurs when an individual is engaged in activities they find highly interesting, or which provide instant gratification, such as video games or online chatting. Hyperfocus is not a recognised symptom of ADHD in diagnostic manuals, but is frequently referred to as a symptom of ADHD in academic literature and commonly reported in patients with ADHD in clinical practice. There is a lack of research into hyperfocus in ADHD. Studies in 2016, 2019 and 2024 found that individuals with ADHD diagnoses or self-reported ADHD symptoms experience hyperfocus more often, or more acutely. A 2020 study did not find a higher frequency of hyperfocus in adults with ADHD, although it reported a positive correlation with self-reported ADHD traits. The discrepancy with other studies may reflect varying definitions and conceptions of hyperfocus.\nA state of hyperfocus has been hypothesised as being beneficial, allowing individuals to focus on tasks for much longer than is typical. Conversely, it can be difficult to disengage from and shift attention to other stimuli or tasks, leading to excessively prolonged attention. It is related to risks such as internet addiction (see ) and to some types of offending behaviour. Recent research has linked hyperfocus to the psychological concepts of flow, an enjoyable experience of deep engagement in an activity, and perseveration, difficulty disengaging or switching from an activity.\nIQ test performance.\nCertain studies have found that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests. The significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms, such as distractibility, on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity. In studies of ADHD, higher IQs may be over-represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average nine points lower on standardised intelligence measures. However, other studies contradict this, saying that in individuals with high intelligence, there is an increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis, possibly because of compensatory strategies in said individuals.\nStudies of adults suggest that negative differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained by associated health problems.\nWhen people with ADHD show discrepancies between certain areas of IQ tests compared to others, it is usually irregularities in sub-tests within sections regarding working memory and processing speed. IQ tests rely on what is known as the g-factor as a way to compare different tests to see how predictive they are of the g-constant (general intelligence), as well as the correlation between other sub-tests on a given test and the predictive power of the g-factor. Some with ADHD may have abnormally low scores on sub-tests that invalidate the full-scale IQ score because the correlation between sub-tests is damaged. The WAIS and WISC have attempted to counter this by introducing a substitute scoring system that only counts sub-tests that are robust against executive dysfunction in studies if a discrepancy occurs.\nOn the Stanford-Binet, youth with ADHD take longer to complete the test, and have widespread irregularities within sub-tests in working memory domains. On the WAIS, the Arithmetic and Digit Span task was the most affected in ADHD and other disabilities.\nAs similar deficits and the lack-thereof also exist in individuals with learning disabilities, autism, and other neurodevelopmental disabilities, discrepancies in sub-tests, even if they satisfy the criteria for successful usage for special scales, such as the one on the WAIS and WISC, cannot alone be used as a definitive way to diagnose an individual with ADHD. Many individuals with NDD's will have similar or even more severe deficits. ADHD patients with a naturally high IQ will likely not have visible deficits in working memory on standardised tests that are normed on average individuals, and that cognitive heterogeneity in the ADHD population signals that many with ADHD will not have any visible working memory or processing speed deficits visible.\nCauses.\nADHD arises from brain maldevelopment especially in the prefrontal executive networks that can arise either from genetic factors (different gene variants and mutations for building and regulating such networks) or from acquired disruptions to the development of these networks and regions involved in executive functioning and self-regulation. Their reduced size, functional connectivity, and activation contribute to the pathophysiology of ADHD, as well as imbalances in the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems that mediate these brain regions.\nGenetic factors play an important role; ADHD has a heritability rate of 70\u201380%. The remaining 20\u201330% of variance is mediated by de-novo mutations and non-shared environmental factors that provide for or produce brain injuries; there is no significant contribution of the rearing family and social environment. Very rarely, ADHD can also be the result of abnormalities in the chromosomes.\nGenetics.\nLiterature reviews published in \"Biological Psychiatry\" and in \"Molecular Psychiatry\" have found the average heritability estimate of ADHD to be from 0.74 to 0.8, based on family, twin studies, and adoption studies. Additionally, evolutionary psychiatrist Randolph M. Nesse has argued that the 5:1 male-to-female sex ratio in the epidemiology of ADHD suggests that ADHD may be the end of a continuum where males are overrepresented at the tails, citing clinical psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen's suggestion for the sex ratio in the epidemiology of autism as an analogue.\nNatural selection has been acting against genetic variants for ADHD over at least 45,000 years, complicating the suggestion that ADHD was an adaptive form of neurodiversity in the human evolutionary past. The disorder may remain at a stable rate by the balance of genetic mutations and removal rate (natural selection) across generations; over thousands of years, these genetic variants become more stable, decreasing disorder prevalence. During human evolution, executive functions disrupted in ADHD, likely provide the capacity to bind contingencies across time thereby directing behaviour toward future over immediate events so as to maximise social consequences for humans.\nADHD has a high heritability of 74%, meaning that 74% of the presence of ADHD in the population is due to genetic factors. There are multiple gene variants which each slightly increase the likelihood of a person having ADHD; it is polygenic and thus arises through the accumulation of many genetic risks each having a very small effect. The siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorder.\nThe association of maternal smoking observed in large population studies disappears after adjusting for family history of ADHD, which indicates that the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and ADHD is due to familial or genetic factors that increase the risk for the confluence of smoking and ADHD.\nADHD presents with reduced size, functional connectivity and activation as well as low noradrenergic and dopaminergic functioning in brain regions and networks crucial for executive functioning and self-regulation. Typically, a number of genes are involved, many of which directly affect brain functioning and neurotransmission. Those involved with dopamine include DAT, DRD4, DRD5, TAAR1, MAOA, COMT, and DBH. Other genes associated with ADHD include SERT, HTR1B, SNAP25, GRIN2A, ADRA2A, TPH2, and BDNF. A common variant of a gene called latrophilin 3 is estimated to be responsible for about 9% of cases and when this variant is present, people are particularly responsive to stimulant medication. The 7 repeat variant of dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4\u20137R) causes increased inhibitory effects induced by dopamine and is associated with ADHD. The DRD4 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that inhibits adenylyl cyclase. The DRD4\u20137R mutation results in a wide range of behavioural phenotypes, including ADHD symptoms reflecting split attention. The DRD4 gene is both linked to novelty seeking and ADHD. The genes GFOD1 and CDH13 show strong genetic associations with ADHD. CDH13's association with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression make it an interesting candidate causative gene. Another candidate causative gene that has been identified is ADGRL3. In zebrafish, knockout of this gene causes a loss of dopaminergic function in the ventral diencephalon and the fish display a hyperactive/impulsive phenotype.\nFor genetic variation to be used as a tool for diagnosis, more validating studies need to be performed. However, smaller studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms in genes related to catecholaminergic neurotransmission or the SNARE complex of the synapse can reliably predict a person's response to stimulant medication. Rare genetic variants show more relevant clinical significance as their penetrance (the chance of developing the disorder) tends to be much higher. However their usefulness as tools for diagnosis is limited as no single gene predicts ADHD. ASD shows genetic overlap with ADHD at both common and rare levels of genetic variation.\nEvolutionary theorists view ADHD traits (such as novelty-seeking, rapid task-switching, and high exploratory drive) as possible cognitive specialisations that were advantageous in ancestral forager-gatherer environments. In modern structured settings these traits may become mismatched, leading to functional impairment. A recent evolutionary-mismatch hypothesis proposes that high trait curiosity associated with ADHD prepared ancestors to discover new opportunities in unpredictable environments, but in information-saturated, stable modern settings this drive may manifest as distractibility or impulsivity.\nEnvironment.\nIn addition to genetics, some environmental factors might play a role in causing ADHD. Alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders which can include ADHD-like symptoms. Children exposed to certain toxic substances, such as lead or polychlorinated biphenyls, may develop problems which resemble ADHD. Perinatal exposure to the organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and dialkyl phosphate is associated with an increased risk; however, the evidence is not conclusive. Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous system development and can increase the risk of ADHD. Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk.\nExtreme premature birth, very low birth weight, and extreme neglect, abuse, or social deprivation also increase the risk as do certain infections during pregnancy, at birth, and in early childhood. These infections include, among others, various viruses (measles, varicella zoster encephalitis, rubella, enterovirus 71). At least 30% of children with a traumatic brain injury later develop ADHD and about 5% of cases are due to brain damage.\nSome studies suggest that in a small number of children, artificial food dyes or preservatives may be associated with an increased prevalence of ADHD or ADHD-like symptoms, but the evidence is weak and may apply to only children with food sensitivities. The European Union has put in place regulatory measures based on these concerns. In a minority of children, intolerances or allergies to certain foods may worsen ADHD symptoms.\nIndividuals with hypokalemic sensory overstimulation are sometimes diagnosed as having ADHD, raising the possibility that a subtype of ADHD has a cause that can be understood mechanistically and treated in a novel way. The sensory overload is treatable with oral potassium gluconate.\nResearch does not support popular beliefs that ADHD is caused by eating too much refined sugar, watching too much television, bad parenting, poverty or family chaos; however, they might worsen ADHD symptoms in certain people.\nChildren who enter school earlier and are of a younger age than their classmates are more likely to have educational and behavioral problems than their peers, which can make them more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Behaviours typical of ADHD occur more commonly in children who have experienced violence and emotional abuse.\nPathophysiology.\nCurrent models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine. The dopamine and norepinephrine pathways that originate in the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus project to diverse regions of the brain and govern a variety of cognitive processes. The dopamine pathways and norepinephrine pathways which project to the prefrontal cortex and striatum are directly responsible for modulating executive function (cognitive control of behaviour), motivation, reward perception, and motor function; these pathways are known to play a central role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Larger models of ADHD with additional pathways have been proposed.\nBrain structure.\nIn children with ADHD, there is a general reduction of volume in certain brain structures, with a proportionally greater decrease in the volume in the left-sided prefrontal cortex. The posterior parietal cortex also shows thinning in individuals with ADHD compared to controls. Other brain structures in the prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar and prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuits have also been found to differ between people with and without ADHD.\nThe subcortical volumes of the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen appears smaller in individuals with ADHD compared with controls. Structural MRI studies have also revealed differences in white matter, with marked differences in inter-hemispheric asymmetry between ADHD and typically developing youths.\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) studies have revealed a number of differences between ADHD and control brains. Mirroring what is known from structural findings, fMRI studies have shown evidence for a higher connectivity between subcortical and cortical regions, such as between the caudate and prefrontal cortex. The degree of hyperconnectivity between these regions correlated with the severity of inattention or hyperactivity Hemispheric lateralisation processes have also been postulated as being implicated in ADHD, but empiric results showed contrasting evidence on the topic.\nNeurotransmitter pathways.\nPreviously, it had been suggested that the elevated number of dopamine transporters in people with ADHD was part of the pathophysiology, but it appears the elevated numbers may be due to adaptation following exposure to stimulant medication. Current models involve the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway and the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system. ADHD psychostimulants possess treatment efficacy because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. There may additionally be abnormalities in serotonergic, glutamatergic, or cholinergic pathways.\nPET mapping of neocortex receptor distribution indicates that the distribution of \u03bc-opioid receptors is the strongest contributor to cortical abnormalities in ADHD, followed by CB1 cannabinoid receptors.\nExecutive function and motivation.\nADHD arises from a core deficit in executive functions (e.g., attentional control, inhibitory control, and working memory), which are a set of cognitive processes that are required to successfully select and monitor behaviours that facilitate the attainment of one's chosen goals. The executive function impairments that occur in ADHD individuals result in problems with staying organised, time keeping, procrastination control, maintaining concentration, paying attention, ignoring distractions, regulating emotions, and remembering details. People with ADHD appear to have unimpaired long-term memory, and deficits in long-term recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory. Due to the rates of brain maturation and the increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older, ADHD impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood. Conversely, brain maturation trajectories, potentially exhibiting diverging longitudinal trends in ADHD, may support a later improvement in executive functions after reaching adulthood.\nADHD has also been associated with motivational deficits in children. Children with ADHD often find it difficult to focus on long-term over short-term rewards, and exhibit impulsive behaviour for short-term rewards.\nParadoxical reaction to neuroactive substances.\nAnother sign of the structurally altered signal processing in the central nervous system in this group of people is the conspicuously common paradoxical reaction (c.\u200910\u201320% of patients). These are unexpected reactions in the opposite direction as with a normal effect, or otherwise significant different reactions. These are reactions to neuroactive substances such as local anesthetic at the dentist, sedative, caffeine, antihistamine, weak neuroleptics and central and peripheral painkillers. Since the causes of \"paradoxical reactions\" are at least partly genetic, it may be useful in critical situations, for example before operations, to ask whether such abnormalities may also exist in family members.\nDiagnosis.\nADHD is diagnosed by an assessment of a person's behavioural and mental development, including ruling out the effects of drugs, medications, and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the symptoms. Childhood and adolescent ADHD diagnosis often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers with most diagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns. While many tools exist to aid in the diagnosis of ADHD, their validity varies in different populations, and a reliable and valid diagnosis requires confirmation by a clinician while supplemented by standardised rating scales and input from multiple informants across various settings. Most diagnosis in children is seen in low-income families, and more in Caucasian children in comparison to Black, Hispanic, and Asian children, however, the diagnosis may be influenced by racial and socio-economic biases.\nThe diagnosis of ADHD has been criticised as being subjective because it is not based on a biological test. The International Consensus Statement on ADHD concluded that this criticism is unfounded, on the basis that ADHD meets standard criteria for validity of a mental disorder established by Robins and Guze. They attest that the disorder is considered valid because: 1) well-trained professionals in a variety of settings and cultures agree on its presence or absence using well-defined criteria and 2) the diagnosis is useful for predicting a) additional problems the patient may have (e.g., difficulties learning in school); b) future patient outcomes (e.g., risk for future drug abuse); c) response to treatment (e.g., medications and psychological treatments); and d) features that indicate a consistent set of causes for the disorder (e.g., findings from genetics or brain imaging), and that professional associations have endorsed and published guidelines for diagnosing ADHD.\nThe most commonly used rating scales for diagnosing ADHD in children are the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) and include the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) used for parents to rate their child's behaviour, the Youth Self Report Form (YSR) used for children to rate their own behaviour, and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) used for teachers to rate their pupil's behaviour. Additional rating scales that have been used alone or in combination with other measures to diagnose ADHD include the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Second Edition (BRIEF2), Revised Conners Rating Scale (CRS-R), Conduct-Hyperactive-Attention Problem-Oppositional Symptom scale (CHAOS), Developmental Behavior Checklist Hyperactivity Index (DBC-HI), Parent Disruptive Behavior Disorder Ratings Scale (DBDRS), Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment (DIPA-L), Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior Rating Scale (SWAN) and the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale.\nThe ASEBA, BASC, CHAOS, CRS, and Vanderbilt diagnostic rating scales allow for both parents and teachers as raters in the diagnosis of childhood and adolescent ADHD. Adolescents may also self report their symptoms using self report scales from the ASEBA, SWAN, and the Dominic Interactive for Adolescents-Revised (DIA-R). Self-rating scales, such as the ADHD rating scale and the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale, are used in the screening and evaluation of ADHD.\nBased on a 2024 systematic literature review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), rating scales based on parent report, teacher report, or self-assessment from the adolescent have high internal consistency as a diagnostic tool meaning that the items within the scale are highly interrelated. The reliability of the scales between raters (i.e. their degree of agreement) however is poor to moderate making it important to include information from multiple raters to best inform a diagnosis.\nImaging studies of the brain do not give consistent results between individuals; thus, they are only used for research purposes and not a diagnosis. Electroencephalography is not accurate enough to make an ADHD diagnosis. A 2024 systematic review concluded that the use of biomarkers such as blood or urine samples, electroencephalogram (EEG) markers, and neuroimaging such as MRIs, in diagnosis for ADHD remains unclear; studies showed great variability, did not assess test-retest reliability, and were not independently replicable.\nIn North America and Australia, DSM-5 criteria are used for diagnosis, while European countries usually use the ICD-11 criteria. ADHD is alternately classified as neurodevelopmental disorder or a disruptive behaviour disorder along with ODD, CD, and antisocial personality disorder. A diagnosis does not imply a neurological disorder.\nVery few studies have been conducted on diagnosis of ADHD on children younger than 7 years of age, and those that have were found in a 2024 systematic review to be of low or insufficient strength of evidence. A 2024 systematic review commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) highlighted that although a variety of diagnostic approaches show potential, there is substantial variability in their performance across studies. The same review found that many studies did not include information on the impact associated with a misdiagnosis or the downsides of administering diagnostic assessments. The CBCL and Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DB-DOS) showed good performance, while BRIEF worked very well. However, there is not enough studies on children younger than 7 years of age to determine which diagnosis method is the most effective. The review emphasized that diagnostic accuracy often depends on the comparison group\u2014whether children with ADHD are being distinguished from typically developing peers or from other clinically referred youth\u2014and that multiple informants (such as parents, teachers, and the youth themselves) may be necessary to improve diagnostic accuracy due to poor-to-moderate agreement between raters.\nClassification.\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual.\nAs with many other psychiatric disorders, a formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria. In the United States, these criteria are defined by the American Psychiatric Association in the DSM. Based on the DSM-5 criteria published in 2013 and the DSM-5-TR criteria published in 2022, there are three presentations of ADHD:\nThis subdivision is based on presence of at least six (in children) or five (in older teenagers and adults) out of nine long-term (lasting at least six months) symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity\u2013impulsivity, or both. To be considered, several symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment (e.g. at home and at school or work). The symptoms must be inappropriate for a child of that age and there must be clear evidence that they are causing impairment in multiple domains of life.\nThe DSM-5 and the DSM-5-TR also provide two diagnoses for individuals who have symptoms of ADHD but do not entirely meet the requirements. \"Other Specified ADHD\" allows the clinician to describe why the individual does not meet the criteria, whereas \"Unspecified ADHD\" is used where the clinician chooses not to describe the reason.\nInternational Classification of Diseases.\nIn the eleventh revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization, the disorder is classified as Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (code 6A05). The defined subtypes are \"predominantly inattentive presentation\" (6A05.0); \"predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation\" (6A05.1); and \"combined presentation\" (6A05.2). However, the ICD-11 includes two residual categories for individuals who do not entirely match any of the defined subtypes: \"other specified presentation\" (6A05.Y) where the clinician includes detail on the individual's presentation; and \"presentation unspecified\" (6A05.Z) where the clinician does not provide detail.\nIn the tenth revision (ICD-10), the symptoms of \"hyperkinetic disorder\" were analogous to ADHD in the ICD-11. When a conduct disorder (as defined by ICD-10) is present, the condition was referred to as \"hyperkinetic conduct disorder\". Otherwise, the disorder was classified as \"disturbance of activity and attention\", \"other hyperkinetic disorders\" or \"hyperkinetic disorders, unspecified\". The latter was sometimes referred to as \"hyperkinetic syndrome\".\nSocial construct theory.\nThe social construct theory of ADHD suggests that, because the boundaries between normal and abnormal behaviour are socially constructed (i.e. jointly created and validated by all members of society, and in particular by physicians, parents, teachers, and others), it then follows that subjective valuations and judgements determine which diagnostic criteria are used and thus, the number of people affected. Thomas Szasz, a supporter of this theory, has argued that ADHD was \"invented and then given a name\".\nAdults.\nAdults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria, including that their signs must have been present by the age of six to twelve. The individual is the best source for information in diagnosis, however others may provide useful information about the individual's symptoms currently and in childhood; a family history of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis. Certain assessments, such as the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), attempt to assess these childhood ADHD symptoms by having adults retrospectively recall their experiences as children. While the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in children and adults, they often present differently in adults than in children: for example, excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults.\nWorldwide, it is estimated that 2.58% of adults have persistent ADHD (where the individual currently meets the criteria and there is evidence of childhood onset), and 6.76% of adults have symptomatic ADHD (meaning that they currently meet the criteria for ADHD, regardless of childhood onset). In 2020, this was 139.84 million and 366.33 million affected adults respectively. Around 15% of children with ADHD continue to meet full DSM-IV-TR criteria at 25 years of age, and 50% still experience some symptoms. As of 2010[ [update]], most adults remain untreated. Many adults with ADHD without diagnosis and treatment have a disorganised life, and some use non-prescribed drugs or alcohol as a coping mechanism. Other problems may include relationship and job difficulties, and an increased risk of criminal activities. Associated mental health problems include depression, anxiety disorders, and learning disabilities.\nSome ADHD symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children. While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax, or may talk excessively in social situations. Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking behaviour, and be short-tempered. Addictive behaviour such as substance abuse and gambling are common. Previously, changes in ADHD presentation over time led to those diagnosed as children appearing to have outgrown the DSM-IV criteria. The DSM-5 addresses this issue by differentiating childhood and adult diagnostic criteria, a marked departure from the DSM-IV, which did not fully take into account the differences in impairments seen in adulthood compared to childhood.\nFor diagnosis in an adult, the presence of symptoms since childhood is generally required. However, a proportion of adults who meet the criteria for ADHD in adulthood would not have been diagnosed with ADHD as children. Most cases of late-onset ADHD develop the disorder between the ages of 12\u201316 and may therefore be considered early adult or adolescent-onset ADHD.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nThe DSM provides differential diagnoses \u2013 potential alternate explanations for specific symptoms. Assessment and investigation of clinical history determines which is the most appropriate diagnosis. The DSM-5 suggests oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and other disorders such as stereotypic movement disorder and Tourette syndrome, in addition to specific learning disorder, intellectual disability, autism, reactive attachment disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, substance use disorder, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, medication-induced symptoms, and neurocognitive disorders. Many but not all of these are also common comorbidities of ADHD. The DSM-5-TR also suggests post-traumatic stress disorder.\nSymptoms of ADHD that particularly relate to disinhibition and irritability in addition to low-mood and self-esteem as a result of symptom expression might be confusable with dysthymia and bipolar disorder as well as with borderline personality disorder, however they are comorbid at a significantly increased rate relative to the general population. Some symptoms that are viewed superficially due to anxiety disorders, intellectual disability or the effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can overlap to some extent with ADHD symptoms. These disorders can also occur along with ADHD.\nPrimary sleep disorders may affect attention and behaviour and the symptoms of ADHD may affect sleep. It is thus recommended that children with ADHD be regularly assessed for sleep problems. Sleepiness in children may result in symptoms ranging from the classic ones of yawning and rubbing the eyes, to disinhibition and inattention. Obstructive sleep apnea can also cause ADHD-like symptoms.\nIn general, the DSM-5-TR can help distinguish between many conditions associated with ADHD-like symptoms by the context in which the symptoms arise. For example, children with learning disabilities may feel distractable and agitated when asked to engage in tasks that require the impaired skill (e.g., reading, math), but not in other situations. A person with an intellectual disability may develop symptoms that overlap with ADHD when placed in a school environment that is inappropriate for their needs. The type of inattention implicated in ADHD, of poor persistence and sustained attention, differs substantially from selective or oriented inattention seen in cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS), as well as from rumination, reexperiencing or mind blanking seen in anxiety disorders or PTSD.\nIn mood disorders, ADHD-like symptoms may be limited to manic or depressive states of an episodic nature. Symptoms overlapping with ADHD in psychotic disorders may be limited to psychotic states. Substance use disorder, some medications, and certain medical conditions may cause symptoms to appear later in life, while ADHD, as a neurodevelopmental disorder, requires for them to have been present since childhood.\nA careful understanding of the symptoms may help establish the difference between ADHD and other disorders. For example, the forgetfulness and impulsivity typical of ADHD (e.g., in completing school assignments or following directions) may be distinguished from opposition when there is no hostility or defiance, although ADHD and ODD are highly comorbid. Tantrums may differ from the outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder if there is no aggression involved. The fidgetiness observed in ADHD may be differentiated from tics or stereotypies common in Tourette syndrome or autism.\nAlso, the social difficulties often experienced by individuals with ADHD due to inattention (e.g., being unfocused during the interaction and therefore missing cues or being unaware of one's behavior) or impulsivity (blurting things out, asking intrusive questions, interrupting) may be contrasted with the social detachment and deficits in understanding social cues associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Individuals with ADHD may also present signs of the social impairment or emotional and cognitive dysregulation seen in personality disorders, but not necessarily such features as a fear of abandonment, an unstable sense of self, narcissistic tendencies, aggressiveness, or other personality features.\nWhile it is possible and common for many of these different conditions to be comorbid with ADHD, the symptoms must not be better explained by them, as per diagnostic criterion E in the DSM-5. The symptoms must arise early in life, appear across multiple environments, and cause significant impairment. Moreover, when some of these conditions are in fact comorbid with ADHD, it is still important to distinguish them, as each may need to be treated separately.\nComorbidities.\nPsychiatric comorbidities.\nIn children, ADHD occurs with other disorders about two-thirds of the time.\nOther neurodevelopmental conditions are common comorbidities. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), co-occurring at a rate of 21% in those with ADHD, affects social skills, ability to communicate, behaviour, and interests. Learning disabilities have been found to occur in about\u00a020\u201330% of children with ADHD. Learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders, and academic skills disorders. ADHD, however, is not considered a learning disability, but it very frequently causes academic difficulties. Intellectual disabilities75 and Tourette syndrome are also common.\nADHD is often comorbid with disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders. Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) occurs in about 25% of children with an inattentive presentation and 50% of those with a combined presentation.75 It is characterised by angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behaviour and vindictiveness which are age-inappropriate. Conduct disorder (CD) is another common comorbid disorder of adolescents with ADHD, and occurs in 25% of individuals with combined presentation.75 It is characterised by aggression, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft and violations of rules. Adolescents with ADHD who also have CD are more likely to develop antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. Brain imaging supports that CD and ADHD are separate conditions: conduct disorder was shown to reduce the size of one's temporal lobe and limbic system, and increase the size of one's orbitofrontal cortex, whereas ADHD was shown to reduce connections in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex more broadly. Conduct disorder involves more impairment in motivation control than ADHD. Intermittent explosive disorder is characterised by sudden and disproportionate outbursts of anger and co-occurs in individuals with ADHD more frequently than in the general population.\nBorderline personality disorder has also been noted to co-occur with ADHD, though more recent research suggests this may be due to historical biases leading to misdiagnoses. The current diagnostic assessment of either disorder is often complex, as both have overlapping symptoms, thus these assessments can follow a differential diagnosis to determine whether there is a co-occurrence of both disorders or not.\nAnxiety and mood disorders are frequent comorbidities. Anxiety disorders have been found to occur more commonly in the ADHD population, as have mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder). While boys tend to present with comorbidities that involve externalization, girls tend to internalise their symptoms, leading to the possibility of increased misdiagnosis via standards designed to recognise male ADHD. Adults and children with ADHD sometimes also have bipolar disorder, which requires careful assessment to accurately diagnose and treat both conditions.\nSleep disorders and ADHD commonly co-exist. They can also occur as a side effect of medications used to treat ADHD. In children with ADHD, insomnia is the most common sleep disorder with behavioural therapy being the preferred treatment. Problems with sleep initiation are common among individuals with ADHD but often they will be deep sleepers and have significant difficulty getting up in the morning. Melatonin is sometimes used in children who have sleep onset insomnia. Restless legs syndrome has been found to be more common in those with ADHD and is often due to iron deficiency anemia. However, restless legs can simply be a part of ADHD and requires careful assessment to differentiate between the two disorders. Delayed sleep phase disorder is also a common comorbidity.\nIndividuals with ADHD are at increased risk of substance use disorders. This is most commonly seen with alcohol or cannabis. The reason for this may be an altered reward pathway in the brains of ADHD individuals, self-treatment and increased psychosocial risk factors. This makes the evaluation and treatment of ADHD more difficult, with serious substance misuse problems usually treated first due to their greater risks. Other psychiatric conditions include reactive attachment disorder, characterised by a severe inability to appropriately relate socially, and cognitive disengagement syndrome, a distinct attention disorder occurring in 30\u201350% of ADHD cases as a comorbidity, regardless of the presentation; a subset of cases diagnosed with ADHD-PIP have been found to have CDS instead. Individuals with ADHD are three times more likely to be diagnosed with an eating disorder compared to those without ADHD; conversely, individuals with eating disorders are two times more likely to have ADHD than those without eating disorders.\nTrauma.\nADHD, trauma, and adverse childhood experiences are also comorbid, which could in part be potentially explained by the similarity in presentation between different diagnoses. The symptoms of ADHD and PTSD can have significant behavioural overlap\u2014in particular, motor restlessness, difficulty concentrating, distractibility, irritability/anger, emotional constriction or dysregulation, poor impulse control, and forgetfulness are common in both. This could result in trauma-related disorders or ADHD being mis-identified as the other. Additionally, traumatic events in childhood are a risk factor for ADHD; they can lead to structural brain changes and the development of ADHD behaviours. Finally, the behavioural consequences of ADHD symptoms cause a higher chance of the individual experiencing trauma (and therefore ADHD leads to a concrete diagnosis of a trauma-related disorder).\nNon-psychiatric.\nSome non-psychiatric conditions are also comorbidities of ADHD. This includes epilepsy, a neurological condition characterised by recurrent seizures. There are well established associations between ADHD and obesity, asthma and sleep disorders, and an association with celiac disease. Children with ADHD have a higher risk for migraine headaches, but have no increased risk of tension-type headaches. Children with ADHD may also experience headaches as a result of medication.\nA 2021 review reported that several neurometabolic disorders caused by inborn errors of metabolism converge on common neurochemical mechanisms that interfere with biological mechanisms also considered central in ADHD pathophysiology and treatment. This highlights the importance of close collaboration between health services to avoid clinical overshadowing.\nIn June 2021, \"Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews\" published a systematic review of 82 studies that all confirmed or implied elevated accident-proneness in ADHD patients, and whose data suggested that the type of accidents or injuries\u2014and overall risk\u2014changes over the lifespan of ADHD patients. In January 2014, \"Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention\" published a meta-analysis of 16 studies examining the relative risk of traffic collisions for drivers with ADHD, finding an overall relative risk estimate of 1.36 without controlling for exposure, a relative risk estimate of 1.29 when controlling for publication bias, a relative risk estimate of 1.23 when controlling for exposure, and a relative risk estimate of 1.86 for ADHD drivers with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder comorbidities.\nSuicide risk.\nSystematic reviews in 2017 and 2020 found strong evidence that ADHD is associated with increased suicide risk across all age groups, as well as growing evidence that an ADHD diagnosis in childhood or adolescence represents a significant future suicidal risk factor. Potential causes include ADHD's association with functional impairment, negative social, educational and occupational outcomes, and financial distress. A 2019 meta-analysis indicated a significant association between ADHD and suicidal spectrum behaviours (suicidal attempts, ideations, plans, and completed suicides); across the studies examined, the prevalence of suicide attempts in individuals with ADHD was 18.9%, compared to 9.3% in individuals without ADHD, and the findings were substantially replicated among studies which adjusted for other variables. However, the relationship between ADHD and suicidal spectrum behaviours remains unclear due to mixed findings across individual studies and the complicating impact of comorbid psychiatric disorders. There is no clear data on whether there is a direct relationship between ADHD and suicidality, or whether ADHD increases suicide risk through comorbidities.\nRejection sensitive dysphoria.\nRejection sensitive dysphoria, while not a formal diagnosis, is a common symptom of ADHD, estimated to affect a majority of people with ADHD. Others posit that rejection sensitivity stems from early attachment relationships and parental rejection; peer rejection is also thought to play a role. Bullying, an extreme form of peer rejection, is likely connected to later rejection sensitivity. However, there is no conclusive evidence for any of these theories.\nKaren Horney was the first theorist to discuss the phenomenon of \"rejection sensitivity\". She suggested that it is a component of the neurotic personality, and that it is a tendency to feel deep anxiety and humiliation at the slightest rebuff. Simply being made to wait, for example, could be viewed as a rejection and met with extreme anger and hostility.\nAlbert Mehrabian developed an early questionnaire measure of rejection sensitivity. Mehrabian suggested that sensitive individuals are reluctant to express opinions, tend to avoid arguments or controversial discussions, are reluctant to make requests or impose on others, are easily hurt by negative feedback from others, and tend to rely too much on familiar others and situations so as to avoid rejection.\nA more recent (1996) definition of rejection sensitivity is the tendency to \"anxiously expect, readily perceive, and overreact\" to social rejection. People differ in their readiness to perceive and react to rejection. The causes of individual differences in rejection sensitivity are not well understood. Because of the association between rejection sensitivity and neuroticism, there is a likely genetic predisposition.\nManagement.\nThe management of ADHD typically involves counseling or medications, either alone or in combination. While there are various options of treatment to improve ADHD symptoms, medication therapies substantially improve long-term outcomes, and while eliminating some elevated risks such as obesity, they do come with some risks of adverse events. Medications used include stimulants, atomoxetine, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, and sometimes antidepressants. In those who have trouble focusing on long-term rewards, a large amount of positive reinforcement improves task performance. Medications are the most effective treatment, and any side effects are typically mild and easy to resolve although any improvements will be reverted if medication is ceased. ADHD stimulants also improve persistence and task performance in children with ADHD. To quote one systematic review, \"recent evidence from observational and registry studies indicates that pharmacological treatment of ADHD is associated with increased achievement and decreased absenteeism at school, a reduced risk of trauma-related emergency hospital visits, reduced risks of suicide and attempted suicide, and decreased rates of substance abuse and criminality\". Data also suggest that combining medication with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can have positive effects: although CBT is substantially less effective, it can help address problems that reside after medication has been optimised.\nThe nature and range of desirable endpoints of ADHD treatment vary among diagnostic standards for ADHD. In most studies, the efficacy of treatment is determined by reductions in symptoms. However, some studies have included subjective ratings from teachers and parents as part of their assessment of treatment efficacies.\nBehavioural therapies.\nThere is good evidence for the use of behavioural therapies in ADHD. They are the recommended first-line treatment in those who have mild symptoms or who are preschool-aged. Psychological therapies used include: psychoeducational input, behavior therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, family therapy, school-based interventions, social skills training, behavioural peer intervention, organisation training, and parent management training. Neurofeedback has greater treatment effects than non-active controls for up to 6 months and possibly a year following treatment, and may have treatment effects comparable to active controls (controls proven to have a clinical effect) over that time period. Despite efficacy in research, there is insufficient regulation of neurofeedback practice, leading to ineffective applications and false claims regarding innovations. Parent training may improve a number of behavioural problems including oppositional and non-compliant behaviours.\nThere is little high-quality research on the effectiveness of family therapy for ADHD\u2014but the existing evidence shows that it is similar to community care, and better than placebo. ADHD-specific support groups can provide information and may help families cope with ADHD.\nSocial skills training, behavioural modification, and medication may have some limited beneficial effects in peer relationships. Stable, high-quality friendships with non-deviant peers protect against later psychological problems.\nDigital interventions.\nSeveral clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of digital therapeutics, particularly Akili Interactive Labs's video game-based digital therapeutic AKL-T01, marketed as EndeavourRx. The pediatric STARS-ADHD randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial demonstrated that AKL-T01 significantly improved performance on the Test of Variables of Attention, an objective measure of attention and inhibitory control, compared to a control group after four weeks of at-home use. A subsequent pediatric open-label study, STARS-Adjunct, published in Nature Portfolio's npj Digital Medicine evaluated AKL-T01 as an adjunctive treatment for children with ADHD who were either on stimulant medication or not on stimulant pharmacotherapy. Results showed improvements in ADHD-related impairment (measured by the Impairment Rating Scale) and ADHD symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment, with effects persisting during a 4-week pause and further improving with an additional treatment period. Notably, the magnitude of the measured improvement was similar for children both on and off stimulants. In 2020, AKL-T01 received marketing authorisation for pediatric ADHD from the FDA, becoming \"the first game-based therapeutic granted marketing authorisation by the FDA for any type of condition.\"\nIn addition to pediatric populations, a 2023 study in the \"Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry\" investigated the efficacy and safety of AKL-T01 in adults with ADHD. After six weeks of at-home treatment with AKL-T01, participants showed significant improvements in objective measures of attention (TOVA - Attention Comparison Score), reported ADHD symptoms (ADHD-RS-IV inattention subscale and total score), and reported quality of life (AAQoL). The magnitude of improvement in attention was nearly seven times greater than that reported in pediatric trials. The treatment was well-tolerated, with high compliance and no serious adverse events.\nMedication.\nThe medications for ADHD appear to alleviate symptoms via their effects on the pre-frontal executive, striatal and related regions and networks in the brain; usually by increasing neurotransmission of norepinephrine and dopamine.\nAccording to Effective Health Care Systematic Review, FDA-approved stimulant and non-stimulant medications shows sufficient evidence showing that they greatly improve the core symptoms of ADHD.\nStimulants.\nMethylphenidate and amphetamine or its derivatives are often first-line treatments for ADHD. About 70 per cent respond to the first stimulant tried and as few as 10 per cent respond to neither amphetamines nor methylphenidate. Stimulants may also reduce the risk of unintentional injuries in children with ADHD. Magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine or methylphenidate decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD. A 2018 review found the greatest short-term benefit with methylphenidate in children, and amphetamines in adults. Studies and meta-analyses show that amphetamine is slightly-to-modestly more effective than methylphenidate at reducing symptoms, and they are more effective pharmacotherapy for ADHD than \u03b12-agonists but methylphenidate has comparable efficacy to non-stimulants such as atomoxetine.\nIn a Cochrane clinical synopsis, Dr Storeb\u00f8 and colleagues summarised their meta-review on methylphenidate for ADHD in children and adolescents. The meta-analysis raised substantial doubts about the drug's efficacy relative to a placebo. This led to a strong critical reaction from the European ADHD Guidelines Group and individuals in the scientific community, who identified a number of flaws in the review. Since at least September 2021, there is a unanimous and global scientific consensus that methylphenidate is safe and highly effective for treating ADHD. The same journal released a subsequent systematic review (2022) of extended-release methylphenidate for adults, concluding similar doubts about the certainty of evidence. Other recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses, however, find certainty in the safety and high efficacy of methylphenidate for reducing ADHD symptoms, for alleviating the underlying executive functioning deficits, and for substantially reducing the adverse consequences of untreated ADHD with continuous treatment. Clinical guidelines internationally are also consistent in approving the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate and recommending it as a first-line treatment for the disorder.\nSafety and efficacy data have been reviewed extensively by medical regulators (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency), the developers of evidence-based international guidelines (e.g., the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of Pediatrics), and government agencies who have endorsed these guidelines (e.g., the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council). These professional groups unanimously conclude, based on the scientific evidence, that methylphenidate is safe and effective and should be considered as a first-line treatment for ADHD.\nThe likelihood of developing insomnia for ADHD patients taking stimulants has been measured at between 11 and 45 per cent for different medications, and may be a main reason for discontinuation. Other side effects, such as tics, decreased appetite and weight loss, or emotional lability, may also lead to discontinuation. Stimulant psychosis and mania are rare at therapeutic doses, appearing to occur in approximately 0.1% of individuals, within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine therapy. The safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear. Symptom improvement is not sustained if medication is ceased.\nThe long-term effects of ADHD medication have yet to be fully determined, although stimulants are generally beneficial and safe for up to two years for children and adolescents. A 2022 meta-analysis found no statistically significant association between ADHD medications and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) across age groups, although the study suggests further investigation is warranted for patients with preexisting CVD as well as long-term medication use. Regular monitoring has been recommended in those on long-term treatment. There are indications suggesting that stimulant therapy for children and adolescents should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication, decrease possible growth delay, and reduce tolerance. Although potentially addictive at high doses, stimulants used to treat ADHD have low potential for abuse. Treatment with stimulants is either protective against substance abuse or has no effect.\nThe majority of studies on nicotine and other nicotinic agonists as treatments for ADHD have shown favorable results; however, no nicotinic drug has been approved for ADHD treatment. Caffeine was formerly used as a second-line treatment for ADHD but research indicates it has no significant effects in reducing ADHD symptoms. Caffeine appears to help with alertness, arousal and reaction time but not the type of inattention implicated in ADHD (sustained attention/persistence). Pseudoephedrine and ephedrine do not affect ADHD symptoms.\nModafinil has shown some efficacy in reducing the severity of ADHD in children and adolescents. The only recorded side effect was increased loss of appetite. It may be prescribed off-label to treat ADHD.\nNon-stimulants.\nTwo non-stimulant medications, atomoxetine and viloxazine, are approved by the FDA and in other countries for the treatment of ADHD.\nAtomoxetine, due to its lack of addiction liability, may be preferred in those who are at risk of recreational or compulsive stimulant use, although evidence is lacking to support its use over stimulants for this reason. Atomoxetine alleviates ADHD symptoms through norepinephrine reuptake and by indirectly increasing dopamine in the pre-frontal cortex, sharing 70\u201380% of the brain regions with stimulants in their produced effects. Atomoxetine has been shown to significantly improve academic performance. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have found that atomoxetine has comparable efficacy, equal tolerability and response rate (75%) to methylphenidate in children and adolescents. In adults, efficacy and discontinuation rates are equivalent.\nAnalyses of clinical trial data suggests that viloxazine is about as effective as atomoxetine and methylphenidate but with fewer side effects.\nAmantadine was shown to induce similar improvements in children treated with methylphenidate, with less frequent side effects. A 2021 retrospective study showed that amantadine may serve as an effective adjunct to stimulants for ADHD\u2013related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second- or third-generation antipsychotics.\nBupropion is also used off-label by some clinicians due to research findings. It is effective, but modestly less than atomoxetine and methylphenidate.\nThere is little evidence on the effects of medication on social behaviours. Antipsychotics may also be used to treat aggression in ADHD.\nAlpha-2a agonists\nTwo alpha-2a agonists, extended-release formulations of guanfacine and clonidine, are approved by the FDA and in other countries for the treatment of ADHD (effective in children and adolescents but effectiveness has still not been shown for adults). They appear to be modestly less effective than the stimulants (amphetamine and methylphenidate) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine) at reducing symptoms, but can be useful alternatives or used in conjunction with a stimulant. These medications act by adjusting the alpha-2a ports on the outside of noradrenergic nerve cells in the pre-frontal executive networks, so the information (electrical signal) is less confounded by noise.\nGuidelines.\nGuidelines on when to use medications vary by country. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends use for children only in severe cases, though for adults medication is a first-line treatment. Conversely, most United States guidelines recommend medications in most age groups. Medications are especially not recommended for preschool children. Underdosing of stimulants can occur, and can result in a lack of response or later loss of effectiveness. This is particularly common in adolescents and adults as approved dosing is based on school-aged children, causing some practitioners to use weight-based or benefit-based off-label dosing instead.\nExercise.\nExercise does not reduce the symptoms of ADHD. The conclusion by the International Consensus Statement is based on two meta-analyses: one of 10 studies with 300 children and the other of 15 studies and 668 participants, which showed that exercise yields no statistically significant reductions on ADHD symptoms. A 2024 systematic review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) identified seven studies on the effectiveness of physical exercise for treating ADHD symptoms. The type and amount of exercise varied widely across studies from martial arts interventions to treadmill training, to table tennis or aerobic exercise. Effects reported were not replicated, causing the authors to conclude that there is insufficient evidence that exercise intervention is an effective form of treatment for ADHD symptoms.\nDiet.\nDietary modifications are not recommended as of 2019[ [update]] by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality due to insufficient evidence.\nA 2013 meta-analysis found less than a third of children with ADHD see some improvement in symptoms with free fatty acid supplementation or decreased consumption of artificial food colouring. These benefits may be limited to children with food sensitivities or those who are simultaneously being treated with ADHD medications. This review also found that evidence does not support removing other foods from the diet to treat ADHD. A 2014 review found that an elimination diet results in a small overall benefit in a minority of children, such as those with allergies. A 2016 review stated that the use of a gluten-free diet as standard ADHD treatment is not advised. A 2017 review showed that a few-foods elimination diet may help children too young to be medicated or not responding to medication, while free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food colouring as standard ADHD treatment is not advised.\nChronic deficiencies of iron, magnesium and iodine may have a negative impact on ADHD symptoms. There is a small amount of evidence that lower tissue zinc levels may be associated with ADHD. In the absence of a demonstrated zinc deficiency (which is rare outside of developing countries), zinc supplementation is not recommended as treatment for ADHD. However, zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used with amphetamine for the treatment of ADHD.\nPrognosis.\nAbout 30\u201350% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have ADHD in adulthood, with 2.58% of adults estimated to have ADHD which began in childhood. Children with ADHD have worse educational outcomes and a higher risk of unintentional injuries. In adults, hyperactivity is often replaced by inner restlessness, and adults affected are likely to develop coping mechanisms as they mature, thus compensating to some extent for their previous symptoms.\nThe negative impacts of ADHD symptoms contribute to poor health-related quality of life that may be further exacerbated by, or may increase the risk of, other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression. Individuals with ADHD may also face misconceptions and stigma. A number of recent studies have found that ADHD is associated with a significant reduction in average life expectancy. A US study found rates of smoking among those with ADHD are higher than in the general population. Positive effects of medication on functional impairment and quality of life (e.g. reduced risk of accidents) have been found across multiple domains.\nIndividuals with ADHD are significantly overrepresented in prison populations. Although there is no generally accepted estimate of ADHD prevalence among inmates, a 2015 meta-analysis estimated a prevalence of 25.5%, and a larger 2018 meta-analysis estimated the frequency to be 26.2%.\nNew research in 2025 indicates that adults diagnosed with ADHD may have a shorter lifespan compared to those without the condition. The study revealed that, on average, men with ADHD lived seven years less than men without ADHD, while women with ADHD had a lifespan nine years shorter than their peers. Although the study did not pinpoint exact causes of death, it highlighted that individuals with ADHD were more likely to engage in smoking, alcohol misuse, and face other health challenges such as depression, self-harm, or personality disorders.\nEpidemiology.\nADHD is estimated to affect about\u00a06\u20137% of people aged 18 and under when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria. When diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria, rates in this age group are estimated around\u00a01\u20132%. Rates are similar between countries and differences in rates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. Children in North America appear to have a higher rate of ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East; this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequency. (The same publication which describes this difference also notes that the difference may be rooted in the available studies from these respective regions, as far more studies were from North America than from Africa and the Middle East.) As of 2019,[ [update]] it was estimated to affect 84.7 million people globally.\nADHD is diagnosed approximately twice as often in boys as in girls, and 1.6 times more often in men than in women, although the disorder is overlooked in girls or diagnosed in later life because their symptoms sometimes differ from diagnostic criteria. In 2014, Keith Conners, one of the early advocates for recognition of the disorder, spoke out against overdiagnosis in a \"New York Times\" article. In contrast, a 2014 peer-reviewed medical literature review indicated that ADHD is underdiagnosed in adults.\nStudies from multiple countries have reported that children born closer to the start of the school year are more frequently diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD than their older classmates. Boys who were born in December where the school age cut-off was 31 December were shown to be 30% more likely to be diagnosed and 41% more likely to be treated than those born in January. Girls born in December had a diagnosis and treatment percentage increase of 70% and 77% respectively compared to those born in January. Children who were born at the last three days of a calendar year were reported to have significantly higher levels of diagnosis and treatment for ADHD than children born at the first three days of a calendar year. The studies suggest that ADHD diagnosis is prone to subjective analysis.\nRates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since the 1970s. Prior to 1970, it was rare for children to be diagnosed with ADHD, while in the 1970s rates were about 1%. This is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in incidence. With widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries, states within countries, races, and ethnicities, some suspect factors other than symptoms of ADHD are playing a role in diagnosis, such as cultural norms.\nDespite showing a higher frequency of symptoms associated with ADHD, non-White children in the US are less likely than White children to be diagnosed or treated for ADHD, a finding that is often explained by bias among health professionals, as well as parents who may be reluctant to acknowledge that their child has ADHD. Crosscultural differences in diagnosis of ADHD can also be attributed to the long-lasting effects of harmful, racially targeted medical practices. Medical pseudosciences, particularly those that targeted Black populations during the period of slavery in the US, lead to a distrust of medical practices within certain communities. The combination of ADHD symptoms often being regarded as misbehaviour rather than as a psychiatric condition, and the use of drugs to regulate ADHD, result in a hesitancy to trust a diagnosis of ADHD. Cases of misdiagnosis in ADHD can also occur due to stereotyping of people of colour. Due to ADHD's subjectively determined symptoms, medical professionals may diagnose individuals based on stereotyped behaviour or misdiagnose due to cultural differences in symptom presentation.\nA 2024 study in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reports around 15.5 million U.S. adults have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, with many facing challenges in accessing treatment. One-third of diagnosed individuals had received a prescription for a stimulant drug in the past year but nearly three-quarters of them reported difficulties filling the prescription due to medication shortages.\nHistory.\nADHD was officially known as attention deficit disorder (ADD) from 1980 to 1987; prior to the 1980s, it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood. Symptoms similar to those of ADHD have been described in medical literature dating back to the 18th century. Sir Alexander Crichton describes \"mental restlessness\" in his book \"An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement\" written in 1798. He made observations about children showing signs of being inattentive and having the \"fidgets\". The first clear description of ADHD is credited to George Still in 1902 during a series of lectures he gave to the Royal College of Physicians of London.\nThe terminology used to describe the condition has changed over time and has included: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;\"minimal brain dysfunction\" in the DSM-I (1952, also called \"minimal cerebral dysfunction\"), \"hyperkinetic reaction of childhood\" in the DSM-II (1968), and \"attention-deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity\" in the DSM-III (1980). In 1987, the symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity were collectively combined to define the new diagnosis of ADHD, and in 1994 the DSM-IV in split the diagnosis into three subtypes: ADHD inattentive type, ADHD hyperactive-impulsive type, and ADHD combined type. These terms were kept in the DSM-5 in 2013 and in the DSM-5-TR in 2022. Prior to the DSM, terms included \"minimal brain damage\" in the 1930s.\nADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been controversial since the 1970s. For example, positions differ on whether ADHD is within the normal range of behaviour, and to degree to which ADHD is a genetic condition. Other areas of controversy include the use of stimulant medications in children, the method of diagnosis, and the possibility of overdiagnosis. In 2009, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence states that the current treatments and methods of diagnosis are based on the dominant view of the academic literature.\nOnce neuroimaging studies were possible, studies in the 1990s provided support for the pre-existing theory that neurological differences (particularly in the frontal lobes) were involved in ADHD. A genetic component was identified and ADHD was acknowledged to be a persistent, long-term disorder which lasted from childhood into adulthood. ADHD was split into the current three sub-types because of a field trial completed by Lahey and colleagues and published in 1994. In 2021, global teams of scientists curated the International Consensus Statement compiling evidence-based findings about the disorder.\nIn 1934, Benzedrine became the first amphetamine medication approved for use in the United States. Methylphenidate was introduced in the 1950s, and enantiopure dextroamphetamine in the 1970s. The use of stimulants to treat ADHD was first described in 1937. Psychiatrist Charles Bradley gave the children with behavioural disorders Benzedrine and found it improved academic performance and behaviour.\nResearch directions.\nPossible positive traits.\nPossible positive traits of ADHD are a new avenue of research, and therefore limited.\nA 2020 review found that creativity may be associated with ADHD symptoms, particularly divergent thinking and quantity of creative achievements, but not with the disorder of ADHD itself\u00a0\u2013 i.e. it has not been found to be increased in people diagnosed with the disorder, only in people with subclinical symptoms or those that possess traits associated with the disorder. Divergent thinking is the ability to produce creative solutions which differ significantly from each other and consider the issue from multiple perspectives. Those with ADHD symptoms could be advantaged in this form of creativity as they tend to have diffuse attention, allowing rapid switching between aspects of the task under consideration; flexible associative memory, allowing them to remember and use more distantly related ideas which is associated with creativity; and impulsivity, allowing them to consider ideas which others may not have.\nPossible biomarkers for diagnosis.\nReviews of ADHD biomarkers have noted that platelet monoamine oxidase expression, urinary norepinephrine, urinary MHPG, and urinary phenethylamine levels consistently differ between ADHD individuals and non-ADHD controls. These parameters could serve as prognostic biomarkers for ADHD, but more research is needed to establish their prognostic utility. Urinary and blood plasma phenethylamine concentrations are lower in ADHD individuals relative to controls. The two most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD, amphetamine and methylphenidate, increase phenethylamine biosynthesis in treatment-responsive individuals with ADHD. Lower urinary phenethylamine concentrations are associated with symptoms of inattentiveness in ADHD individuals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64977", "revid": "35415410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64977", "title": "Tytonidae", "text": "Family of birds\nThe bird family Tytonidae, which includes the barn owls \"Tyto\" and the bay owls \"Phodilus\", is one of the two families of owls, the other being the true owls or typical owls, Strigidae. Tytonidae are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces. They have long, strong legs with powerful talons. Tytonidae also differ from the Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet.\nThe family is wide-ranging, although they are not very tolerant of severe winter cold, so are absent from northern areas of Europe, Asia, and North America; they are also absent from driest desert regions. They live in a wide range of habitats from semi-deserts to forests, and from temperate latitudes to the tropics. Within these habitats, they live near agricultural areas with high amounts of human activity. The majority of the 20 living species of barn owls are poorly known. Some, like the red owl, have barely been seen or studied since their discovery, in contrast to the western barn owl \"Tyto alba\", which is one of the best-known owl species in the world. However, some subspecies of the western barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species, but are very poorly known.\nFive species of barn owl are threatened, and some island species went extinct during the Holocene or earlier (e.g., \"Tyto pollens\", known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas, and possibly the basis for the mythical chickcharney). Barn owls are mostly nocturnal and generally non-migratory, living in pairs or singly.\nTaxonomy and systematics.\nBarn owls consist of two extant subfamilies: the Tytoninae or \"Tyto\" owls (including the western barn owl) and the Phodilinae or bay owls. The modern genera \"Tyto\" and \"Phodilus\" are thought to have originated from a common ancestor from the Oligocene period. It is believed the modern genus \"Tyto\" descended from large nocturnal birds in the West Indies during the Quaternary. The systematics of this group began with the discovery of \"Tyto ostologa\" (now extinct), whose remains were found in north-central Haiti. This discovery led to the finding of \"Tyto pollens, Tyto noeli,\" and \"Tyto riveroi\" in nearby cave deposits, all of which are now extinct and were also considered giant. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order; here, barn owls are a subfamily, Tytoninae. This is unsupported by more recent research (see Cypselomorphae), but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved.\nThe ashy-faced owl (\"T. glaucops\") was for some time included in \"T. alba\". Based on DNA evidence, K\u00f6nig, Weick &amp; Becking (2009) recognised the American barn owl (\"Tyto furcata\") and the Cura\u00e7ao barn owl (\"T. bargei\") as separate species. They proposed that \"T. a. delicatula\" should be split off as a separate species, to be known as the eastern barn owl, which would include the subspecies \"T. d. delicatula\", \"T. d. sumbaensis\", \"T. d. meeki\", \"T. d. crassirostris\", and \"T. d. interposita\". As of 2021, the International Ornithological Committee had not accepted the split of \"Tyto delicatula\" from \"T. javanica\".\nSome island subspecies are occasionally treated as distinct species, a move which should await further research into barn owl phylogeography. According to Murray Bruce in \"Handbook of Birds of the World Volume 5: Barn-owls to Hummingbirds\", \"a review of the whole group [is] long overdue\". Molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows a separation of the species into two clades, an Old World \"alba\" and a New World \"furcata\", but this study did not include \"T. a. delicatula\", which the authors seem to have accepted as a separate species. Extensive genetic variation was found between the Indonesian \"T. a. stertens\" and other members of the \"alba\" clade, leading to the separation of \"stertens\" into \"Tyto javanica\".\nTwenty to thirty subspecies are usually recognized, varying mainly in body proportions, size, and colour. Barn owls range in colour from the almost beige-and-white nominate subspecies \"alba\", \"erlangeri\", and \"niveicauda\", to the nearly black-and-brown \"contempta\". Island forms are mostly smaller than mainland ones, and those inhabiting forests have darker plumage and shorter wings than those living in open grasslands. Several subspecies are generally considered to be intergrades between more distinct populations.\nExtant genera.\nTwo extant genera are accepted:\nGenus \"Tyto\".\nSome of the \"Tyto\" species that exist include the western barn owl (\"Tyto alba\"), the American barn owl (\"Tyto furctata\"), and the eastern barn owl (\"T. javanica\", including the Australian barn owl \"T. javanica delicatula\"). Within each of these species, there are many subspecies. Of the western barn owl there are 10 subspecies: \"T. a. alba, T. a. detorta, T. a. erlangeri, T. a. ernesti, T. a. gracilirostris, T. a. guttata, T. a. hypermetra, T. a. poensis, T. a. schmitzi, T. a. thomensis\". Of the American barn owl, there are 10 subspecies: \"T. f. bargei, T. f. bondi, T. f. contempta, T. f. furcata, T. f. guatemalae, T. f. hellmayri, T. f. niveicauda, T. f. pratincola, T. f. punctatissima, T. f. tuidara\". Of the Australian barn owl, there are 7 subspecies: \"T. j. crassirostris, T. j. delicatula, T. j. javanica, T. j. interposita, T. j. meeki, T. j. stertens, T. j. sumbaensis\".\nThe western barn owl (\"T. alba\") can be found in Africa and parts of Asia, including Eurasia. The American barn owl (\"T. furcata\") can be found from North to South America. Lastly, the Australian barn owl (\"T. delicatula\") can be found in Australia, New Zealand, Polynesia, and Asia.\nGenus \"Phodilus\".\nThis genus includes the Oriental bay owl (\"P. badius\") and the Sri Lanka bay owl (\"P. assimilis\"). The genus has a much smaller distribution than \"Tyto\", with Oriental bay owls found in tropical Asia and Sri Lanka bay owls found in Sri Lanka and southwestern India.\nExtinct genera.\nThe fossil record of barn owls goes back to the Eocene, with the family eventually losing ground to the true owls after the radiation of rodents and owls during the Neogene epoch. Two subfamilies are known only from the fossil record: the Necrobyinae and the Selenornithinae. At least four extinct genera of barn owls have been described:\nFormer genera.\nThe supposed \"giant barn owl\" \"Basityto\" from the Early Eocene of Grafenm\u00fchle (Germany) was actually a crowned crane (\"Balearica\"); the presumed \"Easter Island barn owl\", based on subfossil bones found on Rapa Nui, has turned out to be a procellarid; and the specimen originally described as the fossilized Pliocene \"Lechusa stirtoni\" was later determined to be recent remains of a modern-day American barn owl.\nDescription.\nThe main characteristic of the barn owls is the heart-shaped facial disc, formed by stiff feathers which serve to amplify and locate the source of sounds when hunting. Further adaptations in the wing feathers eliminate sound caused by flying, aiding both the hearing of the owl listening for hidden prey and keeping the prey unaware of the owl. Barn owls overall are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although considerable variation is seen even within species.\nBay owls closely resemble the \"Tyto\" owls, but have a divided facial disc, ear tufts, and tend to be smaller.\nDistribution.\nThe barn owl is the most widespread landbird species in the world, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. Its range includes all of Europe (except Fennoscandia and Malta), most of Africa apart from the Sahara, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australia, many Pacific Islands, and North-, Central-, and South America. In general, it is considered to be sedentary, and, indeed, many individuals, having taken up residence in a particular location, remain there even when better nearby foraging areas are available. In the British Isles, the young seem largely to disperse along river corridors, and the distance travelled from their natal site averages about .\nIn continental Europe, the dispersal distance is greater, commonly somewhere between but exceptionally , with ringed birds from the Netherlands ending up in Spain and in Ukraine. In the United States, dispersal is typically over distances of , with the most travelled individuals ending up some from their points of origin. Dispersal movements in the African continent include , from Senegambia to Sierra Leone, and up to within South Africa. In Australia, there is some migration, as the birds move towards the northern coast in the dry season and southward in the wet season, as well as nomadic movements in association with rodent plagues. Occasionally, some of these birds turn up on Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, or New Zealand, showing that crossing the ocean is within their capabilities. In 2008, barn owls were recorded for the first time breeding in New Zealand. The barn owl has been successfully introduced into the Hawaiian island of Kauai in an attempt to control rodents; distressingly, it has been found to also feed on native birds.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nHunting and feeding.\nHunting in twilight or at night, the barn owl can target its prey and dive to the ground. Its legs and toes are long and slender, which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. This bird hunts by flying slowly, quartering the ground and hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It has long, broad wings that enable it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. It has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically, which improves detection of sound position and distance; the bird does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc helps with the bird's hearing, as is shown by the fact that, with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still determine a sound source's direction, although without the disc it cannot determine the source's height. It may perch on branches, fence posts, or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, and this is the main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia.\nRodents and other small mammals may constitute over ninety percent of the prey caught. Birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians, fish, spiders, and insects. Even when they are plentiful, and other prey scarce, earthworms do not seem to be consumed. In North America and most of Europe, voles predominate in the diet, and shrews are the second most common food choice. In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Mice and rats are the main foodstuffs in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, subtropics, and Australia. Gophers, muskrats, hares, rabbits, and bats are also preyed upon. Barn owls are usually specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in areas where prey is scarce.\nOn the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers, and pratincoles. On a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (\"Oceanodroma leucorhoa\"). On bird-rich islands, a barn owl might include birds as some fifteen to twenty percent of its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming termites, or on Orthoptera such as Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae), or true crickets (Gryllidae). Smaller prey is usually torn into chunks and eaten completely, including bones and fur, while prey larger than about \u2014such as baby rabbits, \"Cryptomys\" blesmols, or \"Otomys\" vlei rats\u2014is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded.\nCompared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Relative to its size, barn owls consume more rodents. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about fourteen percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nesting sites.\nBreeding.\nBarn owls living in tropical regions can breed at any time of year, but some seasonality in nesting is still evident. Where there are distinct wet and dry seasons, egg-laying usually takes place during the dry season, with increased rodent prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off. In arid regions, such as parts of Australia, breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods, with the resultant temporary increase in the populations of small mammals. In temperate climates, nesting seasons become more distinct, and there are some seasons of the year when no egg-laying takes place. In Europe and North America, most nesting takes place between March and June, when temperatures are increasing. The actual dates of egg-laying vary by year and by location, being correlated with the amount of prey-rich foraging habitat around the nest site. An increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate the local barn owls to begin nesting, and, consequently, two broods are often raised in a good year, even in the cooler parts of the owl's range.\nMoulting.\nFeathers become abraded over time and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are particularly dependent on their ability to fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently. In temperate areas, the owls undergo a prolonged moult that lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her, so she does not need to fly much. The first primary feather to be shed is a central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7, and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed, followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being shed the following year.\nThe male owl moults rather later in the year than the female, at a time when there is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting, and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. Their moult follows a pattern similarly prolonged as that of the female. The first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics, and barn owls there usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.\nPredators and parasites.\nPredators of the barn owl include large American opossums (\"Didelphis\"), the common raccoon, and similar carnivorous mammals, as well as eagles, larger hawks, and other owls. Among the latter, the great horned owl (\"Bubo virginianus\"), in the Americas, and the Eurasian eagle-owl (\"B. bubo\") are noted predators of barn owls. Despite some sources claiming that there is little evidence of predation by great horned owls, one study from Washington found that 10.9% of the local great horned owl's diet was made up of barn owls. In Africa, the principal predators of barn owls are Verreaux's eagle-owls (\"Ketupa lactea\") and Cape eagle-owls (\"Bubo capensis\"). In Europe, although less dangerous than the eagle-owls, the chief diurnal predators are the Eurasian goshawk (\"Astur gentilis\") and the common buzzard (\"Buteo buteo\"). About 12 other large diurnal raptors and owls have also been reported as predators of barn owls, ranging from the similar-sized Cooper's hawk (\"Accipiter cooperii\") and scarcely larger tawny owl (\"Strix aluco\") to huge bald (\"Haliaeetus leucocephalus\") and golden eagles (\"Aquila chrysaetos\"). As a result of improved conservation measures, the populations of the northern goshawk and eagle-owls are increasing, thus increasing the incidence of hunting on barn owls where the species coexist.\nWhen disturbed at its roosting site, an angry barn owl lowers its head and sways it from side to side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings outstretched and drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. Another defensive attitude involves lying flat on the ground or crouching with wings spread out.\nBarn owls are hosts to a wide range of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites, and externally the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites, which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies, such as \"Ornithomyia avicularia\", are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the fluke \"Strigea strigis\", the tapeworm \"Paruternia candelabraria\", several species of parasitic round worm, and spiny-headed worms in the genus \"Centrorhynchus\". These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey. There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller bursa of Fabricius, glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly \"Carnus hemapterus\", which attacks nestlings.\nLifespan.\nCollision with road vehicles is another cause of death and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals. In some locations, road mortality rates can be particularly high, with collision rates being influenced by higher commercial traffic, roadside verges that are grass rather than shrubs, and where small mammals are abundant. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may still be the case in some parts of the world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds, and being shot accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.\nStatus and conservation.\nThe barn owl is relatively common throughout most of its range and not considered globally threatened. If considered as a single global species, the barn owl is the second most widely distributed of all raptors, after only the peregrine falcon. It is wider-ranging than the also somewhat cosmopolitan osprey. Furthermore, the barn owl is likely the most numerous of all raptors, with the IUCN Red List assessor estimating a population possibly as large as nearly 10 million individuals. Severe local declines due to organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid 20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, they are not as common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995\u20131997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the US, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states (Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri), and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.\nIn Canada, barn owls are no longer common and are most likely to be found in coastal British Columbia south of Vancouver, having become extremely rare in a previous habitat, southern Ontario. In spite of a Recovery Strategy, particularly in 2007\u20132010 in Ontario, only a handful of wild, breeding barn owls existed in the province in 2018. This is primarily because of disappearing grasslands where the bird hunted in the past, but according to a study, also because of \"harsh winters, predation, road mortality and use of rodenticides\". The species is listed as endangered overall in Canada, due to loss of habitat and a lack of nesting sites.\nIn the Canary Islands, a somewhat larger number of these birds still seem to exist on the island of Lanzarote, but altogether this particular subspecies (\"T. a. gracilirostris\", the Canary barn owl) is precariously rare: perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands, which are usually assigned to this subspecies, have severely declined, and wanton destruction of the birds seems to be significant. On Tenerife, they seem relatively numerous, but on the other islands, as on Fuerteventura, the situation looks bleak. Due to the assignment to this subspecies of birds common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.\nNest boxes are used primarily when populations suffer declines. Although such declines have many causes, among them are the lack of available natural nesting sites. Early successes among conservationists have led to the widespread provision of nest boxes, which has become the most used form of population management. The barn owl accepts the provided nest boxes and sometimes prefers them to natural sites. The nest boxes are placed under the eaves of buildings and in other locations. The upper bound of the number of barn owl pairs depends on the abundance of food at nesting sites. Conservationists encourage farmers and landowners to install nest boxes by pointing out that the resultant increased barn owl population would provide natural rodent control. In some conservation projects, the use of rodenticides for pest control was replaced by the installation of nest boxes for barn owls, which has been shown to be a less costly method of rodent control.\nCultural aspects.\nCommon names such as \"demon owl\", \"death owl\", \"ghost owl\", or \"lich owl\" (from \"lich\", an old term for a corpse) show that rural populations in many places considered barn owls to be birds of evil omen. For example, the Tzeltal people in Mexico regard them as \"disease givers\". These owls do not \"hoot\", instead emitting raspy screeches and hissing noises, and their white face and underbelly feathers, visible as they fly overhead, make them look \"ghostly\". Consequently, they were often killed by farmers who were unaware of the benefits these birds bring. Negative perceptions can also be attributed to the false belief that they could eat large animals, such as chickens and cats. In Thailand, people believe that when the barn owl flies over or perches on the roof of any house, the inhabitants of that house will die. In South Africa, barn owls are often associated with witchcraft and are persecuted. In some South African cultures, these owls are used in , a form of traditional medicine, and are believed to give special powers when consumed.\nIn India, Hindus consider the barn owl to be the mount and symbol of Lakshmi, goddess of wealth and fortune.\nMummified barn owls from Ancient Egypt have also been found.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64980", "revid": "322290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64980", "title": "Boggart", "text": "Creature in English folklore\nA boggart is a supernatural being from English folklore. The dialectologist Elizabeth Wright described the boggart as 'a generic name for an apparition'; folklorist Simon Young defines it as 'any ambivalent or evil solitary supernatural spirit'. Halifax folklorist Kai Roberts states that boggart \u2018might have been used to refer to anything from a hilltop hobgoblin to a household faerie, from a headless apparition to a proto-typical poltergeist\u2019. As these wide definitions suggest boggarts are to be found both in and out of doors, as a household spirit, or a malevolent spirit defined by local geography, a \"genius loci\" inhabiting topographical features. The 1867 book \"Lancashire Folklore\" by Harland and Wilkinson makes a distinction between \"House boggarts\" and other types. Typical descriptions show boggarts to be malevolent. It is said that the boggart crawls into people's beds at night and puts a clammy hand on their faces. Sometimes he strips the bedsheets off them. The household boggart may follow a family wherever they flee. One Lancashire source reports the belief that a boggart should never be named: if the boggart was given a name, it could neither be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive (see True name).\nEtymology.\nBoggart is written in many different forms: \"boggard\" (particularly in Yorkshire), \"baggard\", \"bogerd\", \"boggat\", \"bogard\", \"boggerd\", \"boggert\", \"bugart\", \"buggard\", and \"buggart\". Boggart is ultimately the typical Lancashire dialect form. These forms all point to an origin with the Middle English word \"bugge\" (a spirit or monster) with an aggrandizing suffix making boggart, a great big \"bugge\". This also makes boggart a close linguistic cousin of \"bogle\" (or boggle, a Scots variant), 'bugaboo', \"bugbear\", \"bug\", \"bogeyman\" and \"bogie\", all of which also derive from \"bugge\". \"Bugge\" may, in turn, be related to other British and Irish supernatural terms like \"bucca\", \"pwca\", \"Puck\" and \"pooka\", but this is uncertain.\nDialect.\nIn north-western English dialects the word 'boggart' was sometimes used descriptively. In Lancashire, a skittish or runaway horse was said to have \"took boggarts\"\u2014that is, been frightened by a, usually invisible, boggart. 'Boggart muck' seems to have been a word for owl pellets in much of North West England.\nAppearance.\nThe recorded folklore of boggarts is remarkably varied as to their appearance and size. Many are described as relatively human-like in form, though usually uncouth, very ugly and often with bestial attributes. The 1902 \"Saga-book of the Viking Club\", Vol. 3., published by the Viking Society for Northern Research, describes a certain boggart as \"a squat hairy man, strong as a six year old horse, and with arms almost as long as tacklepoles\".\nOther accounts describe boggarts as having more completely beast-like forms. The \"Boggart of Longar Hede\" from Yorkshire was said to be a fearsome creature the size of a calf, with long shaggy hair and eyes like saucers. It trailed a long chain after itself, which made a noise like the baying of hounds. The \"Boggart of Hackensall Hall\" in Lancashire had the appearance of a huge horse.\nAt least one Lancashire boggart was said to sometimes take the forms of various animals, or indeed more fearful creatures. The boggarts of Lancashire were said to have a leader, or master, called 'Owd Hob', who had the form of a satyr or archetypical devil: horns, cloven hooves and a tail.\nThe name of at least one Lancashire boggart was recorded, \"Nut-Nan\", who flitted with a shrill scream among hazel bushes in Moston near Manchester. In Yorkshire, boggarts also inhabit outdoor locations; one is said to haunt Cave Ha, a limestone cavern at Giggleswick near Settle.\nGrizlehurst boggart (Lancashire).\nIn a piece of folklore concerning a Lancashire boggart first published in 1861, the author, Edwin Waugh, had a conversation with an elderly couple one evening about their local boggart. They maintained that the boggart was buried at a nearby bend in the road under an ash tree, along with a cockerel with a stake driven through it. Despite being buried, the boggart was still able to create trouble. A farmer's wife, the old couple claimed, just two weeks earlier had heard doors banging in her farmhouse at night, then loud laughter; she looked out to see three candles casting blue light and a creature with red burning eyes leaping about. The following morning many marks of cloven hooves were seen outside the house. The couple claimed that the boggart had unhitched their own horse and overturned their cart on occasion. \"Never name it [the boggart]\" the old woman repeated, and her husband stated that he would never dig near its grave.\n\"The Farmer and the Boggart\".\nIn one old tale, said to originate from the village of Mumby in the Lincolnshire countryside, the boggart is described as being rather squat, hairy, and smelly. In the story, a farmer offers a deal to a boggart inhabiting his land; the boggart may choose either the part of the crop that grows above the ground or the part below it. When the boggart chooses the part below the ground, the farmer plants barley; at harvest time, the boggart is left with only stubble. The boggart next time demands the part above ground instead, so the farmer plants potatoes. Once again left with nothing to show for his efforts, the enraged boggart leaves the area.\nAn alternative telling includes a third episode where the farmer and the boggart are to harvest the crop (wheat) from either side of the field, each getting what he harvests. However the farmer plants iron rods in the boggart's half before the reaping, which blunts his scythe and allows the farmer to harvest almost the entire field.\nThis story is identical to the European fable \"The Farmer and the Devil\", cited in many seventeenth-century French works. (See Bonne Continuation, Nina M. Furry et Hannelore Jarausch.)\nDistribution and place names.\nThe word 'boggart' is especially associated with Lancashire. But distribution maps show that \"Boggartdom\" (the area in which stories of boggarts are found) extended to northern Cheshire, much of Derbyshire, northern Lincolnshire, the old West Riding of Yorkshire, parts of the North Riding, the fringes of Westmorland, and perhaps Nottinghamshire, and possibly, at one time, as far north as Cleveland and as far south as Skegness. In other parts of northern England and the Scottish Lowlands, alternative 'bog' words were used such as 'bogie' and 'bogle'.\nA variety of geographic locations and architectural landmarks have been named for the boggart. Most famously there is a large municipal park called Boggart Hole Clough, which is bordered by Moston and Blackley in Manchester. \"Clough\" is a northern dialect word for a steep-sided, wooded valley; a large part of Boggart Hole Clough is made up of these valleys and is said to be inhabited by boggarts. The clough is the setting for many boggart stories, including one of how a local farmer, George Cheetham, and his family were forced to leave their home due to the torment inflicted by a boggart. However, as they were taking their possessions away in a cart, the voice of the boggart was heard issuing from a milk-churn on the cart. Unable to escape the boggart, they returned to their farm.\nThere is a Boggart Stones on Saddleworth Moor where the Moors Murderers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, buried the bodies of Pauline Reade and Lesley Ann Downey, children they had abducted, in 1963 and 1964. The children's bodies were buried just below the location, and in sight of, Boggart Stones (OS Map 1864). There is a Boggart Bridge in Burnley, Lancashire. Tradition says that whoever crosses the bridge must give a living thing to the boggart or forfeit his or her soul. Boggarts Roaring Holes are a group of potholes on the moors of Newby Moss near Clapham in the Yorkshire Dales. Legend has it that these potholes are the dwelling place of grotesque flesh-eating boggarts whose angry growls have allegedly been heard reverberating from the depths of the dark caverns beneath (hence the name). In the Seacroft area of Leeds in West Yorkshire there is a council estate named Boggart Hill; Boggart Hill Drive, Boggart Hill Gardens and Boggart Hill were all given the name of the estate area. Boggard Lane, between the villages of Oughtibridge and Worrall in South Yorkshire, is generally believed to derive from the term \"boggart\". There is also a Boggart Lane at Skelmanthorpe.\nOn Puck, a moon of Uranus, there is a crater named Bogle, in deference to the system of nomenclature on this satellite, whose features are all named after various mischievous spirits.\nThe Boggart Census.\nIn 2019 folklorist Simon Young launched a survey to test modern understandings of the word 'boggart' in England and particularly Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire. Young collected 1,100 accounts, including about 400 negatives ('from the middle-aged and the elderly saying that they had never heard of boggarts while growing up'). The census was released freely online by University of Exeter Press as an open access pdf.\nIn popular culture.\nFiction.\nBoggarts feature prominently in a number of popular fantasy novels, in various incarnations. These include the boggart in Susan Cooper's \"The Boggart\" and \"The Boggart and the Monster\", the boggart in the Septimus Heap series, the boggarts in Joseph Delaney's \"Spook's\" series, the boggart in William Mayne's \"Earthfasts,\" and the boggarts in Tasha Tudor's Corgi-related picture books.\nA boggart appears in Peter S. Beagle's novel \"Tamsin\". He is described as a humanoid creature about a meter high who resents humans moving into his house and torments them with pranks and thievery. It seems he can become invisible at first, but it is later determined that he can hide in narrow cracks such as those between cupboards and under bathtubs. As are many magical creatures in the book, the boggart is mortally afraid of cats.\nIn Stephen King's novel \"It\", the Loser's Club theorizes that Pennywise is a boggart and the tactics and rituals advised for use against boggarts are very effective. Whether this is a result of their belief that Pennywise is a boggart or the fact that Pennywise is indeed a boggart is unclear.\nThe boggarts in J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" are shape-shifters whose true form is unknown, that change shape to resemble their beholder's worst fear (possibly inspired by the \"clutterbumph\" in Paul Gallico's Manxmouse). They are unlike most boggarts of British folklore, whose appearance is fixed. Their closest parallel for a boggart able to change shape at will is probably to be found in a reference to a Lancashire boggart in the book \"Lancashire Folklore\" of 1867. \nIn some contemporary fantasy fiction and films such as \"The Spiderwick Chronicles\", Mark Del Franco's Convergent World books, and the fantasy writing of Juliana Horatio Ewing, boggarts are brownies who have been angered or become malevolent. This has been adopted into folklore studies but is not found in traditional sources.\nFilm and television.\nIn the 2014 fantasy film \"Seventh Son\" an enormous malevolent boggart attacks the protagonists while they are on their journey to find the antagonist character. Boggarts also appear in the film's original source material, \"The Spook's Apprentice\". In the CITV children's show \"The Treacle People\", boggarts are furry, gremlin-like creatures that originate from the Treacle Mines. They are mischievous, frequently playfighting and causing a mess. They serve as pets, friends and pests to the townspeople. They have the ability to walk up walls and other inclined surfaces due to their feet, which resemble plungers. \"Kamen Rider Wizard\" features a villain of the week based on the boggart.\nGames.\nIn the \"\" card game's Lorwyn block, the native goblins of the plane are called boggarts. In role-playing games, the boggart appeared as the immature form of a will-o'-wisp with shape-shifting abilities in \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" as well as Necromancer Games. A boggart appears in the game \"Home Safety Hotline\" \nIn \"My Singing Monsters\", the monster Bowgart is named after the boggart.\nBoggarts and bogs.\nThe connection between the word boggart and 'bog' depends on folk etymology: there is no obvious association in many earlier sources between boggarts and the word 'bog'; though this is frequent in post-war accounts. However, in Lincolnshire, the intimate connection of boggarts with marshland is attested in a 19th-century account. In this account the descriptive phrase 'swamp bogles' is also employed. In 1882, the weekly journal \"All the Year Round\", then edited by Charles Dickens Jr., describes a marsh-dwelling boggart, who milked farmers' cows at night. In Lancashire, when a person got lost in a marsh and was never seen again, the people were sure that a boggart had caught the poor unfortunate and devoured him.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They make up 3.6% of Pakistan's total population, and around 2% of the populations of both Iran and Afghanistan and the largest non-Arab community in Oman.\nEtymology.\nThe exact origin of the word \"Baloch\" is unclear. According to the Baloch historian Naseer Dashti (2012), the name of the ethnic group derives from 'Balaschik' living in Balasagan, between the Caspian Sea and Lake Van in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the Sasanian times. The remnants of the original name such as \"Balochuk\" and \"Balochiki\" are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.\nSome other writers suggest a derivation from Sanskrit words \"bal\", meaning strength, and \"och\" meaning high or magnificent.\nRegardless of its possible roots in ancient era, the ethnonym Baloch might be derived from a term cockscomb or crest used in Middle Persian that refer to the Baloch in Median kingdom and Kayanian dynasty who were part of the army of Astyages or Kay Khosrow troops. In ancient time, the Baloch wore distinctive helmets decorated with a cock's comb. It is presumably indicated to Turban that known as the \"Paag\" in Balochi language. The Baloch traditionally wear various styles of the turban, wrapped around the head.\nErnst Emil Herzfeld believes that the word Baloch is derived from the Median term \"*brza -va\u010diya\" meaning \"loud shouting\".\nAn earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the Gurjara-Pratihara ruler Mihira Bhoja (r. 836\u2013885), which says that the dynasty's founder Nagabhata I repelled a powerful army of \"Valacha Mlecchas\", translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by D. R. Bhandarkar. The army in question is that of the Umayyad Caliphate after the conquest of Sindh.\nLanguage.\nBalochi (, romanized: ) is an Indo-European language, spoken by the Baloch and belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the family. As an Iranian language, it is classified in the Northwestern group, spoken primarily in the Balochistan region of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. In addition, there are speakers in Oman, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Turkmenistan, East Africa and in diaspora communities in other parts of the world.\nUppsala University offers a course titled Balochi A, which provides basic knowledge of the phonetics and syntax of the Balochi language. Carina Jahani is a prominent Swedish Iranologist and professor of Iranian languages at Uppsala University, deeply researching in the study and preservation of the Balochi language.\nThere are a number of characteristic features that Balochi shares to Parthian and Median and close affinity with them.\nThe Balochi dialects are classified as:\nKoroshi is also classified as Balochi.\nMany Baloch are either bilingual or multilingual, speaking the language of their respective nation of origin, such as Urdu, Persian, and Arabic as a second language alongside their native Balochi, while those in diaspora communities often speak three or more languages.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nDuring the rule of Achaemenid, the Baloch were among rebellious Medes and Parthians who supported Bardiya against Darius I and later allied with Darius III in the Battle of Gaugamela with Alexander.\nAgha Mir Nasir Khan Ahmadzai the author of seven-volume book on the history of Baloch and Balochistan, connects Balochs with Medes and considers them descendants of the Medes, the people of ancient Iran. He makes mention of all Baloch tribes are descendants of the Medes, who came to Balochistan and settled in ancient time.\n\u0160ahrest\u0101n\u012bh\u0101 \u012b \u0112r\u0101n\u0161ahr is a surviving Middle Persian text on Sasanian administrative geography and history, based on the source, Padishkhw\u0101rgar (located at the vicinity of Segistan) was a Sasanian province in Late Antiquity and people who contributed to building 21 cities in Padishkhwargar were the K\u014dfy\u0101r \"mountain dweller\" people called Balo\u010d\u0101n \"Balochs\".\nMansel Longworth Dames in 1902 stated that \"a theory of the origin of the Baloch people, the largest ethnic group in the region, is that they are of Median descent.\"\nThe Baloch were among Kay Khosrow allies and formed part of his army headed by General Ashkash. This is depicted in the mythological part of the Shahnamah a prose work written in Middle Persian.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlso in another piece of this pose which is depicted in the same work:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDuring the Sassanid era, Anoshervan and Ardashir fought against the Balochs and After initially sustaining a defeat, succeeded in subjugating the Baloch. The Baloch scattered in the Makran (modern-day Balochistan in Iran and Pakistan) and Kerman regions, areas that formed the southeastern frontier of the Sassanid Empire. Periodic uprisings or refusals to pay tribute might have been part of their interactions with the Sassanid kings.\nMedieval period.\nAccording to Baloch lore, their ancestors hail from Aleppo in what is now Syria. After the fight against abbasid Caliph Harun under Ameer Hamza the Kharijites leader migrated to east or southeast of the central Caspian region, specially toward to east or southeast of the central Caspian region, specially toward Sistan, Iran.\nBased on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the Western Iranian languages, the original homeland of the Baloch tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central Caspian region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late Sasanian period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area. The migrations occurred over several centuries.\nBy the 9th century, Arab writers Istakhri, Yaqut al-Hamawi and Al-Muqaddas\u012b refer to the Baloch as a distinct ethnical group living in the area between Kerman, Khorasan, Sistan, and Makran. Ibn Khordadbeh, in Kitab al-Masalik wal-Mamalik, describes the geography of Makran, and mentions the Baloch as They are powerful, numerous, and engaged in animal husbandry, their houses are made of wood. Al-Muqaddas\u012b documented that Panjgur was the capital of Makran and that it was populated by people called Baloch.\nThe 12th century Seljuk invasion of Kerman seemed to have stimulated the further eastwards emigration of the Baloch, towards what is now the Balochistan province of Pakistan, although some remained behind and there are still Baloch in the eastern parts of the Iranian Sistan-Baluchestan and Kerman provinces. By the 13th\u201314th centuries, waves of Baloch were moving into Sindh, and by the 15th century into the Punjab.\nDayaram Gidumal writes that a Baloch legend is backed up by the medieval Qarmatians. The fact that the Kalmatis were ethnic Baluchis is also confirmed by the Persian historian in the 16th century Muhammad Qasim Ferishta.\nTraditionally, Jalal Khan was the ruler and founder of the first Baloch confederacy in the 12th century. (He may be the same as Jalal al-Din Mangburni the last ruler of the Khwarazmian Empire.) Jalal Khan left four sons \u2013 Rind Khan, Lashar Khan, Hoth Khan, Korai Khan and a daughter, Bibi Jato, who married his nephew Murad. Since 12th century Baloch chieftains ruled over most of Balochistan. Mir Jalal khan and Mir Chakar after the establishment of the Baloch Confederation, They extended their dominance on outside the borders of Balochistan, Mir Chakar seized control over Punjab and captured Multan. The great Baloch kingdom was based on tribal confederation, Punjab and Balochistan remained under his rule for a period of time .\nAccording to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, professor at University of Karachi, the Baloch migrated from Balochistan during the Little Ice Age and settled in Sindh and Punjab. The Little Ice Age is conventionally defined as a period extending from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, or alternatively, from about 1300 to about 1850.\nThe area where the Baloch tribes settled was disputed between the Persian Safavids and the Mughal emperors. Although the Mughals managed to establish some control over the eastern parts of the area, by the 17th century, a tribal Brahui leader named Mir Hasan established himself as the first \"Khan of the Baloch\". In 1666, he was succeeded by Mir A\u1e25mad Khan Qambarani who established the Khanate of Kalat under the Ahmadzai dynasty. Originally in alliance with the Mughals, the Khanate lost its autonomy in 1839 with the signing of a treaty with the British colonial government and the region effectively became part of the British Raj.\nSafavid period.\nThe Baluch tribes revolted against the Safavid government. Engelbert Kaempfer writes about this: Despite their small numbers, they attacked Suleiman Shah with their fortifications.\nDuring the Safavid dynasty sought to incorporate the Baloch regions into its administrative structure, the Baloch tribes maintained their autonomy through resistance, strategic alliances. In the reign of Soltan Hoseyn, a number of Baloch chiefs, ruling Balochistan and neighbouring areas.\nAfsharid period.\nAfter the fall of the Safavids, Iran fell under the control of the Afsharid Empire ruled by Nader Shah. Nader Shah sought to consolidate and expand his empire, which brought him into contact with the Baloch. Mohammad Khan Baloch became military commander in Afsharid Iran and Nader appointed Mohammad Khan Baloch the governor of fars, Kohgiluyeh and Khuzestan. Many Baloch were moved to Khorasan in order to protect the eastern border from invading Afghans during the reign of afsharid dynasty.\nKhanate of Kalat.\nThe Khanate of Kalat founded in the 16th century by Mir Altaz Sani Khan Qambrani and played an important part of Baloch history. The major figure in its establishment was Mir Ahmad Khan, who, established his authority over Kalat. The dynasty established as a tribal confederacy of Baloch and Brahui tribes and emerged as a political entity that consolidated the power of these tribes under a single ruler, known as the Khan. Mir Ahmad Khan I was strong enough to capture Quetta, Mastung, and Pishin from the Mughal governor at Kandahar.\nNasir Khan I Ahmadzai the sixth ruler of kalat was one of the most prominent and influential rulers of the Khanate of Kalat. He played a crucial role in consolidating Baloch power, unifying the Baloch tribes, and shaping the political and administrative structure of the Khanate. The border of Balochestan in the reign of Nasir khan stretched from across modern-day Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. Northern Border in areas such as Helmand and parts of Kandahar (Balochistan, Afghanistan). In the East stretched as far as Punjab including Dera Ghazi Khan, in the south Makran coast along the Arabian Sea from Karachi to Bandar Abbas, in the western included Persian Balochistan (modern-day Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Iran), Kerman and Bandar abbas.\nThe Khanate of Kalat declined in the early 19th century, losing much of its territory to Qajar Iran, Emirate of Afghanistan and British Balochistan.\nTalpur period.\nTalpur was a Baloch dynasty that originated in the modern-day Sindh region of Pakistan.\nThe Talpur ruled the Sindh until British conquest of Sindh in 1843. The Talpur Baloch were a prominent Baloch tribe that rose to power in Sindh during the late 18th century and established their rule. The Battle of Miani (1843), took place near Hyderabad, Baloch forces under the last Talpur ruler Amir Nasir Khan Talpur defeated by the East India Company led by Charles Napier.\nModern era.\nFor centuries, Balochistan was governed autonomously and local Baloch chieftains ruled Balochistan.\nFrom 1666 Balochistan was continuously under the control of the Khanate of Kalat and ruled by confederacy of Baloch tribes, until the occupation of Balochistan by the British in 1839.\nBaloch tribes in the Sarhad resisted the Persian government force. Gamshadzai, Yar Ahmadzai, Ismailzai and Kurd tribes fought against Persian force during 1888. Sanjrani Baloch ruled Seistan with its capital at Chakansur in the early and late 19th century. In 1897 the western regions of Balochistan were under the leadership of the chieftains of the Narui tribe.\nBaloch nationalism in its modern form began in the form of the Anjuman-e-Ittehad-e-Balochan-wa-Balochistan based in Mastung in 1929, led by Yousaf Aziz Magsi, Abdul Aziz Kurd and others. In Pakistan's Balochistan province, insurgencies by Baloch nationalists have been fought in 1948\u201350, 1958\u201360, 1962\u201363 and 1973\u20131977, with an ongoing low-level insurgency beginning in 2003. The Baloch population in Pakistan has endured grave violations of human rights, which include extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture. These actions are purportedly perpetrated by state security forces and their associates.\nThe First Balochistan Conflict started when three of the princely states of Kalat acceded to Pakistan in 1947 after independence.\nDuring the Second Balochistan conflict The Baloch nationalist leader Nawab Nauroz Khan led an armed rebellion against the central government, demanding greater autonomy. This triggered a major armed conflict, with over 50,000 Baloch fighters resisting the Pakistani military.\nThe Third Balochistan conflict began and engaging in guerrilla warfare against the Pakistani military. Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri led militants into guerrilla warfare from 1963 to 1969 by creating their own insurgent bases. This insurgency ended in 1969, with the Baloch separatists agreeing to a ceasefire granting general amnesty to the separatists as well as freeing the separatists.\nBaloch communities.\nPakistan.\nAbout 50% of the total Baloch population live in the Pakistani province of Balochistan while 40% are settled in Sindh and a significant albeit smaller number reside in the Pakistani Punjab.\nIn 2008, there were 180,000 Bugti based in Dera Bugti District. They are divided between the Rahija Bugti, Masori Bugti, Kalpar Bugti, Marehta Bugti and other sub-tribes. led the Bugti as Tumandar until his death in 2006. Talal Akbar Bugti was the tribal leader and President of the Jamhoori Watan Party from 2006 until his death in 2015.\nThere are 98,000 Marri based in Kohlo district in 2008, who further divide themselves into Gazni Marri, Bejarani Marri, and Zarkon Marri.\nAs of 2008 it was estimated that there were between eight and nine million Baloch people living in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. They were subdivided between over 130 tribes. Some estimates put the figure at over 150 tribes, though estimates vary depending on how subtribes are counted. The tribes, known as \"taman\", are led by a tribal chief, the tumandar. Subtribes, known as paras, are led by a muqaddam.\nThe Baloch holds a significant place in the history of Sindh. The Talpur, originally a Baloch tribe, ruled Sindh from 1783 to 1843. A significant population in sindh have Baloch root according unofficial estimates at about 4 million.\nIran.\nBaloch in Iran are the majority ethnic inhabitants of the region of Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Iran.The town of Jask in neighbouring Hormozgan Province is also inhabited by Baloch people. Baloch people also make up a minority in the eastern parts of Kerman, Razavi Khorasan and South Khorasan (Khorasani Baloch) and are scattered throughout other provinces of Iran. They speak the Rakhshani and Sarawani dialects of Balochi, an Iranian language.\nSistan and Balochestan is one of the poorest and least developed provinces in Iran. Basic infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and hospitals, is lacking compared to other regions. The unemployment rate is disproportionately high, especially among Baloch youth. The majority of Iranian Baloch are Sunni Muslims, which distinguishes them from the predominantly Shia Muslim population of Iran. This religious difference has often contributed to tensions between the Baloch and the central government.\nDuring the 1950s, tribal revolt led by a Baloch farmer Mir Daad Shah struck south eastern Iran. Elements of Baloch nationalism were present in this movement, he participated in a rebellion and armed insurgency against the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in the 1950s.\nOn September 30, 2022 (Bloody Friday) in Zahedan a large number of Baloch civilians gathered for Friday prayers at the Grand Makki Mosque, the largest Sunni mosque in Iran, located in Zahedan. After the prayers, peaceful demonstrations began, demanding justice for the sexual assault case of the alleged rape of a 15-year-old Baloch girl in June that by a commander of the police force in Chabahar. Iranian security forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and riot police, surrounded the area and opened fire on the protesters. According to human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Baloch activist groups, at least 96 people were killed on the day of the massacre, and hundreds were injured. Molavi Abdolhamid Ismaeelzahi called the incident a \"catastrophe\" and demanded \"trial and punishment for those responsible for those who have killed people\", adding that worshipers were shot in the head and heart by snipers. From this event, a picture of Khodanur Lojei, a Baloch protester whose hands were tied to a flagpole, with a cup of water put in front of him (but out of his reach) became a symbol in the ongoing protests.\nAfghanistan.\nBaloch constitute approximately 2% of Afghanistan's population. They are the majority in Nimroz Province. Baloch also have a presence in Helmand, Faryab, Takhar, Herat, Kandahar, Badakhshan and other parts of Afghanistan.\nRug weaving is a common profession among the Baloch tribes of Afghanistan. Balochi rugs, floor coverings made by the Baloch, are often sold in the Herat local market and global market. Needlework and handicrafts are the art of Baloch women in Afghanistan. Baloch women wear clothes called \"Za Asteen Guptan\", which are designed on Baloch needlework and embroidery. Keeping and breeding camels, as well as holding camel riding competitions in Nimroz province, is popular among the Baloch.\nIn the fall of 1978, Balochi was recognized as an official language of Afghanistan, alongside Pashto and Dari. A weekly newspaper in Balochi began publication in September 1978. The Baloch Council of Afghanistan is a Baloch socio-cultural organization that celebrates Baloch Culture Day every year.\nThe government of Afghanistan (Before the Taliban came to power) has never employed the same level of brutality against its own Baloch like Pakistan, but it has always been implacably opposed to any suggestion of Baloch separatism.\nGhulam Mohammad Lalzad Baloch, Mohammad Naeem Baloch, are some of the notable Baloch people in Afghanistan.\nOman.\nBaloch account for 20% of Oman's population, a total of around 1 million people and the largest non-Arab community in Oman. The first modern army of Oman was exclusively Baloch, and even today around 40% of Omani Army consists of Baloch people.\nthe Baloch have been well integrated in political life in Oman. the Baloch hold positions in many high-ranking jobs and have played a significant role in the progress and development of Oman.\nIndia.\nThere are around 300 Baloch families living in Mumbai, numbering about 1,500 individuals. They are scattered across the outer western suburbs and ghettos of Mumbai's metropolitan area. The vast majority of them belong to a working class background, having little formal education, and are employed as manual labourers or drivers.\nTurkmenistan.\nBaloch are also found in Turkmenistan mainly Merv and smaller numbers in other areas. They immigrated into the Merv and the Murghab River inland delta from the areas west and north of Herat, Afghanistan, Chakhansur District in the province of Nimruz and Iran in the mid 19th century. In 1926 the Baluch of Merv Oasis numbered 9,974. Their numbers fell to 7,842 in the official statistics by 1959 but then rose to 12,582 by 1970 and 18,997 by 1979.\nDiaspora.\nPersian Gulf Countries.\nThe Baluch people have a notable presence in the Persian Gulf countries, many of which are in Oman, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain.\nNorth America.\nThere was substantial immigration of ethnic Baloch in the United States and Canada who are mainly political refugees and immigrants seeking economic opportunity. A 2015 eight-part documentary by VSH News, the first Balochi language news channel, called Balochs in America, shows that Baloch Americans live in different parts of the United States, including Washington D.C., New York, Texas, North Carolina and Washington.\nAustralia.\nThere is a considerable number of Baloch who settled in Australia for education and employment opportunities. Small Baloch groups of cameleers were shipped in and out of Australia at three-year intervals, to service the Australian inland pastoral industry by carting goods and transporting wool bales by camel trains. Baloch cameleers who worked the Western Australian Goldfields in the late 1890s.\nEurope.\nThere are also significant populations in Norway, Sweden, and other European countries.\nMost Baloch people in Sweden live in the capital Stockholm or in Uppsala. A majority of Baloch political refugees and students choose Sweden as their host country and therefore they have a cultural presence in Sweden. Uppsala University offers a course titled Balochi A, which provides basic knowledge of the phonetics and syntax of the Balochi language. This course also includes a brief overview of the history of the Baloch people. The course is conducted in English and is available as a distance learning option, making it accessible to a broader audience interested in learning about the Balochi language.\nThere is a Baloch community in the UK, originating from the Balochistan province of southwestern Pakistan and neighbouring and other parts where Baloch populations reside. Estimates suggest that the Baloch community in London numbers in the thousands, though an exact figure is not available. There are many Baloch associations and groups active in the UK, including the Baloch Students and Youth Association (BSYA), Baloch Cultural Society, Baloch Human Rights Council (UK) and others.\nEast Africa.\nThere is also a small but historic Baloch community in East Africa, left over from when the Sultanate of Muscat ruled over Zanzibar and the Swahili Coast.\nBaloch culture.\nGold ornaments such as necklaces and bracelets are an important aspect of Baloch women's traditions and among their most favoured items of jewellery are \"dorr\", heavy earrings that are fastened to the head with gold chains so that the heavy weight will not cause harm to the ears. They usually wear a gold brooch (\"tasni\") that is made by local jewellers in different shapes and sizes and is used to fasten the two parts of the dress together over the chest.\nBaloch Culture Day is celebrated by the Baloch people annually on 2 March with festivities to celebrate their rich culture and history.\nWomen.\nIn general, Baloch women's rights and equality have improved in the recent years due to political movements within Baloch society. However, despite the progress, Baloch and international women's rights organizations still report significant human rights issues related to gender equality, forced marriages, and honor killings.\nBaloch women have taken the lead in the new wave of Baloch movements and have emerged as leaders and advocates for Baloch rights. In the movement of Baloch Long March two baloch women leading the movement for justice and equality in Baloch society against human rights violations and enforced disappearances in Balochistan. Mahrang Baloch and Sammi Deen Baloch the leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and Voice for Baloch Missing Persons and have been prominent advocate for the rights of Baloch people. In December 2024, Marang Baloch was included on the BBC's 100 Women list. Sammi Baloch has been honored with the Asia Pacific Human Rights Award for 2024, presented by Front Line Defenders. The award ceremony took place in Dublin, Ireland.\nFariba Baloch is another Baloch women who works for women's rights and human rights in Balochistan in Iran.

She received the 2024 International Women of Courage award.\nKarima Baloch was a human rights activist and was included in the 100 Women List by the \"BBC\" in 2016, where she was identified as a political activist campaigning for the independence for Balochistan from Pakistan. Her inclusion in the BBC 100 list as a Baloch woman was repeated in 2024 when the Iranian Zhina Modares Gorji bookseller was also named for her struggle for freedom of speech.\nBaloch Women have played numerous roles, and contributed in many ways, to Baloch society. Historically, tradition maintained. Banadi Shehak the sister of Mir Chakar Rind was a Baloch woman who led the war and participated in the battlefield.\nFolklore.\nBaloch folklore () consists of folk traditions which have developed in Balochistan over many centuries. The majority of such folk traditions are preserved in the Balochi language and deal with themes such as tragic love, resistance and war. The history of Baloch tribes is captured in the ballads which narrate the conflicts and wars fought by various clans, celebrating the valor of tribal chiefs and heroes.\nHani and Sheh Mureed, a tragic love story. It tells of the deep love between Hani and Sheh Mureed and the societal pressures that ultimately lead to their separation.\nMir Hammal Jiand is a significant figure in Baloch folklore, Baloch culture and Balochi literature , particularly noted for his role during the conflicts with Portuguese colonial forces in the 16th century. He is celebrated as a heroic leader and is often compared to other notable Baloch leaders like Mir Chakar Rind.\nWidely varying in purpose and style, among the Baloch folklore one will find stories about nature, anthropomorphic animals, love, heroes and villains, mythological creatures and everyday life. Baloch mythology often intertwines with their beliefs and geography, featuring the supernatural. A number of these mythological figures can be found in other cultures, like stories of Shahnameh and Iranian Mythology. Ashkash is introduced in several verses in the Shahnameh as the commander of the Baloch army. This work has inspired Baloch heroic tales and has appeared in the works of Baloch writers and Baloch folklore.\nMusic and Dance.\nIn ancient times, especially during the pre-Islamic era, it was common for Baloch women to perform dances and sing folk songs at different events. The tradition of a Baloch mother singing lullabies to her children has played an important role in the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation since ancient times. Apart from the dressing style of the Baloch, indigenous and local traditions and customs are also of great importance to the Baloch.\nZah\u012br\u014dk is one of the musical forms of Baloch and in the beginning, was only sung by two groups of Baloch women.\nSuroz and Ghaychak are popular instrument between Balochs such as craftspeople, folk artists, folk musicians and dance groups.\nWeaving.\nBalochi weaving is renowned throughout the world, with fine specimens of both rugs and carpets. The most famous balochi rugs are those from Nimruz and Khorasan. Wool is the primary material used, sourced from sheep and goats. In some cases, camel hair or a mix of natural fibers is also used. Mehrabi is a prayer rug designed in the Balochi style, and it typically features a mihrab or arch at one end of the rug.\nHandicrafts.\nBalochi handicrafts are handicraft or handmade crafted works originating from Baloch people.\nBalochi mirror work embroidery is a type of traditional Balochi embroidery and art that is used to decorate coats, cloth, hat(pag), cushion covers, tablecloths, bags, shoes, vests, local clothing between Baloch of afghanistan and pakistan.\nBalochi coin work embroidery is one of the handicrafts of Balochistan that the Baloch generally use to decorate bedspreads or camel necks during weddings, and they often hang them on the walls to decorate rooms.

These crafts are known for their intricate designs, vibrant colors, and high-quality craftsmanship. They are often made by women artisans and serve both functional and decorative purposes, playing a significant role in the economy and identity of the Baloch community. Notable Balochi needlework artisans include Mahtab Norouzi. Farah Diba Pahlavi, the former Shahbanu of Iran, was particularly drawn to Balochi needlework handcrafts and incorporated them into many of her formal dresses.\nAmong crafts are coin embroidery and cream embroidery that are made with natural materials.\nGenetics.\nFor most Balochs, haplogroup R1a is the most common paternal clade. The majority of Balochs belong to R1a, with a frequency of 34\u201336%.\nReligion.\nIslam.\nThe Baloch are predominantly Muslim, with the vast majority belonging to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, but there is also tiny proportion of Shia in Balochistan.\nIn the case of Pakistan, breakdown by religious movements or sub-groups among the ethnic Baloch in the country as a whole is as following: 64.78% are Sunni-Deobandis, 33.38% are Sunni-Barelvis and 1.25% are Sunni-Ahl-i Hadith; Shia's are 0.59%. Inside Pakistan's Balochistan province more specifically, the religious affiliation among the Baloch is: 68.75% Sunni-Deobandi, 30.38% Sunni-Barelvis, 0.79% Sunni-Ahl-i Hadith and 0.07% Shi'as.\nIslamism.\nAlthough Baloch leaders, backed by traditional scholarship, have held that the Baloch people are secular, Christine Fair and Ali Hamza found during their 2017 study that, when it comes to Islamism, \"contrary to the conventional wisdom, Baloch are generally indistinguishable from other Pakistanis in Balochistan or the rest of Pakistan\". There are virtually no statistically significant or substantive differences between Baloch Muslims and other Muslims in Pakistan in terms of religiosity, support for a sharia-compliant Pakistan state, liberating Muslims from oppression including Kashmir, etc.\nZikri sect.\nIn 2020, 800,000 Pakistani Baloch were estimated to follow the Zikri sect.\nZoroastrian influences.\nBefore the Islam era, the Baloch were the followers of Mazdakian and Manichean sects of Zoroastrian.\nA number of Baloch tribes still preserve and adhere to pre-Islamic traditions, including the Nal oath (a type of oath to prove innocence by passing through fire) which is common among the Baloch around Taftan, and they are bilingual, speaking Parsiwani in addition to the Balochi language.\nHindu and Sikh minorities.\nA small number of Balochs are non-Muslims, particularly in the Bugti clan which has Hindu and Sikh members.\nMost of these Hindus or Sikhs are not ethnic Baloch, or not fully; for example, many Marathas were captured following their defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 and were integrated within the Baloch tribal system (taking names like Bugti and more), their history having been covered in the 2023 Marathi movie \"Baloch\".\nLikewise, the Bhagnaris are a Hindu community living in India who trace their origin to southern Balochistan but migrated to India during the Partition. Numbering around 2,500 in Mumbai they identify as Sindhis in terms of ethnicity and speak Saraiki, a language close to Punjabi.\nNotable people.\nPakistan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64989", "revid": "6404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64989", "title": "Factsheet Five", "text": "US magazine\nFactsheet Five was a periodical mostly consisting of short reviews of privately produced printed matter along with contact details of the editors and publishers.\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, its comprehensive reviews (thousands in each issue) made it the most important publication in its field, increasing distribution channels for self-publishers and heralding the wider spread of what would eventually be called fanzine or zine culture. A number of underground artists and writers read or submitted their work to \"Factsheet Five\", including John Porcellino, Julie Doucet, and Jonathan Lethem.\nBefore the widespread adoption of the web and e-mail beginning around 1994, publications such as \"Factsheet Five\" formed a vital directory for connecting like-minded people. It was the literary equivalent to such phenomena as \"International Sound Communication\" in the period of cassette culture.\nHistory.\nThe magazine was originally published in 1982 by Mike Gunderloy on a spirit duplicator with a run of 50 copies soon after he moved to the Hyde Park neighborhood in Boston. He started publishing this zine due to frustrations over writing about the same oddities or discoveries to different friends back in California as well as the infrequent publication of \"The Stark Fist of Removal\", of which he was a fan. The original focus was science fiction fanzines (the title comes from a short story by science fiction author John Brunner), but it included other reviews. Bob Grumman contributed a regular column on avant-garde poetry from 1987 to 1992.\nGunderloy later moved to Rensselaer, New York, where he continued to publish. By 1987, he was running a zine BBS, one of the first associated with an underground publication. In 1990, Cari Goldberg Janice and (briefly) Jacob Rabinowitz joined as co-editors. Gunderloy quit publishing \"Factsheet Five\" following the completion of Issue #44 in 1991.\nHudson Luce purchased the rights to \"Factsheet Five\" and published a single issue, Issue #45, with the help of BBS enthusiast Bill Paulouskas, cartoonist Ben Gordon, writer Jim Knipfel, and artist Mark Bloch, who had authored a mail art-related column called \"Net Works\" during the Gunderloy years.\nR. Seth Friedman then published the magazine for five years in San Francisco, with the help of Christopher Becker, Miriam Wolf and Jerod Pore, until Issue #64 in 1998. Circulation grew to 16,000 during that time.\nGunderloy later worked as a computer programmer before retiring in 2020. He co-authored the book \"SQL Server 7 in Record Time.\"\nIn other media.\nJerod Pore collected articles and reviews from the print version of \"Factsheet Five\", and with them produced \"Factsheet Five - Electric\", one of the first zines to use the Usenet newsgroup alt.zines. Beginning in the late 1980s, Gunderloy and Pore also established a substantial online presence on the WELL, an influential, private dial-up BBS.\nThree books were published based on \"Factsheet Five\": \"How to Publish a Fanzine\" by Gunderloy (1988; Loompanics), \"The World of Zines\", by Gunderloy and Janice (1992; Penguin), and \"The Factsheet Five Zine Reader\" by Friedman (1997, Three Rivers Press). Until 1989, Gunderloy collected and, in turn, made available several versions of the Gemstone File. A number of Gunderloy's zine reviews from \"Factsheet Five\" also appeared in edited form in \"High Weirdness by Mail.\"\nMike Gunderloy's Factsheet Five Collection of over 10,000 zines and mail art is now held at the New York State Library in Albany, New York, where it occupies . However, only about 4000 zines in the collection have been cataloged.\nAbout 1/4 of the zines in the collection are listed on Excelsior, the New York State Library's electronic catalog; staff of the Manuscripts &amp; Special Collection can help locate other items.\nR. Seth Friedman donated 240 zines to the Little Maga/Zine Collection of the San Francisco Public Library.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The cassette was used by fine artists and poets for the independent distribution of new work. An independent music scene based on the cassette burgeoned internationally in the second half of the 1970s.\nBackground.\n\u201cCassette culture\u201d is an international music scene that developed in the wake of punk in the second half of the 1970s and continued through into the first half of the 1980s (the \"postpunk\" period), and in some territories into the 1990s, in which a large number of amateur musicians outside the established music industry, usually recording in their homes and usually recording to cassette-tape devices, produced music, very often of a non-mainstream or alternative character, that was then duplicated on cassette in very limited quantities and distributed free or sold at low cost to others involved in the scene and those who followed it. Often, these cassette-only albums of original music were completely self-produced by the artists, but small companies or labels also flourished during the period, producing cassette-only releases in small runs, both single-artist albums and compilations by various artists (in a few cases these labels also released vinyl). Numerous artists who first emerged at this time remain active today, some of them now releasing through commercial companies, others continuing with the DIY ethic of self-releasing on CD and the Internet. Since 2000 there has been a revival of the use of the cassette tape for the release of independent music (very often in conjunction with digital release) and a new \u201ccassette scene\u201d has sprung up.\nInitiating factors, historical background and periodization.\nTechnological factors enabled the rise of cassette culture. Improvement in the recording quality of cassettes and the availability of sophisticated cassette decks, as well as stereo \"boomboxes\", in the late 1970s allowed \"recordists\" to record and duplicate high-quality copies of their music inexpensively. Bands did not need to go into expensive recording studios any longer. In addition, multi-track recording equipment was becoming affordable, portable and of fairly high quality in the early 1980s. Four-track cassette recorders developed by Tascam and Fostex allowed artists to record and get a reasonable sound at home. Electronic instruments, such as drum machines and synthesizers, became more compact and inexpensive. Therefore, it became increasingly feasible to construct home-recording studios, giving rise to the phenomenon of the \"home tapers\". The recording and production qualities of much cassette-culture music means that it can often be described as lo-fi.\nParticularly in North America, college radio played an important role, with stations broadcasting regular cassette-only radio shows that showcased and promoted the work of home-recording artists.\nThe cassette culture can be traced back to the early 1970s, when mail-artists and other artists and poets began making use of the cassette. Audio-art labels/publishers active in the early 1970s included Edition S-Press, Edition Amadulo and Black Box/Watershed. Balsam Flex was a London-based independent poetry-on-cassette label founded in 1972 by artist E.E. Vonna-Michell. It published work by experimental UK poets associated with the London-based Writers Forum and the so-called British Poetry Revival of the 1960s and 1970s, writers such as: Allen Fisher, Bob Cobbing, Peter Finch, Lawrence Upton, cris cheek and Ulli McCarthy/Freer. The British sculptor William Furlong's \"Audio Arts\", founded in 1973, was an arts magazine published on cassette and including sound art in addition to interviews with artists. The musical cassette scene was in part an offshoot of this earlier activity. Participants engaged in extensive tape trading in addition to selling their products. Advertising was done through fanzines and the circulation of photocopied catalogues, etc. The scene was also strongly stimulated by the DIY ethic of punk, and, free of commercial considerations, encouraged musical eclecticism, diversity and experimentation. Whilst distribution was mostly by mail, there were a few retail outlets that stocked independently produced cassette releases, such as (in the UK) Rough Trade and Falling A.\nThe \"cassette culture\" is a historical phenomenon, primarily in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Following the anti-establishment shock of punk a very creative period followed in popular music, the postpunk period (as documented in \n\"Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978\u20131984\", by Simon Reynolds). In the United Kingdom synth-pop was in the ascendant and industrial and postindustrial music was the vanguard of musical experimentation. Many (though by no means all) cassette artists, in Europe and elsewhere, drew on this new avant-garde for their inspiration. Popular-music papers such as \"Sounds\" and \"NME\" in the UK were marked by a new type of journalism, which discussed music (perhaps sometimes over-earnestly) as a serious art-form. In terms of broader developments, the Cold War and the nuclear arms-race were still a reality. In both the UK and the USA the political Right assumed power in the form of the governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. In the UK this was accompanied by a widespread culture of opposition and dissent, often informed by radical Left ideology. The cassette-culture scene emerged in, was embedded in, this broader cultural landscape, enabled by new developments in electronic technology, and many of the artists shared a countercultural ethos in relation to the mainstream music of the time and towards contemporary society more broadly. The scene could not have existed before and the period of its flourishing gradually came to an end in the 1990s with the arrival of inexpensive digital technology for the production of both music and graphics and, of course, the arrival of the World Wide Web. Successor underground and DIY scenes have naturally arisen to take its place, but they are no more to be identified with the cassette culture that arose in the late 1970s than the postpunk revival is to be identified with the original postpunk period.\nAs with any other music scene, artists involved in the scene and others who followed it amassed, sometimes very substantial,\ncollections of independent cassette music. The sense of cassette culture in all its diversity as, nevertheless, a coherent international musical subculture has been reinforced since 2000 by a major revival of interest in the cassette artists of the 1970s and 1980s and the reissue of much music on LP and CD for a small but enthusiastic market (see below).\n\"Cassette culture\" is a coinage that post-dates the scene itself. \"Cassette scene\" was a contemporary term.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom cassette culture was at its peak in what is known as the post-punk period, 1978\u20131984. UK cassette culture was championed by marginal musicians and performers such as Tronics, the Instant Automatons, Storm Bugs, Sean T. Wright, the insane picnic, the Cleaners from Venus, Nocturnal Emissions and Final Program, anarcho-punk groups such as the APF Brigade, The Crouches, The Apostles and Chumbawamba, and many of the purveyors of Industrial music, e.g. Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, and Clock DVA. Artists self-releasing would often copy their music in exchange for \"a blank tape plus self-addressed envelope\". But there also existed many small tape labels, such as Falling A Records, Sterile Records, Third Mind Records and Snatch Tapes, driven by enthusiasm rather than business principles, and in some cases consciously informed by anti-capitalist principles. There was great diversity amongst such labels, some were entirely \"bedroom based\", utilizing domestic tape-copying technology, whilst others were more organized, functioning in a similar way to conventional record labels. Some also did vinyl releases, or later developed into vinyl labels. Many compilation albums were released, presenting samples of work from various artists. Two particularly ambitious compilation projects were the 5-volume \"Rising from the Red Sand\" (see below) and the 15-volume International Sound Communication series. It was not uncommon for artists who had a vinyl contract to release on cassette compilations, or to continue to do cassette-only album releases (of live recordings, work-in-progress material, etc.) after they had started releasing records. The cassette scene was, in other words, an integrated part of the alternative or underground music scene during the postpunk period.\nCassette culture received something of a mainstream boost when acknowledged by the major music press. The \"New Musical Express\" (\"NME\"), \"Melody Maker\" and \"Sounds\", the three main weekly music papers of the time in the UK, launched \"cassette culture\" columns, in which new releases would be briefly reviewed and ordering information given. In September 1982 the \"NME\" acknowledged the band Tronics for releasing in 1980 the first independent cassette album, entitled \"Tronics\", to be nationally distributed. In the UK fanzines covering cassette culture included John Balance's Stabmental.\nTim Naylor of Record Collector magazine has published articles in the 2000s on the cassette culture of the '70s/'80s, including \"C30, C60, C90, C21!\" (\"Record Collector\", 393, September 2011) and \"Home Taping is Thrilling Music\" (\"Record Collector\", 462, January 2017). Memoirs written by people involved in the UK cassette scene include \"Permanent Transience\" (2015), by Bendle of the band The Door and the Window, and \"The Luxury of Dreams: An Autobiography\" (2017), by Mark Automaton of the band The Instant Automatons.\nContinental Europe.\nEuropean artists involved in the cassette scene include: Esplendor Geom\u00e9trico (Spain), Die T\u00f6dliche Doris (Germany), Maurizio Bianchi/M.B. (Italy), Pt\u00f4se (France), Absolute Body Control (Belgium), Clair Obscur (France), Non Toxique Lost (Germany), Giancarlo Toniutti (Italy).\nTwo of the more important cassette labels in Europe were Germany's Datenverarbeitung, run by Andreas M\u00fcller, and Belgium's Insane Music, run by Alain Neffe. Along with material recorded by himself in various configurations, Neffe curated and released numerous compilations featuring tracks sent to him from artists all over the world.\nUnited States.\nIn the US, cassette culture activity extended through the late 1980s and into the 1990s. Although larger operators made use of commercial copying services, anybody who had access to copying equipment (such as the portable tape-to-tape cassette players that became common in the early 1980s) could release a tape, and publicize it in the network of fanzines and newsletters that served the scene, such as \"OP Magazine\", \"Factsheet Five\" and \"Unsound\". The cassette culture became an inexpensive and democratic way for artists to make available music that was never likely to have mainstream appeal, and many found in the scene music that was more imaginative, challenging, beautiful, and groundbreaking than much of what was being released by the established music industry.\nIn the United States, cassette culture was associated with DIY sound collage, riot grrrl, and punk music and blossomed across the country on cassette labels such as: Psyclones, Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine, Randy Greif's Swinging Axe Productions, Pass the Buck, E.F. Tapes, Mindkill, Happiest Tapes on Earth, Apraxia Music Research, and Sound of Pig (which released over 300 titles), From the Wheelchair to the Pulpit, Walls of Genius (which released over 30 titles, including their own, Architects Office and The Miracle), K Records, brown interior music. Artists such as PBK, Big City Orchestra, Alien Planetscapes, Don Campau, Ken Clinger, Dino DiMuro, Tom Furgas, The Haters, Zan Hoffman, If, Bwana, Hal McGee, Min\u00f3y, Dave Prescott, Dan Fioretti (who now identifies as female and goes by the name Dreamgirl Stephanie Ashlyn), Jim Shelley, Suburban Campers, The Silly Pillows, Linda Smith, Saboteur, and hundreds of others, recorded albums available only on cassette throughout the late 1980s and well into the 1990s.\nThe American cassette-culture scene has been quite well-served by documentary-makers, in contrast with the scenes in the UK and Europe. In 2009 Andrew Szava-Kovats, who was involved in the US scene under the name Data-Bank-A, released a 60-minute documentary \"Grindstone Redux: A Documentary About 1980's Cassette Culture\" on the American cassette network, with contributions from many of those involved. In 2015 the independent filmmaker William Davenport released \"The Great American Cassette Masters\", a 90-minute documentary interviewing many key US artists of the 1980s scene. \"Cassette: A Documentary Mixtape\" (2016), directed by Zack Taylor, George Petzold and Seth Smoot, is a 90-minute documentary which, as the title indicates, takes a broader view of the cassette format and its history and features the inventor of the cassette tape Lou Ottens. It examines nostalgia for the format and its return as a medium for contemporary independent musicians. In 2020 American author Jerry Kranitz published the highly illustrated book \"Cassette Culture: Homemade Music &amp; The Creative Spirit In The Pre-Internet Age\" (Vinyl On Demand).\nOther territories.\nThere were many cassette artists outside the United Kingdom, the US and Europe. There was a very active scene in Japan, as can be seen from the list of contributors to the International Sound Communication series of compilations.\nCreative packaging.\nThe packaging of cassette releases, whilst sometimes amateurish, was also an aspect of the format in which a high degree of creativity and originality were displayed. For the most part packaging relied on standard plastic cases with a photocopied \"J-card\" insert, but some made more of an effort. \"Anusol\" by the A Band, released on the Chocolate Monk label, came packaged with a \"suppository\" unique to each copy \u2013 one of which was a used condom wrapped in tissue. The BWCD label released a cassette by Japanese noise artist Aube that came attached to a blue plastic ashtray in the shape of a fish. EEtapes of Belgium's 1995 release of This Window's http:// was packaged with an X-ray of a broken limb. The Barry Douglas Lamb album \"Ludi Funebres\" presented the cassette case in a tin, the tin filled with earth and the earth covered with leaves. Walls Of Genius went to great lengths, spray-painting abstract art on the cassette labels, affixing hand-made \"authentic\" stickers, painting cassette boxes (the \"white\" cassette, 1984), creating one-of-a-kind pinup covers (\"The Mysterious Case of Pussy Lust\", 1985) and issuing \"Certificates of Genius\" to anybody discriminating enough to purchase one of their titles. The interested reader is referred to \"Tape-Mag.com\" (see below).\nDecline, revival of interest and the new cassette scene.\nIn the United Kingdom the cassette culture seemed to wane in the second half of the 1980s, and by the mid-1990s the scene in the United States was also in decline, with the appearance of new technologies and methods of distribution: CD-Rs and the widespread arrival of the Internet, MP3s and file sharing. However, the early 2000s saw a major revival of interest in the cassette culture of the late 1970s and 1980s, with many obscure tapes being made available on music blogs and the emergence of specialist labels, of which Vinyl On Demand is the best known, dedicated to reissuing on LP and CD material originally released on cassette. In October 2005 \"cassette_culture [c_c]\", an international electronic mailing list, was established on Yahoo! Groups for discussion \"of all aspects of the DIY music scene, or cassette culture, of the late 1970s, 1980s, and into the 90s\". Cassette releases have now been added to the Discogs database, and other databases, in great numbers. Cassette-culture releases can now fetch high prices (See Tim Naylor's articles for Record Collector, mentioned above).\nOn 1 January 2018, Frank Bull of Vinyl On Demand Records launched \"Tape-Mag.com\", a vast online database of cassette-culture and related material. Material, audio and visual, relating to the cassette culture of the 1970s and 1980s has become widely available on the Internet on platforms such as Bandcamp and Archive.org, and on social media.\nSince the Millennium there has also been a revival in the use of the cassette by independent artists, with the rise of partly or wholly tape-based labels such as Burger Records, http://, Memorials of Distinction, Tuff Enuff Records, Truant Recordings, First Base Tapes and Gnar Tapes. In 2007 (12\u201326 May) an exhibition was held at Printed Matter in New York City devoted to current American cassette culture entitled \"Leaderless: Underground Cassette Culture Now.\"\nNotable compilations since 2000.\nA number of compilations devoted to or including significant representation of cassette-culture music of the 1970s and 1980s have been released since the revival of interest in the scene. The most ambitious collection of material is a trilogy from Cherry Red Records, each release comprising four CDs of material: \"\" (2016), \"Noise Reduction System: Formative European Electronica 1974-1984\" (2017), and \"Third Noise Principle: Formative North American Electronica 1975-1984\" (2019). In 2008 the Hyped To Death label released the CD \"Messthetics Greatest Hiss: Classics of the UK Cassette Culture DIY, 1979-1982\". Perhaps the most significant British compilation of cassette-culture music released at the time was the 5-cassette \"Rising from the Red Sand\" (1983), on Third Mind Records (one of the more notable cassette labels), which contained 45 pieces of music. For many years this landmark collection was kept available (on cassette) by RRRecords, and in 2013 it was released on vinyl by Vinyl On Demand Records. Although not reissued since 1989, mention should also be made of 1983's pioneering double-LP release \"The Elephant Table Album: a compilation of difficult music\", a 21-track selection of work by British cassette-culture artists. The record was compiled by Dave Henderson, the cassette-culture reviewer for \"Sounds\" at the start of the 1980s. Henderson followed this with a sequel, \"Three Minute Symphony\", another double LP, which threw the net wider to include European and US artists. In the 2020s South Fellini released their hauntology project HOAGIEWAVE on cassette and VHS.\nThe interested reader is referred to the extensive output of vinyl editions for collectors released since 2004 on the German company Vinyl On Demand Records and the many CD releases of US and UK DIY music of the late '70s to early '80s released by the US label Hyped To Death.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The party dominated Dutch politics from 1977 to 1994, becoming the largest party all but twice, with leaders Dries van Agt and Ruud Lubbers serving as prime minister.\nThe party faced a major defeat in the 1994 general election, after which the first two cabinets without its participation were formed. The CDA regained its status as the largest party between 2002 and 2010, during which leader Jan Peter Balkenende headed four cabinets. Between 2010 and 2023, the party saw further electoral decline under varied leadership, participating in three of four cabinets as a junior coalition partner. Following the 2025 general election, the party holds 18 seats, now led by Henri Bontenbal.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nPredecessor parties.\nSince 1880, Catholics and the Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) collaborated in the so-called Coalition. They shared a common goal of securing public funding for religious schools, which was achieved through the Pacification of 1917. In 1888, they established the first Christian democratic cabinet, the Mackay cabinet. This cooperation, however, was not without challenges, and in 1894, more anti-Catholic and aristocratic conservatives split from the ARP to form what would become the Christian Historical Union (CHU) in 1908. Within both parties, there remained a desire to reunite. Meanwhile, in 1904, the General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses was formed, eventually evolving into the Roman Catholic State Party (RKSP) in 1926 and later the Catholic People's Party (KVP) in 1945.\nDuring the Interwar period, all three parties remained continuously in government. After World War II, however, the KVP distanced itself from the CHU and especially the ARP, refraining from governing with them until 1952 and 1958, respectively, instead forming Roman/Red cabinets with the Labour Party (PvdA). Meanwhile, the parties began collaborating at the European level, with the CHU and ARP joining the KVP in the Nouvelles Equipes Internationale in 1953. Due to secularisation and depillarisation, the three parties lost their combined majority in the 1959 general election for the first time since 1918.\nMerger talks.\nInfluenced by the Second Vatican Council, the KVP published the report \" (transl.\u2009Foundation and Character of the KVP) and adopted its conclusions, which called for Christian democratic cooperation, in December 1966. The Night of Schmelzer in October 1966 exposed divisions both between and within the three parties, leading to disappointing election results for each. Consequently, the three parties accepted an ARP initiative to form the Group of Eighteen in April 1967, comprising six prominent politicians from each party, tasked with establishing a common foundation for Christian politics and, if successful, determining the best path forward.\nMeanwhile, Christian-radical members within the three parties grew dissatisfied with their support in the 1967 general election, as they favored cooperation with progressive parties over alignment with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the De Jong cabinet. To prevent this group from disrupting party cooperation, the leaders of the three parties announced on 14 February 1968 that in the next election, they would either unite into a single Christian party or only join the cabinet together. This announcement led a group of KVP radicals to leave the party the same month, founding the Political Party of Radicals (PPR). Two years later, a group of ARP radicals also left to establish the Evangelical Progressive Party (EVP).\nIn 1969, the Group of Eighteen proposed drafting a joint \"urgency programme,\" which the parties completed shortly before the 1971 general election, where they again lost seats. Following up on the Group of Eighteen, the Contact Council was established in 1972 to further develop their cooperation. Led by KVP Senator Piet Steenkamp, the council issued a memorandum in June 1972, advocating a single candidate list for the next election and the formation of a Christian democratic movement, with membership open to members of the three parties as well as direct members.\nA month later, however, the first Biesheuvel cabinet collapsed, leaving insufficient time to prepare a single candidate list, resulting in another loss in the 1972 general election. As part of its polarisation strategy, the PvdA persuaded several KVP and ARP politicians to join its progressive Den Uyl cabinet during the 1972\u20131973 cabinet formation. This arrangement required their parliamentary groups to provide confidence and supply, while the CHU moved into opposition. This shift complicated the merger process, as the CHU stipulated that a joint list would depend on the \"actual parliamentary political situation\" (the so-called \"political mortgage\").\nFederation.\nNevertheless, based on the memorandum, the Christian Democratic Appeal was officially formed as a pre-federation in 1973, with Steenkamp as its chairperson. It would employ a \"growth model\", in which they would work out political and organizational details, while keeping the original parties until the last moment. Meanwhile discussions continued on the role of the Bible in the party and the political course. When the pre-federation was turned into a federation in 1975, some conservative members of the CHU and ARP left to form the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF).\nVan Agt cabinets, 1977\u20131982.\nIn 1976, the three parties announced that they would field a single candidate list at the 1977 general election, after their parliamentary groups had intensified cooperation. KVP minister of Justice Dries van Agt was the lead candidate. The election manifesto was titled \"Not by bread alone\" () and was progressive. The list was able to get one seat more than the three parties together five years earlier. Based on the results, a cabinet of PvdA, CDA and Democrats 66 (D66) was most likely and was discussed at the start of the 1977 cabinet formation. After seven months, the negotiations finally collapsed, after it had been suspended multiple times. Soon after, Van Agt was able to form the first Van Agt cabinet with the conservative liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).\nSome progressive MPs nicknamed the loyalists, which included parliamentary leader Willem Aantjes, did not commit to support the cabinet, but only tolerated it. Their opposition forced the cabinet to compromise on the placement of nuclear weapons in the Netherlands. This issue would continue to divide the party until it was resolved in the 1980s and would contribute to the removal of loyalists Jan Nico Scholten and Stef Dijkman from the parliamentary group in 1983. Nevertheless, the first Van Agt cabinet was able to complete its term.\nThe federation was founding member of the European People's Party on 8 July 1978. For the 1979 European Parliament election, they had first selected Wim Vergeer (KVP), but after Ruud Lubbers (KVP) had replaced Aantjes as parliamentary leader, Bouke Beumer (ARP) was selected. CDA won ten out of 25 seats and was the largest Dutch delegation to distribute the leadership between the parties.\nOn 11 October 1980, the three original parties ceased to exist and the CDA was founded as a unitary party. The differences between the groups would continue to exist for a long time within the party. It led to another group of members leaving the party and joining with the EPV to found the Evangelical People's Party (EVP).\nFor the 1981 general election, Van Agt was reelected as lead candidate. Its election manifesto was titled \"For a meaningful existence\" () and compared to the previous manifesto shifted responsibility from the government to society. CDA became the largest party, despite losing a seat. Because CDA and VVD had lost their majority, the second Van Agt cabinet with PvdA and D66 was formed in the 1981 cabinet formation. Bad relations between PvdA and CDA led to crises from the start, and the cabinet fell within a year. Van Agt led the rump cabinet Van Agt III with D66 to prepare the next election.\nLubbers cabinets, 1982\u20131994.\nVan Agt was again lead candidate for the general election and its manifesto was the same as the previous year with an attachment. CDA lost three seats and ended second after PvdA. After the elections, Van Agt announced that he would leave politics and was succeeded as party leader by Lubbers. During the September\u2013November 1982 cabinet formation, Lubbers would form the first Lubbers cabinet with the VVD. To combat the economic crisis, the cabinet implemented budget cuts, limited the welfare state and privatised state-owned companies. A major achievement was the Wassenaar Agreement in 1982, in which trade unions agreed to wage moderation in exchange for reduction of working hours by employers' organisations. This would be the start of the polder model, a concept in line with CDA's principle of distributed responsibility.\nThe 1986 general election took place when the economy was improving, but the manifesto nevertheless focused on reducing the welfare state and shifting the responsibility to society. Given Lubber's popularity for his \"no-nonsense approach\", the slogan was \"Let Lubbers finish his job\" (). CDA won 54 seats, the highest a single party had ever won, mostly at the expense of the VVD. After the 1986 cabinet formation, the second Lubbers cabinet continuing with VVD as coalition partner. VVD felt like being in the supporting role, and finally brought down the cabinet in 1989 over the travel expenses allowance.\nThe manifesto for the 1989 general election built upon the previous with the addition of environmental management among the priorities. The CDA kept its 54 seats and after the 1989 cabinet formation the third Lubbers cabinet was formed with the PvdA. A notable reform in line with the CDA principle of distributed responsibility, was the privatization of the housing associations by CDA State Secretary for Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment Enne\u00fcs Heerma, with which he started in 1989 and was finished in 1994.\nOpposition to Purple, 1994\u20132002.\nIn the run-up to the 1994 general election, Lubbers announced he would retire from Dutch politics and had named Elco Brinkman his successor. During the campaign, Lubbers appeared to distance himself from Brinkman. Furthermore, the freezing of pensions they had included in their manifesto proved unpopular with its elderly voters. CDA lost 20 of its 54 seats. The 1994 cabinet formation led to the first purple coalition, the first time since 1918 that CDA or its predecessors were not part of a cabinet. Enne\u00fcs Heerma succeeded Brinkman as parliamentary leader and attempted to be the voice of the opposition and bring the topic of family on the political agenda, but failed in both.\nJaap de Hoop Scheffer was selected as lead candidate for the 1998 general election. The election manifesto \"You don't live together alone\" () differed from previous ones, focusing on communitarianism in contrast to the individualism of the purple coalition. However, De Hoop Scheffers was relatively unknown compared to his opponents, and the CDA, as a centrist party, struggled to simultaneously target both the left-wing PvdA and the right-wing VVD. It led to another loss of five seats and a continuation of the cabinet without CDA.\nBalkenende cabinets, 2002\u20132010.\nIn the run-up to the 2002 general election, a leadership crisis erupted between party leader De Hoop Scheffer and party chair Marnix van Rij, after which they both left. De Hoop Scheffer was succeeded as lead candidate by Jan Peter Balkenende. The campaign was dominated by the right-wing politician Pim Fortuyn and Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) with his critique of the purple cabinets. Fortuyn and Balkenende had agreed not to attack each other during the campaign. Near the end of the campaign, Fortuyn was assassinated, which led to civil unrest. In the election, many people voted for the CDA, hoping that it could bring stability and because it had not attacked Fortuyn like many other parties. CDA became the largest party with 43 seats, followed by LPF with 26 seats. In the 2002 cabinet formation, the first Balkenende cabinet was formed with CDA, VVD and LPF. The cabinet would fall after only three months due to struggles within the LPF.\nCDA won another seat in the 2003 general election and remained the largest party. CDA started negotiations with PvdA in the 2003 cabinet formation, but after this failed, the second Balkenende cabinet was formed with VVD and D66. To comply with the deficit limits of the European Stability and Growth Pact, the cabinet cut back on social security, leading to protest within CDA. A major reform, which was started under the previous cabinet, was the introduction of a new system of health care insurance plan, which made an end to the distinction between public and private healthcare insurance funds, with the aim of reducing costs and waiting lists. The cabinet fell in 2006 after D66 left, leading to the formation of the third Balkenende cabinet as rump cabinet with VVD.\nCDA lost three seats, but remained the largest party after the 2006 general election. In the cabinet formation it formed the fourth cabinet Balkenende with PvdA and the Christian Union (CU). The cabinet was confronted with the 2008 financial crisis, leading to the nationalisation of some banks. CDA and PvdA disagreed a lot, and PvdA finally left the cabinet in 2010.\nRutte cabinets, 2010\u20132023.\nDespite open internal opposition, Balkenende was again selected as lead candidate for the 2010 general election, in which CDA lost half of its seats. Balkenende announced his resignation as party leader and was replaced by Maxime Verhagen. At first, Verhagen was aiming for opposition during the 2010 cabinet formation. However, after talks between purple plus collapsed, CDA entered negotiations with VVD and Party for Freedom (PVV), the latter would be providing confidence and supply. Within the party, some opposed a coalition with the radical right PVV. Verhagen's co-negotiator Ab Klink resigned over the negotiations and two other MPs threatened to oppose the coalition, which would make it lose its majority. A special party convention was held to approve the result of the negotiations, which 68% of the record 4,700 members did. On 14 October, the first Rutte cabinet was sworn in with Verhagen as Deputy Prime Minister.\nAfter the fall of the short-lived first Rutte cabinet in 2012, CDA held a leadership election, which was won by interim parliamentary leader Sybrand Buma, with runner-up Mona Keijzer receiving 26% of the votes. The election manifesto for the 2012 general election was titled \"Everyone\" () after a Strategic Deliberation had advised a position in the \"radical centre\", focusing on all layers of society. In the election, CDA fell to 13 seats. CDA played no role in the 2012 cabinet formation which lead to the second Rutte cabinet and also stayed out of agreements the coalition made with opposition parties. In opposition, Buma followed a right-conservative line, embracing the \"angry citizen\" and focusing on norms and values.\nIts manifesto for the 2017 general election, \"Choices for a better Netherlands\", focused on norms and values, Dutch identity, insecurities and opposed excessive individualism. The CDA gained sixed seats and joined the third Rutte cabinet, with the VVD, D66 and CU.\nBuma resigned in May 2019 and was succeeded temporarily by Pieter Heerma as parliamentary leader. A leadership election did not take place until July 2020. The chaotic election was narrowly won by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport Hugo de Jonge, with MP Pieter Omtzigt as runner-up. De Jonge withdrew as lead candidate in December, because he could not combine it with his duties as minister during the COVID-19 pandemic. In his place, the party board appointed Minister of Finance Wopke Hoekstra.\nThe party lost four seats in the March 2021 election. After the longest ever cabinet formation the party continued in fourth Rutte cabinet, which had the same composition as the previous. During the formation, Omtzigt had left the party, alleging he had been treated unfairly in the party, and later started the party New Social Contract (NSC). During the cabinet period, the party struggled with its position in the nitrogen crisis and the farmers' protests that followed. The party faced electoral competition from the new political party Farmer\u2013Citizen Movement (BBB) on this issue.\nOpposition, 2023\u2013present.\nFor the November 2023 general election, MP Henri Bontenbal was selected as party leader. The party received its worst result ever, securing only five seats.\nPolitical positions.\nThe CDA is a centre to centre-right Christian democratic party. It started relatively progressive compared to other European Christian democratic parties or secular conservative parties, but followed the general trend in Dutch politics in becoming more conservative and centre-right. As of 2022, social conservatism is regarded as one of its guiding ideologies. The party had long been reluctant to call itself conservative, but it has been embraced by Bontenbal in 2023. It has become more communitarianist, in particular under Balkenende's leadership, who was inspired by sociologist Amitai Etzioni.\nThe party has four main principles: stewardship, solidarity, distributed responsibility and public justice. Distributed responsibility refers to the way society should be organised: no one organisation should control all society. Instead the state, the market, and social institutions, like churches and unions should work together. It is a combination of the neo-Calvinist concept of sphere sovereignty and the Catholic concept of subsidiarity.\nEconomic issues.\nRole of the government.\nFollowing the principles of distributed responsibility, CDA has always focused on a \"responsible society\", where intervention by the government should be limited. To achieve this, CDA cherishes civil society. In its 1977 election manifesto, it ascertained that Dutch society was not yet a real responsible society, and that the government should help society achieve this. In the 1980s, CDA concluded that the government spending levels were unsustainable and focused on budgets cuts and reducing the welfare state. In the 1990s, its confidence in and expectations of society grew, as well in the responsibility of individual citizens. Notable reforms in this direction have been the privatisation of the housing associations in 1994 and the healthcare reform in 2006.\nEnvironment.\nCDA supports the protection of the environment based on the principle of stewardship. It aims to reconcile the protection of the environment with economic growth, although the latter often prevailed.\nSocial issues.\nAbortion.\nCDA has always held a middle position in the debate on abortion in the Netherlands, advocating for \"no unless\". CDA supports the right to abortion when the life of the woman is in danger. It has accepted since its creation that a majority in the Netherlands was in favor of abortion beyond that, arguing that their own ethical values should not be codified in law. CDA is however in favor of some limitations, including abortion being in the Criminal Code and a reflection period of five days. A majority of its representatives voted for the compromise abortion law in 1981, while a majority voted against the removal of the reflection period in 2021.\nLGBT rights.\nToday, CDA supports same-sex marriage in the Netherlands, although it did not do so early on. In the beginning, CDA opposed same-sex marriage, but supported the registration of other forms of cohabitation. This was more explicitly mentioned in election manifestos after its think tank published its report \"1+1=together\" in 1986. In 1997, CDA voted against a bill that would allow civil union for same-sex relationships, because it would also be open to opposite-sex relationships. In 2000, all but three CDA members of parliament voted against the introduction of same-sex marriage. Since then, CDA became more supportive of same-sex marriage, voting in favour of a law giving married lesbians the same parenting rights as opposite-sex parents.\nIn May 2019, the CDA voted against banning gay conversion therapy, arguing that conversion therapy is already punishable as abuse and too broadly formulated.\nInternational affairs.\nEurope.\nBased on the Chapel Hill expert survey (2014), CDA can be qualified as \"Eurorealist\", while it had been more pro-European in the past. In its party manifesto in 1980, the CDA strove for a \"united Europe\" and in 1979 they had endorsed the EPP election manifesto which called for a federal Europe. In the early 2000s CDA started emphasizing the national identity, writing in its 2004 election manifesto it wanted \"to ensure that we do not lose our own Dutch identity in the larger Europe\". A turning point was the 2005 referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which was voted down. CDA had officially endorsed the Treaty, but Balkenende was largely absent during the campaign. The focus shifted to the national interest in Europe. Around the same that the EPP started to distance itself from a federal Europe in its new party manifesto, CDA wrote in its manifesto for the 2014 European Parliament election the party \"is and remains against a federal Europe\". It turned against enlargement of the European Union, which it had supported in the previous decade.\nElectorate.\nThe core electorate of the CDA are church members, both Catholics and Protestants. Part of the electoral decline can be attributed to secularisation (9\u201310 seats in the period 1970\u20132010), while church members increasingly have been voting for other (mostly non-religious) parties (10-14 seats in the period 1970-2010). Non church members at times also vote for CDA, with a record during the 2002 general election. The CDA has been stated to be an issue owner of \"norms and values\".\n2021\u20132023.\nVoter surveys held after the March 2021 general election and the March 2023 provincial elections showed that the average CDA voter's self-placement on a left-right axis was slightly to the right of the average voter. They were slightly less supportive of euthanasia and climate policy. CDA voters were more opposed to immigration than the average voter in 2021, but this difference had disappeared by 2023. 2023 CDA voters also had more trust in political parties than the average voter. The average CDA voter was older than the average voter, at 63 in 2021 (compared to 55 among all voters) and 61 in 2023 (compared to 56 among all voters). Around 60% of CDA voters described themselves as religious, a proportion twice as high as the proportion among all voters. Around 60 to 70% of CDA voters lived in rural areas, compared to roughly half of all voters. CDA voters felt considerably more connected to other people than voters of other parties and, in 2023, were slightly happier about their life.\nOrganisation.\nLinked organisations.\nCDA Research Institute.\nThe think tanks of CDA's predecessors, \"Dr. Abraham Kuyperstichting\" (ARP), \"Centrum voor Staatkundige Vorming\" (KVP) and the \"Jhr.mr. A.F. de Savornin Lohmanstichting\" (CHU), started working together in 1972 and played a role in the Contact Council. On 15 December 1977, the \"Stichting Studiecentrum CDA\" was founded as a collaborative body for the three think tanks. The think tanks merged into the \"Stichting Studiecentrum CDA\" in 1980, when the parties merged, and in 1981 the name was changed to \"CDA Research Institute\" ().\nChristian Democratic Youth Appeal.\nThe youth wing of the CDA is the Christian Democratic Youth Appeal (CDJA). It was founded as a federation of the youth wings of its predecessors in 1977 and they merged in 1981. The CDJA has a seat in the Association Council of the CDA and is often active with motions and amendments in party conventions.\nInternational organisations.\nEuropean People's Party.\nThe CDA is a founding member of the European People's Party (EPP) and its parliamentary group in the European Parliament in 1976. For the establishment, CDA focused on the Christian democratic character it believed the party should have. This was explicit in its programme, but CDA believed it should also be visible in the name and membership of the party. In contrast, the more secular and antisocialist Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) wanted to include conservative parties, to become the largest group and form a front against socialism. As a compromise, the term \"Christian democratic\" would be included in the subtitle and non-Christian democratic parties would not be allowed to join.\nCDA would for a long time oppose the membership of the Conservative Party (UK), Forza Italia and the return of the Austrian People's Party. In 2019, called for the expulsion of the Hungarian Fidesz party, because of the rule of law and press freedom under its rule, which finally led Fidesz to leave in 2021. In the past, the Dutch parties 50PLUS and Christian Union were part of the EPP parliamentary group, but not of the party. The Dutch parties New Social Contract (NSC) and the Farmer\u2013Citizen Movement (BBB) are since 2024 also member of the parliamentary group.\nCentrist Democrat International.\nCDA is member of the Centrist Democrat International.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. It occurs when skin cells grow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors. The primary cause of skin cancer is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning devices. Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in humans. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two, along with a number of less common skin cancers, are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin that may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds.\nMore than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Such exposure has increased since the beginning of the industrial revolution, partly due to ozone depletion. Tanning beds are another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers, exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell skin cancers, total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with lighter skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy.\nDecreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell skin cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may, less commonly, involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as fluorouracil. Treatment of melanoma may involve some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and targeted therapy. In those people whose disease has spread to other areas of the body, palliative care may be used to improve quality of life. Melanoma has one of the higher survival rates among cancers, with over 86% of people in the UK and more than 90% in the United States surviving more than 5 years.\nSkin cancer is the most common form of cancer, globally accounting for at least 40% of cancer cases. The most common type is nonmelanoma skin cancer, which occurs in at least 2\u20133 million people per year. This is a rough estimate; good statistics are not kept. Of nonmelanoma skin cancers, about 80% are basal-cell cancers and 20% squamous-cell skin cancers. Basal-cell and squamous-cell skin cancers rarely result in death. In the United States, they were the cause of less than 0.1% of all cancer deaths. Globally in 2012, melanoma occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. White people in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. The three main types of skin cancer have become more common since late 20th century, especially in regions where the population is predominantly white.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassification.\nThere are three main types of skin cancer: basal-cell skin cancer (basal-cell carcinoma) (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (squamous-cell carcinoma) (SCC) and melanoma.\nBasal-cell carcinomas are most commonly present on sun-exposed areas of the skin, especially the face. They rarely metastasize and rarely cause death. They are easily treated with surgery or radiation. Squamous-cell skin cancers are also common, but much less common than basal-cell cancers. They metastasize more frequently than BCCs. Even then, the metastasis rate is quite low, with the exception of SCC of the lip or ear, and in people who are immunosuppressed. Melanoma are the least frequent of the three common skin cancers. They frequently metastasize, and can cause death once they spread.\nLess common skin cancers include: Merkel cell carcinoma, Paget's disease of the breast, atypical fibroxanthoma, porocarcinoma, spindle cell tumors, sebaceous carcinomas, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, and skin sarcomas, such as angiosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Kaposi's sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma.\nBCC and SCC often carry a UV-signature mutation indicating that these cancers are caused by UVB radiation via direct DNA damage. However, melanoma is predominantly caused by UVA radiation via indirect DNA damage. The indirect DNA damage is caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Research indicates that the absorption of three sunscreen ingredients into the skin, combined with a 60-minute exposure to UV, leads to an increase of free radicals in the skin, if applied in too little quantity and too infrequently. However, the researchers add that newer creams often do not contain these specific compounds, and that the combination of other ingredients tends to retain the compounds on the surface of the skin. They also add that frequent re-application reduces the risk of radical formation.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThere are a variety of different skin cancer symptoms. These include changes in the skin that do not heal, ulcering in the skin, discolored skin, and changes in existing moles, such as jagged edges to the mole, enlargement of the mole, changes in color, the way it feels or if it bleeds. Other common signs of skin cancer can be painful lesion that itches or burns and large brownish spot with darker speckles.\nBasal-cell skin cancer.\nBasal-cell skin cancer (BCC) usually presents as a raised, smooth, pearly bump on the sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, torso or shoulders. Sometimes small blood vessels (called telangiectasia) can be seen within the tumor. Crusting and bleeding in the center of the tumor frequently develops. It is often mistaken for a sore that does not heal. This form of skin cancer is the least deadly, and with proper treatment can be eliminated, often without significant scarring.\nSquamous-cell skin cancer.\nSquamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) is commonly a red, scaling, thickened patch on sun-exposed skin. Some are firm hard nodules and dome shaped like keratoacanthomas. Ulceration and bleeding may occur. When SCC is not treated, it may develop into a large mass. Squamous-cell is the second most common skin cancer. It is dangerous, but not nearly as dangerous as a melanoma.\nMelanoma.\nMost melanoma consist of various colours from shades of brown to black. A small number of melanoma are pink, red or fleshy in colour; these are called amelanotic melanoma and tend to be more aggressive. Warning signs of melanoma include change in the size, shape, color or elevation of a mole. Other signs are the appearance of a new mole during adulthood or pain, itching, ulceration, redness around the site, or bleeding at the site. An often-used mnemonic is \"ABCDE\", where A is for \"asymmetrical\", B for \"borders\" (irregular: \"Coast of Maine sign\"), C for \"color\" (variegated), D for \"diameter\" (larger than 6\u00a0mm \u2013 the size of a pencil eraser) and E for \"evolving.\"\nOther.\nMerkel cell carcinomas are most often rapidly growing, non-tender red, purple or skin colored bumps that are not painful or itchy. They may be mistaken for a cyst or another type of cancer.\nCauses.\nUltraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the primary environmental cause of skin cancer. This can occur in professions such as farming. Other risk factors that play a role include:\nUV-induced DNA damage.\nUV-irradiation of skin cells causes damage to DNA through photochemical reactions. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formed by adjacent thymine bases, or by adjacent cytosine bases, are frequent types of DNA damage induced by UV. Human skin cells are capable of repairing most UV-induced damage by nucleotide excision repair, a process that protects against skin cancer, but may be inadequate at high levels of exposure.\nPathophysiology.\nA malignant epithelial tumor that primarily originates in the epidermis, in squamous mucosa or in areas of squamous metaplasia is referred to as a squamous-cell carcinoma.\nMacroscopically, the tumor is often elevated, fungating, or may be ulcerated with irregular borders. Microscopically, tumor cells destroy the basement membrane and form sheets or compact masses which invade the subjacent connective tissue (dermis). In well differentiated carcinomas, tumor cells are pleomorphic/atypical, but resembling normal keratinocytes from prickle layer (large, polygonal, with abundant eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm and central nucleus).\nTheir disposal tends to be similar to that of normal epidermis: immature/basal cells at the periphery, becoming more mature to the centre of the tumor masses. Tumor cells transform into keratinized squamous cells and form round nodules with concentric, laminated layers, called \"cell nests\" or \"epithelial/keratinous pearls\". The surrounding stroma is reduced and contains inflammatory infiltrate (lymphocytes). Poorly differentiated squamous carcinomas contain more pleomorphic cells and no keratinization.\nA molecular factor involved in the disease process is mutation in gene PTCH1 that plays an important role in the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis is by biopsy and histopathological examination.\nNon-invasive skin cancer detection methods include photography, dermatoscopy, sonography, confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, terahertz spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, the multispectral imaging technique, thermography, electrical bio-impedance, tape stripping and computer-aided analysis.\nDermatoscopy may be useful in diagnosing basal cell carcinoma in addition to skin inspection.\nThere is insufficient evidence that optical coherence tomography (OCT) is useful in diagnosing melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. OCT may have a role in diagnosing basal cell carcinoma but more data is needed to support this.\nComputer-assisted diagnosis devices have been developed that analyze images from a dermatoscope or spectroscopy and can be used by a diagnostician to aid in the detection of skin cancer. CAD systems have been found to be highly sensitive in the detection of melanoma, but have a high false-positive rate. There is not yet enough evidence to recommend CAD as compared to traditional diagnostic methods.\nHigh-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) is of unclear usefulness in the diagnosis of skin cancer. There is insufficient evidence for reflectance confocal microscopy to diagnose basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma or any other skin cancers.\nPrevention.\nSunscreen is effective and thus recommended to prevent melanoma and squamous-cell carcinoma. There is little evidence that it is effective in preventing basal-cell carcinoma. Other advice to reduce rates of skin cancer includes avoiding sunburn, wearing protective clothing, sunglasses and hats, and attempting to avoid sun exposure or periods of peak exposure. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people between 9 and 25 years of age be advised to avoid ultraviolet light.\nThe risk of developing skin cancer can be reduced through a number of measures including decreasing indoor tanning and mid-day sun exposure, increasing the use of sunscreen, and avoiding the use of tobacco products.\nIt is important to limit sun exposure and to avoid tanning beds, because they both involve UV light. UV light is known to damage skin cells by mutating their DNA. The mutated DNA can cause tumors and other growths to form on the skin. Further, there are other risk factors beside just UV exposure. Fair skin, prolonged history of sunburns, moles, and family history of skin cancer are just a few.\nThere is insufficient evidence either for or against screening for skin cancers. Vitamin supplements and antioxidant supplements have not been found to have an effect in prevention. Evidence for reducing melanoma risk from dietary measures is tentative, with some supportive epidemiological evidence, but no clinical trials.\nZinc oxide and titanium oxide are often used in sunscreen to provide broad protection from UVA and UVB ranges.\nEating certain foods may decrease the risk of sunburns but this is much less than the protection provided by sunscreen.\nA meta-analysis of skin cancer prevention in high risk individuals found evidence that topical application of T4N5 liposome lotion reduced the rate of appearance of basal cell carcinomas in people with xeroderma pigmentosum, and that acitretin taken by mouth may have a skin protective benefit in people following kidney transplant.\nA paper published in January 2022 showed that a vaccine that stimulates the production of a protein critical to the skin's antioxidant network could reinforce people's defenses against skin cancer.\nTreatment.\nTreatment is dependent on the specific type of cancer, location of the cancer, age of the person, and whether the cancer is primary or a recurrence. For a small basal-cell cancer in a young person, the treatment with the best cure rate (Mohs surgery or CCPDMA) might be indicated. In the case of an elderly frail man with multiple complicating medical problems, a difficult to excise basal-cell cancer of the nose might warrant radiation therapy (slightly lower cure rate) or no treatment at all. Topical chemotherapy might be indicated for large superficial basal-cell carcinoma for good cosmetic outcome, whereas it might be inadequate for invasive nodular basal-cell carcinoma or invasive squamous-cell carcinoma. In general, melanoma is poorly responsive to radiation or chemotherapy.\nFor low-risk disease, radiation therapy (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate control of the disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as photodynamic therapy, epidermal radioisotope therapy, topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage can be found in the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.\nMohs' micrographic surgery (Mohs surgery) is a technique used to remove the cancer with the least amount of surrounding tissue and the edges are checked immediately to see if tumor is found. This provides the opportunity to remove the least amount of tissue and provide the best cosmetically favorable results. This is especially important for areas where excess skin is limited, such as the face. Cure rates are equivalent to wide excision. Special training is required to perform this technique. An alternative method is CCPDMA and can be performed by a pathologist not familiar with Mohs surgery.\nIn the case of disease that has spread (metastasized), further surgical procedures or chemotherapy may be required.\nTreatments for metastatic melanoma include biologic immunotherapy agents ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, cemiplimab; BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib; and a MEK inhibitor trametinib.\nIn February 2024, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first cancer treatment that uses tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, also called TIL therapy, specifically for melanomas that have not improved with other treatments. Additionally, scientists are testing a vaccine designed to match the unique genetic details of a patient's cancer in an advanced clinical trial.\nReconstruction.\nCurrently, surgical excision is the most common form of treatment for skin cancers. The goal of reconstructive surgery is the restoration of normal appearance and function. The choice of technique in reconstruction is dictated by the size and location of the defect. Excision and reconstruction of facial skin cancers are generally more challenging due to the presence of highly visible and functional anatomic structures in the face.\nWhen skin defects are small in size, most can be repaired with simple repair where skin edges are approximated and closed with sutures. This will result in a linear scar. If the repair is made along a natural skin fold or wrinkle line, the scar will be hardly visible. Larger defects may require repair with a skin graft, local skin flap, pedicled skin flap, or a microvascular free flap. Skin grafts and local skin flaps are by far more common than the other listed choices.\nSkin grafting is patching of a defect with skin that is removed from another site in the body. The skin graft is sutured to the edges of the defect, and a bolster dressing is placed atop the graft for seven to ten days, to immobilize the graft as it heals in place. There are two forms of skin grafting: split thickness and full thickness. In a split thickness skin graft, a shaver is used to shave a layer of skin from the abdomen or thigh. The donor site regenerates skin and heals over a period of two weeks. In a full thickness skin graft, a segment of skin is totally removed and the donor site needs to be sutured closed.\nSplit thickness grafts can be used to repair larger defects, but the grafts are inferior in their cosmetic appearance. Full thickness skin grafts are more acceptable cosmetically. However, full thickness grafts can only be used for small or moderate sized defects.\nLocal skin flaps are a method of closing defects with tissue that closely matches the defect in color and quality. Skin from the periphery of the defect site is mobilized and repositioned to fill the deficit. Various forms of local flaps can be designed to minimize disruption to surrounding tissues and maximize cosmetic outcome of the reconstruction. Pedicled skin flaps are a method of transferring skin with an intact blood supply from a nearby region of the body. An example of such reconstruction is a pedicled forehead flap for the repair of a large nasal skin defect. Once the flap develops a source of blood supply form its new bed, the vascular pedicle can be detached.\nPrognosis.\nThe mortality rate of basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinoma is around 0.3%, causing 2000 deaths per year in the US. In comparison, the mortality rate of melanoma is 15\u201320% and it causes 6500 deaths per year. Even though it is much less common, melanoma is responsible for 75% of all skin cancer-related deaths.\nThe survival rate for people with melanoma depends upon when they start treatment. The cure rate is very high when melanoma is detected in early stages, when it can easily be removed surgically. The prognosis is less favorable if the melanoma has spread to other parts of the body. As of 2003 the overall five-year cure rate with Mohs' micrographic surgery was around 95 percent for recurrent basal cell carcinoma.\nAustralia and New Zealand exhibit one of the highest rates of skin cancer incidence in the world, almost four times the rates registered in the United States, the UK and Canada. Around 434,000 people receive treatment for non-melanoma skin cancers and 10,300 are treated for melanoma. Melanoma is the most common type of cancer in people between 15 and 44 years in both countries. The incidence of skin cancer has been increasing. The incidence of melanoma among Auckland residents of European descent in 1995 was 77.7 cases per 100,000 people per year, and was predicted to increase in the 21st century because of \"the effect of local stratospheric ozone depletion and the time lag from sun exposure to melanoma development.\"\nEpidemiology.\nSkin cancers result in 80,000 deaths a year as of 2010, 49,000 of which are due to melanoma and 31,000 of which are due to non-melanoma skin cancers. This is up from 51,000 in 1990.\nMore than 3.5 million cases of skin cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States, which makes it the most common form of cancer in that country. One in five Americans will develop skin cancer at some point of their lives. The most common form of skin cancer is basal-cell carcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Unlike for other cancers, there exists no basal and squamous cell skin cancers registry in the United States.\nMelanoma.\nIn the US in 2008, 59,695 people were diagnosed with melanoma, and 8,623 people died from it. In Australia, more than 12,500 new cases of melanoma are reported each year, out of which more than 1,500 die from the disease. Australia has the highest per capita incidence of melanoma in the world.\nAlthough the rates of many cancers in the United States is falling, the incidence of melanoma keeps growing, with approximately 68,729 melanomas diagnosed in 2004 according to reports of the National Cancer Institute.\nMelanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK (around 13,300 people were diagnosed with melanoma in 2011), and the disease accounts for 1% all cancer deaths (around 2,100 people died in 2012).\nNon-melanoma.\nApproximately 2,000 people die from basal or squamous cell skin cancers (non-melanoma skin cancers) in the United States each year. The rate has dropped in recent years. Most of the deaths happen to people who are elderly and might not have seen a doctor until the cancer had spread; and people with immune system disorders.\nRisk factors.\nWhite people and people with light skin are prone to skin cancer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64996", "revid": "1318572552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64996", "title": "Lodi, Lombardy", "text": "Lodi ( , ; Ludesan: ) is an Italian \"comune\" with 45,375 inhabitants, serving as the capital of the province of the same name in Lombardy.\nThe city was founded on 3 August 1158 by Frederick Barbarossa, following the destruction of the ancient village of \"Laus Pompeia\", a former Roman municipium, episcopal see, and free commune. During the Renaissance, Lodi experienced a period of significant artistic and cultural splendor, notably after hosting the signing of the historic treaty between the pre-unification Italian states, known as the Treaty of Lodi, in 1454.\nIn the 21st century, Lodi has become a major industrial hub for cosmetics, crafts, and cheese production. It also serves as a reference point for a region primarily dedicated to agriculture and livestock farming; due to this characteristic, Lodi was chosen as the location for the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Milan and the Parco Tecnologico Padano, one of the most qualified research institutes in Europe in the field of agri-food biotechnology.\nThe city also has a well-developed tertiary sector and tourism industry: Lodi is recognized as one of the art cities of the Po Valley and is notable for several important monuments, including the Cathedral, the Civic Temple of the Crowned Virgin, the Church of San Francesco, the Church of Sant'Agnese, and Palazzo Mozzanica.\nGeography.\nTerritory.\nThe territory of Lodi, covering , is located in the central-southern part of Lombardy, in the area known as the \"lower plain\". The oldest core of the city is situated on the Eghezzone hill, an approximately trapezoidal elevation on the right bank of the Adda River; the rest of the urban center lies partly on a morphological terrace shaped by the river\u2019s erosion and partly in the floodplain area. The municipal territory ranges in elevation from 65 to above sea level.\nHydrology.\nThe municipal territory is crossed by the Adda River and several other waterways, including the Muzza Canal (which marks its western boundary), the Roggia Bertonica, and the Roggia Molina (whose urban section is now almost entirely underground).\nIn the Middle Ages, the city was bordered by the Gerundo Lake: the territory was largely marshy and hazardous, but thanks to hydraulic engineering works and the efforts of Cistercian and Benedictine monks, it was reclaimed and transformed into one of the most fertile regions in Europe. Agricultural activity is also supported by the abundant irrigation waters from numerous springs present in the area.\nGeology and morphology.\nFrom a petrological perspective, the soil consists of glacial and fluvial deposits that filled the Po Valley between the Upper Pleistocene and the Holocene, during the last glaciation. The lithotypes present are varied and irregularly distributed; they are generally rich in matrix. The soils are predominantly sandy and silty.\nSeismology.\nThe seismic hazard is low and uniformly distributed across the territory: the \"comune\" has been classified by the \"Protezione Civile\" as \"zone 3\" (low seismicity).\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Lodi territory, like the rest of the Po Valley, exhibits characteristics typical of a continental climate, specifically the \"Cfa\" subtype of the K\u00f6ppen climate classification (warm-humid temperate climate with hot summers): summers are sweltering and characterized by the phenomenon of sultriness (based on data from the reference period 1961\u20131990, the average maximum summer temperature is +29.7 \u00b0C); conversely, winters are often cold (the average minimum temperature is \u22120.8 \u00b0C) and snowfalls are common, though rarely heavy. A very frequent phenomenon during the winter semester is fog, which can sometimes persist for days due to the absence of synoptic winds at ground level. Autumn and spring are the seasons with the highest precipitation.\nThe Italian climate classification places Lodi in \"zone E\" with degree days.\nHistory.\nLodi traces its origins to the destruction of \"Laus Pompeia\", an ancient village of the Boii and later a Roman municipium, renamed in 89 BC in honor of the consul Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo. Located at the confluence of the roads from \"Placentia\" (Piacenza) and \"Acerrae\" (Pizzighettone) to \"Mediolanum\" (Milan), and at the intersection with the road from \"Ticinum\" (Pavia) to \"Brixia\" (Brescia), \"Laus\" was a key hub and became a thriving commercial and agricultural village. After coming under the control of the Lombards (6th\u20138th centuries) and later the Franks (8th\u20139th centuries), on 24 May 1111, \"Laus Pompeia\" was razed by the Milanese following a period of siege. The peace agreements prohibited the reconstruction of the destroyed buildings.\nNearly fifty years later, on 3 August 1158, the city was refounded by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa not on the ruins of \"Laus Pompeia\" (now Lodi Vecchio) but along the banks of the Adda, to ensure a more strategic position for territorial control. The emperor granted Lodi extraordinary privileges, despite which the city grew with difficulty: in 1167, it was forced by the Milanese to join the Lombard League and participate in the Battle of Legnano in 1176.\nIn the 13th century, Lodi continued to develop under the protection of Frederick II. From 1251, the city saw a succession of lordships under the Vistarini, Torriani, Visconti, Fissiraga, and Vignati, until in the 14th century, the County of Lodi became dependent on the Duchy of Milan, initially under the Visconti, who built the imposing Castle of Porta Regale (1355\u20131370), and later under the Sforza, who, under Francesco Sforza, expanded and strengthened the defensive system by constructing two fortifications at the ends of the Adda bridge.\nDuring the Renaissance, significant historical events took place in Lodi: in 1413, Antipope John XXIII and Emperor Sigismund convened the Council of Constance from the Lodi Cathedral, which later resolved the Western Schism. On 9 April 1454, the pre-unification Italian states signed the Treaty of Lodi, which ensured forty years of political stability. This also marked one of the happiest periods in Lodi\u2019s history from a cultural perspective, particularly under the episcopate of Carlo Pallavicino.\nIn subsequent eras, Lodi fell under Spanish, Austrian, and French domination. This corresponded to a period of decline and slowed demographic growth, particularly during the Spanish era, when the city was reduced to a veritable fortress. On 10 May 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the Austrians in the Battle of the Lodi Bridge, paving the way for the conquest of Milan.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the city began to expand beyond the ancient medieval walls, particularly following the opening of the Milan-Piacenza railway in 1861 and the establishment of the first industries (including Polenghi Lombardo in 1870). Toward the end of the century, the first social clashes occurred between emerging mass parties.\nThe people of Lodi played a significant role during the Resistance: the actions of the National Liberation Committee, formed in the city in October 1943, intensified in 1944, culminating in the fatal attack on a fascist party official. The reprisal was severe, and by the end of the year, eleven partisans were executed at the shooting range. Lodi was liberated by the CLN on 27 April 1945: when the Allies arrived from Piacenza, they found the city completely free.\nSymbols.\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is described as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Or, a plain cross gules. External ornaments of a city.\nThe origins of the emblem are uncertain: some historians suggest it dates back to the time of the First Crusade (1095), although there is no evidence confirming the city\u2019s participation in the enterprise. Most scholars identify an imperial origin, as the gold cross on a red field derives from the banner of Constantine I; the colors were later reversed. According to this interpretation, the city\u2019s banner was created even before the crusade to declare the city\u2019s loyalty to the Ghibelline cause and to distinguish Lodi\u2019s militias during wartime actions.\nThe gonfalon of the \"comune\" displays the heraldic iconography of the coat of arms on the front and two scenes on the back: the first is dedicated to the patron saint Bassianus, while the second depicts Barbarossa presenting the new city\u2019s insignia to Lodi\u2019s notables.\nHonors.\nThe \"comune\" of Lodi holds the title of city, inherited from \"Laus Pompeia\", an ancient Roman \"municipium\"; this status was formally recognized on 3 December 1158 by an imperial diploma issued by Frederick Barbarossa and confirmed by the Imperial Patent of 24 April 1815.\nSociety.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEthnic groups and foreign minorities.\nLike many other northern Italian centers, in the 21st century, Lodi has become a multiethnic city with a significant presence of foreign residents. As of 31 December 2023, foreign residents in the \"comune\" numbered 6,301, or 13.95% of the population. The most significant groups are as follows:\nTraditions and folklore.\nThe Feast of Saint Bassianus.\nOn 19 January each year, the patronal feast of Saint Bassianus is celebrated. Religious celebrations begin the previous evening in the Cathedral, with a diocesan vigil presided over by the bishop. The actual feast day begins on the morning of 19 January with a procession of civic authorities from Palazzo Broletto to the Cathedral, accompanied by figures in medieval costumes; in the crypt, where the saint\u2019s relics are kept, official speeches are delivered by the mayor and the bishop.\nAfter the solemn mass, under the porticos of Palazzo Broletto, the free distribution of \"b\u00fc\u0161\u00e8ca\" (Lombard-style tripe cooked with pancetta, vegetables, and beans), hot tea, and mulled wine takes place; simultaneously, throughout the day, the traditional Saint Bassianus fair is held in Piazza della Vittoria. In the afternoon, after the celebration of vespers, the ceremony for the awarding of civic honors and the \"Fanfullino della riconoscenza\" prize takes place, given to Lodi citizens distinguished in the fields of social commitment and cultural or scientific promotion.\nThe Feast of Saint Lucia.\nLodi is one of the northern Italian cities where Saint Lucia is venerated as a bringer of gifts: according to tradition, in the days leading up to the 13 December feast, children list their desired gifts in a letter, which must then be placed in an urn set up for the occasion in the Cathedral, at the foot of the saint\u2019s statue. Preparations for the feast begin in one of the first afternoons of the month, when the city hosts the \"Saint Lucia vigil\", an event dedicated to primary and kindergarten-age children. Additionally, from 8 December to midnight on 12 December, the ancient Saint Lucia fair is held in Piazza della Vittoria, with stalls selling toys, sweets, and handicrafts.\nThe market.\nThe street market in the historic center is one of the city's oldest and most significant popular traditions. It takes place on Saturdays and Sundays in the square of the same name, while on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it is held in Piazza della Vittoria. The market consists of a variable number of stalls, ranging from 75 to 78. At the stalls specializing in food products, visitors can find typical items of local cuisine.\nThe \"Palio dei Rioni\".\nSince 1986, the \"Palio dei Rioni\" has been held annually, a historical reenactment consisting of a series of challenges among the city's ancient neighborhoods. The Palio day begins in the Cathedral with a solemn Mass presided over by the bishop. Following a parade in traditional costumes, the \"ring race\" takes place, during which a jockey rides a wooden and iron horse and, pushed by two athletes, attempts to throw his javelin through four rings placed around the perimeter of Piazza della Vittoria in the shortest time possible. The event continues with the \"cursa dei cav\u00e0i\", in which competitors must ride their horses three laps around the square, trying to be the first to reach the finish line located in front of the cathedral square. The winning neighborhood, determined by the rankings of the various events, receives \"el bast\u00f3n de san Bassan\" from the hands of the city\u2019s mayor. Occasionally, the final ranking is also determined by the outcomes of competitions held on the Adda River during the summer, including a contest for allegorical boats, a canoe race, and a \"river bicycle\" race. The Department for the Development and Competitiveness of Tourism has awarded the Lodi Palio the title of \"Italy\u2019s heritage for tradition\", a recognition aimed at promoting the most significant folkloric events at the national level.\nQuality of life.\nThe following table shows the rankings of the municipality of Lodi in the annual report published by Legambiente as part of the \"Ecosistema Urbano\" survey on the environmental quality of provincial capital cities. Between the 18th and 20th editions of the survey, municipalities were evaluated separately based on population size; Lodi was placed in the group of \"small cities\".\nCulture.\nLibraries.\nThe Biblioteca Laudense has ancient origins and was opened to the public in 1792. Its historical section houses approximately volumes, including incunabula, sixteenth-century books, illuminated manuscripts, and other manuscripts, as well as valuable prints and maps. The modern collection, on the other hand, consists of more than volumes.\nUniversities and scientific research.\nSince 2005, Lodi has been home to a scientific-university hub, comprising the Parco Tecnologico Padano and some facilities of the University of Milan.\nThe Parco Tecnologico Padano is one of the most important research centers in Europe in the field of agri-food biotechnology.\nThe University of Milan\u2019s hub includes the faculty of veterinary medicine, designed by the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, alongside which are located an educational-experimental zootecnical center and a veterinary hospital comprising educational and clinical facilities for horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and companion animals. The city also is home to the Research Center for Forage and Dairy Productions, formed by the merger of the Experimental Institute for Forage Crops, directed from 1948 to 1976 by the renowned agronomist Giovanni Haussmann, with the Experimental Dairy Institute and the Experimental Institute for Dairy Cattle Husbandry.\nLodi is also home to a branch campus of the University of the Republic of San Marino.\nSchools.\nThe municipal territory is home to 17 kindergartens, 12 primary schools, 6 middle schools, 9 high schools, and 4 vocational training centers.\nMuseums.\nLodi is home to several important museums, including the Civic Museum, the Paolo Gorini Anatomical Collection, the Natural Sciences Museum, the Incoronata Temple Treasure Museum, the Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art, and the Printing and Art Printing Museum.\nMedia.\nThe city is home to the editorial office of the local daily newspaper \"Il Cittadino\" and a branch office of Telepace.\nArt.\nLodi is renowned for its artistic ceramic production. Documented since the 15th century, this activity saw significant expansion in the 18th century with the Coppellotti, Rossetti, and Ferretti factories, and in the 19th century with the Dossena family. The main subjects, reproduced in turquoise monochrome and polychrome, include landscapes with ruins, still lifes, floral motifs, popular scenes, and chinoiserie. Contemporary Lodi artistic ceramic production, known as \"Vecchia Lodi\", focuses on revisiting the stylistic models of the Ferretti manufacture. Lodi is recognized among the \"Cities of Ceramics \u2013 Traditional Artistic Ceramics\", a designation proudly borne by its numerous artisan workshops.\nIn the 1950s, the city hosted two painting competitions: the \"Citt\u00e0 di Lodi\" prize (1950) and the \"Lodi and the World of Milk\" contest (1956), held respectively during the second and fifth Milk Fair.\nCuisine.\nThe gastronomy of Lodi is primarily characterized by dairy products. The most renowned among the local cheeses is the Grana Padano PDO. Another version of grana cheese, called Tipico Lodigiano PAT, is produced, directly derived from the traditional processing of Granone Lodigiano, now extinct. This ancient product, considered the \"progenitor\" of all grana cheeses, had distinctive characteristics: its color was yellow due to the addition of saffron to the paste; moreover, as it was not pressed, it expelled whey during aging, forming the characteristic \"tear\". Fresh grana cheeses are cut in half and scraped with a special tool: this technique yields very thin flakes known as \"raspad\u00fcra\". Other typically Lodi cheeses include mascarpone PAT and pannerone PAT, both made with cream. Frittate, soups, and salumi are other specialties; there are also numerous typical desserts, such as the Tortionata PAT, Amaretti Fanfullini, and Gnam-gnam.\nEvents.\nThe \"Festival of the Seven Deadly Sins\", promoted by the municipality, consisted of seven editions held each spring from 2003 to 2009, attracting over visitors for each event. Each of the seven editions featured cultural events, debates, exhibitions, and workshops dedicated to one of the seven deadly sins of Western philosophical tradition. In subsequent years, the event was replaced by the \"Human Behaviors\" festival (2010-2015) and the \"Generating Future\" festival (2016-2017).\nSince 2010, the \"Ethical Photography Festival\" has been held every autumn in the city, one of the most significant documentary photography exhibitions on an international scale.\nHuman geography.\nUrban planning.\nIn the early centuries of the city\u2019s existence, urban development progressed slowly: the construction of the Cathedral, begun between 1158 and 1160, was completed over a hundred years later, excluding subsequent modifications; at the end of the 12th century, the San Lorenzo Church was built, while the San Francesco Church and the initial core of the Broletto Palace date back to the late 13th century. The following century left behind the Vistarini Palace, the Castle, and the Sant\u2019Agnese Church. In the late 15th century, remembered as the period of the city\u2019s greatest splendor, numerous new buildings were erected, including the Mozzanica Palace, the Ospedale Maggiore, and the Civic Temple of the Incoronata; during the same period, the defensive fortification system dating back to the early 13th century was strengthened. Between the 16th and early 18th centuries, the San Cristoforo Complex and the Modignani Palace were built. \nHowever, the current appearance of the historic center is largely due to the works carried out between the 18th and 19th centuries, which altered the original urban structure of Lodi\u2019s ancient medieval core. During the Austrian period, in particular, a robust economic recovery led to significant construction development, transforming the city\u2019s appearance in the style of late Baroque architecture: new churches, including Santa Maria del Sole, Santa Maria Maddalena, and San Filippo, were built, while the Episcopal Palace was completely renovated. Numerous monasteries and minor religious buildings were deconsecrated and, in some cases, demolished to make way for new private residences; the main streets were also widened by removing guard stones and demolishing porticos. During the same period, the first two suburban cemeteries of Riolo and San Fereolo were established. The bastions built during the Spanish domination of the 17th century were also demolished; in their place, a ring road was designed, connecting all the city gates, which had served as customs barriers for centuries. In 1835, the southern segment of the ring road was transformed into a \"public promenade\".\nBy the mid-19th century, Lodi\u2019s urban area was still entirely enclosed within the medieval walls; outside the perimeter of the walled city, in addition to numerous farmsteads, there were some hamlets (San Grato, San Fereolo, and San Bernardo), situated at the intersections of regional and local roads, at distances ranging from 2 to 5 km from the city center. This complex urban layout was altered in 1861 with the opening of the Milan-Bologna railway line, which passed through Lodi along the southern edge of the inhabited area: the railway track became the main obstacle when, in the following decades, the city began to slowly expand into the areas adjacent to the ring of the walls.\nBetween 1864 and the early 20th century, numerous urban interventions were carried out: regarding the two cemeteries in Riolo and San Fereolo, the former was expanded, and the latter was closed; in 1886, the construction of the Monumental Cemetery (better known as \"Maggiore\") began. Regarding the road network, the most significant works included the construction of the new Adda bridge in masonry, the redevelopment of the Piazza della Vittoria area, the expansion of Piazza Ospitale, and the creation of a road axis between the railway station and the historic center, with the opening of Viale Dante and Piazza Castello. In terms of infrastructure, in 1880, four steam interurban trams were inaugurated: the Milan-Lodi, the Lodi-Treviglio-Bergamo, the Lodi-Sant\u2019Angelo, and the Lodi-Crema-Soncino. During the same period, rapid urbanization occurred in the quadrilateral between the public promenade and the railway: alongside some industrial settlements, the first batch of public housing was built in 1904. Simultaneously, further south, the first large industrial complexes emerged: the National Hemp and Flax Mill in the San Fereolo area and the Lodi Mechanical Workshops in the Camolina locality.\nAfter a phase of moderate growth between the 1920s and World War II, from 1955, the city\u2019s development accelerated and began to involve both banks of the Adda: new neighborhoods were created, including the \"Fanfani houses\" (west of the historic center) and the \"Oliva village\" (southwest), both built under the INA-Casa plan. Between the 1970s and 2000s, in addition to the completion of a system of ring roads, much of the industrial building stock was decommissioned and converted into new residential areas.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture and livestock.\nAgriculture and livestock have been of fundamental importance to Lodi and its territory since the Middle Ages. As evidence of the ongoing significance of the primary sector, data indicate farms in the province producing mainly maize (47% of the utilized agricultural area) and forage (24% of the UAA). In the municipal territory, there are 84 farms, and the utilized agricultural area consists of , of which 48% is cultivated with maize; additionally, there are head of cattle and head of pigs.\nTo ensure and promote the excellence of the sector, as well as to protect the environment, animal welfare, and consumer health, the \"Lodigiano Terra Buona\" brand committee was established in 2004.\nIndustry and crafts.\nThe first industrial plants established in Lodi were related to the processing of primary sector products: the Lanificio Varesi (1868), the Polenghi Lombardo, the first Italian company to fully process milk (1870), the Officine Sordi, which built machinery for the dairy sector (1881), and the Linificio Canapificio Nazionale (1909). Among other industries in the city, the mechanical sector was particularly developed: for example, the Lodi Mechanical Workshops (1908), the Officine Meccaniche Folli-Gay (1922), the Officine Curioni (1925), and the Officine Elettromeccaniche Adda (1926) were active. The latter were acquired in the 1980s by ABB, which in 1994 transferred its global center for the construction of transformers, high-voltage circuit breakers, and electrical substations to Lodi; in 2016, the company employed about 230 people.\nIn 1944, methane began to be extracted from the wells of nearby Caviaga, and its applications were tested at the local Agip research center. The six-legged dog, the company\u2019s logo, is said to be inspired by the mythical dragon Tarantasio that allegedly haunted Gerundo Lake: when methane was discovered in those areas, it was imagined that the creature, once the guardian of the marshes and then disappeared underground after their reclamation, had reappeared in the form of gas. Lodi was the first city in Italy to use methane for domestic and industrial purposes. In the petrochemical industry, since 1963, Itelyum has been based in Lodi, specializing in the recycling of used motor oil through a refining process. In 2007, the company had a turnover of 100 million euros and employed 170 people.\nAt the border of Lodi\u2019s municipal territory, in an area under the jurisdiction of the municipalities of Montanaso Lombardo and Tavazzano con Villavesco, stands a large thermal power plant owned by EPH, powered by natural gas. The plant, with an installed capacity of , is one of the most important in Italy and employed 73 people in 2019. The initial core, built in 1952 as part of the Marshall Plan, was inaugurated by Enrico Mattei and the Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi; the current facilities were activated in stages between 2002 and 2010. The plant draws cooling water from the Muzza Canal, the Belgiardino Canal, and the Adda River.\nToday, the most developed industries are the dairy industry (the Lodi area is one of the 14 areas where Grana Padano production is concentrated) and artisanal crafts, particularly in the ceramics and cosmetics sectors (L\u2019Erbolario).\nServices.\nAmong the most important companies in the service sector is Zucchetti, which operates in the software and hardware industry; with approximately employees, of which are in Lodi, and a turnover exceeding one billion euros, it is one of Italy\u2019s leading companies in the IT field.\nLodi also has significant banking activity: the Banca Popolare di Lodi, founded by the activist Tiziano Zalli in 1864, was the first cooperative bank established in Italy. Since 2007, it has been part of the Banco Popolare group (later Banco BPM), the third largest banking group in Italy.\nIn 1997, Lodi was one of the first cities to be wired with optical fiber as part of Telecom Italia\u2019s Socrates project, aimed at creating a network for cable television and data transmission.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, before the Great Recession, the city experienced significant economic growth due to the revival of commercial activities, the expansion of the ring road system, and the development of environmental technologies (thanks to the significant portion of recyclable waste produced by the people of Lodi and district heating technology).\nTourism.\nLodi was part of the art cities circuit of the Po Valley from 1999 until 2018, when the organization was dissolved. Since the 2000s, tourism has been a rapidly expanding sector in the area: in 2006, arrivals were recorded, a 116% increase compared to three years earlier.\nIn addition to cultural tourism, naturalistic tourism is particularly significant, thanks to the efficient cycling network that extends from the capital throughout the territory. Food and wine tourism is particularly concentrated between October and December, during which, since 1988, the \"Lodi Gastronomic Festival\" is held.\nInfrastructure and transport.\nRoads.\nLodi is a regional road hub: the city is served by the State Road 9 Via Emilia and numerous provincial roads, including the former SS 235 Pavia-Brescia and the former SS 472 Treviglio-Lodi. The roads converging on the city are connected by the South and East ring roads, forming a semi-ring (interrupted in the northwest sector) with dual carriageway characteristics.\nThe Autostrada del Sole also passes nearby; the \"Lodi\" exit, located in the municipal territory of Pieve Fissiraga, is 6 km southwest of the city.\nRailways and trams.\nThe Lodi railway station is situated on the Milan-Bologna railway and is primarily served by suburban, regional (Milan-Piacenza), and fast regional (Milan-Bologna and Milan-Mantua) trains operated by Trenord and TPER, as well as some long-distance services run by Trenitalia. Most of the traffic consists of commuters traveling to the capital of Lombardy; the station serves a wide catchment area, including travelers from nearby towns and the Cremasque area.\nBetween 1880 and the early decades of the 20th century, Lodi was the center of an extensive network of interurban trams, including the Milan-Lodi, Lodi-Treviglio-Bergamo, Lodi-Sant\u2019Angelo, and Lodi-Crema-Soncino lines, connecting the city with the main capitals of Lombardy.\nUrban mobility.\nThe city has an urban bus network managed by the company STAR Mobility, which provides service through seven lines.\nThe STAR company, based in Lodi since 1922, also manages numerous interurban lines and connections with the main regional centers.\nAdministration.\nThe administrative history of the Municipality of Lodi since the establishment of the Italian Republic can be divided into two phases: for the first thirty years, only mayors from the Christian Democracy party succeeded one another, while from 1975 onward, the city has been predominantly governed by representatives of left or center-left coalitions.\nOther administrative information.\nThe municipality is part of the management consortium of the Adda Sud Park, whose headquarters are located in Lodi.\nIn 1877, the suburban municipalities of Chiosi Uniti con Bottedo and Chiosi d\u2019Adda Vigadore were annexed to the municipal territory. The term \"chiosi\", of dialectal origin, referred to the agricultural lands surrounding the city of Lodi, similar to the more well-known Corpi Santi around Milan.\nSport.\nThe sports scene in Lodi is diverse. Lodi's sports clubs and athletes have achieved titles at both national and international levels.\nThe most popular sport by tradition is roller hockey. The city's leading team, Amatori Lodi, has won four \"scudetti\", four Coppe Italia, two Supercoppe Italiane, one Coppa di Lega, one Cup Winners' Cup, and one WSE Cup. However, the most widely practiced sport remains football. The Lodi-based club A.S. Fanfulla was a prominent participant in the Serie B championship during the 1930s and 1950s, and later won a Coppa Italia Serie C in 1984.\nThe city is equipped with numerous sports facilities, including the Stadio Dossenina and the PalaCastellotti.\nNotable people.\nEugenio Castellotti (1930-1957), racing driver\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64998", "revid": "41603429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64998", "title": "Kaiju", "text": "Japanese media genre\n is a Japanese term that is commonly associated with media involving giant monsters. A subgenre of science-fiction, more precisely monster films, its widespread contemporary use is credited to \"tokusatsu\" (special effects) director Eiji Tsuburaya and filmmaker Ishir\u014d Honda, who popularized the \"kaiju\" film genre by creating the \"Godzilla franchise\" and its spin-offs. The term can also refer to the monsters themselves, which are usually depicted attacking major cities and battling either the military or other creatures.\n\"Godzilla\" (1954) is often regarded as the first \"kaiju\" movie. When developing it, Honda and Tsuburaya drew inspiration from the character of King Kong, both in its influential 1933 film and in the conception of a giant monster, establishing it as a pivotal precursor in the evolution of the genre. During their formative years, \"kaiju\" movies were generally neglected by Japanese critics, who regarded them as \"juvenile gimmick\", according to authors Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski.\n\"Kaiju\" are often somewhat metaphorical in nature; Godzilla, for example, initially served as a metaphor for nuclear weapons, reflecting the fears of post-war Japan following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the \"Lucky Dragon 5\" incident. Other notable examples of \"kaiju\" include Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Gamera, and King Kong.\nOrigins.\nEtymology.\nThe Japanese word \"kaij\u016b\" originally referred to monsters and creatures from ancient Japanese legends; it earlier appeared in the Chinese \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\". There are no traditional depictions of \"kaij\u016b\" or \"kaij\u016b\"-like creatures among the \"y\u014dkai\" of Japanese folklore, although it is possible to find megafauna in their mythology (e.g., Japanese dragons). After \"sakoku\" ended and Japan was opened to foreign relations in the mid-19th century, the term \"kaij\u016b\" came to be used to express concepts from paleontology and legendary creatures from around the world. For example, the extinct \"Ceratosaurus\"-like cryptid featured in \"The Monster of \"Partridge Creek\"\" (1908) by French writer Georges Dupuy was referred to as \"kaij\u016b\". It is worthy to note that in the Meiji era, Jules Verne\u2019s works were introduced to the Japanese public, achieving great success around 1890.\nFilm genre.\nGenre elements were present at the end of Winsor McCay's 1921 animated short \"The Pet\" in which a mysterious giant animal starts destroying the city, until it is countered by a massive airstrike. It was based on a 1905 episode of McCay's comic strip series \"Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend\".\nThe 1925 film \"The Lost World\" (adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel of the same name), featured many dinosaurs, including a brontosaurus that breaks loose in London and destroys Tower Bridge. The dinosaurs of \" The Lost World\" were animated by pioneering stop motion techniques by Willis H. O'Brien, who would some years later animate the giant gorilla-like creature breaking loose in New York City in the 1933 film \"King Kong\". The enormous success of \"King Kong\" can be seen as the definitive breakthrough of monster movies. This influential achievement of King Kong paved the way for the emergence of the giant monster genre, serving as a blueprint for future kaiju productions. Its success reverberated in the film industry, leaving a lasting impact and solidifying the figure of the giant monster as an essential component in genre cinematography. RKO Pictures later licensed the King Kong character to the Japanese studio Toho, resulting in the co-productions \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" (1962) and \"King Kong Escapes\" (1967), both directed by Ishir\u014d Honda.\nYoshir\u014d Edamasa directed \"The Great Buddha Arrival\" in 1934. Although the original film is now lost, stills of the film have survived, and it is one of the earliest examples of a \"kaiju\" film in Japanese cinematic history. The 1934 film presumably influenced the production of the \"Ultraman\" franchise.\nRay Bradbury's short story published in the Saturday Evening Post, June 23, 1951 \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" served as the basis for the film \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (1953), featuring a fictional dinosaur (animated by Ray Harryhausen), which is released from its frozen, hibernating state by an atomic bomb test within the Arctic Circle. The American movie was released in Japan in 1954 under the title \"The Atomic Kaiju Appears\", marking the first use of the genre's name in a film title. However, \"Godzilla\", released in 1954, is commonly regarded as the first Japanese \"kaiju\" film. Tomoyuki Tanaka, a producer for Toho Studios in Tokyo, needed a film to release after his previous project was halted. Seeing how well the Hollywood giant monster movie genre films \"King Kong\" and \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" had done in Japanese box offices, and himself a fan of these films, he set out to make a new movie based on them and created \"Godzilla\". Tanaka aimed to combine Hollywood giant monster movies with the re-emerged Japanese fears of atomic weapons that arose from the Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru fishing boat incident; and so he put a team together and created the concept of a giant radioactive creature emerging from the depths of the ocean, a creature that would become the monster Godzilla. \"Godzilla\" initially had commercial success in Japan, inspiring other \"kaiju\" movies.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"kaij\u016b\" translates literally as \"strange beast\". \"Kaiju\" can be antagonistic, protagonistic, or a neutral force of nature, but are more specifically preternatural creatures of divine power. They are not merely \"big animals\". Godzilla, for example, from its first appearance in the initial 1954 entry in the \"Godzilla\" franchise, has manifested all of these aspects. Other examples of \"kaiju\" include Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Anguirus, King Kong, Gamera, Megalon, The Cloverfield Monster, , Guilala, and Yonggary. There are also subcategories including \"Mecha\" \"Kaiju\" (Meka-Kaij\u016b), featuring mechanical or cybernetic characters, including Moguera, Mechani-Kong, Mechagodzilla, and Gigan, which are an offshoot of \"kaiju\". Likewise, the collective subcategory \"Ultra-Kaiju\" (Urutora-Kaij\u016b) is a separate strata of \"kaij\u016b\" that specifically originates in the long-running \"Ultra Series\" franchise but can also be referred to simply by \"kaij\u016b\". As a noun, \"kaij\u016b\" is an \"invariant\", as both the singular and the plural expressions are identical.\n\"Kaijin\".\n( lit. \"Strange person\") refers to distorted human beings or humanoid-like creatures. The origin of \"kaijin\" goes back to the early 20th Century Japanese literature, starting with Edogawa Rampo's 1936 novel, \"The Fiend with Twenty Faces\". The story introduced Edogawa's master detective, Kogoro Akechi's arch-nemesis, the eponymous \"Fiend\", a mysterious master of disguise, whose real face was unknown; the \"Moriarty\" to Akechi's \"Sherlock\". Catching the public's imagination, many such literary and movie (and later television) villains took on the mantle of \"kaijin\". To be clear, \"kaijin\" is not an offshoot of \"kaiju\". The first-ever kaijin that appeared on film was \"The Great Buddha Arrival\" a lost film, made in 1934. After the Pacific War, the term was modernized when it was adopted to describe the bizarre, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced evil humanoid spawn conceived for the \"Kamen Rider Series\" in 1971. This created a new splinter of the term, which quickly propagated through the popularity of superhero programs produced from the 1970s, forward. These \"kaijin\" possess rational thought and the power of speech, as do human beings. A successive \"kaijin\" menagerie, in diverse iterations, appeared over numerous series, most notably the \"Super Sentai\" programs premiering in 1975 (later carried over into \"Super Sentai\"'s English iteration as \"Power Rangers\" in the 1990s).\nThis created yet another splinter, as the \"kaijin\" of \"Super Sentai\" have since evolved to feature unique forms and attributes (e.g., gigantism), existing somewhere between \"kaijin\" and \"kaiju\".\n\"Daikaiju\".\n\"Daikaij\u016b\" () literally translates as \"giant \"kaiju\"\" or \"great \"kaiju\"\". This hyperbolic term was used to denote greatness of the subject \"kaiju\", the prefix \"dai-\" emphasizing great size, power, and/or status. The first known appearance of the term \"daikaiju\" in the 20th Century was in the publicity materials for the original 1954 release of \"Godzilla\". Specifically, in the subtitle on the original movie poster, \"Suibaku Daikaiju Eiga\" (), lit. \"H-Bomb Giant Monster Movie\". \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\", the first film of the \"Gamera\" franchise in 1965, also utilized the term where the Japanese title of the film is \"Daikaij\u016b Gamera\" ().\n\"Seijin\".\n\"Seijin\" ( lit. \"star people\"), appears within Japanese words for extraterrestrial aliens, such as \"Kaseijin\" (), which means \"Martian\". Aliens can also be called \"uch\u016bjin\" () which means \"spacemen\". Among the best known \"Seijin\" in the genre can be found in the \"Ultra Series\", such as Alien Baltan from \"Ultraman\", a race of cicada-like aliens who have gone on to become one of the franchise's most enduring and recurring characters other than the Ultras themselves.\nToho has produced a variety of \"kaiju\" films over the years (many of which feature Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra), but other Japanese studios contributed to the genre by producing films and shows of their own: Daiei Film (Kadokawa Pictures), Tsuburaya Productions, and Shochiku and Nikkatsu Studios.\nMonster techniques.\nEiji Tsuburaya, who was in charge of the special effects for \"Godzilla\", developed a technique to animate the \"kaiju\" that became known colloquially as \"suitmation\". Where Western monster movies often used stop motion to animate the monsters, Tsubaraya decided to attempt to create suits, called \"creature suits\", for a human (suit actor) to wear and act in. This was combined with the use of miniature models and scaled-down city sets to create the illusion of a giant creature in a city. Due to the extreme stiffness of the latex or rubber suits, filming would often be done at double speed, so that when the film was shown, the monster was smoother and slower than in the original shot. \"Kaiju\" films also used a form of puppetry interwoven between suitmation scenes for shots that were physically impossible for the suit actor to perform. From the 1998 release of \"Godzilla\", American-produced \"kaiju\" films strayed from suitmation to computer-generated imagery (CGI). In Japan, CGI and stop-motion have been increasingly used for certain special sequences and monsters, but suitmation has been used for an overwhelming majority of \"kaiju\" films produced in Japan of all eras.\nSelected media.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The character and the first film were intended to follow the success of Toho's \"Godzilla\" film series, while various staffs have participated in both and related franchises, and the two franchises have influenced each other. The Daiei franchise has become a Japanese icon in its own right and one of the many representatives of Japanese cinema, appearing in a total of 12 films produced by Daiei Film and later by Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Daiei Studio (Kadokawa Corporation) respectively, and various other media such as novels, anime, videos, manga and cartoons, magazines, video games, television programs, shows, other merchandises, and so on.\nGamera is depicted as a giant, flying, fire-breathing, prehistoric turtle. In the series' first film, Gamera is portrayed as an aggressive and destructive monster, though he also saved a child's life. As the films progressed, Gamera took on a more benevolent role, becoming a protector of humanity, especially children, nature, and the Earth from extraterrestrial races and other giant monsters.\nThe Gamera franchise has been (both directly and indirectly) very influential in Japan and internationally. This is seen notably in the productions of the \"Daimajin\" and \"Yokai Monsters\" film franchises and influences on the entire tokusatsu genre, including the \"Godzilla\" franchise, and the domestic television industry. The franchise directly and indirectly contributed in starting of two influential social phenomena (the two \"Kaiju Booms\" ()() and their successor \"Y\u014dkai / Kaiki Boom\"), and \"Gamera\" and \"Daimajin\" franchises were part of the \"Kaiju Booms\". Gamera and Daimajin and other related characters have been referenced and used in various topics, such as the naming of prehistoric turtles (\"Sinemys gamera\" () and \"Gamerabaena\"), an algorithm to study plasma bubbles, and many others. 27 November is publicly referred as in Japan, and Gamera and related characters are used as mascots by the city of Ch\u014dfu.\nDespite its popularity and influence, expansion of the franchise and public recognition of the character were severely hindered by Daiei Film and its successors' (Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation) precarious financial conditions, facing repeated copyright transfers of Daiei properties, failed global expansions despite featuring foreign casts, diminished media attentions, and cancellations of various projects escalated by controversial aspects of the highly acclaimed Heisei trilogy, and the competition against the \"Godzilla\" franchise. On the other hand, both franchises bear connections in productions and distributions, and their filmmakers and producers did not have senses of rivalry and have paid respects to each other. Additionally, there had been failed attempts to produce a direct crossover, and a scrapped Gamera project served as one of predecessors of \"Godzilla\" (2014) by Legendary Pictures.\nDespite being a major film studio and Masaichi Nagata being a highly influential figure, Daiei Film was facing a dire fiscal condition and was suffering internal and external factors, including the decline of the film industry itself (even including Toho and its \"Godzilla\" franchise) from the competition against the rising television industry, which was boosted by the 1964 Summer Olympics, a recession, and the aforementioned \"Kaiju Booms\" most notably \"Ultra Q\" and \"Ultraman\" where Nagata's attempt to save the film industry resulted in the governmental supports for kaiju and tokusatsu productions, and the booms were ironically shaped. Consequently, the original \"Gamera\" film became a black-and-white film.\nDaiei Film's situation improved thanks to the \"Gamera\" franchise, which solely supported the company and its subcontractors until Daiei's bankruptcy in 1971. On the other hand, not only budgets, schedules, ideas, and (both physical and human) resources, but also labor conditions continuously declined and impoverished remaining employees, leading to deteriorations of qualities and distributions, and to deaths of the actor Taro Marui and a staff of \"Gamera vs. Jiger\" (1970). A riot, losses of various materials and expertises, and disputes over the legal rights of the franchise (and Niisan Takahashi's isolation from all stakeholders) were evoked as the company was officially declared bankrupt, triggering further issues on subsequent situations by Tokuma Shoten.\nOverview.\nConception.\nThe name derives from the Japanese \"kame\" (\"turtle\"), and the suffix \"-ra\", a suffix shared by such other \"kaiju\" characters as Godzilla (\"Gojira\") and Mothra. Gamera's name was spelled \"Gamela\" on a French newspaper in the 1965 film, and \"Gammera\" in the title of \"Gammera the Invincible\", the re-titled American release of the first film in the franchise, \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\". The character was named by Masaichi Nagata, who pushed ahead the name to contend Godzilla, while other executives were against it for its resemblance to Godzilla, however others eventually didn't come up with any sufficient names for the turtle kaiju along with their reluctances to resist the autocratic president.\nThe original idea for Gamera was developed by Yonejiro Saito, Masaichi Nagata, Hidemasa Nagata, Niisan Takahashi, and Noriaki Yuasa. The character was created as a property of the production company Daiei Film, and was intended to compete with the \"Godzilla\" film series, owned by rival studio Toho. Prior to the idea of the flying turtle monster, there existed preceding concepts of an octopus kaiju called and the rat monsters. These pre-Gamera projects resulted in failures by using live animals for filming, presumably due to the efforts to avoid the Toho-based tokusatsu techniques under the constraints from the Six-Company Agreement (Five-Company Agreement), which was led by Masaichi Nagata himself.\nThere had been contradicting testimonies regarding the original conceptor and models of Gamera. Noriaki Yuasa believed it was Niisan Takahashi's idea, while Takahashi noted that he heard Masaichi Nagata came up with the idea of a \"giant, flying turtle\". There had also been rumors of \"lewd turtles\" as the model(s) of Gamera, either true stories or jokes, among Daiei staffs including Yonejiro Saito. Alternatively, Tomio Sagisu, a student of Eiji Tsuburaya and had repeatedly associated with Daiei Film and crews of the \"Gamera\" and other Daiei tokusatsu productions, claimed that the concept of Gamera originates in his demo reel, while Yonesaburo Tsukiji, another student of Tsuburaya, declared it was Hidemasa Nagata's idea.\nGamera's turtle-like design may have been inspired by the Black Tortoise, one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations in East Asian mythology. The Black Tortoise is known as \"Genbu\" in Japanese, and is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a snake. Each of the Four Symbols are said to act as guardians over each of the four cardinal directions: with the dragon \"Seiryu\" in the east, the tiger \"Byakko\" in the west, the bird \"Suzaku\" in the south, and the tortoise \"Genbu\" in the north. In \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\", the first film in the franchise, Gamera is depicted as awakening in the Arctic, the northernmost region on Earth. ', the 11th film in the franchise, contains a scene featuring a book describing the Four Symbols, including \"Genbu\". Before the character was officially referenced to the Black Tortoise in the 1999 film, designs and background stories of Gamera and Gyaos () were also inspired by ancient Chinese aspects during the production of ' while the original script of the film, so-called \"Konaka Gamera\" focused more on the ancient India.\nMasaichi Nagata set the policy to make Gamera as the hero of children. Gamera's characteristics as a hero who protects humanity and animals, his energy-only diet predating Godzilla, his emerging from the north, and his liking of light and nuclear explosions were also designed to differ from Godzilla having a hatred for humanity, man-made lights, and nuclear explosions. While Godzilla may represent a terror of nuclear war, Gamera was aimed to be a contrasting character, whom children can always believe in, as an antithesis to adults trying to manipulate children with nationalism and propaganda, based on Noriaki Yuasa's own traumatic experiences of pre and post-war situations as a child. Hidemasa Nagata's intention to make the franchise child-friendly was also due to his desire to create positive emotional influences on child developments. In addition, while a nuclear explosion played roles in both \"Godzilla\" and \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\", the latter didn't symbolize it to illustrate negative aspects of the humanity unlike the Godzilla film; while Godzilla was a victim of nucler energy and explosion, Gamera represents such energy itself and its circulation and predated the Toho kaiju to feed on nuclear energies.\nUnder Masaichi Nagata, Daiei Film distributed the re-released edition of \"King Kong\" in 1952 and \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" in 1954. The former was the first post-war release of monster films in Japan, and these distributions might have influenced productions of \"Godzilla\" and the \"Gamera\" franchise. \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" depicted the titular monster to being awoken with a nuclear explosion in the Arctic who later destroys a lighthouse, akin to \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\". There also exist minor references to the novelization of \"King Kong\", such as relationships between titular monsters and humans and pets of the same or related motif with the titular monsters. Subsequent Gamera films in Showa and Heisei eras also bear remembrances in plot to \"King Kong\".\nIn contrast to Godzilla in his earlier films with a concept to represent the \"god of destruction\", Daiei's filmmakers paid attentions to zoom in on Gamera to feature him as a character with personality, and his roars were designed to be emotional with several variations to depict his emotions. During the production of the 1965 film, Noriaki Yuasa and others \"became fond of\" Gamera, therefore they decided not to kill him and developed a friendly side of him. A number of crews and audiences initially did not favor the idea of Gamera becoming a hero, as kaiju were generally regarded to be fearsome beings at that time.\nYuasa and others didn't intend to make \"Gamera\" films to be \"good in quality\", but being \"good in performances\", by appealing to young audiences to aim for additional revenues; unlike today where sales of video and DVD also contribute, theater attendances were more important at that time, therefore child-friendly films were effective to attract additional audiences (accompanying adults), and margins between tickets for children and adults were recoverable with sales of merchandise and snacks and drinks. Filmmakers focused on how not to bore child audiences, and scenes depicting Gamera performing bizarre behaviors such as acrobatic (due to the popularity of the 1964 Summer Olympics) and musical acts (to play \"Gamera March\" with the dorsal fins of Zigra), and daily life of people, such as having meals, were also inserted to attract attentions of children.\nMasaichi Nagata, who pushed ahead the production of \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\", solely supported the film while others (including Noriaki Yuasa himself) anticipated it to flop since the beginning but couldn't resist Masaichi's authority and unwillingly changed their reviews, and even Yuasa was baffled with its unexpected success.\nCharacteristics.\nGamera resembles an enormous prehistoric turtle, and is capable of both bipedal movement and flight. He occasionally walks on all four legs in Showa films and \"Gamera the Brave\" in 2006. He has a pronounced crest on his head, his mouth contains rows of teeth, and two tusks protrude upward from each side of his lower jaw.\nHe can fly by means of \"jets\" which can be ignited out of his limb holes when he retracts into his shell. The jets allow Gamera to rise into the air and spin, propelling him forward. In later films, he is shown to be able to fly with only his rear legs drawn inside his shell, allowing his front limbs more freedom.\nGamera's shell is presented as being incredibly resilient and strong (only ever being damaged by Guiron, Legion (), Iris, and Zedus), and can deflect projectiles such as missiles. His plastron (lower shell) is more vulnerable than his carapace (upper shell).\nGamera never feeds on any fauna or plant organisms, and exclusively relies on thermal energy, electricity, radiation, and other energy sources. Using conventional weapons, even including nuclear weapons, against Gamera may also empower him instead, although his durability may change on occasions.\nAll incarnations of the character have an affinity for humans (especially children) and nature, and protect them at all costs even by sacrificing themselves. They may also save animals, wildlife, yokai, and innocent kaiju even if they are offspring of antagonists. On the other hand, they may get mistaken by the humanity as a threat, and may face hostilities despite their intentions to protect and befriend with the humanity.\nAll incarnations of the character possess several supernatural abilities, most notably telepathy, and others such as healing and reviving humans, understanding human speech, sensing antagonistic kaiju and extraterrestrial races from afar, sharing ancient memories with humans, using life forces (mana in the Heisei trilogy) for offensive and supplemental usages, and potential reincarnation. Mystic depictions of monsters increased after the Heisei trilogy, and there have been additional powers exclusively performed in literatures by respective divine incarnations such as materialization and time manipulation. The lore of \"Gamera the Brave\" also loosely connects Gamera to a deity with supernatural depictions, however his exact origin remains unclear with the sequels of the 2006 film being cancelled.\nIn canonical productions, the character has never been depicted to die precisely unlike fan fictions, \"GAMERA 4-TRUTH\" and \"Gamera: The Last Hope\"; Gamera was artificially revived in the 1994 manga \"Giant Monster Gamera\" which serves as a substantial sequel to ', the \"Gamera graveyard\" represented in ' was regarded as the disposal site for defective flops to create the living Gamera, and Toto is speculated to be the reincarnation of Avant Gamera in \"Gamera the Brave\".\n, as transformations of other kaiju, had appeared in several medias as antagonists, and the cancelled 2006 anime by Yoshitomo Yonetani intended to introduce a corps of , aside from exoteric examples.\nShowa.\nDuring the franchise's Sh\u014dwa era, Gamera was depicted as feeding on flammable substances, such as oil and fire. According to notes by frequent series director Noriaki Yuasa, Gamera's internal anatomy includes sacs which allow him to store oil, lava, coal, and uranium. In \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" and \"Gamera vs. Barugon\", extreme cold temperatures are shown to weaken Gamera, although he is capable of being active in the outer space and the deep ocean. Gamera is also capable of performing additional feats including supernatural ones such as emitting electricity and electromagnetic waves, telepathy, and remote sensing. Additionally, he has a high intelligence which is used to outsmart antagonists, to tactically use artificial objects, to behave cautiously to mind humans, and to repair an alien spaceship. Gamera's intention behind bizarre displays including acrobatic and musical acts in later films was presumably to calm and entertain children.\nThe original 1965 film, \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\", depicts Gamera's origins as being a result of United States military fighters launching an attack on enemy bombers (presumably belonging to the Soviet Union), which causes the detonation of an atomic bomb on board one of the aircraft. The nuclear blast releases Gamera from a state of suspended animation in the ice. Meanwhile, a Japanese research team stumbles upon an Inuit tribe in possession of an ancient stone etching that depicts a giant turtle, which the tribe refers to as \"Gamera\".\nHis exact origin was not verified aside from his association with the ancient civilization of the Atlantis, while he was potentially known to the inhabitants on the Mu continent because of his fights against Jiger back then, as the civilization had been troubled by the parasitic monster. The Inuit fear of Gamera and his confinement in the Arctic, contrary to his heroic personality and favor of thermal energy, was presumably due to his entrapment by the Atlanteans and inherited memories of their ancestors to mistake him as a threat, along with the loss of records by Atlanteans after the demise of the ancient civilization.\nHis incongruous ferocity in \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" and the beginning of \"Gamera vs. Barugon\" was presumably due to an uncontrollable starvation and confusion after 8,000 years of hibernation caused by the entrapment by the Atlanteans, and Gamera's rampage against humanity was only to feed on thermal energy and electricity. He learned of modern human technology through the atomic bomb explosion, and his attacks on cities were also to lure military operations so that he could feed more on thermal energy of weapons. The protagonist boy (Toshio) in the 1965 film kept claiming that Gamera was not villainous but had been misunderstood by the humanity because of his hunger and loneliness. Gamera's uncontrollable appetite was gradually satisfied, and he regained his natural calmness as the films progressed, and began saving the humanity voluntarily.\nThe incarnation of the character appeared in \"\" (1980) was depicted to be potentially a different individual from the previous films where the film itself is a new story, and a normal pond slider was magically turned into a kaiju by the spacewomen, a group of supernatural female aliens. At the end of the film, Gamera sacrificed himself to destroy the Zanon, the spaceship of the antagonists. While the 1994 manga \"Giant Monster Gamera\" depicted this as Gamera's fate, Gamera was resurrected by the descendants of Atlanteans with ancient technology of Atlantis, gaining characteristics of the Heisei trilogy Gamera, and was sent back to the ancient period to change the history to prevent his own demise, as well as to save and monitor humanity.\nHeisei trilogy.\nIn the franchise's Heisei period, which began with the 1995 reboot film ', Gamera's in-universe origins were changed. In the Heisei films, Gamera is portrayed as an ancient, bio-engineered creature from Atlantis, created for the purpose of defending the people of Atlantis from Gyaos (), a bat-like creature which breathes a destructive supersonic beam to attack. Human researchers find Gamera floating in the Pacific Ocean, encased in rock, and mistaking him for an atoll. Within the rock, they discover a large monolith explaining Gamera's origins, along with dozens of magatama made from orichalcum, which allow for a psychic link between Gamera and humans. In ', an undersea graveyard containing numerous Gamera-like fossils is shown. While this may suggest that the Gamera was not the only one of his kind, one character in the film refers to these fossils as \"beta versions\" of Gamera, possible failures in Atlantis' attempts to create the final version.\nThis iteration of Gamera has retractable claws within his elbows, and is shown to be able to shoot plasma fireballs from his mouth. Gamera has also been shown as being able to absorb mana from the Earth, to fire a plasma beam from his chest, and to manipulate energy to create a pseudo arm composed of fire to destroy a foe. Within the first and the third films of the trilogy, Gamera magically healed harmed humans including reviving temporarily deceased or nearly dead individuals, although he was unable to revive humans whose corpses were physically destroyed. In the 2003 comic, he was depicted to be supernaturally capable of triggering eruptions in volcanoes. Within the comic book adaptation of the 1999 film by Kazunori Ito and Moo. Nenpei, who had also published another Gamera manga \"Gamera vs. Morphos\" in 1999, Gamera performed extreme regeneration to restore his head from mimicked plasma fireballs by Iris, and defeated the antagonist with either an empowered fire blast or fireball instead of the \"vanishing fist\". In \"Gamera vs. Morphos\", Gamera performed additional abilities including telepathy without a magatama, an earthquake, and a powerful fireball with himself glowing red, akin to the \"Toto impact\" in \"Gamera the Brave\".\nGamera the Brave.\nThe franchise was rebooted a second time with the 2006 film \"Gamera the Brave\", the 12th entry in the film series. This incarnation was modeled after the African spurred tortoise, and also possesses supernatural traits such as instant growth, telepathy, comprehending human speech, sensing and foreseeing emerging evil monsters from afar, and reincarnation. Gamera's origin is unclear, while a top scientist was utterly shocked with the virtual replica of Gamera's cells and consequently committed a suicide, and Gamera has been referred to sacred entities; one of scientists described the kaiju as a deity, and some of villagers saved by Avant Gamera kept the red pearls as amulets and called the objects as \"fragments of the guardian angel\"; the items became a center of public attentions and brought economic effects, and significantly contributed in the reconstruction of the region. Stranger children were driven by incomprehensible instincts to carry the red stone to Gamera; they somehow knew the term \"Toto\" and the importance of delivering it to Gamera. With the light from the stone, children also \"recalled\" and understood the ancient period before their births, and understood what Gamera is. Gamera (Toto) also somehow performed a judo technique which was a specialty of one of the protagonist boys presumably through telepathy. Governmental officials and scientists try to use him as a weapon against villainous kaiju while protagonists try to save him. Gamera and Gyaos were designed to be much smaller yet heavier than previous incarnations, corresponding with the \"Konaka Gamera\" script for \"\" which became the basis for the 2006 film.\nThe opening scene of the film, set in 1973, depicts the original Gamera, called \"Avant Gamera\", sacrificing himself by means of self-destruction to save a coastal village from four Gyaos. 33 years later, a young boy named Toru Aizawa finds a glowing heart-shaped rock near his home, with a small egg lying on top of it. A baby turtle hatches from the egg, and begins to grow in size at an alarming rate. The turtle, dubbed \"Toto\" by Toru after his own nickname by his deceased mother, quickly forms a bond with the boy and develops the ability to breathe fire and fly. After consuming the glowing rock found with his egg, Toto fully transforms into the next incarnation of Gamera, gaining the power to defeat a lizard-like monster known as Zedus. Zedus was once a normal reptile, but turned into a kaiju by feeding on Gyaos' corpse, and was presumably controlled by the vengeful spirits of the villainous flying creatures.\nIn one of novelizations, additional mutants spawned from Gyaos cells made appearances, including Space Gyaos, Barugon, Viras, Guiron, Jiger and its offspring, and Zigra, and Toto fought against a legion of these kaiju.\nGamera Rebirth.\n\"Gamera Rebirth\", the first installation in the Reiwa era introduced monsters' characteristics to represent not only homages to previous films but also some of unused ideas of previous films and scrapped projects. All kaiju in this series are artificial life forms created by ancient civilizations for warfare and to control the overpopulation of humanity. This incarnation of Gamera was also originally created for mass-massacres, however he was re-programmed by a rebellious figure to become the protector of civilians from other kaiju. During the downfalls of ancient civilizations, Gamera presumably stood against 24 different kaiju to protect the humanity.\nWhile previous incarnations of the character possessed affinities to elements most notably fire, electricity, plasma energy, electromagnetic pulse, and jamming, Gamera in \"Gamera Rebirth\" further expanded combat attributes to include gravitation, an energy shield, and baryon. This incarnation also possesses several supernatural traits such as telepathy, a psychic link with humans, interfering mental contact by other kaiju on humans, bestowing a power to sense presence of other kaiju on children, and his name itself contains a power to somehow encourage specific children and makes humans to feel that the name \"Gamera\" is the correct one.\nGamera appeared to protect children from other monsters trying to feed on children and other humans. Through battle, Gamera was severely damaged and nearly died. During the battle against S-Gyaos, an enormous Gyaos mutant who fed on Viras' corpse, Gamera was injected with specific RNA viruses to reprogram him for the original usage. However, Gamera managed to regain his consciousness by willpower and a telepathic link with a boy. To prevent himself from being enslaved for carnage, Gamera sacrificed himself to destroy the Moonbase of the antagonists, the descendants of nobles of an ancient civilization who were using kaiju. Using all of his remaining power for the planet-penetrating Charged Baryon Cannon, the \"Moon Buster\", Gamera dissolved into ashes, leaving behind an egg for the new incarnation of Gamera who strongly resembles Toto from the 2006 film.\nOthers.\nThere have been multiple other incarnations of the character appeared in various other media from novelizations to manga and video games.\nThe origin of the Gamera appeared in the 1995 novel \"Gamera vs. Phoenix\" by Niisan Takahashi, which was redeveloped from a script for a cancelled film in 1994, is unclear. Showa era Gamera defeated villainous kaiju like in previous films while the \"new\" Gamera who emerged from underneath the Nazca Lines possessed characteristics of the 1995 film \"\". This \"new\" Gamera initially attacked chemical plants all over the world, resulting in hostility from humanity, though his intention was to prevent an oncoming catastrophe caused by environmental degradations and to warn humanity. After sealing the Phoenix, an immortal but suicidal, fiery entity constantly suffering due to its immortality, the new Gamera sacrificed himself to save the Earth from further destruction caused by harmful sunlight triggered by air pollution, following a similar fate as the Phoenix where both monsters cannot die for the sake of the planet which was damaged by humanity.\nThe incarnation of the character, the \"Black Tortoise\", appeared in , a spin-off novelization of the 2021 film \"\" by Takashi Miike, was uniquely portrayed to be an actual goddess. This incarnation was capable of various supernatural abilities such as materialization, human speech, and making yokai and humans they have known her since childhood even if it is their first encounter with her. In spirit-like form, she appeared from Mount Ooe and surrounding mountains north of Heian-ky\u014d (Kyoto) and manifested a physical form and battled Nue, a gigantic yokai being empowered by vengeful Abe no Seimei to save the world from antagonistic humans and yokai. Gamera overwhelmed and severely weakened Nue with her fireballs and spinning jet, and left the rest to yokai and humans so they could fulfill their destiny, and secretly disappeared (dematerialized).\nThe presence of the \"Black Tortoise\" was also confirmed in the 2015 novel , a tribute to Masaichi Nagata and his Nichiren-themed films. The author Shinichiro Inoue has published literatures about Gamera and Daimajin, and has participated in both \"Daimajin Kanon\" and \"Gamera Rebirth\"; his attempt to revive the franchise was also redeveloped as the 2015 anniversary short film. In this novel, Barugon and Jiger directly appeared as the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger, respectively. Each monster is a spiritual and sacred entity, being regarded as deities with supernatural powers such as telepathy, weaponizing the weather, energy beams, levitation, and time manipulation. These monsters choose specific humans as summoners and form supernatural links with them through magatamas, and bestow them superpowers. The chosen ones can summon materialized monsters to perform tremendous feats, however, if summoners use monsters for destructive deeds, the world would be spiritually poisoned and requires other members of the Four Symbols (and their chosen ones) to purify. Nichiren, the current summoner of the Black Tortoise who was also bestowed abilities including a time manipulation, tried to restore the world after the battle of Barugon and Jiger during the Mongol invasions of Japan.\nGamera made several appearances in the two tokusatsu television series \"Sailor Fight!\" and \"Cosplay Warrior Cutie Knight\" series (Ver.1.0, Ver.1.3, \"2: Revenge of the Empire\") in 1995 and 1996 (as a \"Capsule Monster\" in the 1996 video, presumably based on similarly styled characters from \"Ultra Seven\", which later inspired \"Pok\u00e9mon\". Noriaki Yuasa directed a related 1996 video \"Cosplay Warrior Cutie Knight 2: Revenge of the Empire\" and appeared in it as the character \"Dr. Yuasa\", making it his posthumous work. Hurricane Ryu, who was also working for the 1994 manga \"Giant Monster Gamera\", played Gamera in the video.\nIn the 2015 short film to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the franchise, Gamera saved a boy from a swarm of Gyaos attacking Tokyo and incinerated them with a powerful fire blast. A decade later, another monster appeared in Tokyo to cause havoc, and the boy again witnessed Gamera returns to fight it.\nWithin the \"USO Makoto Y\u014dkai Hyaku Monogatari\" series by Natsuhiko Kyogoku, in which multiple Kadokawa stakeholders, Daiei (Kadokawa)-related characters, and characters from \"GeGeGe no Kitar\u014d\" made cameo appearances as unsubstantial entities along with various other characters from multiple different franchises.\nRelationship with Godzilla.\nOverview.\nBoth \"Gamera\" and \"Godzilla\" franchises have played significant roles in expanding modern culture in Japan, influenced various other productions, and influenced each other on various occasions. Both along with other tokusatsu productions, most notably \"Daimajin\" and Tsuburaya's \"Ultra Q\" and \"Ultraman\" franchises, formed the First Kaiju Boom, which became the basis for the Second Kaiju Boom and the Y\u014dkai / Kaiki Boom. Despite the restraints by the Six-Company Agreement, which was led by Masaichi Nagata himself, the success of Daiei Film's own \"Gamera\" prompted non-Toho kaiju productions. This, and Masaichi's contributions in the launching of the Japanese Film Export Promotion Association, encouraged the Japanese government to value kaiju and tokusatsu productions for exports, and the First Kaiju Boom became a social phenomenon with notable influences on modern popular cultures in Japan.\nDaiei Film's objective was not to surpass the \"Godzilla\" franchise, but to coexist with it, and the \"Gamera\" franchise achieved differentiation from Toho productions, gained popularity notably among children, and rivaled the \"Godzilla\" franchise.\nEspecially by global and post-Daiei domestic perspectives, Gamera has often been described as a cheap, uncool, and inferior rip-off of Godzilla, and such impressions along with declined public recognitions and limited advertisements and media attentions have negatively affected the franchise most notably on box office results of post-Daiei productions, furtherly hindering revival attempts by Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation.\nOn the other hand, Masaichi Nagata's intention to explore potentials for giant monster films began with the releases of \"King Kong\" and \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\", and potentially influenced the production of \"Godzilla\" (1954), aside from Eiji Tsuburaya and others' early associations with Nagata and Daiei Film prior to their eventual returns to Toho; they participated in Japan's first post-war science fiction tokusatsu films by Daiei with their intentions to join the company, and \"Godzilla\" franchise was later launched. Following the Gamera-related \"Warning from Space\" (1956) which was the first-colored tokusatsu film in Japan, Daiei produced its first kaiju film \"The Whale God\" in 1962, and the company's attempt to create its own monster franchises resulted in the failures of the aforementioned \"Dagora\" and \"Nezura\" presumably to avoid using Toho-based techniques and styles for the Six-Company Agreement led by Masaichi Nagata himself; its aftermath triggered additional issues on the near-bankrupt company, and \"Gamera\" was instead produced eventually. As below-mentioned, both franchises various stakeholders in productions, and Toho has distributed Daiei productions including the Heisei Gamera trilogy.\nGodzilla films including later Showa films, \"Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla\" (1994), \"Godzilla vs. Destoroyah\" (1995), \"Godzilla 2000\" (1999), \"Godzilla vs. Megaguirus\" (2000), ' (GMK) (2001), \"Shin Godzilla\" (2016), \"Godzilla Minus One\" (2023), and MonsterVerse series by Legendary Pictures have been pointed out to be influenced by Showa Gamera films and Shusuke Kaneko's Heisei Gamera trilogy and '. Gamera was represented within a concept art of ', and Kaneko himself acknowledges similarities between his films and MonsterVerse films where the scrapped 2011 project \"Gamera 3D\" by Yoshimitsu Banno served as one of predecessors of the 2014 film \"Godzilla\". According to Jared Krichevsky, \"Shimo\" appeared in ' was partially inspired by Barugon. Shusuke Kaneko used some aspects of Showa Gamera and his Heisei Gamera trilogy for \"\" such as \"submarine within kaiju's body\" from \"Gamera vs. Jiger\", and Kaneko reused ideas which he originally wanted for the Heisei trilogy and its cancelled sequel(s).\nEiji Tsuburaya depicted Godzilla to be more heroic and to bleed in later Showa films despite disliking bleeding kaiju, and having avoided this in previous Showa films due to his belief in Christianity. Later Showa Godzilla films featured more child-friendly aspects, emotional interactions between kaiju and children, introducing theme songs, depicting kaiju as characters than monsters with increased scenes to zoom in on kaiju, increasing the number of scenes involving kaiju, and adding more fancifully designed kaiju. Yoshimitsu Banno, who later planned to direct \"Gamera 3D\", made Godzilla to fly in his \"Godzilla vs. Hedorah\". These later Showa Godzilla films were presumably influenced by Gamera. The creations of Minilla (a child-friendly son of Godzilla) and Kamoebas (), Toho's own turtle kaiju, were also possibly influenced by the \"Gamera\" franchise where possible references between the two turtle kaiju had been made in later \"Godzilla\" productions. Feeding behaviors relying on nuclear energy by titular kaiju was also initially introduced in the \"Gamera\" franchise. On the other hand, Toto in the 2006 film \"Gamera the Brave\" in return bears physical and conceptual similarities to Minilla, Godzilla Junior in the 1994 film \"Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla\", and \"Daigoro vs. Goliath\" (1972) by Toho and Tsuburaya Productions, where the 1972 film was instead influenced by \"Gamera\". While \"Gamera the Brave\" re-used the original script of \"\", which also affected productions of \"Digimon Tamers\" and \"Ultraman Tiga\", the plot of the 2006 film was also influenced by the Heisei Mothra trilogy where crews such as Nippon Eizo Creative had participated in both productions.\nIshiro Honda highly praised the 1967 film \"Gamera vs. Gyaos\", pleasing Niisan Takahashi greatly and freeing him from his feeling of inferiority towards the \"Godzilla\" franchise, and Honda suggested Takahashi to work together in the future. There was a failed attempt to produce a \"Daimajin\" film involving Honda in 1980s, and Takahashi later sent his script for the cancelled 1994 film, which later became the basis of the novel \"Gamera vs. Phoenix\", to several tokusatsu film makers including Honda; however, despite Honda's encouragement, Takahashi's attempt failed to materialize.\nThe Six-Company Agreement led by Masaichi Nagata prevented other companies from easily chasing after the success of Toho, and the \"Godzilla\" franchise didn't have notable competitors until the \"Gamera\" franchise; the agreement ironically made Daiei Film's own \"Dagora\" and \"Nezura\" to fail by using live animals (octopuses and rats) to avoid the Toho-style, and Daiei Film changed the direction for \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\". As below mentioned, non-Toho kaiju productions suddenly increased after Daiei's \"The Whale God\" and early \"Gamera\" films, which were produced under Masaichi Nagata, and the aforementioned First Kaiju Boom became an influential social phenomenon among post-war Japanese popular cultures.\nJoint appearances.\nAlthough the two franchises have often influenced and referenced each other and there existed attempts to conduct direct crossovers, Gamera and Godzilla have never met onscreen officially as of 2025.\nDuring the production of ' in 1995, Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founder of Tokuma Shoten, expressed his interest in producing \"Godzilla vs. Gamera\" and proposed a crossover to Toho, however this attempt failed to materialize, and Yasuyoshi's death in 2000 and the financial situation of Tokuma Shoten eventually resulted in the disposal of Daiei Film properties, along with the cancellation of \"Gamera 4\" due to box office results and limited revenues of the trilogy that were caused by multiple factors, the destruction scenes by Gamera in ', and the planned plot of the scrapped sequel.\nIn 2002, Kadokawa acquired the copyrights of Daiei Film properties from Tokuma Shoten, and Kazuo Kuroi announced a crossover plan between Gamera and Godzilla, along with a plan to reboot \"Daimajin\". The company approached Toho to achieve it, however the latter turned down the offer and Kadokawa therefore produced \"Gamera the Brave\" instead as Toho temporary ceased Godzilla productions after \"\". Zedus, the main antagonist of the 2006 film was intentionally designed to resemble Toho monsters such as Varan and Gorosaurus, TriStar Pictures' Godzilla, and it notably resembles both Toho's Godzilla and Jirahs, the Godzilla-based kaiju from \"Ultraman\". Shogo Tomiyama was aware of the demand for the crossover, however clarified it lacked merits for filmmakers. Additionally, Shusuke Kaneko has also expressed his interest in producing a crossover.\nIn 2023, the Netflix series \"Gamera Rebirth\" was directed by Hiroyuki Seshita who previously directed the anime Godzilla trilogy. This time, Toho instead proposed an offer for a crossover due to a large number of requests from players of the mobile game \"Godzilla Battle Line\", and an official collaboration between the Netflix series and the mobile game was made where Seshita's incarnation of Godzilla was chosen for the key art, and Gamera and Gyaos () and Guiron appeared in the game as playable characters, followed by Showa incarnations of Gamera and Gyaos.\nAdditionally, Masaaki Tezuka once suggested using Gamera instead of the aforementioned Kamoebas () for the 2003 film ', and the novelization of the anime Godzilla trilogy by Hiroyuki Seshita, who later directed \"Gamera Rebirth\", made a possible reference to Kamoebas in the 2003 film and Gamera as the \"Kamoebas IV\" who was slain by Godzilla. Additionally. Gamera was at one point considered to appear in the 2007 video game ' while the 1999 video game \"Gamera Dream Battle\" was able to connect to \"Mothra Dream Battle\" in which Mothra and King Ghidorah appeared as playable characters.\nGamera's voice effect was used in \"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah\", and Gamera was represented within a concept art of ', and additional Godzilla productions, such as ', aforementioned series (the anime Godzilla trilogy and MonsterVerse), and \"\", have presumed references to Gamera. Atelier Koganemushi, who had produced a puppetry show which involved Gamera, Godzilla, King Ghidorah, Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and additional characters from different franchises, later produced the \"Godziban\" series, and had sporadically introduced Gamera references into the series.\nGamera and Godzilla and other characters from respective and related franchises (including Daimajin and Yokai) co-appeared in several exoteric productions and events, and some of them directly involved stakeholders from both franchises. In Showa, these characters had been featured together and interacted each other on multiple occasions on magazines. Additional cases include \"Dr. Slump\" and \"Dragon Ball\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Urusei Yatsura\", \"Daicon III and IV Opening Animations\", \"MegaTokyo\", \"City Shrouded in Shadow\", \"GigaBash\", \"Robot Chicken\", \"The Slammie Brothers vs. Godzilla and Gamera\", \"USO Makoto Y\u014dkai Hyaku Monogatari\", miscellaneous comics, stage and puppetry shows, and television shows ()()().\nSeveral franchises such as the aforementioned \"Dr. Slump\", \"Detective Conan\", \"Sailor Moon SuperS\", and \"Jumbo Monster GOMERA\" have characters with the names \"Gamera\" and \"Godzilla\". There had also been various toy merchandises, generally refereed as , literally meaning \"counterfeit\" (), based on various tokusatsu characters by major studios including \"Gamera\" and \"Godzilla\" and \"Ultraman\" franchises. In 2005, Shusuke Kaneko directed the 11th episode on \"Ultraman Max\", choosing to include a scene of children playing with toys of Gamera and Godzilla as a reference to the films he had directed in both franchises. Ayako Fujitani also made an appearance as a guest in the episode. On the other hand, Kaneko's attempt to make Gamera to appear in his live-film adaptation of \"Minna Agechau\" (1985), which originally intended to involve Kazunori Ito and use the aforementioned , and Shinji Higuchi indirectly participated in. The film included various vulgar references to classic characters such as Godzilla, King Ghidorah, Mother of Ultra, \"Indiana Jones\", and below-mentioned Bruce Lee, however Tokuma Shoten turned this down while using Mother of Ultra eventually resulted in Kaneko's connections with Tsuburaya Production, and influenced productions of \"The Samurai\" (), and the below-mentioned scrapped \"Ultra Q\" project and \"Ultraman Max\", whose productions are related to the Heisei Gamera trilogy.\nThe 1998 Shochiku film \"Giant Monsters Appear in Tokyo\" represented off-screen appearances of two battling kaiju, the \"jet-flying turtle appeared on Fukuoka\" and the \"80 meters tall, fire-breathing, bipedal, carnivorous dinosaur-like lizard appeared on the port of Tokyo Bay\", clearly referencing Gamera in \"\" and Godzilla in \"The Return of Godzilla\" where several casts from the Heisei Gamera Trilogy such as Hirotar\u014d Honda and Tomorowo Taguchi appeared in the film.\nProductions.\nDaiei Film produced and distributed films that played major roles in forming tokusatsu and kaiju genre under Masaichi Nagata, one of creators of Gamera. After the dissolution of the Dai Nippon Film following the end of the World War II, Nagata, who was the chief founder and the vice president of Dai Nippon Film, instead launched a new company Daiei Film. Since then, Nagata emphasized to develop diverse tokusatsu productions as one of core strategies, ranging from historical drama to disaster, thriller, classic novels, romance, horror, fantasy, science fiction, and so on. These films especially themed wars, historical events, natural and animal disasters, extraterrestrial life, y\u014dkai, ghost, kaijin such as \"Tetsu no tsume\" (1951), and kaiju.\nNagata's intentions made the company to distribute foreign films, such as Disney productions due to Masaichi's connections with Walt Disney, and to produce innovative productions, resulting in the productions of the first post-war science fiction tokusatsu films in Japan; \"The Rainbow Man\" and \"The Invisible Man Appears\" in 1949. Eiji Tsuburaya, who had repeatedly associated with Masaichi Nagata since early 1930s, and Sadamasa Arikawa and Shuzaburo Araki participated in these and other Daiei productions before the signing of the Six-Company Agreement in 1953 (which was also led by Masaichi), and they intended to join Daiei Film with the 1949 films after Tsuburaya's exile from Toho because of the 1948 purge due to his involvements in war propaganda, and Arikawa and Araki's voluntary resignations after Toho strikes. However, Tsuburaya was rather dissatisfied with the tokusatsu production (or effects) in \"The Invisible Man Appears\" (or their attempts to join the company didn't materialize), and eventually didn't join Daiei Film. The three later participated in \"Godzilla\" and various other Toho tokusatsu productions. The 2020 biopic \"Nezura 1964\" ambiguously portrayed Tsuburaya's association with Daiei Film before \"Gamera\". Additionally, various members among Tsuburaya's coworkers and students from \"Godzilla\" and other productions later participated in \"Gamera\" and \"Daimajin\" and other Daiei productions.\nDaiei Film, along with its own productions of various tokusatsu films, including Gamera-related \"Warning from Space\" (1956) and the first Daiei kaiju film \"The Whale God\" (1962), also distributed the re-released edition of \"King Kong\" in 1952, making it the first post-war release of monster movies in Japan, and also distributed \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" in Japan in 1954, and these presumably influenced the productions of the 1954 film \"Godzilla\" by Toho and Daiei Film's own tokusatsu productions including the \"Gamera\" franchise.\nDue to the Six-Company Agreement, other companies, including Masaichi's Daiei Film itself, could not \"openly\" use tokusatsu techniques and staffs and actors of Toho. However, according to Keiz\u014d Murase, Eiji Tsuburaya's teams were secretly appointed for \"\" by Nikkatsu and \"The X from Outer Space\" by Shochiku, and other subsequent productions, and Toho's techniques were secretly used in these films. For \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\", some crews who had previously participated in \"Godzilla\" and other Toho kaiju films joined its production despite the agreement, and Eiji Tsuburaya gave a tacit approval to their actions. However, while there had been suggestions to seek Tsuburaya's help, even by an executive who is a friend of the father of Yonejiro Saito and Tsuburaya, filmmakers intentionally avoided receiving any technological assistances from Tsuburaya for the \"Gamera\" franchise to differentiate their productions from Toho, and produced \"Gamera\" and other tokusatsu films without Toho-based techniques, choices of materials, direction, and so on.\nSuccesses of \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" and \"Gamera vs. Barugon\" resulted in sudden increases of non-Toho kaiju productions, such as afroementioned \"\" and \"The X from Outer Space\". Film makers were suspicious of Tsuburaya's involvements to these non-Daiei productions despite the Six-Company Agreement because of sudden increases in non-Toho kaiju productions after Gamera films, despite the only non-Toho tokusatsu film of that time before the 1965 Gamera film to feature gigantic creature was Daiei Film's \"The Whale God\" (\"Killer Whale\") in 1962.\nShowa Gamera films, especially since \"Gamera vs. Gyaos\", were intended to appeal to children. This was to deal with budgetary problems and the Six-Company Agreement to differentiate from the \"Godzilla\" franchise. Due to the agreement and the direction to differentiate from Toho, Gamera's characteristics such as to breathe traditional non-atomic fire, occasional quadrupedalism along with his foes and brutal and animalistic fight scenes, his personality as both a friendly creature and a hero rather than Godzilla's theme to represent a \"god of destruction\". Material choices for suits and miniature models were devised to avoid duplicates with the Toho productions. Plots of Showa Gamera films intentionally avoided to focus on \"standards\" of kaiju films by Toho, such as the JSDF and other military forces, weapons, scientific explanations, destructions of urban areas, and so on. Instead, subsequent films since \"Gamera vs. Viras\" featured simple, childish, and eccentric plots for young audiences. In the Showa films, children play significant roles with the eccentric ideas presented, and children, unlike adults, always believe in Gamera, partially due to Noriaki Yuasa's antithesis against war and political propaganda and nationalism. This direction was initially decided because a number of children watching \"Gamera vs. Barugon\" got bored with the plot and left their seats, and also to deal with drastically decreased budgets due to the financial situation of Daiei Film; the budget of \"Gamera vs. Viras\" was \u00a524\u00a0million compared to budgets of \"Gamera vs. Barugon\" (\u00a580\u00a0million) and \"Gamera vs. Gyaos\" (\u00a560\u00a0million), with limitations of further elements such as designs and abilities of monsters, amounts of special effects, destructions of urban areas, cancellations of new monsters and battle scenes, limited locations, and so on.\nA number of new tokusatsu expertise were obtained through productions of Showa Gamera films to compensate for lack of resources and avoiding Toho-based techniques and materials, however those were lost due to the bankruptcy of the company. Thr production of the Heisei trilogy relied on expertise from various other tokusatsu productions, especially Tsuburaya Production's \"Ultraman\" franchise, while \"Ultraman 80\" by Noriaki Yuasa himself was the most influential of those, and some of Gamera expertises were used for aforementioned \"Daigoro vs. Goliath\" (1972) and \"Fireman\" (1973) by Tsuburaya.\nAs below mentioned, diminished public recognition of the franchise due to repeated hiatuses in productions and limited marketing, limited productions of associated products and their revenues, and limited media attentions, along with misconceptions among new audience segments, such as Gamera being a cheap, \"corny\", and inferior imitation of Godzilla and Gamera belonging to the Toho franchise, might have negatively affected box office results of the post-Daiei productions by Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation. Additionally, negative reactions by global audiences towards the franchise in comparison to the Toho franchise were also presumably influenced by the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".\nShusuke Kaneko, and Shinji Higuchi, who have previously participated in \"The Return of Godzilla\", respectively directed \"GMK\" and \"Shin Godzilla\" where Kaneko and Kazunori Ito originally wanted to take the 1992 film \"Godzilla vs. Mothra\" (the relationship between Mothra and Shobijin might have influenced the depictions of Gamera and Asagi Kusanagi in the Heisei Gamera trilogy), however Kaneko and Ito and Higuchi's preferences of \"Godzilla\" and other Toho productions, along with their disfavor of Gamera and dissatisfactions for the Heisei Godzilla continuity resulted in controversial outcomes of the Heisei trilogy, while Kaneko had expressed his concern and unpleasantness towards tokusatsu fans who criticize the Godzilla continuity in comparison to the Heisei Gamera trilogy.\nDistributions and releases.\nOne of factors restricted revenues from Daiei Film productions was its weak distribution systems including limited theater chains; releases of Daiei Film productions relied on movie theatres by Toho, Shochiku, and Toei Company. Daiei Film later launched the to gain directly managing movie theaters, however the attempt failed as feasible properties were already acquired by other companies, further accelerating financial difficulties of Daiei Film. The deterioration of the company including its distribution system was partially caused by rather prodigal operations by Masaichi Nagata; his extensive achievements granted him the title \"Father of the cinema\", however his career ironically formed a dictatorial company culture which even restricted executives, and Noriaki Yuasa described Hidemasa Nagata being \"too artistic\" to run a company. On the other hand, it was also Masaichi who pushed ahead to produce \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" and decided to make Gamera a heroic and friendly figure, and Masaichi's authority rather compulsively overturned overall negative pre-release reviews of the 1965 film within Daiei Film as he complimented it, and the first Gamera film indeed succussed where even Yuasa anticipated it to fail since the beginning and couldn't understand why it didn't flop. Additionally, Masaichi's attempt to save the declining Japanese film industry itself resulted in the prosperity of \"kaiju\" and \"tokusatsu\" genres aimed for global markets, while their rising competitors (television industry) was also ironically boosted by the Kaiju Booms ()() which were influenced by Masaichi himself's efforts to rescue the industry, influences from \"Gamera\" and \"Godzilla\" franchises including involvements of Eiji Tsuburaya and other participants from both franchises, along with a recession of the Japanese economy back then.\nEver since the last Daiei Film installment \"Gamera vs. Zigra\" was distributed by Dainichi Eihai for financial reasons, Daiei productions by Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation have always relied on other companies to distribute, further restricting their productions and revenues. The Heisei trilogy was distributed by Toho as Daiei Film lost its theater chains after its bankruptcy. However, the trilogy was distributed by Toho Western Films unlike \"Godzilla\" films, and the number of movie theatres for the trilogy was much smaller than \"Godzilla\" films, further reducing potential box office results. However, Sh\u014dgo Tomiyama noted that he did not perceive the \"Gamera\" franchise as a rival, but was instead happy to see its revival along with the \"Godzilla\" franchise which was the sole support the kaiju genre received for years. Filming of \"Gamera: Guardian of the Universe\" was also affected by the 1994 film \"Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla\" as both films were filmed in Fukuoka.\nGlobal distributions of videos of the franchise was also affected by the \"Godzilla\" franchise. For financial reasons, Daiei avoided the market in the United States and instead focused more on European countries to decrease competition with Toho productions. Foreign cast members became increasingly well-represented due to requests from European buyers; however, these buyers also requested to avoid hiring black cast members. Daiei Film obliged, though some criticized Daiei Film for this decision. On the other hand, its increasingly childish direction along with involving foreign cast members were also prompted by the Japanese Film Export Promotion Association under the Japanese government where Daiei Film's Masaichi Nagata contributed in its establishment, and governmental policy to export tokusatsu films to the global market also boosted serializations of \"Gamera\" and \"Daimajin\" franchises. \"Gamera\" franchise's child-friendly directions, limited productions, and much smaller global expansions than the \"Godzilla\" franchise, presumably restricted public recognition of the Daiei franchise and established inferior public impressions on it globally to the Toho productions.\nAfter the bankruptcy of Daiei Film, the franchise increased its efforts avoid direct competition against the \"Godzilla\" franchise, including the Heisei trilogy, and \"\" by Tokuma Shoten and \"Gamera the Brave\" by Kadokawa were released in 1980 and 2006 respectively because Toho temporary ceased producing Godzilla films due to declined box office results. While the franchise was not rebooted after the 1980 film, there also existed scrapped projects in early 1990s prior to the Heisei trilogy, where the Heisei Godzilla continuity had been continuously developed since \"Godzilla vs. Biollante\" (1989). After the commercial failure of the 2006 film, which was originally launched as a proposal for a crossover with Godzilla in 2002, Kadokawa cancelled various projects, including its sequels, anime production(s), \"Gamera 3D\", and reboot attempt(s) in 2010s, and instead released a short film for the 50th anniversary of the franchise in 2015; MonsterVerse by Legendary Pictures (which was at one point a Gamera project \"Gamera 3D\") began in 2014, and subsequent Godzilla productions were continuously developed among theatrical releases and streaming media. \"Shin Godzilla\" and the anime Godzilla trilogy were directed by filmmakers who have either previously or subsequently participated in Gamera productions. \"Gamera Rebirth\" was released on Netflix in 2023 after \"Godzilla Singular Point\" in 2021.\nParticipants.\nWhile Eiji Tsuburaya and Sadamasa Arikawa and Shuzaburo Araki eventually didn't join Daiei Film, a number of Tsuburaya's coworkers and students, who had previously participated in \"Godzilla\" and various other Toho productions, participated in \"Gamera\" and \"Daimajin\" and other Daiei productions, and a number of staffs involved in \"Gamera\" productions later participated in various \"Godzilla\" and \"Ultraman\" productions, including \"Gamera the Brave\" and \"Ultraman Tiga\" (and \"Digimon Tamers\") reusing the same early script for \"\".\nA number of crews and filmmakers, actors, voice actors, extras, and suit actors have participated in both and related franchises (including other Tsuburaya works). Keiz\u014d Murase and Masao Yagi and Toru Suzuki and Michio Mikami, who have previously participated in \"Godzilla\" and other Toho kaiju films and worked with Eiji Tsuburaya, and Akira Takahashi and Nori Maezawa founded the tokusatsu modelling company the Ex Productions after \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\". Murase also founded another company 20Twenty afterward. These companies contributed in various tokusatsu productions including \"Gamera\" and \"Daimajin\", and non-Daiei franchises by Tsuburaya such as \"Godzilla\" and its related \"Zone Fighter\", \"Ultraman\", \"Kamen Rider\", and so on.\nP Productions.\nAs aforementioned, there have been contradicting theories regards the original conceptor of Gamera where even Noriaki Yuasa and Niisan Takahashi and Yonejiro Saito weren't truly aware of. Tomio Sagisu, the founder of P Productions, had repeatedly participated in Daiei Film productions most notably \"The Whale God\" and \"Buddha\" (). Sagisu claimed that his 1962 demo reel for the project \"STOP Series\", could be the original idea of Daiei's Gamera. Sagisu initially showed the demo reel to his teacher Eiji Tsuburaya, who had repeatedly associated with Masaichi Nagata and Daiei Film before \"Gamera\". In response to this, Toho paid attention to Sagisu's idea, and the company later brought the project to Fuji Television, however \"STOP Series\" was eventually cancelled. Later, Sagisu instead brought the reel to Daiei Film to launch a project, and believed that this eventually became the prototype of Gamera. Sagisu once inquired Yonesaburo Tsukiji, another student of Tsuburaya and participated in both \"Nezura\" and \"Gamera\", however Tsukiji didn't agree with Sagisu's claim and instead noted Hidemasa Nagata as the inventor.\nThere is also a testimony about the development of Gamera by the designer Akira Inoue, which might not entirely correspond with Sagisu's claim; Inoue designed over 50 different designs of Gamera for the 1965 film, including drastically different ones from the final version, such as a limb-less monster to crawl on the ground like a centipede.\nDespite this, P Productions and Daiei Film retained a tie and shared various crews from productions including the \"Gamera\" franchise where Eiji Tsuburaya's co-woker and student from Daiei Film (Takayama and Watanabe) were two of founders of P Productions. Additionally, Shinsuke Kojima and Tamotsu Taga and others abandoned Daiei Film, which was already at the brink of bankruptcy and was in a chaotic state, and joined P Production after the failure and the aftermaths of \"Nezura\", such as a labor dispute, multiple hygiene issues involving neighborhoods resulted in interventions from public health centres, mass mortality of rats, and near-fatal dust mite allergy on Michio Mikami and others. These troubles were caused by using live rats (akin to \"Dagora\" which used a live octopus) presumably due to the restraints from the Six-Company Agreement led by Masaichi Nagata himself; as aforementioned, Daiei Film used live animals for these pre-Gamera projects, presumably to avoid Toho-based styles and techniques to deal with the inter-company agreement, forcing them to change the direction to the more traditional, suit-acting character (Gamera).\nThanks to the success of the \"Gamera\" franchise, which was the successor of \"Dagora\" and \"Nezura\", Daiei Film's fiscal condition was temporary improved, and the turtle kaiju solely supported the company and its subcontractors. Crews of \"Gamera\" and other Daiei productions, even including Noriaki Yuasa and Niisan Takahashi and Shunsuke Kikuchi and Toru Matoba, later participated in projects by P Productions since before the 1968 incidents on P Productions, and increased their involvements afterward where P Productions was no longer able to produce tokusatsu productions by itself and was forced to make its staffs as contract employees, and crews from P Productions projects later joined \"Gamera\" films.\nThe Daiei-based P Productions founders, Ryosaku Takayama and Yoshio Watanabe, continuously worked for both Daiei Film and P Productions including \"Gamera\", \"Daimajin\", \"Yokai Monsters\", and Sagisu-related productions such as \"The Whale God\" and \"Buddha\" (). Additionally, aforementioned former Daiei Film crews, who once abandoned the near-bankrupt and disoriented Daiei Film for P Productions because of \"Nezura\", later participated in \"Gamera\" and other Daiei productions. For instance, Tamotsu Taga, along with Noriaki Yuasa and other \"Gamera\" staffs and crews from P Productions such as Shigeru Shinohara, co-participated in projects such as ones by Daiei TV-Film (), and \"\" after the bankruptcy of Daiei Film.\nShir\u014d Sagisu, the son of Tomio and the current owner of the company, has also participated in several Daiei TV-Film dramas after the bankruptcy of Daiei Film, and Shir\u014d, Hideaki Anno, and Shinji Higuchi co-participated in Toho and Tsuburaya Production projects, which have been influenced by the \"Gamera\" franchise; \"Shin Godzilla\", \"Shin Ultraman\", \"Attack on Titan\", the \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" franchise, and the \"Gridman\" franchise. Shir\u014d also introduced Higuchi to the pianist Junko Miyagi () during the production of \"\" because Miyagi is also a fan of the Heisei Gamera trilogy.\nHistory.\nThe \"Gamera\" film series is broken into three different eras, each reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all \"kaiju eiga\" (monster movies) in Japan. The names of the three eras refer to the Japanese emperor during production: the Sh\u014dwa era, the Heisei era, and the Reiwa era.\nSince original 1965 film production and merchandising budgets of each film have been confined due to financial situations of Daiei Film, Tokuma Shoten, and Kadokawa Corporation respectively, resulting in repeated copyright transfers of Daiei properties and limited productions and distributions overall, including cancellations of various projects and failed global expansions despite frequently featuring foreign casts in Sh\u014dwa films and Nagata's own contributions to the prosperity of the genre by its export. Because of further declining public recognition of the character due to years of inactivity of the franchise and limited advertising expenses and media attentions, Gamera's heroic concept and irrelevance from \"Godzilla\" franchise were \"forgotten\", and new audience segments often viewed him as a mere, \"corny\" (as a turtle) and \"childish\" imitation of Godzilla. This, along with other factors such as the loss of Daiei theater chains, has negatively affected on box office results and made it more difficult for Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation to restore the series along with other Daiei tokusatsu franchises such as \"Daimajin\" and \"Yokai Monsters\", especially the \"Daimajin\" which requires more budgets due to life-sized props.\nThere have been several major hiatus in productions: one between \"Gamera vs. Zigra\" in 1971 and ' in 1980, followed by ' in 1995, \"\" in 1999 followed by \"Gamera the Brave\" in 2006 and \"Gamera Rebirth\" in 2023.\nThe \"Daimajin\", another iconic tokusatsu character by Daiei Film, was originally designed to be an antagonist for the second film, and its concept was fed back into both Daimajin and Barugon, the foe in the 1966 film \"Gamera vs. Barugon\", and was instead yielded through Daimajin. \"Gamera vs. Barugon\" was also an exception among the Showa films; not being directed by Noriaki Yuasa while it was the only installment to appoint his father Hikaru Hoshi, didn't involve child actors, and didn't target child audiences. After the success of the first film, it became the first colored and the most expensive Showa installment, yet its plot made young audiences got bored and shaped the subsequent direction of the franchise.\nDaiei's y\u014dkai films most notably the \"Yokai Monsters\" were also launched due to the success of the \"Gamera\" franchise, and productions of them and related later films such as \"\" were largely influenced by \"Gamera\" and \"Daimajin\" series. Collaborations of the Daiei films with Shigeru Mizuki and Kazuo Umezu started because of Daiei's y\u014dkai films and formed the \"Y\u014dkai Boom\" together, resulted in minor crossovers between Gamera and Daimajin and Shigeru Mizuki's \"GeGeGe no Kitar\u014d\" series and Hiroshi Aramata's Yasunori Kat\u014d from \"Teito Monogatari\".\nDaiei Film, which was already at the brink of bankruptcy, somewhat recovered due to the unexpected success of the 1965 film, which was considered to be \"a mere rehash of Godzilla\", \"cheap\", \"being forced on Noriaki Yuasa as no one wanted\", and \"destined to flop\", and launched the \"Daimajin\" and the \"Yokai Monsters\", and these tokusatsu franchises gained popularity despite limited and continuously decreasing budgets and the declines of the First Kaiju Boom and domestic film industries (partially due to the success of the \"Gamera\" franchise) and the arise of the more affordable \"Yokai Boom\". Serializations of \"Gamera\" and \"Daimajin\" franchises were also promoted as the Japanese government valued exportations of tokusatsu productions to the global markets to acquire foreign currencies. \"Gamera vs. Viras\" was originally considered as the last Showa production, however the franchise was further continued in response to its popularity.\nThere had been several failed attempts to reboot the franchise after ' (1980), and the Heisei trilogy originally started as an attempt to revive either (or both of) the \"Daimajin\" and the \"Yokai Monsters\" by Tokuma Shoten, however the projects faced budgetary problems, and surveys revealed higher popularity of \"Gamera\" instead, while Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa Corporation also aimed to revive the Daimajin along with the Gamera franchise respectively; one in the late 1990s along with the Heisei Gamera Trilogy by starring Steven Seagal, the father of Ayako Fujitani who played Asagi Kusanagi, the human protagonist of the trilogy, and another by Takashi Miike in late 2000s along with \"Gamera the Brave\" which was eventually redeveloped into \"Daimajin Kanon\", and Miike made the Daimajin to appear in the 2018 film ' where Gamera also made a cameo appearance within its spin-off novelization.\nDaiei Film's decay.\nDaiei Film was once one of leading film studios in Japan and contributed in the golden era of the Japanese cinema, with its president and one of Gamera's creator Masaichi Nagata was an influential figure not only among the film industry but also other fields including the political circles. However, at the time when \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" was released, economic clout of the company was already significantly declining, and the original \"Gamera\" film and Daiei Film's first kaiju production \"The Whale God\" (1962) were forced to produced as black-and-white film for budgetary constraints despite they were produced after the first colored tokusatsu film in Japan, \"Warning from Space\" (1956) which bears connections with the \"Gamera\" franchise in their productions.\nNagata's extensive achievements shaped his profligate and autocratic management of Daiei Film to prioritize production-first philosophy, and this resulted in major weaknesses of the company and stagnations of its productions, such as its weak distribution systems. On the other hand, the Japanese film industry itself (even including the \"Godzilla\" franchise) was declining in general, and about the half of entire movie theaters in Japan were closed. This was mostly due to the competition against the television industry, which was boosted by several factors such as the aforementioned \"Kaiju Booms\" ()() itself ironically especially \"Ultra Q\" and \"Ultraman\" franchises by below-mentioned Eiji Tsuburaya himself and other figures related to \"Gamera\" and \"Godzilla\" and related productions, the 1964 Summer Olympics, and an economic stagnation of the nation. Additionally, Nagata's intention to explore monster films, and his attempt to save the film industry resulted in expansions of kaiju and tokusatsu genres, however this also contributed in the launching of the \"Kaiju Booms\" which ironically supported the television industry. As a background of these social phenomena (booms), a governmental association was established as the result of Nagata's efforts for the sake of the film industry, and the Japanese government encouraged and supported productions of kaiju and tokusatsu works to export to the global markets to obtain foreign currencies.\nHowever, while Daiei and Toho were leading the genres, increased competitions, and depletions of ideas and resources were inevitable because of abrupt entries of other major film studios into the genres, and the two \"Kaiju Booms\" including the \"Godzilla\" series didn't last long also due to the shortage of ideas, repercussions from receiving tax-based funds from the association (this resulted in the arise of the aforementioned, more cost-effective \"Yokai Boom\"), and additional factors such as declines of the nation's economy and the film industry, 1970s energy crisis, and so on. \"Gamera\" and \"Daimajin\" didn't play major roles for the Second Kaiju Boom, as the company faced the bankruptcy shortly after \"Gamera vs. Zigra\" in 1971, at the beginning of the boom.\nThere had been additional factors that damaged Daiei Film back then, such as producing three \"Daimajin\" films within the same year (1966) which consequently hindered the franchise, resignations of experienced staffs (this also influenced productions of subsequent films especially the \"Gamera\" franchise), losing leading stars particularly Nagata's relative Ichikawa Raiz\u014d VIII from a colorectal cancer, and so on. Furthermore, the aforementioned Six-Company Agreement (Five-Company Agreement) led by Nagata himself presumably affected the productions of \"Dagora\" and \"Nezura\" to avoid Toho-based tokusatsu techniques, and the latter caused further resignations of employees due to serious hygiene and health and animal welfare issues. The agreement also restrained careers of various actors and actresses, and Taro Marui eventually committed a suicide six months after his appearance in \"Gamera vs. Gyaos\".\nAccording to Noriaki Yuasa, Daiei Film \"borrowed more money\" from Niisan Takahashi than anyone else, but the company eventually couldn't reimburse to him, and Takahashi also didn't receive some of his wages due to his nonparticipation in the Writers Guild of Japan. After the company's bankruptcy, Takahashi visited Masaichi Nagata and received all rights to Gamera. However, Tokuma Shoten didn't inform the production of the 1995 film \"\" to Takahashi, and the company reneged the agreement between Takahashi and Nagata regards the rights to Gamera, declaring that the company is independent from Daiei Film and thus doesn't accept Nagata's treaty. Takahashi was highly dissatisfied with this decision, and he severed ties with all stakeholders, damaging the friendship with Yuasa in the aftermath. Takahashi independently developed a script to produce a new film, which later became the basis of the novel \"Gamera vs. Phoenix\" (1995).\nThe \"Gamera\" franchise solely supported Daiei Film and its subcontractors until the 1971 bankruptcy. However, various materials including kaiju suits and models and props were lost with the company, resulting in the poor production of \"\" and limited amounts of publications and exhibitions. There exist contradicting testimonies about the actual cause of this; Noriaki Yuasa destroyed them due to his frustration and distress when he heard about the bankruptcy of the company, or by a riot among employees. The demise of the company also triggered confusions and losses of negative prints and other materials, resulting in changes in the running time of \"Gamera vs. Viras\" for video and DVD releases.\nAll villainous monsters since \"Gamera vs. Viras\" (Viras, Guiron, Jiger, Zigra) received their names from public submissions, and this was to draw public attention to compensate for limited advertising expenses. Concepts for monsters' designs and abilities were also restricted due to budgets, cancellations of new monsters, decreased destructions of urban areas, and film crews focused more on brutal melee fights to compensate for limited amounts of special effects, although the franchise occasionally received global compliments for its brutalness, such as Guiron beheading a Space Gyaos in \"Gamera vs. Guiron\". In the 1992 Gamera-themed television special, its presenter commented as \"Gamera was not enduring his enemies but budgets\".\nThe plot of \"Gamera vs. Zigra\", the last film of the Showa continuity, was particularly poor in consistency and logics due to the confusion of the company prior to its bankruptcy. Since the previous film \"Gamera vs. Jiger\" (1970), Noriaki Yuasa was forced to become a contract director without overtime pay, impoverishments of employees and resources became evident, and production systems were disrupted due to increased labor negotiations. Niisan Takahashi also didn't receive some of his wages, and the company couldn't pay back debts to him. In the 1970 film, one of kaiju battles were also eventually scrapped due to budgetary and schedule limitations. According to Yuasa, all staffs were stressed out for their fears of bankruptcy, and one of lighting staffs died from an intracranial hemorrhage shortly after the completion of \"Gamera vs. Jiger\".\n\"\" (1980), the first installment by Tokuma Shoten, almost exclusively relied on stock footages from previous films. The direction to re-edit stock footages of former films was also influenced by budgetary and schedule problems, along with the aforementioned loss of suits and models by either Yuasa or staffs, and the success of the 1979 \"Ultraman\" video by Akio Jissoji (), which contributed in the revival of the Tsuburaya Productions franchise. Its box office result was not excellent partially due to the timing; kaiju genre in general stagnated between late 1970s and early 1980s where Toho ceased producing Godzilla films because of the box office result of \"Terror of Mechagodzilla\" in 1975. The 1980 film also faced several other conditions to restrict its production, such as the music copyright, resulting in the lack of previous music materials including the \"Gamera March\".\nThe Heisei trilogy had greatly affected the entire tokusatsu genre afterward, while various other tokusatsu productions significantly influenced its production to compensate for the loss of tokusatsu expertise obtained from Showa Gamera films due to the collapse of Daiei Film, especially Noriaki Yuasa himself's \"Ultraman 80\" (1980) after his \"Gamera\" career in Daiei, along with other \"Ultraman\" and \"Ultra Q\" series, \"Kamen Rider\", \"Choujyu Sentai Liveman\", \"Gridman the Hyper Agent\", \"Gunhed\", and many others. Some of Gamera expertise were instead used for Tsuburaya Production's \"Daigoro vs. Goliath\" (1972) and \"Fireman\" (1973), while the plot of the former bears similarities to the aforementioned \"Konaka Gamera\" script.\nRevenues of Daiei Film productions were repeatedly restricted due to lack of exclusive movie theaters, and ever since \"Gamera vs. Zigra\" which was co-distributed with Nikkatsu due to the financial problems and was released several months prior to the bankrupt, the franchise has always relied on co-distributions as Daiei Film lost its theater chains after its bankruptcy; the Heisei trilogy was done so by Toho, so as \"Gamera the Brave\" by Shochiku, and \"Gamera Rebirth\" by Netflix. \"The Great Yokai War\" and \"\" were also co-distributed by Shochiku and Toho. Heisei trilogy was distributed by Toho Western Films with much fewer theatres than \"Godzilla\" films, further declining box office results.\nFinancial vulnerability resulted in repeated avoidances from direct competitions against the \"Godzilla\" franchise, although there had been failed attempts to make a crossover in 1990s and 2002, leading to the production of \"Gamera the Brave\" in 2006 due to Toho's temporal pause of Godzilla film productions since \"\" while both films shared some of crews.\nInfluences of the Heisei Trilogy.\nThe Heisei Trilogy by Shusuke Kaneko, despite its limited budgets less than half of \"Godzilla\" films at that time, distributions, marketing, media attentions, and revenues, was highly acclaimed among audiences, partially because a number of hardcore kaiju (tokusatsu) fans at that time, including Kaneko and other crews themselves, were dissatisfied with the Heisei Godzilla continuity (although Kaneko instead condemned fans who unjustly treat those Godzilla films by comparing with the Gamera trilogy,) and filmmakers that they are often considered as one of best kaiju and tokusatsu productions ever made, and it greatly influenced entire tokusatsu genre afterward, including the \"Godzilla\" franchise but most notably on \"Ultraman\" and \"Kamen Rider\" franchises. However, there are pros and cons regarding the outcomes of the trilogy.\nContinuation of the series after \"\" was cancelled due to the overall box office results of the trilogy, partially due to diminished public recognition of the franchise and limited advertising expenses and limited distributions, and the struggle to produce sequels after depicting the titular heroic character as an unintentional threat to humanity in the 1999 film where the film plot such as a girl (child) to detest Gamera, and depictions of human casualties in the battles of Shibuya and Kyoto largely displeased Noriaki Yuasa and Niisan Takahashi and others; Yuasa criticized the trilogy and emphasized the importance to differentiate from Godzilla, and the draft by Shusuke Kaneko and Kazunori It\u014d for the sequel to portray Gamera to be a further threat was immediately turned down. According to Kazunori Ito, Daiei (Tokuma Shoten) absolutely disapproves a story beyond \"G3\", and the concepts of the cancelled \"G4\" was later reused for the 2003 independent film \"GAMERA 4-TRUTH\" by Shinpei Hayashiya.\nKaneko noted that he was at one point almost dismissed during the production of the 1995 film (and its production was at the brink of cancellation and was significantly delayed) due to considerable disagreements between Kaneko and It\u014d against executives and Showa staffs to depict Gamera as an intimidating-looking character being both an artificial and mechanical \"living robot\" and a threat to humanity without caring at all for humans, not even children, partially because Kaneko and Ito originally wanted to make the 1992 film \"Godzilla vs. Mothra\" instead of Gamera, and wanted to \"take revenge on with Gamera\" while the two were not delighted with the offer to produce Gamera films as they and Shinji Higuchi have always preferred Toho productions since their childhoods, and disliked and regarded the concept of Gamera being rather absurd and \"childish\", especially his ability to fly, his heroic concept as a protector of the humanity and affinity to children, child protagonists, and being a turtle.\nDuring the trilogy, Kaneko and Ito tried to exclude children completely from the plot, and also tried to depict human casualties by Gamera from the start, however executives and Showa staff didn't approve such ideas, and scenes to involve children were briefly inserted as an \"excuse\" to convince stakeholders although such scenes mostly depicted children to be helpless \"burdens\" unlike Showa films, and human casualties were not featured until \"\". The 1999 film instead situated a girl (child) named Ayana Hirasaka as one of central antagonists to detest Gamera, however she was again portrayed as a \"burden\" that her parents and pet cat named \"Iris\" were accidentally killed by Gamera because their evacuation from the battle between Gamera and a Gyaos was delayed due to Ayana's hospitalization, and she brings a mass destruction with her misdirected hatred for Gamera, and Gamera loses his right arm to save her. Especially the 1999 film intentionally avoided to appeal to child audiences, and the trilogy in general didn't contribute in increasing young audiences due to the difficulty of the plot, lack of points that children can empathize, and fearsome and gruesome scenes especially the destruction of Shibuya by Gamera caused family audiences to exit theaters because children started crying, while Kazunori Ito claimed that he dislikes to depict Gamera as the hero of children, and advocated that he refuses to make Gamera as a child-friendly hero, and making child audiences crying in fears is correct for kaiju films. The trilogy also triggered a misconception amongs new audience segments; Gamera as the character exclusively originates artificially, would sacrifice humans for the sake of the planet and nature, and turtles and tortoises (as normal organisms) don't exist (or went extinct) in the universes of the franchise. On the other hand, production of \"Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris\" was delayed and was intentionally designed as a horror because of box office results of 1995 and 1996 films, declined popularity of kaiju genre, and contrasting popularity of horror films among children at that time, including \"Ring\" and \"Ghosts at School\" () franchises which possess indirect connections with the \"Gamera\" franchise.\nThese aspects resulted in controversies, even among film crews of the Heisei trilogy, and a disapproval of the films, especially ', by a number of executives and Showa staff where Tokuma Shoten's revenues were also reduced due to the intercompany treaty with Nippon TV and Hakuhodo to achieve Kaneko's demand to increase budgets. Parts of two previous films in the trilogy, such as Gamera's origin as an artificial lifeform, the depiction of Gamera doing damage to Fukuoka in the 1995 film, and the \"Ultimate Plasma\" technique in ', were also controversial, but were eventually approved. The plot of ' and Gamera's depictions within the film partially followed those original ideas by Kaneko and It\u014d and Shinji Higuchi, while some of the originally cancelled depictions of Gamera for the 1995 film, such as his intimidating appearance and the ability to transform his arms into flippers during flights, were partially approved in '. As aforementioned, the 2003 independent film \"GAMERA 4-TRUTH\" partially re-used the plot of cancelled \"G4\" in which Gamera no longer protects humanity and causes tremendous collateral damages to exterminate remnants of Gyaos.\nThe 1999 documentary film \"GAMERA 1999\" by Hideaki Anno focused on ruptures among film crews, even between Kaneko and Higuchi. Kaneko described that the documentary film was a harassment by one of producers to target Kaneko by using Anno.\nIronically, the popularity of the Heisei trilogy indirectly triggered another setback for the franchise. While the box office returns of the trilogy and their revenues for Tokuma Shoten along with proceeds of merchandises targeting maniac audiences weren't particularly excellent due to aforementioned factors, the company was already struggling financially and it eventually disposed the copyrights of Daiei Film properties after the death of Yasuyoshi Tokuma in 2000. Sequels after \"\", potentially up to \"G5\" or more, were cancelled also due to the plot of \"G3\" for Gamera to act hazardous, and the plot of \"G4\" in which Gamera becomes a further threat.\nThe 2006 film \"Gamera the Brave\", which was released shortly after the death of Noriaki Yuasa and during a \"winter\" of kaiju genre (akin to the situations of ' and ') since ' in 2004, was the first reboot attempt by Kadokawa Corporation reusing the original script \"Konaka Gamera\" of the 1995 film. \"Gamera the Brave\" aimed to restore the basis of the franchise, with a slogan to \"return Gamera to children\" despite knowing the obvious popularity of the Heisei trilogy and the risk to fail by changing the direction. In the early stage of its production, Kadokawa carefully considered whether or not to expand the continuity of the trilogy, with either sequels, prequels, or side stories, or trilogy-esque different series, but eventually decided to change the direction to correct the course of the franchise and to avoid declines in the fan base which may result in the ultimate demise of the franchise and the character. It was also aimed to avoid \"standards\" of kaiju films akin to Showa films, partially due to a slump of kaiju genre itself (including the box office result of ') and the success of Heisei Mothra trilogy, and was also influenced by various other films including \"Daigoro vs. Goliath\" which is under the influences of Showa Gamera films, \"Helen the Baby Fox\", which also collaborated in distribution of the 2006 Gamera film, and \"\".\nHowever the 2006 film was generally not well-accepted by fans of the Heisei trilogy, but it was more welcomed by children and female audiences who were not specially targeted for the Heisei trilogy, resulting in the commercial failure of the film and cancellation of its sequels and other subsequent productions such as (one or two) anime(s) by Cartoon Network and Yoshitomo Yonetani, \"Gamera 3D\" by Yoshimitsu Banno, and one or more presumed reboot attempt(s) in 2010s, and the franchise was again in a period of inactivity until the 2023 Netflix series \"Gamera Rebirth\".{{refn|As aforementioned, the franchise after the bankruptcy of Daiei Film may have always tried to avoid direct competitions against \"Godzilla\" franchise, while Tokuma Shoten and Kadokawa's offers for a crossover were turned down in 1990s and 2002. Godzilla productions have been continuously released since 2014 where \"Gamera 3D\" was one of predecessors of MonsterVerse series by Legendary Pictures.|group=\"note\"}} Takashi Miike's \"Daimajin\" project was presumably cancelled due to the aftermath of \"Gamera the Brave\", while it resulted in the production of \"Daimajin Kanon\", and Daimajin appeared in Miike's \"\" (2021), along with Gamera in its spin-off novelization; Miike's \"The Great Yokai War\" (2005) also made brief references to Gamera.\nAccording to Shusuke Kaneko, Kadokawa \"doesn't offer\" him a new production despite him having new ideas for either \"G4\" or a new production; Kaneko brought a new idea to Kadokawa at one point, however \"Gamera Rebirth\" was already in production. Kaneko prefers villainous characters (by comparing Gamera and Godzilla), and one of his new ideas is Gamera's attack on the Pearl Harbor.\nShusuke Kaneko, who dislikes the concepts of Showa Gamera, is aware both of criticisms against him and the intention of \"Gamera the Brave\" (to recover the ideology of the franchise from the Heisei trilogy), however he in return openly disfavored the 2006 film and criticized its concept, describing it a commercial failure and a failed serialization, and instead advocated the superiority of his direction and the Heisei trilogy. Kaneko also believes \"Gamera the Brave\" and the aforementioned \"\" were responsible for the decline of the genre afterwards. On the other hand, Kazunori Ito, who also doesn't favor Showa Gamera films but prefers Toho productions, instead suggested to free the franchise from the \"curse\" of the Heisei trilogy after he watched the anniversary short film in 2015.\n\"Gamera Rebirth\", a tribute to Noriaki Yuasa, prioritized to be faithful to previous productions most notably the Showa films, and the series was produced with several policies about Gamera-human relationship, such as a reciprocal relationship between Gamera and children to protect each other, and to avoid human casualties by Gamera. While reducing battle scenes among urban areas is effective to reduce production costs, Gamera was also intentionally depicted to arrive at Tokyo in the first episode after most evacuations were completed, and he threw Gyaos and Jiger at open areas without people in early episodes{{refn|Showa Memorial Park in the first episode, and a riverbed of Tama River in the second episode.|group=\"note\"}} for this reason.\nAs aforementioned, artificial origins of kaiju in ' was highly controversial among Daiei and caused a misconception among audiences that the kaiju in the franchise has always been bioengineered creatures. This disagreement almost resulted in either a cancellation of the project or dismiss of Shusuke Kaneko while such setting was introduced by Kaneko and Kazunori Ito to rationalize illogical biology (flight capability) of Gamera.{{refn|The idea itself was either initially developed during the original scripts by Chiaki J. Konaka and Kazuya Konaka () and Yoshikazu Okada () and was reused by Kaneko and Ito (in the plot, one of scientists had an impression that the biology of Gyaos evokes biomechanical rather than natural), or Kaneko and Ito instead developed by themselves. According to Kaneko, he originally intended to depict humanity to weaponize monsters in the trilogy akin to \"Pacific Rim\".|group=\"note\"}} While the lore of the trilogy itself possessed supernatural aspects and introduced souls and a ghost in a manga side story, the franchise, along with Niisan Takahashi's 1995 novel \"Gamera vs. Phoenix\", subsequently increased supernatural depictions, including \"Gamera the Brave\" which was redeveloped from the \"Konaka Gamera\" script, such as mystic identities of kaiju, and to involve entities such as deities, spirits, yokai, souls, and ghosts. Within the aforementioned spinoff prequel of ', Gamera was emphasized as a divine beast based on her capabilities to fly and to breathe fire.\nAs aforementioned, there had been a number of hardcore kaiju and tokusatsu fans with their dissatisfactions with the Heisei Godzilla series back then, including Kaneko and Ito and Higuchi and some of the crews of the trilogy, and their demands for realistic and serious kaiju productions contributed in the direction of the trilogy and its positive receptions. However, this indirectly triggered an atmosphere among inconsiderate fans to use the Gamera trilogy to deny those Godzilla films, discomforting Kaneko instead.\nAdditionally, Tokuma Shoten's dispute with Niisan Takahashi regarding Gamera's legal rights and the production of \"\" indirectly damaged relationships between Takahashi and all other Daiei and Gamera stakeholders even including Noriaki Yuasa.\nSh\u014dwa era (1965\u20131980).\nDaiei film.\nThe film series began in 1965 with \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\", directed by Noriaki Yuasa, which is the first and only entry in the entire series to be shot in black-and-white due to budgetary constraints. To date, it is the only Showa \"Gamera\" film to be released theatrically in the United States; however, it was heavily edited, dubbed and retitled \"Gammera the Invincible\". In the United States, Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of UHF television stations featuring Saturday afternoon matin\u00e9e showcases such as \"Creature Double Feature\", and later in the 1990s, when five \"Gamera\" films were featured on the television series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". As aforementioned, \"Gamera\" franchise was often viewed as a cheap, inferior competitor to the \"Godzilla\" franchise especially by global audiences, and this tendency was presumably caused by not only its direction, limited productions and global distributions, but also due to the rather ridiculing atmosphere created with the television series.\nNiisan Takahashi later published a revised graphic novel of \"Gamera vs. Garasharp\" illustrated by Yutaka Kondo, known for his illustrations of kaiju and other fictional characters for the \"K\u016bs\u014d Kagaku Dokuhon\" series (which has featured both \"Gamera\" and \"Godzilla\" franchises and theoretical battles between the two titular characters), and it was recorded in the 1995 CD-ROM of \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\". This edition depicted Garasharp with a different appearance and the ability to emit electricity.\nTokuma Shoten.\nAfter Daiei was purchased by Tokuma Shoten in 1974, the new management wanted to produce another \"Gamera\" film, resulting in \"\" (also known as \"Space Monster Gamera\"), released in 1980. The filmmakers were forced to make the movie because of the contract for one more \"Gamera\" film that they owed to Daiei. Approximately one-third of \"Gamera: Super Monster\" is composed of stock footage from six of the previous seven films. Yuasa had Takahashi end the film by having Gamera be presumably killed by sacrificing his life to save Earth, while the later-published manga by Hurricane Ryu depicted that Gamera was artificially resurrected.\nThe attempt to reboot the franchise following \" (1980) didn't materialize.\nHeisei era (1995\u20132015).\nTokuma Shoten.\nIn the 1995 series reboot by Tokuma Shoten, \", three Gyaos are discovered on a remote island. The Japanese government discovers that they are all female and decides that since they are the last of their kind, they should be captured and studied. Meanwhile, scientists search for a moving atoll in the Pacific. When the atoll is located, small gems made of an unknown metal are discovered on it, as well as a stone that protrudes from the center of the island. The scientists take pictures and collect some of the strange gems, but the stone crumbles and the atoll moves off towards Japan at high speeds.

It was initially intended to be either a related story of the Heisei trilogy (either a sequel or prequel or side story, or a similar production),{{sfn|Mamiya|2006|p=34-35}} or a crossover with Godzilla, and the company also initiated reboot attempts of \"Daimajin\" and \"Yokai Monsters\", and the 2005 film \"The Great Yokai War\" was produced and Gamera was briefly mentioned in this film.

The franchise's direct and indirect influences extend among not only \"kaiju\" and \"tokusatsu\" genres, but also other entertainment industries; aside from the kaiju and yokai booms, Noriaki Yuasa also became one of the best hitmakers for domestic television industries at that time through his experiences of \"Gamera\" and other Daiei Film productions. Additionally, Yuasa and Niisan Takahashi and others had also engaged in non-Daiei tokusatsu productions including ones by the aforementioned P Productions, and contributed in the expansion of the \"Kaiju Booms\". In 2006, the franchise was chosen for special stamps () as one of representative properties among Japanese cinema.\nTodd McCarthy, in his review of \"Gamera: Guardian of the Universe\" for \"Variety\", wrote that \"Despite its horrific countenance and plated shell, Gamera remains one of the most likable of all movie monsters\". Brian Solomon of the website Bloody Disgusting ranked Gamera eighth on his list of \"Most Kick-Ass Giant Monsters in Movie History\". Gamera was also ranked eighth on Rick Mele of \"Sharp\"'s list of \"Greatest Giant Monsters in Movie History\". Chris Coffel of Film School Rejects wrote that \"I would argue that the \"Gamera\" franchise is better than the \"Godzilla\" franchise\", complimenting Gamera's turtle-like design and his affinity for children. Ken Watanabe, who played a major role in the aforementioned MonsterVerse series, noted that he preferred Gamera to Godzilla during his youth. Guillermo del Toro noted that \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" is one of favorite kaiju films, and he as a child often created his own kaiju and robots based on classic characters including Gamera and Barugon.\nSeveral authors such as Hiro Arikawa and Jeremy Robinson and K\u014dhei Horikoshi noted that Gamera is one of their favorite kaiju and had influences on their works such as \"Nemesis Saga\" and \"My Hero Academia\". Atsuji Yamamoto noted that Gamera was one of inspiration sources for his images of protagonists of his works. Hideaki Anno and Hajime Isayama also drew inspirations from Gyaos for their images of angels and titans in \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" and \"Attack on Titan\" respectively where Anno directed the 1999 documentary \"{{Ill|GAMERA 1999|ja|GAMERA1999}}\", and Shinji Higuchi directed the live-action film adaptation of \"Attack on Titan\". Several authors such as K\u014d Machida and Yoshiki Shibata () have also published original stories of Gyaos. {{Ill|Shinichiro Inoue|ja|\u4e95\u4e0a\u4f38\u4e00\u90ce}} and {{Ill|Toshio Miike|ja|\u4e09\u6c60\u654f\u592b}} participated in the 2020 disaster film \"Fukushima 50\", and Inoue clarified its style to insert a number of telops is an homage to the Heisei Gamera trilogy. Higuchi used expertise from the Gamera trilogy for his later works such as \"\", \"Sinking of Japan\", \"Shin Godzilla\", and so on.\nParticipants and resources from Showa Gamera films contributed in productions of kaiju productions by other film stuidios and companies, such as the 1967 South Korean-Japanese film \"Yongary, Monster from the Deep\", and the aforementioned \"Daigoro vs. Goliath\" (1972) and \"Fireman\" (1973) by Tsuburaya Productions.\nThe Heisei Gamera Trilogy is widely applauded both by film makers and audiences in Japan, and Keiichi Hasegawa remarked that it had a great impact on entire tokusatsu genre afterwards especially the \"Ultraman\" and the \"Kamen Rider\" franchises,{{refn|According to Hasegawa, subsequent \"Ultraman\" and \"Kamen Rider\" productions would have been different if it were not for the Heisei Gamera trilogy.|group=\"note\"}} including various references, and several important tokusatsu techniques were created by the trilogy while expertise and connections from previous \"Ultraman\" works including a scrapped \"Ultra Q\" project by Kaneko and Kazunori It\u014d and Shinji Higuchi, \"Ultraman 80\", and \"{{Ill|Ultraman Powered|ja|\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30f3\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9}}\" and various other productions such as \"Gridman the Hyper Agent\" in return influenced the Heisei Gamera Trilogy where Showa staffs such as Noriaki Yuasa participated in the production of \"Ultraman 80\". \"Digimon Tamers\" by Toei Animation and \"Ultraman Tiga\" by Tsuburaya Productions were re-developed from the aforementioned \"Konaka Gamera\" script for ' which also became the basis for \"Gamera the Brave\". As aforementioned, several Godzilla films have been pointed out to be influenced by Heisei Gamera Trilogy, and ' and \"Shin Godzilla\" were directed by Shusuke Kaneko and Shinji Higuchi. Kaneko acknowledges the similarities between Heisei Gamera Trilogy and MonsterVerse series, and the scrapped Gamera project \"\"Gamera 3D\" which was the successor of \"Godzilla 3D\"\" by Yoshimitsu Banno served as one of predecessors of MonsterVerse. Higuchi also adapted his experiences and miniature models from the Heisei Gamera Trilogy for his 2012 short film \"Giant God Warrior Appears in Tokyo\" where Daiei franchises and Studio Ghibli were owned by Tokuma Shoten at that time,{{refn|For an interview on Tokuma Shoten's \"Animage\", which also published the aforementioned manga \"Gamera vs. Morphos\", Hayao Miyazaki noted that he watched \"Gamera vs. Viras\" in a theater in his childhood, and was skeptical towards its eccentric plot for the entire humanity to surrender to Viras for the sake of two boys, and this experience was one of factors for him to build logical stories for his works.

Developed by University of Maryland engineering students in 2011 and 2012, respectively, the name was also chosen in reference to the university's mascot, the diamondback terrapin, as well as to flights undertaken by Japanese human-powered helicopters years prior.\nIn July 2011, Washington State University veterinarians successfully fixed a prosthetic caster onto an African spurred tortoise named Gamera (after the giant turtle), who was a single amputee where Avant Gamera and Toto in \"Gamera the Brave\" were designed after African spurred tortoise.\nJ/FPS-5 (), an early-warning radar of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is often referred as {{Nihongo|\"Gamera Radar\"|\u30ac\u30e1\u30e9\u30ec\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|Gamera R\u0113d\u0101|lead=yes}} due to its shape somewhat resembling a turtle shell. A Japanese free climber {{Ill|Toshiyuki Kikuchi|ja|\u83ca\u5730\u654f\u4e4b}} is known with a nickname \"Gamera\" being named after the kaiju. The Japanese esports player \"Gamera\" was named after the kaiju, and a technique for esports is called \"Gamera\" in Japan after the kaiju.\nIn 2024, Itochu acquired BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd () after multiple scandals of the latter, and the code name for the acquiring project was named \"Gamera\" after the kaiju. Tokyo Gas also uses the trademark \"GAMERA\" for one of its meter data management systems. The Second generation model (C130; 1972) of the Nissan Laurel is also known by the nickname \"Gamera Laurel\" for its design.\nNaoyuki \"Gyaos\" Nait\u014d (), a TV personality who was formerly a baseball player and a manager, took his stage name from Gyaos, the most recurring foe of Gamera of the series. The comedy troupe \"Gyaos\" which was later renamed to \"Denshamichi\" (), presumably took its name from Nait\u014d as the comedians focused on baseball topics. There also exists a comedian called Gamera Wataru. Similarly, Kazuhiro \"Daimajin\" Sasaki was nicknamed after the Daimajin, the character redeveloped from the Gamera franchise, where Chikara Hashimoto, who portrayed the Daimajin and Daimon the vampiric demon in \"Yokai Monsters\" and participated in \"Gamera\" and other related productions, was also a baseball player and also co-acted with aforementioned Bruce Lee in the 1972 film \"Fist of Fury\". Hashimoto was also appointed for other monsters and yokai films most notably \"Gamera vs. Viras\" and \"The Whale God\" (\"Killer Whale\") where the latter presumably influenced the Dai-kaiju, the right whale-based kaiju with an alias of the \"Whale God\", from \"GeGeGe no Kitar\u014d\" franchise."}

His first published novel, it is a satire of campus life.\nPlot.\nThe story chronicles the disillusionment of a number of young intellectuals as they encounter the realities of the higher education establishment parodied in the story. Over time their lives and sanity disintegrate in different ways through a series of escalating events that culminates with a full-scale civil war raging on the campus of \"American Megaversity\".\nTold in the first person from the perspective of Bud, a lecturer in Remote Sensing who is new to the university, the book attacks and makes fun of just about every conceivable group at university, though its portraits of the nerds/computer scientists/role players tend to be more detailed than those of other factions.\nThe events take place at a fictitious big university consisting of a single building (a central complex with eight towers containing student housing), making the university an enclosed universe of its own. Stephenson uses this fact to take what starts as a mostly realistic satire and move it further and further into the realm of improbability, with giant radioactive rats, hordes of bats and a lab-made railgun.\nThe book was written while Stephenson attended Boston University and the fictional campus is parallel to BU in many ways. The dormitories are similar to Warren Towers, one of the largest dorms in the US. The character of President Septimius Severus Krupp shares traits with then\u2013BU President John Silber, although his name\u2014like those of his predecessors as president of the Big U\u2014is taken from the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus. The neon Big Wheel sign plays a part reminiscent of the Boston Citgo sign just east of the BU campus in Kenmore Square.\nLiterary significance and criticism.\nStephenson has said he is not proud of this book. When Stephenson's \"Snow Crash\" was published in 1992, the book that became a best-seller and vaulted him to fame, \"The Big U\" was out of print and Stephenson was content to leave it that way. When original editions began selling on eBay for hundreds of dollars, he relented and allowed \"The Big U\" to be republished, saying that the only thing worse than people reading the book was paying that much to read it.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65008", "revid": "33959159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65008", "title": "Shub-Niggurath", "text": "Fictional deity in the Cthulhu Mythos\nShub-Niggurath is a deity created by H. P. Lovecraft. She is often associated with the phrase \"The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young\". The only other name by which Lovecraft referred to her was \"Lord of the Wood\" in his story \"The Whisperer in Darkness\".\nShub-Niggurath is first mentioned in Lovecraft's revision story \"The Last Test\" (1928); she is not described by Lovecraft, but is frequently mentioned or called upon in incantations. Most of her development as a literary figure was carried out by other Mythos authors, including August Derleth, Robert Bloch, and Ramsey Campbell.\nLovecraft explicitly defined Shub-Niggurath as a mother goddess in \"The Mound\", where he calls her \"Shub-Niggurath, the All-Mother\". He describes her as a kind of Astarte in the same story. In \"Out of the Aeons\", she is one of the deities siding with humanity against \"hostile gods\".\nAugust Derleth classified Shub-Niggurath as a Great Old One, but the \"Call of Cthulhu\" role-playing game classifies her as an Outer God. The \"CthulhuTech\" role-playing game, in turn, returns to Derleth's classification of Shub-Niggurath as a Great Old One. Shub Niggurath also had children with Hastur in present as she is the mate of Hastur, and in the past she had offsprings with Yog-sothoth too.\nDevelopment.\nShub-Niggurath's appearances in Lovecraft's main body of fiction do not provide much detail about his conception of the entity. Her first mention under Lovecraft's byline was in \"The Dunwich Horror\" (1928), where a quote from the \"Necronomicon\" discussing the Old Ones breaks into an exclamation of \"I\u00e4! Shub-Niggurath!\" The story provides no further information about this peculiar expression.\nThe next Lovecraft story to mention Shub-Niggurath is scarcely more informative. In \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1930), a recording of a ceremony involving human and nonhuman worshippers includes the following exchange:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ever Their praises, and abundance to the Black Goat of the Woods. I\u00e4! Shub-Niggurath!\n\"I\u00e4! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!\"\nSimilarly unexplained exclamations occur in \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" (1932) and \"The Thing on the Doorstep\" (1933).\nRevision tales.\nLovecraft only provided specific information about Shub-Niggurath in his \"revision tales\", stories published under the names of clients for whom he ghost-wrote. As Price points out, \"For these clients he constructed a parallel myth-cycle to his own, a separate group of Great Old Ones\", including Yig, Ghatanothoa, Rhan-Tegoth, \"the evil twins Nug and Yeb\"\u2014and Shub-Niggurath.\nWhile some of these revision stories just repeat the familiar exclamations, others provide new elements of lore. In \"The Last Test\" (1927), the first mention of Shub-Niggurath seems to connect her to Nug and Yeb: \"I talked in Yemen with an old man who had come back from the Crimson Desert\u2014he had seen Irem, the City of Pillars, and had worshipped at the underground shrines of Nug and Yeb\u2014I\u00e4! Shub-Niggurath!\"\nThe revision story \"The Mound\", which describes the discovery of an underground realm called K'n-yan by a Spanish conquistador, reports that a temple of Tsathoggua there \"had been turned into a shrine of Shub-Niggurath, the All-Mother and wife of the Not-to-Be-Named-One. This deity was a kind of sophisticated Astarte, and her worship struck the pious Catholic as supremely obnoxious.\"\nThe reference to \"Astarte\", the consort of Baal in Semitic mythology, ties Shub-Niggurath to the related fertility goddess Cybele, the Magna Mater mentioned in Lovecraft's \"The Rats in the Walls\", and implies that the \"great mother worshipped by the hereditary cult of Exham Priory\" in that story \"had to be none other than Shub-Niggurath\".\nThe Not-to-Be-Named-One, not being named, is difficult to identify; a similar phrase, translated into Latin as the \"Magnum Innominandum\", appears in a list in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" and was included in a scrap of incantation that Lovecraft wrote for Robert Bloch's \"The Shambler from the Stars\". August Derleth identifies this mysterious entity with Hastur (though Hastur appears in the same \"Whisperer in Darkness\" list with the \"Magnum Innominandum\"), while Robert M. Price equates him with Yog-Sothoth\u2014though he also suggests that Shub-Niggurath's mate is implicitly the snake god Yig.\nFinally, in \"Out of the Aeons\", a revision tale set in part on the lost continent of Mu, Lovecraft describes the character T'yog as the \"High Priest of Shub-Niggurath and guardian of the copper temple of the Goat with a Thousand Young\". In the story, T'yog surprisingly maintains that \"the gods friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods, and\u00a0... that Shub-Niggurath, Nug, and Yeb, as well as Yig the Serpent-god, were ready to take sides with man\" against the more malevolent Ghatanothoa. Shub-Niggurath is called \"the Mother Goddess\", and reference is made to \"her sons\", presumably Nug and Yeb.\nOther references.\nOther evidence of Lovecraft's conception of Shub-Niggurath can be found in his letters. For example, in a letter to Willis Conover, Lovecraft described her as an \"evil cloud-like entity\". \"Yog-Sothoth's wife is the hellish cloud-like entity Shub-Niggurath, in whose honor nameless cults hold the rite of the Goat with a Thousand Young. By her he has two monstrous offspring\u2014the evil twins Nug and Yeb. He has also begotten hellish hybrids upon the females of various organic species throughout the universes of space-time.\"\nThe Black Goat.\nAlthough Shub-Niggurath is often associated with the epithet \"The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young\", it is possible that this Black Goat is a separate entity. Rodolfo Ferraresi, in his essay \"The Question of Shub-Niggurath\", says that Lovecraft himself separated the two in his writings, such as in \"Out of the Aeons\" (1935) in which a distinction is made between Shub-Niggurath and the Black Goat\u2014the goat is the figurehead through which Shub-Niggurath is worshipped. In apparent contrast to Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat is sometimes depicted as a male, most notably in the rite performed in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1931) in which the Black Goat is called the \"Lord of the Woods\". However, Lovecraft clearly associates Shub-Niggurath with The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young in two of his stories\u2014\"The Dreams in the Witch House\" and \"The Thing on the Doorstep\".\nIt is possible that The Black Goat is actually Ny-Rakath, Shub-Niggurath's brother. The Black Goat may also be the personification of Pan, since Lovecraft was influenced by Arthur Machen's \"The Great God Pan\" (1890), a story that inspired Lovecraft's \"The Dunwich Horror\" (1929). In this incarnation, the Black Goat may represent Satan in the form of the satyr, a half-man, half-goat. In folklore, the satyr symbolized a man with excessive sexual appetites. The Black Goat may otherwise be a male, earthly form of Shub-Niggurath\u2014an incarnation she assumes to copulate with her worshipers.\nRobert M. Price's interpretation.\nRobert M. Price points to a passage from \"Idle Days on the Yann\", by Lord Dunsany, one of Lovecraft's favorite writers, as the source for the name Shub-Niggurath:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And I too felt that I would pray. Yet I liked not to pray to a jealous God there where the frail affectionate gods whom the heathen love were being humbly invoked; so I bethought me, instead, of Sheol Nugganoth, whom the men of the jungle have long since deserted, who is now unworshipped and alone; and to him I prayed.\nNotes Price: \"The name already carried a whiff of sulfur: Sheol was the name for the Netherworld mentioned in the Bible and the Gilgamesh Epic.\"\nAs for Shub-Niggurath's association with the symbol of the goat, Price writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;we may believe that here Lovecraft was inspired by the traditional Christian depiction of the Baphomet Goat, an image of Satan harking back to the pre-Christian woodland deity Pan, he of the goatish horns and shanks. The Satanic goat is a device of much spectral fiction, as when in Dennis Wheatley's \"The Devil Rides Out\" the Archfiend's epiphany takes goat-headed form.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65009", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65009", "title": "Damselfly", "text": "Suborder of insects\nDamselflies are flying insects of the suborder Zygoptera in the order Odonata. They are similar to dragonflies (which constitute the other odonatan suborder, Epiprocta) but are usually smaller and have slimmer bodies. Most species fold the wings along the body when at rest, unlike dragonflies which hold the wings flat and away from the body. Damselflies have existed since the Late Jurassic, and are found on every continent except Antarctica.\nAll damselflies are predatory insects: both nymphs and adults actively hunt and eat other insects. The nymphs are aquatic, with different species living in a variety of freshwater habitats including acidic bogs, ponds, lakes and rivers. The nymphs moult repeatedly, at the last moult climbing out of the water to undergo metamorphosis. The skin splits down the back, they emerge and inflate their wings and abdomen to gain their adult form. Their presence on a body of water indicates that it is relatively unpolluted, but their dependence on freshwater makes them vulnerable to damage to their wetland habitats.\nSome species of damselfly have elaborate courtship behaviours. Many species are sexually dimorphic, the males often being more brightly coloured than the females. Like dragonflies, they reproduce using indirect insemination and delayed fertilisation. A mating pair form a shape known as a \"heart\" or \"wheel\", the male clasping the female at the back of the head, the female curling her abdomen down to pick up sperm from secondary genitalia at the base of the male's abdomen. The pair often remain together with the male still clasping the female while she lays eggs within the tissue of plants in or near water using a robust ovipositor.\nArtificial fishing flies that mimic damselfly nymphs are used in wet-fly fishing. Damselflies are sometimes represented in personal jewellery such as brooches.\nClassification.\nThe Zygoptera are an ancient group, with the earliest fossils dating to the Kimmeridgian age of the Late Jurassic, around 152\u00a0million years ago. Well-preserved Eocene damselfly larvae and exuviae are known from fossils preserved in amber in the Baltic region.\nMolecular analysis in 2021 confirms that most of the traditional families are monophyletic, but shows that the Amphipterygidae, Megapodagrionidae and Protoneuridae are paraphyletic and will need to be reorganised. The Protoneuridae in particular is shown to be composed of six clades from five families. The result so far is 27 damselfly families, with seven more likely to be created. The discovered clades did not agree well with traditional characteristics used to classify living and fossil Zygoptera such as wing venation, so fossil taxa will need to be revisited. The results of the analysis are show in the phylogenetic tree shown below, with the seven new or resurrected families marked with an asterisk:\nGeneral description.\nThe general body plan of a damselfly is similar to that of a dragonfly. The compound eyes are large but are more widely separated and relatively smaller than those of a dragonfly. Above the eyes is the frons or forehead, below this the clypeus, and on the lower lip or labium, an extensible organ used in the capture of prey. The top of the head bears three simple eyes (ocelli), which may measure light intensity, and a tiny pair of antennae that serve no olfactory function but may measure air speed. Many species are sexually dimorphic; the males are often brightly coloured and distinctive, while the females are plainer, cryptically coloured, and harder to identify to species. For example, in \"Coenagrion\", the Eurasian bluets, the males are bright blue with black markings, while the females are usually predominantly green or brown with black. A few dimorphic species show female-limited polymorphism, the females being in two forms, one form distinct and the other with the patterning as in males. The ones that look like males, andromorphs, are usually under a third of the female population but the proportion can rise significantly and a theory that explains this response suggests that it helps overcome harassment by males. Some Coenagrionid damselflies show male-limited polymorphism, an even less understood phenomenon.\nIn general, damselflies are smaller than dragonflies, the smallest being members of the genus \"Agriocnemis\" (wisps). However, members of the Pseudostigmatidae (helicopter damselflies or forest giants) are exceptionally large for the group, with wingspans as much as in \"Megaloprepus\" and body length up to in \"Pseudostigma aberrans\".\nThe first thoracic segment is the prothorax, bearing the front pair of legs. The joint between head and prothorax is slender and flexible, which enables the damselfly to swivel its head and to manoeuvre more freely when flying. The remaining thoracic segments are the fused mesothorax and metathorax (together termed the synthorax), each with a pair of wings and a pair of legs. A dark stripe known as the humeral stripe runs from the base of the front wings to the second pair of legs, and just in front of this is the pale-coloured, antehumeral stripe.\nThe forewings and hindwings are similar in appearance and are membranous, being strengthened and supported by longitudinal veins that are linked by many cross-veins and that are filled with haemolymph. Species markers include quadrangular markings on the wings known as the pterostigma or stigma, and in almost all species, there is a nodus near the leading edge. The thorax houses the flight muscles. Many damselflies (e.g. Lestidae, Platycnemidae, Coenagrionidae) have clear wings, but some (Calopterygidae, Euphaeidae) have coloured wings, whether uniformly suffused with colour or boldly marked with a coloured patch. In species such as the banded demoiselle, \"Calopteryx splendens\" the males have both a darker green body and large dark violet-blue patches on all four wings, which flicker conspicuously in their aerial courtship dances; the females have pale translucent greenish wings.\nThe abdomen is long and slender and consists of ten segments. The secondary genitalia in males are on the undersides of segments two and three and are conspicuous, making it easy to tell the sex of the damselfly when viewed from the side. The female genital opening is on the underside between segments eight and nine. It may be covered by a subgenital plate, or extended into a complex ovipositor that helps them lay eggs within plant tissue. The tenth segment in both sexes bears cerci and in males, its underside bears a pair of paraprocts.\nDamselflies (except spreadwings, Lestidae) rest their wings together, above their bodies, whereas dragonflies rest with their wings spread diametrically apart; the spreadwings rest with their wings slightly apart. Damselflies have slenderer bodies than dragonflies, and their eyes do not overlap. Damselfly nymphs differ from dragonflies nymphs in that the epiproct and pair of paraprocts at the tip of their abdomen has been modified into caudal gills, in addition to being able to absorb oxygen through the wall of their rectum, whereas dragonflies breathe through internal rectal gills only. Damselfly nymphs swim by fish-like undulations, the gills functioning like a tail. Dragonfly nymphs can forcibly expel water in their rectum for rapid escape.\nDistribution and diversity.\nOdonates are found on all the continents except Antarctica. Although some species of dragonfly have wide distributions, damselflies tend to have smaller ranges. Most odonates breed in fresh-water; a few damselflies in the family Caenagrionidae breed in brackish water (and a single dragonfly species breeds in seawater). Dragonflies are more affected by pollution than are damselflies. The presence of odonates indicates that an ecosystem is of good quality. The most species-rich environments have a range of suitable microhabitats, providing suitable water bodies for breeding.\nAlthough most damselflies live out their lives within a short distance of where they were hatched, some species, and some individuals within species, disperse more widely. Forktails in the family Coenagrionidae seem particularly prone to do this, large male boreal bluets (\"Enallagma boreale\") in British Columbia often migrating, while smaller ones do not. These are known to leave their waterside habitats, flying upwards till lost from view, and presumably being dispersed to far off places by the stronger winds found at high altitudes. In this way they may appear in a locality where no damselflies were to be seen the day before. Rambur's forktail (\"Ischnura ramburii\") has been found, for example, on oil rigs far out in the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe distribution and diversity of damselfly species in the biogeographical regions is summarized here. (There are no damselflies in the Antarctic.) Note that some species are widespread and occur in multiple regions.\nOverall, there are about 2942 extant species of damselflies placed in 309 genera.\nBiology.\nAdult damselflies catch and eat flies, mosquitoes, and other small insects. Often they hover among grasses and low vegetation, picking prey off stems and leaves with their spiny legs (unlike dragonflies which prefer catching flying prey). Although predominantly using vision to locate their prey, adults may also make use of olfactory cues. No species are known to hunt at night, but some are crepuscular, perhaps taking advantage of newly hatched flies and other aquatic insects at a time when larger dragonflies are roosting. In tropical South America, helicopter damselflies (Pseudostigmatidae) feed on spiders, hovering near an orb web and plucking the spider, or its entangled prey, from the web. There are few pools and lakes in these habitats, and these damselflies breed in temporary water bodies in holes in trees, the rosettes of bromeliads and even the hollow stems of bamboos.\nThe nymphs of damselflies have been less researched than their dragonfly counterparts, and many have not even been identified. They choose their prey according to size and seem less able to overpower larger prey than can dragonfly nymphs. The major part of the diet of most species appears to be crustaceans such as water fleas.\nEcology.\nDamselflies exist in a range of habitats in and around the wetlands needed for their larval development; these include open spaces for finding mates, suitable perches, open aspect, roosting sites, suitable plant species for ovipositing and suitable water quality. Odonates have been used for bio-indication purposes regarding the quality of the ecosystem. Different species have different requirements for their larvae with regard to water depth, water movement and pH.\nThe European common blue damselfly (\"Enallagma cyathigerum\") for example can occur at high densities in acid waters where fish are absent, such as in bog pools.\nThe scarce blue-tailed damselfly (\"Ischnura pumilio\") in contrast requires base-rich habitats and water with a slow flow-rate. It is found in ditches, quarries, seeps, flushes, marshes and pools. It tolerates high levels of zinc and copper in the sediment but requires suitable emergent plants for egg-laying without the water being choked by plants. Damselflies' dependence on freshwater habitats makes them very vulnerable to damage to wetlands through drainage for agriculture or urban growth.\nIn the tropics, the helicopter damselfly \"Mecistogaster modesta\" (Pseudostigmatidae) breeds in phytotelmata, the small bodies of water trapped by bromeliads, epiphytic plants of the rainforest of northwest Costa Rica, at the high density of some 6000 larvae per hectare in patches of secondary forest. Another tropical species, the cascade damselfly \"Thaumatoneura inopinata\" (Megapodagrionidae), inhabits waterfalls in Costa Rica and Panama.\nDamselflies, both nymphs and adults, are eaten by a range of predators including birds, fish, frogs, dragonflies, other damselflies, water spiders, water beetles, backswimmers and giant water bugs.\nDamselflies have a variety of internal and external parasites. Particularly prevalent are the gregarine protozoans found in the gut. In a study of the European common blue damselfly, every adult insect was infected at the height of the flying season. When present in large numbers, these parasites can cause death by blocking the gut. Water mites Hydracarina are often seen on the outside of both nymphs and adults, and can move from one to the other at metamorphosis. They suck the body fluids and may actually kill young nymphs, but adults are relatively unaffected, it being necessary for the completion of the mite's life cycle that it returns to water, a feat accomplished when the adult damselfly breeds.\nBehaviour.\nMany damselflies have elaborate courtship behaviours. These are designed to show off the male's distinctive characteristics, bright colouring or flying abilities, thus demonstrating his fitness. \"Calopteryx\" males will hover in front of a female with alternating fast and slow wingbeats; if she is receptive she will remain perched, otherwise she will fly off. The male river jewelwing (\"Calopteryx aequabilis\") performs display flights in front of the female, fluttering his forewings while keeping his hindwings still, and raising his abdomen to reveal the white spots on his wings. \"Platycypha\" males will hover in front of a female, thrusting their bright white legs forward in front of their heads. Flattened tibia and bright leg colouring are seen in \"Platycnemis phasmovolans\" and a few other Platycnemididae, including the extinct \"Yijenplatycnemis huangi\". \"Rhinocypha\" bobs up and down, often low over fast-flowing forested and shaded streams, displaying its bright-coloured body and wings. Some species (\"R. biceriata\", \"R. humeralis\") have a foot waggling behaviour: they thrust a leg forward and vibrate it towards ovipositing females while in flight. Vibrating the tibia is seen in \"Libellago semiopaca\" despite it lacking bright colouration on the tibia suggesting that foot waggling is a generalized excitary signal in Chlorocyphidae damselflies. Foot waggling has been observed in \"Calopteryx\" sp., \"Platycypha fitzsimonsi\", and \"Platycypha caligata\". Male members of the family Protoneuridae with vividly coloured wings display these to visiting females. Swift forktail (\"Ischnura erratica\") males display to each other with their blue-tipped abdomens raised.\nOther behaviours observed in damselflies include wing-warning, wing-clapping, flights of attrition and abdominal bobbing. Wing-warning is a rapid opening and closing of the wings and is aggressive, while wing-clapping involves a slower opening of the wings followed by a rapid closure, up to eight times in quick succession, and often follows flight; it may serve a thermo-regulatory function. Flights of attrition are engaged in by the ebony jewelwing (\"Calopteryx maculata\") and involve males bouncing around each other while flying laterally and continuing to do so, sometimes over a considerable distance, until one insect is presumably exhausted and gives up. Characteristics of displays and coloration of males are suggested to be the common cues used by females to choose mates. In at least one species, \"Mnais costalis\", males with more sunlight in their territories had higher wing-beat frequency and were more likely to mate. Females preferred \"hotter\" males because they would be on warmer territories for egg laying.\nAt night, damselflies usually roost in dense vegetation, perching with the abdomen alongside a stem. If disturbed they will move around to the other side of the stem but will not fly off. Spreadwings fully fold their wings when roosting. The desert shadowdamsel (\"Palaemnema domina\") aggregates to roost in thick places near streams in the heat of the day. While there it engages in wing-clapping, the exact function of which is unknown. Some species such as the rubyspot damselfly, \"Hetaerina americana\", form night roosting aggregations, with a preponderance of males; this may have an anti-predator function or may be simply the outcome of choosing safe roosting sites.\nReproduction.\nMating in damselflies, as in dragonflies, is a complex, precisely choreographed process involving both indirect insemination and delayed fertilisation. The male first has to attract a female to his territory, continually driving off rival males. When he is ready to mate, he transfers a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment 9, near the end of his abdomen, to his secondary genitalia on segments 2\u20133, near the base of his abdomen. The male then grasps the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen; the structure of the claspers varies between species, and may help to prevent interspecific mating. The pair fly in tandem with the male in front, typically perching on a twig or plant stem. The female then curls her abdomen downwards and forwards under her body to pick up the sperm from the male's secondary genitalia, while the male uses his \"tail\" claspers to grip the female behind the head: this distinctive posture is called the \"heart\" or \"wheel\"; the pair may also be described as being \"in cop\". Males may transfer the sperm to their secondary genitalia either before a female is held, in the early stage when the female is held by the legs or after the female is held between the terminal claspers. This can lead to variations in the tandem postures. The spermatophore may also have nutrition in addition to sperms as a \"nuptial gift\". Some cases of sexual cannibalism exist where females (of \"Ischnura graellsii\") eat males while in copula.\nParthenogenesis (reproduction from unfertilised eggs) is exceptional, and has only been recorded in nature in female \"Ischnura hastata\" on the Azores Islands.\nEgg-laying (ovipositing) involves not only the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but the male hovering above her, mate-guarding, or in some species continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, a form of sperm competition (the sperms of the last mated male have the greatest chance of fertilizing the eggs, also known as sperm precedence) made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up much of the time that a copulating pair remain in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.\nAll damselflies lay their eggs inside plant tissues; those that lay eggs underwater may submerge themselves for 30 minutes at a time, climbing along the stems of aquatic plants and laying eggs at intervals. For example, the red-eyed damselfly \"Erythromma najas\" lays eggs, in tandem, into leaves or stems of floating or sometimes emergent plants; in contrast, the scarce bluetail \"Ischnura pumilio\" oviposits alone, the female choosing mostly emergent grasses and rushes, and laying her eggs in their stems either above or just below the waterline. The willow emerald \"Chalcolestes viridis\" (a spreadwing) is unusual in laying eggs only in woody plant tissue, choosing thin twigs of trees that hang over water, and scarring the bark in the process. A possible exception is an apparent instance of ovo-viviparity, in which \"Heliocypha perforata\" was filmed in western China depositing young larvae (presumably hatched from eggs inside the female's body) onto a partly submerged branch of a tree.\nMany damselflies are able to produce more than one brood per year (voltinism); this is negatively correlated with latitude, becoming more common towards the equator, except in the Lestidae.\nLife cycle.\nDamselflies are hemimetabolous insects that have no pupal stage in their development. The female inserts the eggs by means of her ovipositor into slits made in water plants or other underwater substrates and the larvae, known as naiads or nymphs, are almost all completely aquatic. Exceptions include the Hawaiian \"Megalagrion oahuense\" and an unidentified Megapodagrionid from New Caledonia, which are terrestrial in their early stages. The spreadwings lay eggs above the waterline late in the year and the eggs overwinter, often covered by snow. In spring they hatch out in the meltwater pools and the nymphs complete their development before these temporary pools dry up.\nThe nymphs are voracious predators and feed by means of a flat labium (a toothed mouthpart on the lower jaw) that forms the so-called mask; it is rapidly extended to seize and pierce the \"Daphnia\" (water fleas), mosquito larvae, and other small aquatic organisms on which damselfly nymphs feed. They breathe by means of three large external, fin-like gills on the tip of the abdomen, and these may also serve for locomotion in the same manner as a fish's tail. Compared to dragonfly larvae, the nymphs show little variation in form. They tend to be slender and elongate, many having morphological adaptations for holding their position in fast flowing water. They are more sensitive than dragonfly nymphs to oxygen levels and suspended fine particulate matter, and do not bury themselves in the mud.\nThe nymphs proceed through about a dozen moults as they grow. In the later stages, the wing pads become visible. When fully developed, the nymphs climb out of the water and take up a firm stance, the skin on the thorax splits and the adult form wriggles out. This has a soft body at first and hangs or stands on its empty larval case. It pumps haemolymph into its small limp wings, which expand to their full extent. The haemolymph is then pumped back into the abdomen, which also expands fully. The exoskeleton hardens and the colours become more vivid over the course of the next few days. Most damselflies emerge in daytime, and in cool conditions the process takes several hours. On a hot day, the cuticle hardens rapidly and the adult can be flying away within half an hour.\nConservation.\nConservation of Odonata has usually concentrated on the more iconic suborder Anisoptera, the dragonflies. However, the two suborders largely have the same needs, and what is good for dragonflies is also good for damselflies. The main threats experienced by odonates are the clearance of forests, the pollution of waterways, the lowering of groundwater levels, the damming of rivers for hydroelectric schemes and the general degradation of wetlands and marshes. The clearance of tropical rainforests is of importance because the rate of erosion increases, streams and pools dry up and waterways become clogged with silt. The presence of alien species can also have unintended consequences. In Hawaii, the introduction of the mosquitofish (\"Gambusia affinis\") was effective in controlling mosquitoes but nearly exterminated the island's endemic damselflies. The ancient greenling \"Hemiphlebia mirabilis\" has been an important flagship species for conservation action in preserving its habitat in Australia.\nIn culture.\nFishing flies that mimic damselfly nymphs are sometimes used in wet-fly fishing, where the hook and line are allowed to sink below the surface.\nDamselflies have formed subjects for personal jewellery such as brooches since at least 1880.\n\"Damselfly\" is a 2005 short film directed by Ben O'Connor.\n\"Damselfly\" is the title of a 2012 novel in the \"Faeble\" series by S. L. Naeole and of a 2018 novel by Chandra Prasad.\nModern poems with the damselfly as a subject include a 1994 poem by August Kleinzahler, which contains the lines \"And that blue there, cobalt / a moment, then iridescent, / fragile as a lady's pin / hovering above the nasturtium?\" The poet John Engels published \"Damselfly, Trout, Heron\" in his 1983 collection \"Weather-Fear: New and Selected Poems\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Created by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson, the Swamp Thing has had several different incarnations throughout his publication. The character first appeared in \"House of Secrets\" #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone horror story set in the early 20th century. The character found perhaps its greatest popularity during the original 1970s Wein/Wrightson run and in the mid-late 1980s during a highly acclaimed run under Alan Moore, Stephen Bissette, and John Totleben. Swamp Thing would also go on to become one of the staples of the Justice League Dark, a team featuring magical superheroes. \nThe character is often depicted as a swamp monster that resembles an anthropomorphic mound of vegetable matter seeking to protect nature and humanity from threats of both scientific and supernatural origin. These duties are often an expression of his designation as the Avatar of the Green, an illustrious title depicted as synonymous with both Swamp Thing and makes the character the embodiment of the cosmic energies that gives life to all plant life in the known universe, often dubbed \"The Green\". Several incarnations arise from the consciousness of other beings who are selected as the champion of the Parliament of Trees, the guiding and collective consciousness of all plant life, which includes past incarnations of Swamp Thing. Swamp Thing is also often in an elemental conflict with both rivals within the Green (i.e Floronic Man), rival elemental forces, such as \"The Red\" (embodies all animal life, including humanity), and most notably \"The Rot\" or \"The Black\" (embodies death), with their archnemesis being Anton Arcane. \nThe original version of the character is Alexander Olsen, a scientist who was killed by his assistant vying for the affections of his wife. Returning as a swamp creature after his body is dumped, he takes revenge on his killer, but his wife runs off, unable to recognize him. He later becomes a local legend in Louisiana. His successor, Alec Holland, is the second and most well-regarded version of the character. A chemist working on a compound to enable plant growth in hostile enviroments, Holland is seemingly transformed by his own creation after his death at the hands of criminal elements. Stories vary in his being, sometimes a plant creature believing himself to be Alec possessing his memories while later stories make him the genuine Alec who transforms into the Swamp Thing. This version is also a reluctant ally of John Constantine and a later member of the Justice League Dark, considered a powerhouse among their ranks.\nIn 2021, a new incarnation of Swamp Thing was created. This version is Levi Kamei, a young Indian scientist chosen as the new Swamp Thing at a young age. Descended from a tribunal connected to the Kaziranga wetlands, his powers awaken following an altercation between the community and employers, which also resulted in his death and reincarnation. Following his awakening, various factions seeking to control the new Swamp Thing for their own nefarious agenda. Kamei is guided by Alec's spirit and fellow scientist Jennifer Reece in his new role. Existing concurrently with the Alec version, this Swamp Thing is instead more prominently a member of the Titans.\nThe character has been adapted from the comics into several forms of media, including feature films, television series, and video games. The character made his live-action debut in the film \"Swamp Thing\" (1982), with Dick Durock playing the Swamp Thing, while Ray Wise played Alec Holland. Durock played both Swamp Thing and Holland in the sequel film \"The Return of Swamp Thing\" (1989). Durock reprised the role again in the television series \"Swamp Thing\" (1990). The Swamp Thing was played by Derek Mears with Andy Bean playing Alec Holland in the television series \"Swamp Thing\" (2019). Another live-action film adaptation, titled \"Swamp Thing\", is in development as an installment of the DC Universe (DCU) media franchise. IGN ranked him 28th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes list.\nConcept and creation.\nLen Wein came up with the idea for the character while riding a subway in Queens. He later recalled: \"I didn't have a title for it, so I kept referring to it as 'that swamp thing I'm working on'. And that's how it got its name!\" Bernie Wrightson designed the character's visual image, using a rough sketch by Wein as a guideline.\nPublication history.\nVolume 1.\nLen Wein was the writer for the first 13 issues, before David Michelinie and Gerry Conway finished up the series. Burgeoning horror artist Bernie Wrightson drew the first 10 issues of the series, while Nestor Redondo drew a further 13 issues, the last issue being drawn by Fred Carrillo. The original creative team worked closely together; Wrightson recalled that during story conferences, Wein would walk around the office acting out all of the parts. The Swamp Thing fought against evil as he sought the men who murdered his wife and caused his monstrous transformation, as well as searching for a means to transform back into his human form.\nThe Swamp Thing has since fought many villains. Though they only met twice during the first series, the mad scientist Anton Arcane (with his obsession with gaining immortality) became the Swamp Thing's nemesis, even as the Swamp Thing developed a close bond with Arcane's niece Abigail Arcane. Arcane was aided by his nightmarish army of Un-Men and the Patchwork Man, alias Arcane's brother Gregori Arcane who, after a land mine explosion, was rebuilt as a Frankenstein Monster-type creature by his brother. Also involved in the conflict was the Swamp Thing's close friend-turned-enemy Lt. Matthew Joseph Cable, a federal agent who\noriginally mistakenly believed the Swamp Thing to be responsible for the deaths of Alec and Linda Holland.\nAs sales figures plummeted towards the end of the series, the writers attempted to revive interest by introducing fantastical creatures, aliens, and even Alec Holland's brother, Edward (a character that was never referred to again by later writers) into the picture.\nThe last two issues saw the Swamp Thing transformed back into Alec Holland and having to fight one last menace as an ordinary human. The series was cancelled with issue #24 and a blurb for a 25th issue containing an upcoming encounter with Hawkman led nowhere. Alec Holland's transformation back into the Swamp Thing was covered in \"Challengers of the Unknown\" #81-87, within which the Swamp Thing is enlisted by the titular team to fight the Lovecraftian cosmic threat M'nagalah, whom the Swamp Thing had encountered during Wein's run.\n\"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\" and Volume 2.\nIn 1982, DC Comics revived the \"Swamp Thing\" series, attempting to capitalize on the summer 1982 release of the Wes Craven film of the same name. A revival had been planned for 1978, but was a victim of the DC Implosion. The new series, called \"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\", featured an adaptation of the Craven film in its first annual. Now written by Martin Pasko, the book loosely picked up after the Swamp Thing's guest appearances in \"Challengers of the Unknown\" #81-87, \"DC Comics Presents\" #8, and \"The Brave and the Bold\" #172, with the character wandering around the swamps of Louisiana seen as an urban legend and feared by locals. Pasko's main arc depicted the Swamp Thing roaming the globe, trying to stop a young girl (and the possible Anti-Christ) named Karen Clancy from destroying the world.\nWhen Pasko had to give up work on the title due to increasing television commitments, editor Len Wein assigned the title to British writer Alan Moore. When Karen Berger took over as editor, she gave Moore free rein to revamp the title and the character as he saw fit. Moore reconfigured the Swamp Thing's origin to make him a true monster, as opposed to a human transformed into a monster. In his first issue, he swept aside most of the supporting cast that Pasko had introduced in his year-and-a-half run as writer and brought the Sunderland Corporation to the forefront, as they hunted the Swamp Thing down and \"killed\" him in a hail of bullets. The subsequent investigation revealed that the Swamp Thing was not Alec Holland transformed into a plant, but actually a wholly plant-based entity created upon the death of Alec Holland, having somehow absorbed duplicates of Holland's consciousness and memories into himself. He is described as \"a plant that thought it was Alec Holland, a plant that was trying its level best to \"be\" Alec Holland\". This is explained as a result of the plant matter of the swamp absorbing Holland's bio-restorative formula, with the Swamp Thing's appearance being the plants' attempt to duplicate Holland's human form. This revelation resulted in the Swamp Thing suffering a temporary mental breakdown and identity crisis, but he re-asserted himself in time to stop the latest scheme of Floronic Man.\nIssue #32 was a strange twist of comedy and tragedy, as the Swamp Thing encounters an alien version of Pogo, Walt Kelly's character.\nMoore would later reveal, in an attempt to connect the original one-off Swamp Thing story from \"House of Secrets\" #92 to the main \"Swamp Thing\" canon, that there had been dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Swamp Things since the dawn of humanity, and that all versions of the creature were designated defenders of the Parliament of Trees, an elemental community which rules a dimension known as \"the Green\" that connects all plant life on Earth. Moore's \"Swamp Thing\" broadened the scope of the series to include ecological and spiritual concerns while retaining its horror-fantasy roots. In issue #37, Moore formally introduced the character of John Constantine the Hellblazer as a magician/con artist who would lead the Swamp Thing on the \"American Gothic\" storyline. Alan Moore also introduced the concept of the DC characters Cain and Abel being the mystical reincarnations of the Biblical Cain and Abel caught in an endless cycle of murder and resurrection.\n\"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\" was the first mainstream comic book series to completely abandon the Comics Code Authority's approval.\nWith issue #65, regular penciler Rick Veitch took over from Moore and began scripting the series, continuing the story in a roughly similar vein for 24 more issues. Veitch's term ended in 1989 due to a widely publicized creative dispute, when DC refused to publish issue #88 because of the use of Jesus Christ as a character, despite having previously approved the script in which the Swamp Thing is a cupbearer who offers Jesus water when he calls for it from the cross. The series was handed to Doug Wheeler, who made the cup that the Shining Knight believed to be the Holy Grail to be a cup used in a religious ceremony by a Neanderthal tribe that was about to be wiped out by Cro-Magnons, in the published version of issue #88. In issue #90, Wheeler not only reintroduced Matango, a character that Stephen Bissette had introduced in \"Swamp Thing Annual\" #4, but he also completed Veitch's story arc that intended to have Abby Holland give birth to the human-plant hybrid elemental Tefe Holland . \nAfter a period of high creative turnover, in 1991 DC sought to revive interest in \"Swamp Thing\" by bringing horror writer Nancy A. Collins on board to write the series. Starting with \"Swamp Thing Annual\" #6, Collins moved on to write \"Swamp Thing\" (vol. 2) #110\u2013138, dramatically overhauling the series by restoring the pre-Alan Moore tone and incorporating a new set of supporting cast members into the book. Collins resurrected Anton Arcane, along with the Sunderland Corporation, as foils for the Swamp Thing. Her stories tended to be ecologically based and at one point featured giant killer flowers.\nWith issue #140 (March 1994), the title was handed over to Grant Morrison for a four-issue story arc, co-written by the then-unknown Mark Millar. As Collins had destroyed the status quo of the series, Morrison sought to shake the book up with a four-part storyline which had the Swamp Thing plunged into a nightmarish dreamworld scenario where he was split into two separate beings: Alec Holland and the Swamp Thing, which was now a mindless being of pure destruction. Millar then took over from Morrison with issue #144, and launched what was initially conceived as an ambitious 25-part storyline where the Swamp Thing would be forced to go upon a series of trials against rival elemental forces. Millar brought the series to a close with issue #171 in a finale where the Swamp Thing becomes the master of all elemental forces, including the planet.\nVolume 3.\nWritten by Brian K. Vaughan and drawn by Roger Petersen and Giuseppe Camuncoli in 2001, the third \"Swamp Thing\" series focused on the daughter of the Swamp Thing, Tef\u00e9 Holland. Even though she was chronologically 11\u201312, the series had Tef\u00e9 aged into the body of an 18-year-old with a mindwipe orchestrated by the Swamp Thing. Constantine and Abby try to control her darker impulses, brought about by her exposure to the Parliament of Trees. Due to the circumstances under which she was conceived, the Swamp Thing, possessing John Constantine, was not aware that he was given a blood transfusion by a demon. She held power over both plants and flesh.\nBelieving herself to be a normal human girl named Mary who had miraculously recovered from cancer three years prior, she rediscovers her powers and identity when she finds her boyfriend and best friend betraying her on prom night. In a moment of anger, her powers manifest and she kills them both. Tef\u00e9 then fakes her own death and embarks on a series of misadventures that take her across the country, and ultimately to Africa, in search of a mythical \"Tree of Knowledge\".\nDuring this series, it seems that the Swamp Thing and Abigail have reunited as lovers and are living in their old home in the Louisiana swamps outside Houma. The home in which they live more closely resembles the one that the Swamp Thing constructs for Abigail during the Moore run than the home in which they dwell during the Collins run. In a confrontation with Tef\u00e9, the Swamp Thing explains that he has cut himself off from the Green and there seems to be no trace of the god-like powers he acquired from the Parliaments of Air, Waves, Stone or Flames during the Millar run. Also, Vaughan's Swamp Thing does not seem to have been divorced from the humanity of his Alec Holland self. The disconnection between these two entities becomes a plot point in Volume 4.\nVolume 4.\nA fourth series began in 2004, with writers Andy Diggle (#1\u20136), Will Pfeifer (#7\u20138) and Joshua Dysart (#9\u201329). In this latest series, the Swamp Thing is reverted to his plant-based Earth elemental status after the first story line, and he attempts to live an \"eventless\" life in the Louisiana swamps. Tef\u00e9, likewise, is rendered powerless and mortal. Issue #29 was intended to be the final issue of the fourth volume, which was cancelled due to low sales numbers.\nReturn to the DC Universe.\n\"Brightest Day\".\nThe conclusion of the crossover event \"Brightest Day\" revealed that the Swamp Thing had become corrupted by the personality of the villain Nekron in the wake of the \"Blackest Night\" crossover event. The Swamp Thing now believed himself to be Nekron, similar to how he had once believed himself to be Alec Holland. The Swamp Thing went on a rampage in Star City, seeking to destroy all life on Earth. The Life Entity uses several heroes, including Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Firestorm, Martian Manhunter, Aquaman and Deadman, to slow the rampage while a new Swamp Thing was formed around the human remains of Alec Holland. Instead of merely \"thinking\" that it was Holland, this version of the Swamp Thing would actually be him. The new Swamp Thing defeated and killed the corrupted and original Swamp Thing. Restoring life to natural environments across the Earth, he declared that those who hurt the Green would face his wrath. He also restored Aquaman, Firestorm, Hawkman, and Martian Manhunter to normal. The book ended with the Swamp Thing resuming his original mission by killing several businessmen who engaged in deliberate, illegal polluting activities.\n\"Brightest Day Aftermath: The Search for the Swamp Thing\".\nThis three\u2013issue miniseries follows immediately after the events of \"Brightest Day\", and follows the actions of John Constantine as he tries to work out what has changed with the Swamp Thing and track him down, with the assistance of Zatanna, Batman, and Superman.\nVolume 5.\nDC Comics relaunched \"Swamp Thing\" with issue #1 in September 2011 as part of \"The New 52\", with writer Scott Snyder (#1-18 and \"Annual\"). Snyder's run concluded with \"Rotworld\", a crossover event between \"Swamp Thing\", \"Animal Man\" and \"Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.\" Charles Soule wrote issues #19-40.\nVolume 6.\nA six\u2013issue miniseries written by Len Wein, co-creator of the Swamp Thing, with art by Kelley Jones was released between March and August 2016. It follows Swamp Thing giving up his powers to Anton Arcane, who is disguised as Matt Cable.\nThis was followed by a Tom King winter special in 2018, also featuring Len Wein's last Swamp Thing issue.\n\"The Swamp Thing\".\nA 16-issue miniseries retitled with \"The\" written by Ram V with art by Mike Perkins began publication in March 2021. The book focuses on a new character named Levi Kami taking up the Swamp Thing mantle while Alec Holland is off-world. Originally planned as a 10-issue miniseries, \"The Swamp Thing\" has been extended to 16 issues, with \"The Swamp Thing\" #10 followed by a short hiatus before returning in March 2022.\nCharacter overview.\nLevi Kamei.\nThe latest version of Swamp Thing's secret identity is Levi Kamei, an immigrant scientist from India specializing in biology. Characterized as experiencing a loss of familial and culture identity, the character seeks to regain it, stemming from his more progressive views in contrast to his family and community, who distrust foreign corporations and their environmental impact. Like prior Swamp Things, Kamei also acts as a protector of nature and is a recognized expert in environmentalism within the superhero community.\nFictional character biography.\nAlexander Olsen.\nThe original version of the Swamp Thing, Alexander \"Alex\" Olsen was a talented young scientist in Louisiana in the early 1900s, married to Linda. Alex's assistant, Damian Ridge, was secretly in love with Linda and plotted the death of his friend. He tampered with Olsen's chemicals, killing him in the explosion, and dumped his body in the nearby swamp. Ridge used Linda's grief to convince her to marry him. However, Ridge was confronted by Alex Olsen, now a risen humanoid pile of vegetable matter. Olsen killed Ridge, but Linda did not recognize him and ran away. Olson was left to wander the swamps alone. It was later explained that Olson accepted the offer of the Parliament of Trees to join them, allowing the role of Swamp Thing to be vacated for a more worthy successor.\nLevi Kamei.\nAt a young age, Levi Kamei is unknowingly marked to become the Swamp Thing during a ritual performed to him and his brother, Jacob, by their mother. A descendant of a community that has watched over the Kaziranga wetlands for generations, he has differing views and later becomes a scientist for a foreign company, Prescot Industries. When his employers show interest in the Kaziranga wetlands, he attempts to help negotiate a deal with a community tribunal to sell the land in exhange for economic opportunities. The tribunal rejects the deal and protests ensue, but Prescot Industries use their political ties to force a deal and Levi's father is killed when the protests are violently broken up. A grieving Levi receives a vision of his future self as Swamp Thing and chooses to accept this new role in order to atone for his mistakes.\nAssisted by his girlfriend and fellow scientist Jennifer Reece to understand his power, others such as Amanda Waller and Prescot Industries seek to control him. Matters are also complicated when his rival in the Green is revealed to be his brother, now known as the Hadera. who believed he should have been the Avatar in place of his brother, having stronger environmentalist ideals. but falls towards using eco-terrorism to punish humanity for their crimes against nature. Conflict later escalates when Prescot Industries' interest in Levi as Swamp Thing results in them hiring Jason Woodrue, whose actions resurrects Levi's initial adversary, the Wanderer.\nLevi and his predecessor (existing as an extension of Levi's power to recall Alec's incarnation) becomes involved in the Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths storyline, wherein they're among the supernatural-affiliated questioning the Great Darkness's actions, having believed it too grand to meddle with mere mortals and joined Justice League Dark to assist them. With a team of superheroes, Levi helps investigate the Great Darkness's \"corruption\" and later lends his powers to Jon Kent to extract a machine revealed to be responsible for allowing the villain Pariah to manipulate a portion of the Great Darkness's power for his machinations. In the aftermath of Dark Crisis, Levi helps the Titans regrow an area of a rainforest and is recruited to the team as a part-time member to balance his role as the Avatar of the Green while lending his expertise.\nPowers and abilities.\nAlec Holland's powers and abilities.\nAn Avatar of the Green, Alec as Swamp Thing possess the power to control the aforementioned \"Green\", cosmic energies which animate all plant life in the known universe and is often the living embodiment of it, possesses various powers: being capable of inhabiting and animating vegetable matter at will, including those with alien origin, and move towards places wherever there's life. Swamp Thing also possesses various esoteric abilities, including the ability to change its size and shape with control over the vegetable matter within their given body and can even travel through time, superhuman strength, and other attributes capable of contending with powerful adversaries of great strength and also possesses regenerative powers.\nLevi Kamei's powers and abilities.\nLevi possess all the powers of the original Swamp Thing, with his body composed of vegetable matter and possessing superhuman strength, size changing abilities, and possess control over plant-life, in which also enables him to transfer his consciousness and become functionally immortal. Like other past versions of the character, these abilities stem from his status as Avatar of the Green and controlling the cosmic force that animates all plant-life known also as the \"Green\". Unique to him, he can shift between both his human form and Swamp Thing form. \nKamei is also a gifted scientist knowledgeable in biology and botany; his abilities coupled with his advanced knowledge distinguish him from previous Swamp Things by enabling his superhuman form to adopt various chemical compositions of other flora for an advantage (i.e having resistance against heavy metal toxicity by adapting chemical compositions from \"Pycnandra acuminata\").\nWeaknesses.\nSwamp Thing is susceptible to chemical compounds which typically prove disastrous to plant-life, making him capable of being poisoned. His powers can be impaired or completely disrupted if his connection to the Green is also cut off by mystical or scientific applications.\nAwards.\nOver the years, the \"Swamp Thing\" series has been nominated for and won several awards. Len Wein won the 1972 Shazam Award for \"Best Writer (Dramatic Division)\" and Berni Wrightson won the Shazam Award for \"Best Penciller (Dramatic Division)\" that same year for their work on \"Swamp Thing\". Wein and Wrightson also won the Shazam Award for \"Best Individual Story (Dramatic)\" in 1972 for \"Dark Genesis\" in \"Swamp Thing\" #1. The series won the Shazam Award for \"Best Continuing Feature\" in 1973.\nAlan Moore won the 1985 and 1986 Jack Kirby Awards for \"Best Writer\" for \"Swamp Thing\". Moore, John Totleben, and Steve Bissette won the 1985 Jack Kirby Award for \"Best Single Issue\" for \"Swamp Thing Annual\" #2. They also won the 1985, 1986, and 1987 Jack Kirby Awards for \"Best Continuing Series\" for \"Swamp Thing\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He produced a large body of work, consisting of essays, short fiction, and novels, spanning several overlapping genres including horror, fantastic fiction, and science fiction. Hodgson used his experiences at sea to lend authentic detail to his short horror stories, many of which are set on the ocean, including his series of linked tales forming the \"Sargasso Sea Stories\". His novels, such as \"The House on the Borderland\" (1908) and \"The Night Land\" (1912), feature more cosmic themes, but several of his novels also focus on horrors associated with the sea. Early in his writing career Hodgson dedicated effort to poetry, although few of his poems were published during his lifetime. He also attracted some notice as a photographer and achieved renown as a bodybuilder. He died in World War I at age 40.\nLife.\nEarly years and life at sea.\nHodgson was born in the hamlet of Blackmore End near Braintree in Essex, the son of the Reverend Samuel Hodgson, an Anglican priest, and Lissie Sarah Brown. He was the second of 12 children, three of whom died in infancy. The death of a child is a theme in several of Hodgson's works including the short stories \"The Valley of Lost Children\", \"The Sea-Horses\", and \"The Searcher of the End House\".\nHodgson's father was moved frequently and served 11 different parishes in 21 years, including one in Ardrahan, County Galway, Ireland. This setting was later featured in Hodgson's novel \"The House on the Borderland\".\nHodgson ran away from his boarding school at age 13, in an effort to become a sailor. He was caught and returned to his family, but eventually received his father's permission to be apprenticed as a cabin boy and began a four-year apprenticeship in 1891. Hodgson's father died shortly thereafter, of throat cancer, leaving the family impoverished; while William was away, the family subsisted largely on charity. After his apprenticeship ended in 1895, Hodgson began two years of study in Liverpool and was then able to pass the tests and receive his mate's certificate; he then began several more years as a sailor.\nAt sea, Hodgson experienced bullying. This led him to begin a programme of personal training. According to Sam Moskowitz,\nThe primary motivation of his body development was not health, but self-defence. His relatively short height and sensitive, almost beautiful face made him an irresistible target for bullying seamen. When they moved in to pulverize him, they would learn too late that they had come to grips with easily one of the most powerful men, pound for pound, in all England.\nThe theme of bullying of an apprentice by older seamen, and revenge taken, appeared frequently in his sea stories.\nWhile away at sea, in addition to his exercises with weights and with a punching bag, Hodgson also practised his photography, taking photographs of aurora borealis, cyclones, lightning, sharks, and the maggots that infested the food given to sailors. He also built up a stamp collection, practised his marksmanship while hunting, and kept journals of his experiences at sea. In November 1898, he was awarded the Royal Humane Society medal for heroism for saving another sailor who, in March of the same year, had fallen from the topmast into the sea in shark-infested waters off the coast of New Zealand.\nPhysical culture, essays and poetry.\nIn 1899, at age 22, he opened a School of Physical Culture in Ainsworth Street, Blackburn, England, as \"the inventor and teacher of a system that will cure indigestion\". The School offered tailored exercise regimes for personal training. Among his customers were members of the Blackburn police force. In 1902, Hodgson himself appeared on stage with handcuffs and other restraining devices supplied by the Blackburn police department and applied the restraints to Harry Houdini, who had previously escaped from the Blackburn jail. His behaviour towards Houdini generated controversy; the escape artist had some difficulty removing his restraints, complaining that Hodgson had deliberately injured him and jammed the locks of his handcuffs.\nHodgson was not shy of publicity, and in another notable stunt, rode a bicycle down a street so steep that it had stairs, an event written up in the local paper. Despite his reputation, he eventually found that he could not earn a living running his personal training business, which was seasonal in nature, and shut it down. He began instead writing articles such as \"Physical Culture versus Recreative Exercises\" (published in 1903). One of these articles, \"Health from Scientific Exercise\", featured photographs of Hodgson himself demonstrating his exercises. The market for such articles seemed to be limited, however; so, inspired by authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells, Jules Verne and Arthur Conan Doyle, Hodgson turned his attention to fiction, publishing his first short story, \"The Goddess of Death\", in 1904, followed shortly by \"A Tropical Horror\" (1905). He also contributed to an article in \"The Grand Magazine\", taking the \"No\" side in a debate on the topic \"Is the Mercantile Navy Worth Joining?\" In this piece, Hodgson laid out in detail his negative experiences at sea, including facts and figures about salaries. This led to a second article in \"The Nautical Magazine\", an expos\u00e9 on the subject of apprenticeships; at the time, families often were forced to pay to have boys accepted as apprentices. Hodgson began to give paid lectures, illustrated with his photography in the form of colorized slides, about his experiences at sea.\nAlthough he wrote a number of poems, only a handful were published during his lifetime; several, such as \"Madre Mia\" (1907), appeared as dedications to his novels. Apparently cynical about the prospects of publishing his poetry, in 1906 he published an article in \"The Author\" magazine, suggesting that poets could earn money by writing inscriptions for tombstones. Many of his poems were published by his widow in two posthumous collections, but some 48 poems were not published until their appearance in the collection \"The Lost Poetry of William Hope Hodgson\" (2005).\nCareer in fiction, and marriage.\nHodgson's first short story was \"The Goddess of Death\" (1904), in which he utilised a statue of Flora which stood in Corporation Park, Blackburn, as the focus of a tale in which a Hindu statue, seized from an Indian temple, stood in a small English town. The statue comes alive to take its revenge on the people who stole it. \"The Royal Magazine\" published the story in April 1904.\nIn 1906, the American magazine \"The Monthly Story Magazine\" published \"From the Tideless Sea\", the first of Hodgson's Sargasso Sea stories. Hodgson continued to sell stories to American magazines as well as British magazines for the remainder of his career, carefully managing the rights to his work in order to maximize his remuneration.\nWhile he still lived with his mother in relative poverty, his first published novel, \"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\"\", appeared in 1907, to positive reviews. Hodgson also published \"The Voice in the Night\" the same year, as well as \"Through the Vortex of a Cyclone\", a realistic story inspired by Hodgson's experiences at sea and illustrated with tinted slides made from his own photographs; Hodgson had previously used these slides to illustrate a \"lantern lecture\" entitled \"Through the Heart of a Cyclone\", which he had given at the Trinity Wesleyan School in Montague Street, Blackburn, on 16 November 1906. Hodgson also explored the subject of ships and cyclones in his story \"The Shamraken Homeward-Bounder\" (1908). Also in 1908, Hodgson published his second novel, \"The House on the Borderland\", again to positive reviews, as well as an unusual satirical science fiction story, , a Swiftian satire in which it is suggested that war should be carried out by men fighting in pens with knives, and the corpses carefully salvaged for food, although in letters to the editor published at the time, Hodgson expressed strong patriotic sentiments.\nIn 1909, he published \"Out of the Storm\", a short horror story about \"the death-side of the sea\", in which the protagonist drowning in a storm rants about the horrors of a storm at sea. According to Moskowitz,\nThis story proved an emotional testament beyond all other evidence. Hodgson, whose literary success would be in a large measure based on the impressions he received at sea, actually hated and feared the waters with an intensity that was the passion of his life.\nAlso in 1909, Hodgson published another novel, \"The Ghost Pirates\". In the foreword, he wrote that it\n... completes what, perhaps, may be termed a trilogy; for, though very different in scope, each of the three books deals with certain conceptions that have an elemental kinship. With this book, the author believes that he closes the door, so far as he is concerned, on a particular phase of constructive thought.\n\"The Bookman\" magazine in its review of the novel in 1909 concluded with the comment:\nWe can only hope that Mr. Hodgson may be induced to reconsider his decision, for we know of nothing like the author's previous work in the whole of present-day literature.\nDespite the critical success of his novels, Hodgson remained relatively poor. To try to bolster his income from short story sales, he began working on the first of his recurring characters, Thomas Carnacki, featured in several of his most famous stories and partly inspired by Algernon Blackwood's occult detective John Silence. The first of these, \"The Gateway of the Monster\", was published in \"The Idler\" (1910). In 1910, Hodgson also published \"The Captain of the Onion Boat\", an unusual story that combines a nautical tale and a romance. He continued to publish many stories and non-fiction pieces, occasionally resorting to the use of recycled plot elements and situations, sometimes to the annoyance of his publishers.\nHis last novel to see publication, \"The Night Land\", was published in 1912, although it likely had its genesis a number of years earlier. Hodgson also worked on a 10,000-word novelette version of the novel, now known as \"The Dream of X\" (1912). He continued to branch out into related genres, publishing \"Judge Barclay's Wife\", a Western adventure, in the United States, as well as several non-supernatural mystery stories and the science fiction story \"The Derelict\" (1912), and even war stories (several of the Captain Gault tales feature wartime themes).\nIn 1912, Hodgson married Betty Farnworth, known also as Bessie, a girl from Cheadle Hulme and a staff member who wrote the \"agony\" column for the women's magazine \"Home Notes\". Both were 35. She gave up her job after they married on 26 February 1913, in the London borough of Kensington. They moved to the south of France and took up residence there, owing in part to the low cost of living. Hodgson began a work entitled \"Captain Dang (An account of certain peculiar and somewhat memorable adventures)\" and continued to publish stories in multiple genres, although financial security continued to elude him. When war broke out in Europe, the Hodgsons returned to England.\nLater life, World War I experience.\nHodgson joined the University of London's Officers' Training Corps. Refusing to have anything to do with the sea despite his experience and Third Mate's certificate, he received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 3 July 1915. In 1916, he was thrown from a horse and suffered a broken jaw and a serious head injury; he received a mandatory discharge on 10 June 1916, and returned to writing.\nRefusing to remain on the sidelines of WWI, Hodgson recovered sufficiently to re-enlist, receiving a new commission as second lieutenant on 18 March 1917. On 10 October 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant, though this was not gazetted until after his death. His published articles and stories from the time reflect his experience in war.\nDeath.\nHodgson was killed by the direct impact of an artillery shell at the Fourth Battle of Ypres in April 1918; sources suggest either the 17th or 19th. He was eulogized in \"The Times\" on 2 May 1918. The American magazine \"Adventure\", to which Hodgson had contributed fiction, also ran an obituary which reprinted a clipping from his widow, describing how Hodgson led a group of\nNCOs to safety under heavy fire.\nMost famous works.\nHodgson is most widely known for two works. \"The House on the Borderland\" (1908) is a novel of which H. P. Lovecraft, in his long essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", wrote \"but for a few touches of commonplace sentimentality [it] would be a classic of the first water\". \"The Night Land\" (1912) is a much longer novel, written in an archaic style and expressing a sombre vision of a sunless far-future world; Lovecraft described it as \"one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written\". These works both contain elements of science fiction, although they also partake of horror and the occult. According to critical consensus, in these works, despite his often laboured and clumsy language, Hodgson achieves a deep power of expression which focuses on a sense not only of terror but as well of the ubiquity of \"potential\" terror, of the thinness of the invisible boundary between the world of normality and an underlying, unaccountable reality for which humans are not suited.\n\"The Ghost Pirates\" (1909) has less of a reputation than \"The House on the Borderland\", but is an effective seafaring horror story of a ship attacked and ultimately dragged down to its doom by supernatural creatures. The book purports to be the spoken testimony of the sole survivor, and the style lacks the pseudo-archaism which makes \"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\"\" (1907) and \"The Night Land\" tedious reading for many.\nHodgson is also known for his short stories featuring recurring characters: the \"detective of the occult\" Thomas Carnacki, and the smuggler Captain Gault. The Carnacki story \"The Whistling Room\" has been reprinted in numerous anthologies, including collections introduced by Alfred Hitchcock. Hodgson's single most famous short story is probably \"The Voice in the Night\" (1907), which has been adapted for film twice. Another story regarded highly by critics is \"The Shamraken Homeward-Bounder\".\nHodgson's work is said to have had an influence on H.P. Lovecraft, even though Lovecraft did not read his works until 1934. In a 2009 essay, China Mi\u00e9ville traces the origin of \"the tentacle\" as an object of horror to Hodgson's \"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\"\", but the motif had already been used by M. R. James in \"Count Magnus\", which Lovecraft first read shortly before employing the motif.\nLiterary influence.\nAfter his death, Hodgson's work was largely forgotten. In the 1930s, however, Hodgson's supernatural fiction was anthologised in both Colin de la Mare's \"They Walk Again\" (1931) and Dennis Wheatley's \"A Century of Horror Stories\" (1935); this began a revival of interest in Hodgson's work.\nIn 1934, Herman Charles Koenig, a book collector who was friends with H. P. Lovecraft, introduced Lovecraft and his friends to Hodgson's weird fiction books. Lovecraft responded to the books with enthusiasm and praised Hodgson in the second edition of his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\". Other writers in the \"Lovecraft circle\", including Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth and Fritz Leiber, also read and expressed admiration for Hodgson's work. In the late 1940s Derleth's Arkham House published two omnibus editions of Hodgson's work, \"The House on the Borderland and Other Novels\" and an expanded edition of \"Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder\". These books helped popularise Hodgson's work in the United States.\nHodgson's work was inspirational to many science fiction and fantasy writers. In Britain, Adrian Ross, Olaf Stapledon and Dennis Wheatley were all influenced by Hodgson's work. Across the Atlantic, the American writers Clark Ashton Smith, Henry S. Whitehead, and Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore, were also influenced by Hodgson's writings. Modern authors who cite Hodgson as an influence include Iain Sinclair, Gene Wolfe, Greg Bear, China Mi\u00e9ville, Simon Clark, Elizabeth Massie, Tim Lebbon, and Brian Keene.\nHodgson's literary estate.\nHodgson's widow, Bessie, worked to keep his books in print and to publish works he was not able to get published during his lifetime, including two books of poetry. After Bessie Hodgson died in 1943, Hodgson's sister Lissie took over his literary estate.\nWhile the first six Carnacki stories were collected during Hodgson's lifetime, \"The Haunted Jarvee\" appeared posthumously in 1929, and two more Carnacki stories, \"The Find\" and \"The Hog,\" were published in 1947 by August Derleth.\nOne Captain Gault story, \"The Plans of the Reefing Bi-Plane\", was not published until 1996, when it was included in the short story collection \"Terrors of the Sea\".\nSome of Hodgson's poems were first published in 2005, when they appeared in \"The Lost Poetry of William Hope Hodgson\".\nA number of other Hodgson works are reprinted for the first time since their original publication in the five-volume \"Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson\" series published by Night Shade Books.\nCopyright protection has now expired on most of Hodgson's work, , including many of his poems.\nNovels.\nOrder of writing versus order of publication.\nSam Gafford, in his 1997 essay \"Writing Backwards: The Novels of William Hope Hodgson\" has suggested that Hodgson's four major novels may have been published in roughly the reverse order of their writing. If this is true, then \"The Night Land\" was Hodgson's first novel, in which he poured out his imagination at its most unbridled, and not his last. Gafford writes:\nThis concern over the order of composition of the novels may seem of little importance until we consider the implications toward Hodgson's work overall. .. in effect, Hodgson moved away from \"TNL\"'s quasi-science fiction scenario (which contained an astounding number of original conceptions) and toward \"BoGC\"'s more basic adventure slant.\nIf we accept Gafford's thesis, then Hodgson actually wrote \"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\"\" last, and it benefits from the modernization of style to the point where it is Hodgson's most accessible novel:\nWhen he finishes the group with \"BoGC\", Hodgson has managed to rid himself of these affectations of style and produces a book written in a flat but serviceable tone. With each book, Hodgson learns better control of language and more writing savvy and eventually begins to develop his own voice.\nBut despite the excessively archaic prose style, which does make them less approachable, it is actually Hodgson's earlier works that are considered masterpieces today. And as Gafford says:\n...we can only wonder what wonderfully imaginative excesses like \"The Night Land\" may have been lost because of an unappreciative public.\nShort stories.\nMiscellaneous stories.\n\"Note\": the following list of stories is based on the five-volume \"Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson\" published by Night Shade Books, completed in late 2006. The list includes details of first publication, where known.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65020", "revid": "48181213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65020", "title": "Adapter pattern", "text": "Design pattern in computer programming\nIn software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.\nAn example is an adapter that converts the interface of a Document Object Model of an XML document into a tree structure that can be displayed.\nOverview.\nThe adapter design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known Gang of Four design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.\nThe adapter design pattern solves problems like:\nOften an (already existing) class can not be reused only because its interface does not conform to the interface clients require.\nThe adapter design pattern describes how to solve such problems:\nThe key idea in this pattern is to work through a separate codice_1 that adapts the interface of an (already existing) class without changing it.\nClients don't know whether they work with a codice_3 class directly or through an codice_1 with a class that does not have the codice_3 interface.\nSee also the UML class diagram below.\nDefinition.\nAn adapter allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the real-world definition for an adapter. Interfaces may be incompatible, but the inner functionality should suit the need. The adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.\nUsage.\nAn adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior. Alternatively, a decorator pattern makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time, and a facade pattern is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired.\nStructure.\nUML class diagram.\nIn the above UML class diagram, the codice_9 class that requires a codice_3 interface cannot reuse the codice_2 class directly because its interface doesn't conform to the codice_3 interface.\nInstead, the codice_9 works through an codice_1 class that implements the codice_3 interface in terms of codice_2:\nObject adapter pattern.\nIn this adapter pattern, the adapter contains an instance of the class it wraps. In this situation, the adapter makes calls to the instance of the wrapped object.\nClass adapter pattern.\nThis adapter pattern uses multiple polymorphic interfaces implementing or inheriting both the interface that is expected and the interface that is pre-existing. It is typical for the expected interface to be created as a pure interface class, especially in languages such as Java (before JDK 1.8) that do not support multiple inheritance of classes.\nA further form of runtime adapter pattern.\nMotivation from compile time solution.\nIt is desired for \n to supply \n with some data, let us suppose some \n data. A compile time solution is:\nclassB.setStringData(classA.getStringData());\nHowever, suppose that the format of the string data must be varied. A compile time solution is to use inheritance:\npublic class Format1ClassA extends ClassA {\n @Override\n public String getStringData() {\n return format(toString());\nand perhaps create the correctly \"formatting\" object at runtime by means of the factory pattern.\nRun-time adapter solution.\nA solution using \"adapters\" proceeds as follows:\nImplementation of the adapter pattern.\nWhen implementing the adapter pattern, for clarity, one can apply the class name \n to the provider implementation; for example, \n. It should have a constructor method with an adaptee class variable as a parameter. This parameter will be passed to an instance member of \n. When the clientMethod is called, it will have access to the adaptee instance that allows for accessing the required data of the adaptee and performing operations on that data that generates the desired output.\nJava.\npackage org.wikipedia.examples;\ninterface ILightningPhone {\n void recharge();\n void useLightning();\ninterface IMicroUsbPhone {\n void recharge();\n void useMicroUsb();\nclass Iphone implements ILightningPhone {\n private boolean connector;\n @Override\n public void useLightning() {\n connector = true;\n System.out.println(\"Lightning connected\");\n @Override\n public void recharge() {\n if (connector) {\n System.out.println(\"Recharge started\");\n System.out.println(\"Recharge finished\");\n } else {\n System.out.println(\"Connect Lightning first\");\nclass Android implements IMicroUsbPhone {\n private boolean connector;\n @Override\n public void useMicroUsb() {\n connector = true;\n System.out.println(\"MicroUsb connected\");\n @Override\n public void recharge() {\n if (connector) {\n System.out.println(\"Recharge started\");\n System.out.println(\"Recharge finished\");\n } else {\n System.out.println(\"Connect MicroUsb first\");\n/* exposing the target interface while wrapping source object */\nclass LightningToMicroUsbAdapter implements IMicroUsbPhone {\n private final ILightningPhone lightningPhone;\n public LightningToMicroUsbAdapter(ILightningPhone lightningPhone) {\n this.lightningPhone = lightningPhone;\n @Override\n public void useMicroUsb() {\n System.out.println(\"MicroUsb connected\");\n lightningPhone.useLightning();\n @Override\n public void recharge() {\n lightningPhone.recharge();\npublic class AdapterDemo {\n static void rechargeMicroUsbPhone(IMicroUsbPhone phone) {\n phone.useMicroUsb();\n phone.recharge();\n static void rechargeLightningPhone(ILightningPhone phone) {\n phone.useLightning();\n phone.recharge();\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n Android android = new Android();\n Iphone iPhone = new Iphone();\n System.out.println(\"Recharging android with MicroUsb\");\n rechargeMicroUsbPhone(android);\n System.out.println(\"Recharging iPhone with Lightning\");\n rechargeLightningPhone(iPhone);\n System.out.println(\"Recharging iPhone with MicroUsb\");\n rechargeMicroUsbPhone(new LightningToMicroUsbAdapter(iPhone));\nOutput\nPython.\nAdapter pattern example.\nfrom abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod\nfrom typing import NoReturn\nRECHARGE: list[str] = [\"Recharge started.\", \"Recharge finished.\"]\nCONNECTED_MSG: str = \"{} connected.\"\nCONNECT_FIRST_MSG: str = \"Connect {} first.\"\nclass RechargeTemplate(metaclass = ABCMeta):\n @abstractmethod\n def recharge(self) -&gt;

A static library can be re-used (a form of sharing) in multiple executables, but each executable contains a copy of the library code instead of \nsharing a copy in memory with other executables. Although not true today, historically, all libraries were static. Although a shared library can have static linkage, such a library is not classified as a static library.\nOften, a shared library is also a dynamic library; loaded by a dynamic linker which generally makes use of the library easier for the programmer than if it instead it had static linkage. A dynamic library need not be accessible to multiple executables (shared library) and a shared library need not be loaded at consumer runtime (dynamic library).\nMemory sharing.\nLibrary code may be shared in memory by multiple processes and on disk. If virtual memory is used, processes would execute the same physical page of RAM mapped into the processes' different address spaces. This has advantages. For instance, on the OpenStep system, applications were often only a few hundred kilobytes in size and loaded quickly; most of their code was located in libraries already loaded for other purposes by the operating system.\nPrograms can accomplish RAM sharing by using position-independent code, as in Unix, which leads to a complex but flexible architecture, or by using common virtual addresses, as in Windows and OS/2. These systems ensure that code has a high probability of being shared by various means, like pre-mapping the address space and reserving slots for each shared library. A third alternative is a single-level store with a single address space, as used by the IBM System/38 and its successors. This allows position-dependent code, with programs and libraries assigned a permanent address in that address space.\nIn some cases, different versions of shared libraries can cause problems, especially when libraries of different versions have the same file name and various applications are installed on a system, each requiring a specific version. This scenario is known as DLL hell, named after the Windows and OS/2 DLL files. Most modern operating systems after 2001 have clean-up methods to eliminate such situations or use application-specific \"private\" libraries.\nExamples.\nThe following commonly-used library technologies are both shared and dynamic in nature.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These members access the system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details.\nOverview.\nThe Facade\ndesign pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known \n\"GoF design patterns\" \nthat describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.\nWhat problems can the Facade design pattern solve?\nClients that access a complex subsystem directly refer to (depend on) many different objects having different interfaces (tight coupling), which makes the clients hard to implement, change, test, and reuse.\nWhat solution does the Facade design pattern describe?\nDefine a codice_1 object that \nThis enables to work through a codice_1 object to minimize the dependencies on a subsystem.\n&lt;br&gt;\nSee also the UML class and sequence diagram below.\nUsage.\nA Facade is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired. Alternatively, an adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior. A decorator makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time.\nThe facade pattern is typically used when\nStructure.\nUML class and sequence diagram.\nIn this UML class diagram, \nthe codice_3 class doesn't access the subsystem classes directly.\nInstead, the codice_3 works through a codice_1 class that implements a simple interface in terms of (by delegating to) the subsystem classes (codice_6, codice_7, and codice_8).\nThe codice_3 depends only on the simple codice_1 interface\nand is independent of the complex subsystem.\nThe sequence diagram \nshows the run-time interactions: The codice_3 object \nworks through a codice_1 object that delegates the request to\nthe codice_6, codice_7, and codice_8\ninstances that perform the request.\n The facade class abstracts Packages 1, 2, and 3 from the rest of the application.\n The objects are using the facade pattern to access resources from the packages.\nExample.\nThis is an abstract example of how a client (\"you\") interacts with a facade (the \"computer\") to a complex system (internal computer parts, like CPU and HardDrive).\nC++.\nimport std;\nusing std::string;\nusing std::string_view;\nclass CPU {\nprivate:\npublic:\n void freeze() {\n void jump(long position) {\n void execute() {\nclass HardDrive {\nprivate:\npublic:\n string read(long lba, int size) {\nclass Memory {\nprivate:\npublic:\n void load(long position, string_view data) {\nclass ComputerFacade {\nprivate:\n CPU cpu;\n Memory memory;\n HardDrive hardDrive;\n const long bootAddress;\n const long bootSector;\n const int sectorSize;\npublic:\n ComputerFacade(long bootAddress, long bootSector, int sectorSize):\n void start() {\n cpu.freeze();\n memory.load(bootAddress, hardDrive.read(bootSector, sectorSize));\n cpu.jump(bootAddress);\n cpu.execute();\n};\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n ComputerFacade computer(/* parameters here */);\n computer.start();\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"Our Gang\" shorts were later syndicated to television as \"The Little Rascals\".\nIn addition to his work in \"Our Gang\" and its feature-film spin-off \"General Spanky\" (1936), McFarland regularly appeared in co-starring or supporting juvenile roles in feature films produced by other studios throughout the 1930s. These included \"Kentucky Kernels\" (1934) with Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey, \"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\" (1936) with Sylvia Sidney and Fred MacMurray, and \"Peck's Bad Boy with the Circus\" (1938). Leaving acting as a teenager, McFarland had several varying careers as an adult before finding success as a sales executive. He spent the final decades of his life as a public speaker reflecting on his child-acting career.\nEarly life.\nMcFarland was born in Dallas, Texas, on October 2, 1928, to Virginia Winifred (n\u00e9e Phillips) and Robert Emmett McFarland. He had three siblings: Thomas (\"Tommy\", who appeared in a few \"Our Gang\" episodes as \"Dynamite\"), Amanda, and Roderick (\"Rod\"). He attended Lancaster High School in Lancaster, Texas.\nBefore joining the \"Our Gang\" comedies, \"Sonny\", as he was called by his family, modeled children's clothing for a Dallas department store and was also seen around the Dallas area on highway billboards and in print advertisements for Wonder Bread. This established Sonny early on in the local public's eye as an adorable child model and provided experience before cameras.\nCareer.\n\"Our Gang\".\nIn January 1931, in response to a trade magazine advertisement from Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, requesting photographs of \"cute kids\", Spanky's Aunt Dottie (Virginia's sister) sent pictures from Sonny's portfolio. An invitation for a screen test arrived that spring, leading to his acting career. Portions of Spanky's screen test are included in a 1932 \"Our Gang\" entry, \"Spanky\".\nThe nickname \"Spanky\" is erroneously said to have arisen from warnings by his mother not to misbehave during one of the initial discussions with Hal Roach in his office. McFarland contradicted the tale, saying that the name was given by a Los Angeles newspaper reporter. Use of the \"Spanky\" name by McFarland for subsequent business or personal activities was expressly granted to McFarland in one of his studio contracts. In later years some family members would affectionately refer to him as \"Spank\".\nUpon being discovered at age three, he instantly became a key member of the \"Our Gang\" children's comedy movie series and one of Hollywood's stars. His earliest films show him as an outspoken toddler, grumpily going along with the rest of the gang. His scene-stealing abilities brought him more attention, and by 1935 he was the \"de facto\" leader of the gang, often paired with Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer, and always the enterprising \"idea man\". Switzer's character became as much of a scene-stealer as the young McFarland was, and the two boys' fathers fought constantly over screen time and star billing for their children.\nSpanky McFarland's only starring feature-film role was in the 1936 Hal Roach film \"General Spanky\", an unsuccessful attempt to move the \"Our Gang\" series into features. He also appeared as a juvenile performer in many non-Roach feature films, including the Wheeler &amp; Woolsey comedy \"Kentucky Kernels\", the early Technicolor feature \"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\" (1936), and two Fritz Lang features of the 1940s.\nFollowing the 1938 \"Our Gang\" short \"Came the Brawn\", McFarland \"retired\" from \"Our Gang\", beginning a personal appearance tour. In mid-1938, Hal Roach sold the \"Our Gang\" unit to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who began casting for a new \"team leader\" character in Spanky's vein and ended up rehiring McFarland himself. He remained in the MGM \"Our Gang\" productions until his final appearance in the series \"Unexpected Riches\" in 1942, at age fourteen.\nLater years.\nIn 1952, at age 24, McFarland joined the U.S. Air Force. Upon his return to civilian life, indelibly typecast in the public's mind as \"Spanky\" from \"Our Gang,\" he found himself unable to find work in show business. He took less glamorous jobs, including work at a soft drink plant, a hamburger stand, and a popsicle factory. In the mid-1950s, when the \"Our Gang\" comedies were syndicated on television as \"The Little Rascals\", McFarland hosted an afternoon children's show, \"The Spanky Show\", on KOTV television in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The show included a studio audience and appearances by other celebrities such as James Arness. \"Little Rascals\" shorts were also shown. Station executives prevented McFarland from developing and expanding the show's format, and by 1960 McFarland had quit the show.\nAfter that stint, he continued at odd jobs: selling wine, operating a restaurant and night club, and selling appliances, electronics, and furniture. He was selling for Philco-Ford Corporation, where he advanced to national sales training director. During this time, McFarland continued to make personal appearances and cameo roles in films and television, including an appearance on \"The Mike Douglas Show\" with Darla Hood and William \"Buckwheat\" Thomas. \nIn 1985, as general manager, McFarland helped launch the classic movie channel The Nostalgia Channel. During the 1990s, after his self-described \"semi-retirement\", Spanky lent his name and celebrity to help raise money for charities, primarily by participating in golf tournaments. Spanky also had his own namesake charity golf classic for 16 years, held in Marion, Indiana. He also traveled the country doing speaking engagements and lectures about his movie roles and his days in the \"Our Gang\". His final television appearance was in 1993, playing himself in the cold open of the \"Cheers\" episode \"Woody Gets An Election\".\nIn January 1994, McFarland posthumously joined fellow alumnus Jackie Cooper to become one of only two \"Our Gang\" members to receive a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.\nDeath.\nMcFarland died of \"a heart attack or an aneurysm\" at his home; his remains were cremated shortly thereafter. A cenotaph for McFarland to be placed at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas, has been approved, but according to the cemetery's website, has yet to be installed.\nNamesake.\nThe 1960s sunshine pop rock group Spanky and Our Gang named themselves after McFarland's character because singer Elaine \"Spanky\" McFarlane's last name was similar to his. However, this is disputed by biographer Bruce Eder, who has said her fellow musician Arnie Lanza gave her the nickname \"Spanky,\" based on what he saw as her resemblance to George McFarland who played \"Spanky\" in the Our Gang comedies.\nIn 1990, McFarland filed a $100,000 lawsuit against a bar owner in St. Paul, Minnesota. McFarland claimed that \"Spanky's\" bar on East 7th Street used his name and face for thirteen years without permission. The lawsuit also called for McFarland to receive all of the internal merchandise and equipment featuring his likeness. The case was eventually settled, and the owner changed the name to Checker's Bar.\nFilmography.\nMcFarland appeared as \"Spanky\" in 95 \"Our Gang\" films between 1932 and 1942. He also appeared in:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"bridge\" uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.\nWhen a class varies often, the features of object-oriented programming become very useful because changes to a program's code can be made easily with minimal prior knowledge about the program. The bridge pattern is useful when both the class and what it does vary often. The class itself can be thought of as the \"abstraction\" and what the class can do as the \"implementation\". The bridge pattern can also be thought of as two layers of abstraction.\nWhen there is only one fixed implementation, this pattern is known as the Pimpl idiom in the C++ world.\nThe bridge pattern is often confused with the adapter pattern, and is often implemented using the object adapter pattern; e.g., in the Java code below.\nVariant: The implementation can be decoupled even more by deferring the presence of the implementation to the point where the abstraction is utilized.\nOverview.\nThe Bridge design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known \"GoF design patterns\" that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.\nWhat problems can the Bridge design pattern solve?\nWhen using subclassing, different subclasses implement an abstract class in different ways.

Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are pneumatically inflated structures, providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint, called a contact patch, designed to match the vehicle's weight and the bearing on the surface that it rolls over by exerting a pressure that will avoid deforming the surface.\nThe materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric, and wire, along with carbon black and other chemical compounds. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air. Before rubber was developed, tires were metal bands fitted around wooden wheels to hold the wheel together under load and to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many vehicles, including cars, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks, heavy equipment, and aircraft. Metal tires are used on locomotives and railcars, and solid rubber (or other polymers) tires are also used in various non-automotive applications, such as casters, carts, lawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.\nUnmaintained tires can lead to severe hazards for vehicles and people, ranging from flat tires making the vehicle inoperable to blowouts, where tires explode during operation and possibly damage vehicles and injure people. The manufacture of tires is often highly regulated for this reason. Because of the widespread use of tires for motor vehicles, tire waste is a substantial portion of global waste. There is a need for tire recycling through mechanical recycling and reuse, such as for crumb rubber and other tire-derived aggregate, and pyrolysis for chemical reuse, such as for tire-derived fuel. If not recycled properly or burned, waste tires release toxic chemicals into the environment. Moreover, the regular use of tires produces micro-plastic particles that contain these chemicals that both enter the environment and affect human health.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology and spelling.\nThe word \"tire\" is a short form of \"attire\", from the idea that a wheel with a tire is a dressed wheel.\n\"Tyre\" is the oldest spelling, and both \"tyre\" and \"tire\" were used during the 15th and 16th centuries. During the 17th and 18th centuries, \"tire\" became more common in print. The spelling \"tyre\" did not reappear until the 1840s when the English began shrink-fitting railway car wheels with malleable iron. Nevertheless, many publishers continued using \"tire\". \"The Times\" newspaper in London was still using \"tire\" as late as 1905. The spelling \"tyre\" began to be commonly used in the 19th century for pneumatic tires in the UK. The 1911 edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" states that \"The spelling 'tyre' is not now accepted by the best English authorities, and is unrecognized in the US\", while Fowler's \"Modern English Usage\" of 1926 describes that \"there is nothing to be said for 'tyre', which is etymologically wrong, as well as needlessly divergent from our own [sc. British] older &amp; the present American usage\". However, over the 20th century, \"tyre\" became established as the standard British spelling.\nHistory.\nThe earliest tires were bands of leather in Sumer, then iron (later steel) placed on wooden wheels used on carts and wagons. A skilled worker, known as a wheelwright, would cause the tire to expand by heating it in a forge fire, placing it over the wheel, and quenching it, causing the metal to contract back to its original size to fit tightly on the wheel.\nThe first patent for what appears to be a standard pneumatic tire appeared in 1847 and was lodged by Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson. However, this idea never went into production. The first practical pneumatic tire was made in 1888 on May Street, Belfast, by Scots-born John Boyd Dunlop, owner of one of Ireland's most prosperous veterinary practices. It was an effort to prevent the headaches of his 10-year-old son Johnnie while riding his tricycle on rough pavements. His doctor Sir John Fagan, had prescribed cycling as an exercise for the boy and was a regular visitor. Fagan participated in designing the first pneumatic tires. Cyclist Willie Hume demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tires in 1889, winning the tire's first-ever races in Ireland and then England. In Dunlop's tire patent specification dated 31 October 1888, his interest is only in its use in cycles and light vehicles. In September 1890, he was made aware of an earlier development, but the company kept the information to itself. In 1892, Dunlop's patent was declared invalid because of the prior art by forgotten fellow Scot Robert William Thomson of London (patents London 1845, France 1846, USA 1847). However, Dunlop is credited with \"realizing rubber could withstand the wear and tear of being a tire while retaining its resilience\". John Boyd Dunlop and Harvey du Cros worked through the ensuing considerable difficulties. They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and acquired other rights and patents, which allowed them some limited protection of their Pneumatic Tyre business's position. Pneumatic Tyre would become Dunlop Rubber and Dunlop Tyres. The development of this technology hinged on myriad engineering advances, including the vulcanization of natural rubber using sulfur, as well as the development of the \"clincher\" rim for holding the tire in place laterally on the wheel rim.\nSynthetic rubbers were invented in the laboratories of Bayer in the 1920s. Rubber shortages in the United Kingdom during WWII prompted research on alternatives to rubber tires with suggestions including leather, compressed asbestos, rayon, felt, bristles, and paper.\nIn 1946, Michelin developed the radial tire method of construction. Michelin had bought the bankrupt Citro\u00ebn automobile company in 1934 to utilize this new technology. Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the US, the outdated bias-ply tire construction persisted until the Ford Motor Company adopted radial tires in the early 1970s, following a 1968 article in an influential American magazine, \"Consumer Reports\", highlighting the superiority of radial construction. The US tire industry lost its market share to Japanese and European manufacturers, which bought out US companies.\nApplications.\nTires may be classified according to the type of vehicle they serve. They may be distinguished by the load they carry and by their application, e.g. to a motor vehicle, aircraft, or bicycle.\nAutomotive.\nLight\u2013medium duty.\nLight-duty tires for passenger vehicles carry loads in the range of on the drive wheel. Light-to-medium duty trucks and vans carry loads in the range of on the drive wheel. They are differentiated by speed rating for different vehicles, including (starting from the lowest speed to the highest): winter tires, light truck tires, entry-level car tires, sedans and vans, sport sedans, and high-performance cars. Apart from road tires, there are special categories:\nOther types of light-duty automotive tires include run-flat tires and race car tires:\nHeavy duty.\nHeavy-duty tires for large trucks and buses come in a variety of profiles and carry loads in the range of on the drive wheel. These are typically mounted in tandem on the drive axle.\nOther.\nAircraft, bicycles, and a variety of industrial applications have distinct design requirements.\nConstruction types.\nTire construction spans pneumatic tires used on cars, trucks, and aircraft, but also includes non-automotive applications with slow-moving, light-duty, or railroad applications, which may have non-pneumatic tires.\nAutomotive.\nFollowing the 1968 \"Consumer Reports\" announcement of the superiority of the radial design, radial tires began an inexorable climb in market share, reaching 100% of the North American market in the 1980s. Radial tire technology is now the standard design for essentially all automotive tires, but other methods have been used.\nRadial (or radial-ply) tire construction utilizes body ply cords extending straight across the tread from bead to bead\u2014so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to one another\u2014as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The plies are generally made of nylon, polyester, or steel, and the belts of steel, fiberglass, or Kevlar. The tire's footprint, wider than a bias tire's, and flexible sidewalls provide a better grip in turns, and its circumferential belts stabilize it. The advantages of this construction over that of a bias tire are many, including longer tread life, better steering control, lower rolling resistance, improved fuel economy, more uniform wear, higher heat resistance, fewer blowouts, and a steadier, more comfortable ride at speed. Disadvantages, besides a higher cost than that of bias tires, are a harder ride at low speeds and generally worse performance on rough terrain. Radial tires are also seldom seen in diameters of greater than 42 inches, as such tires are difficult to make.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Bias tire (bias-ply, or cross-ply) construction utilizes body ply cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles in the range of 30 to 40 degrees from the direction of travel. Successive plies are laid at opposing angles, forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. Such a design is resistant to sidewall deformation and punctures (and to punctures\u2019 expansion, or \"torque splitting\") and therefore durable in severe use. Since the tread and sidewalls share their casing plies, the tire body flexes as a whole, providing the main advantage of this construction, better traction and smoother motion on uneven surfaces, with a greater tendency to conform to rocky ground and throw off mud and clay, especially because the rubber is usually of a softer compound than that used on radial tires. However, this conformity increases a bias tire's rolling resistance, and its stiffness allows less control, traction, and comfort at higher speeds, while shear between its overlapping plies causes friction that generates heat. Still, bias tires benefit from simpler structure and so cost less than like-size radials, and they remain in use on heavy equipment and off-road vehicles, although the earthmoving market has shifted to radials.\nA belted bias tire starts with two or more bias plies to which stabilizer belts are bonded directly beneath the tread. This construction provides a smoother ride that is similar to the bias tire, while lessening rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness. The design was introduced by Armstrong, while Goodyear made it popular with the \"Polyglas\" trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of fiberglass. The \"belted\" tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in conventional tires, and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve performance compared to non-belted bias tires. The belts may be fiberglass or steel.\nOther.\nTubeless tires are pneumatic tires that do not require a separate inner tube.\nSemi-pneumatic tires have a hollow center, but they are not pressurized. They are lightweight, low-cost, puncture-proof, and provide cushioning. These tires often come as a complete assembly with the wheel and even integral ball bearings. They are used on lawn mowers, wheelchairs, and wheelbarrows. They can also be rugged, typically used in industrial applications, and are designed to not pull off their rim under use.\nAn airless tire is a non-pneumatic tire that is not supported by air pressure. They are most commonly used on small vehicles, such as golf carts, and on utility vehicles in situations where the risk of puncture is high, such as on construction equipment. Many tires used in industrial and commercial applications are non-pneumatic, and are manufactured from solid rubber and plastic compounds via molding operations. Solid tires include those used for lawnmowers, skateboards, golf carts, scooters, and many types of light industrial vehicles, carts, and trailers. One of the most common applications for solid tires is for material handling equipment (forklifts). Such tires are installed utilizing a hydraulic tire press.\nWooden wheels for horse-drawn vehicles usually have a wrought iron tire. This construction was extended to wagons on horse-drawn tramways, rolling on granite setts or cast iron rails.\nThe wheels of some railway engines and older types of rolling stock are fitted with railway tires to prevent the need to replace the entirety of a wheel. The tire, usually made of steel, surrounds the wheel and is primarily held in place by interference fit.\nAircraft tires may operate at pressures that exceed . Some aircraft tires are inflated with nitrogen to \"eliminate the possibility of a chemical reaction between atmospheric oxygen and volatile gases from the tire inner liner producing a tire explosion\".\nManufacturing.\nPneumatic tires are manufactured in about 450 tire factories around the world. Tire production starts with bulk raw materials such as rubber, carbon black, and chemicals and produces numerous specialized components that are assembled and cured. Many kinds of rubber are used, the most common being styrene-butadiene copolymer.\nForecasts for the global automotive tire market indicate continued growth through 2027. Estimates put the value of worldwide sales volume around $126 billion in 2022, it is expected to reach the value of over $176 billion by 2027. Production of tires is also experiencing growth. In 2015, the US manufactured almost 170 million tires. Over 2.5 billion tires are manufactured annually, making the tire industry a major consumer of natural rubber. It was estimated that for 2019 onwards, at least 3 billion tires would be sold globally every year. However, other estimates put worldwide tire production of 2,268 million in 2021 and is predicted to reach 2,665 million tires by 2027.\nAs of 2011, the top three tire manufacturing companies by revenue were Bridgestone (manufacturing 190 million tires), Michelin (184 million), Goodyear (181 million); they were followed by Continental, and Pirelli. The Lego group produced over 318 million toy tires in 2011 and was recognized by Guinness World Records as having the highest annual production of tires by any manufacturer.\nComponents.\nA tire comprises several components: the tread, bead, sidewall, shoulder, and ply.\nTread.\nThe tread is the part of the tire that comes in contact with the road surface. The portion that is in contact with the road at a given instant in time is the contact patch. The tread is a thick rubber, or rubber/composite compound formulated to provide an appropriate level of traction that does not wear away too quickly.\nThe tread pattern is characterized by a system of circumferential grooves, lateral sipes, and slots for road tires or a system of lugs and voids for tires designed for soft terrain or snow. Grooves run circumferentially around the tire and are needed to channel away water. Lugs are that portion of the tread design that contacts the road surface. Grooves, sipes, and slots allow tires to evacuate water.\nThe design of treads and the interaction of specific tire types with the roadway surface affects roadway noise, a source of noise pollution emanating from moving vehicles. These sound intensities increase with higher vehicle speeds. Tires treads may incorporate a variety of distances between slots (\"pitch lengths\") to minimize noise levels at discrete frequencies. Sipes are slits cut across the tire, usually perpendicular to the grooves, which allow the water from the grooves to escape sideways and mitigate hydroplaning.\nDifferent tread designs address a variety of driving conditions. As the ratio of tire tread area to groove area increases, so does tire friction on dry pavement, as seen on Formula One tires, some of which have no grooves. High-performance tires often have smaller void areas to provide more rubber in contact with the road for higher traction, but may be compounded with softer rubber that provides better traction, but wears quickly. Mud and snow (M&amp;S) tires employ larger and deeper slots to engage mud and snow. Snow tires have still larger and deeper slots that compact snow and create shear strength within the compacted snow to improve braking and cornering performance.\nWear bars (or wear indicators) are raised features located at the bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When the tread lugs are worn to the point that the wear bars connect across the lugs, the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service, typically at a remaining tread depth of .\nOther.\nThe tire bead is the part of the tire that contacts the rim on the wheel. This essential component is constructed with robust steel cables encased in durable, specially formulated rubber designed to resist stretching. The precision of the bead's fit is crucial, as it seals the tire against the wheel, maintaining air pressure integrity and preventing any loss of air. The bead's design ensures a secure, non-slip connection, preventing the tire from rotating independently from the wheel during vehicle motion. Additionally, the interplay between the bead's dimensions and the wheel's width significantly influences the vehicle's steering responsiveness and stability, as it helps to maintain the tire's intended shape and contact with the road.\nThe sidewall is that part of the tire, or bicycle tire, that bridges between the tread and bead. The sidewall is largely rubber but reinforced with fabric or steel cords that provide for tensile strength and flexibility. The sidewall contains air pressure and transmits the torque applied by the drive axle to the tread to create traction but supports little of the weight of the vehicle, as is clear from the total collapse of the tire when punctured.\nSidewalls are molded with manufacturer-specific detail, government-mandated warning labels, and other consumer information.\nSidewall may also have sometimes decorative ornamentation that includes whitewall or red-line inserts as well as tire lettering.\nThe shoulder is that part of the tire at the edge of the tread as it makes the transition to the sidewall.\nPlies are layers of relatively inextensible cords embedded in the rubber to hold its shape by preventing the rubber from stretching in response to the internal pressure. The orientations of the plies play a large role in the performance of the tire and are one of the main ways that tires are categorized.\nBlems.\nBlem (short for \"blemished\") is a term used for a tire that failed inspection during manufacturing - but only for superficial/cosmetic/aesthetic reasons. For example, a tire with white painted lettering which is smudged or incomplete might be classified as a \"blem\". Blem tires are fully functional and generally carry the same warranty as flawless tires - but are sold at a discount.\nMaterials.\nThe materials of modern pneumatic tires can be divided into two groups, the cords that make up the ply and the elastomer which encases them.\nCords.\nThe cords, which form the ply and bead and provide the tensile strength necessary to contain the inflation pressure, can be composed of steel, natural fibers such as cotton or silk, or synthetic fibers such as nylon or kevlar. Good adhesion between the cords and the rubber is important. To achieve this the steel cords are coated in a thin layer of brass, various additives will also be added to the rubber to improve binding, such as resorcinol/HMMM mixtures.\nElastomer.\nThe elastomer, which forms the tread and encases the cords to protect them from abrasion and hold them in place, is a key component of pneumatic tire design. It can be composed of various composites of rubber material\u00a0\u2013 the most common being styrene-butadiene copolymer\u00a0\u2013 with other chemical compounds such as silica and carbon black.\nOptimizing rolling resistance in the elastomer material is a key challenge for reducing fuel consumption in the transportation sector. It is estimated that passenger vehicles consume approximately 5%\u201315% of their fuel to overcome rolling resistance, while the estimate is understood to be higher for heavy trucks. However, there can be a trade-off between rolling resistance and wet traction and grip, based on the viscoelastic properties of the rubber compound. A low dissipation factor, which is often written as the tangent of the phase angle delta (tan(\"\u03b4\")), reduces rolling resistance, whereas a high tan(\"\u03b4\") can improve wet traction and grip. Fortunately, this tradeoff is not inherent: rolling resistance is affected by tan(\"\u03b4\") at low frequencies (on the order of 100\u00a0Hz) whereas the improvement in traction comes from high tan(\"\u03b4\") at much higher frequencies. Historically, direct measurement of tan(\"\u03b4\") at high frequencies was difficult, and it became common to instead use measured low-frequency tan(\"\u03b4\") at a low temperature (0\u00a0\u00b0C) as a predictor of wet traction because of its correlation to high-frequency tan(\"\u03b4\"). For rolling resistance, tan(\"\u03b4\") value at 60\u00a0\u00b0C is directly relevant and often used as a predictor of low rolling resistance. \nDesigning an elastomer material that can achieve both high wet traction and low rolling resistance is key in achieving safety and fuel efficiency in the transportation sector. More recent research has found that compounds using dual-phase fillers exhibit a poor correlation between low-temperature tan(\"\u03b4\") and wet traction, indicating an opportunity to circumvent the tradeoff assumed in the traditional approach. New approaches to understanding wet traction incorporate consideration of the effect of water lubrication on the interactions between surfaces and have pointed the way to developing compounds that can provide high wet traction and low rolling resistance.\nThe most common elastomer material used today is a styrene-butadiene copolymer. It combines the properties of polybutadiene, which is a highly rubbery polymer (\"T\"g \n \u2212100\u00a0\u00b0C) having high hysteresis and thus offering good wet grip properties, with the properties of polystyrene, which is a glassy polymer (\"T\"g \n 100\u00a0\u00b0C) having low hysteresis and thus offering low rolling resistance in addition to wear resistance. Therefore, the ratio of the two monomers in the styrene-butadiene copolymer is considered key in determining the glass transition temperature of the material, which is correlated to its grip and resistance properties.\nNon-exhaust emissions of particulate matter, generated by the wearing down of brakes, clutches, tires, and road surfaces, as well as by the suspension of road dust, constitute a little-known but rising share of emissions from road traffic and significantly harm public health.\nOn the wheel.\nAssociated components of tires include the wheel on which it is mounted, the valve stem through which air is introduced, and, for some tires, an inner tube that provides the airtight means for maintaining tire pressure.\nPerformance characteristics.\nThe interactions of a tire with the pavement are complex. A commonly used (empirical) model of tire properties is Pacejka's \"Magic Formula\". Some are explained below, alphabetically, by section.\nWear.\nTire wear is a major source of rubber pollution. A concern hereby is that vehicle tire wear pollution is unregulated, unlike exhaust emissions.\nSizes, codes, standards, and regulatory agencies.\nAutomotive tires have a variety of identifying markings molded onto the sidewall as a tire code. They denote size, rating, and other information pertinent to that individual tire.\nAmericas.\nThe National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a U.S. government body within the Department of Transportation (DOT) tasked with regulating automotive safety in the United States. NHTSA established the Uniform Tire Quality Grading System (UTQG), is a system for comparing the performance of tires according to the Code of Federal Regulations 49 CFR 575.104; it requires labeling of tires for tread wear, traction, and temperature. The DOT Code is an alphanumeric character sequence molded into the sidewall of the tire and allows the identification of the tire and its age. The code is mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation but is used worldwide. The DOT Code is also useful in identifying tires subject to product recall or at end of life due to age. The \"Tire and Rim Association\" (T&amp;RA) is a voluntary U.S. standards organization that promotes the interchangeability of tires, rims, and allied parts. Of particular interest, they publish key tire dimensions, rim contour dimensions, tire valve dimension standards, and load/inflation standards.\nThe National Institute of Metrology Standardization and Industrial Quality (INMETRO) is the Brazilian federal body responsible for automotive wheel and tire certification.\nEurope.\nThe European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation (ETRTO) is the European standards organization \"to establish engineering dimensions, load/pressure characteristics and operating guidelines\". All tires sold for road use in Europe after July 1997 must carry an E-mark. The mark itself is either an upper case \"E\" or lower case \"e\"\u00a0\u2013 followed by a number in a circle or rectangle, followed by a further number. An (upper case) \"E\" indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance, and marking requirements of ECE regulation 30. A (lowercase) \"e\" indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance, and marking requirements of Directive 92/23/EEC. The number in the circle or rectangle denotes the country code of the government that granted the type approval. The last number outside the circle or rectangle is the number of the type approval certificate issued for that particular tire size and type.\nThe British Rubber Manufacturers Association (BRMA) recommended practice, issued June 2001, states, \"BRMA members strongly recommend that unused tires should not be put into service if they are over six years old and that all tires should be replaced ten years from the date of their manufacture.\"\nAsia.\nThe Japanese Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association (JATMA) is the Japanese standards organization for tires, rims, and valves. It performs similar functions as the T&amp;RA and ETRTO.\nThe China Compulsory Certification (CCC) is a mandatory certification system concerning product safety in China that went into effect in August 2002. The CCC certification system is operated by the State General Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China (AQSIQ) and the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People's Republic of China (CNCA).\nMaintenance.\nTo maintain tire health, several actions are appropriate, tire rotation, wheel alignment, and, sometimes, retreading the tire.\nInflation.\nInflation is key to proper wear and rolling resistance of pneumatic tires. Many vehicles have monitoring systems to assure proper inflation. Most passenger cars are advised to maintain a tire pressure within the range of when the tires are not warmed by driving.\nHazards.\nTire hazards may occur from failure of the tire, itself, or from loss of traction on the surface over which it is rolling. Structural failures of a tire can result in flat tires or more dangerous blowouts. Some of these failures can be caused by manufacture error and may lead to recalls, such as the widespread Firestone tire failures on Ford vehicles that lead to the Firestone and Ford tire controversy in the 1990s.\nTire failure.\nTires may fail for any of a variety of reasons, including:\nHealth impacts.\nTires contain a number of trace toxic chemicals including heavy metals and chemical agents used to increase the durability of the tires. These typically include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzothiazoles, isoprene and heavy metals such as zinc and lead.\nAs tires are used for vehicle operations, the natural wear of the tire leaves microfine particles equivalent to PM0.1, PM2.5, and PM10 as tire residue. This residue accumulates near roadways and vehicle use areas, but also will travel into the environment through surface runoff. Both humans and animals are exposed to these chemicals at the sites of accumulation (i.e. walking on the road surface) and through bioaccumulation in natural environments and foodchains. A 2023 literature review from Imperial College London, warned of both the toxic chemicals and microplastics produced from tire wear as having potential widespread serious environmental and health consequences.\nMoreover, burning of tires releases these chemicals as air pollutants that can harm first responders and leaves toxic residues that endanger local communities.\nEnd of use.\nOnce tires are discarded, they are considered scrap tires. Scrap tires are often re-used for things from bumper car barriers to weights to hold down tarps. Tires are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space. Rubber tires are likely to contain some traces of heavy metals or other serious pollutants, but these are tightly bonded within the actual rubber compound so they are unlikely to be hazardous unless the tire structure is seriously damaged by fire or strong chemicals. Some facilities are permitted to recycle scrap tires by chipping and processing them into new products or selling the material to licensed power plants for fuel. Some tires may also be retreaded for re-use.\nEnvironmental issues.\nAmericans generate about 285 million scrap tires per year. Many states regulate the number of scrap tires that can be held at any site out of concern with dumping, fire hazards, and mosquitoes. In the past, millions of tires were simply discarded into open fields. Outdoor tire heaps create breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which are a nuisance and may spread disease, since the tires often hold water inside and remain warm enough for mosquito breeding. It also creates a fire hazard. Tires very seldom catch fire inadvertently, requiring a temperature of to combust, but once burning are hard to extinguish, for a large tire pile has ample fuel and water used to douse fires does not adequately penetrate or cool them. Some tire fires have burned for months, sometimes liquefying and releasing hydrocarbons and other contaminants to the ground and even groundwater, and black smoke, an air pollutant that is a hazard to downwind properties, to the air.\nThe use of scrap tire chips for landscaping has become controversial because of the leaching of metals and other contaminants from the tire pieces. Zinc is concentrated (up to 2% by weight) to levels high enough to be highly toxic to aquatic life and plants. Of particular concern is evidence that some of the compounds that leach from tires into the water contain hormone disruptors and cause liver lesions.\nTires are a major source of microplastic pollution, found in a 2020 study to contribute 78% of the total mass of microplastics found in the ocean. The commonly used compound 6PPD-quinone, found entering stormwater runoff via tire-wear particles, has been identified as toxic to coho salmon, brook trout, and rainbow trout.\nRetreading.\nTires that are fully worn can be retreaded, re-manufactured to replace the worn tread. This is known as retreading or recapping, a process of buffing away the worn tread and applying a new tread. There are two main processes used for retreading tires, called mold-cure and pre-cure methods. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as shearography to locate non-visible damage and embedded debris and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires over the life of the tire body. Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.\nDuring the retreading process, retread technicians must ensure the casing is in the best condition possible to minimize the possibility of a casing failure. Casings with problems such as capped tread, tread separation, irreparable cuts, corroded belts or sidewall damage, or any run-flat or skidded tires, will be rejected. The mold cure method involves the application of raw rubber on the previously buffed and prepared casing, which is later cured in matrices. During the curing period, vulcanization takes place, and the raw rubber bonds to the casing, taking the tread shape of the matrix. On the other hand, the pre-cure method involves the application of a ready-made tread band on the buffed and prepared casing, which later is cured in an autoclave so that vulcanization can occur.\nRecycling.\nTires can be recycled into, among other things, the hot melt asphalt, typically as crumb rubber modifier\u2014recycled asphalt pavement (CRM\u2014RAP), and as an aggregate in portland cement concrete. Shredded tires can create rubber mulch on playgrounds to diminish fall injuries. There are some \"green\" buildings that are being made both private and public buildings that are made from old tires.\nThe tire pyrolysis method for recycling used tires is a technique that heats whole or shredded tires in a reactor vessel containing an oxygen-free atmosphere and a heat source. In the reactor, the rubber is softened after which the rubber polymers continuously break down into smaller molecules.\nOther uses.\nOther downstream uses have been developed for worn-out tires, including:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65039", "revid": "42778291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65039", "title": "Muskeg", "text": "Bog-like ecosystem common in Arctic and boreal areas\nMuskeg (; ; , lit. \"moss bog\") is a peat-forming ecosystem found in several northern climates, most commonly in Arctic and boreal areas. Muskeg is approximately synonymous with bog or peatland, and is a standard term in Canada and Alaska. The term became common in these areas because it is of Cree origin, () meaning \"low-lying marsh\".\nMuskeg consists of non-living organic material in various states of decomposition (as peat), ranging from fairly intact sphagnum moss, to sedge peat, to highly decomposed humus. Pieces of wood can make up five to fifteen percent of the peat soil. The water table tends to be near the surface. The sphagnum moss forming it can hold fifteen to thirty times its own weight in water, which allows the spongy wet muskeg to also form on sloping ground.\nMuskeg patches are ideal habitats for beavers, pitcher plants, agaric mushrooms and a variety of other organisms.\nComposition.\nMuskeg forms because permafrost, clay or bedrock prevents water drainage. The water from rain and snow collects, forming permanently waterlogged vegetation and stagnant pools. Muskeg is wet, acidic, and relatively infertile, which prevents large trees from growing, although stunted shore pine, cottonwood, some species of willow, and black spruce are typically found in these habitats. It needs two conditions to develop: abundant rain and cool summers. A dead plant that falls on dry soil is normally attacked by bacteria and fungi and quickly rots. If the same plant lands in water or on saturated soil, it decomposes differently. Less oxygen is available under water, so aerobic bacteria and fungi fail to colonize the submerged debris effectively. In addition, cool temperatures retard bacterial and fungal growth. This causes slow decomposition, and thus the plant debris gradually accumulates to form peat and eventually muskeg. Depending on the underlying topography of the land, muskeg can reach depths greater than 30 metres (100\u00a0ft).\nDescription.\nAlthough, at first glance, muskeg resembles a plain covered with short grasses, a closer look reveals a bizarre and almost unearthly landscape. Small stands of stunted (often-dead) trees, which vaguely resemble natural bonsai, grow where land protrudes above the water table, with small pools of water (stained dark red) scattered about. Its grassland appearance invites the unwary to tread on it; however, even the most solid muskeg is spongy and waterlogged. Traveling through muskeg is a strange and dangerous experience, for the unaccustomed. Muskeg can grow atop bodies of water, especially small ponds and streams. Because of the water beneath, the muskeg surface sometimes moves and ripples underfoot. Thinner patches can collapse under significant weight, and cause larger animals to fall-through and become trapped underneath, drowning if an escape route is not found. Moose are at a particular disadvantage, with their preferred diet of aquatic plants and grasses possibly drawing them dangerously near to muskeg; due to their long legs, minimal hoof area, and great weight, they are at great risk of falling and drowning. Hunters and hikers may occasionally encounter young moose in muskeg-covered ponds submerged up to their torsos or necks, having been unaware of the unstable ground.\nSurface strength.\nMuskeg can be a significant impediment to transportation. Legend holds that during the 1870s, muskeg in Northern Ontario swallowed a train and a thousand feet of track whole when a track was accidentally laid on muskeg.\nMany other instances have been reported of heavy construction equipment vanishing into muskeg in the spring as the frozen muskeg beneath the vehicle thawed. Construction in muskeg-laden areas sometimes requires the complete removal of the soil and filling with gravel. If the muskeg is not completely cleared to bedrock, its high water content will cause buckling and distortion from winter freezing, much like permafrost.\nOne method of working atop muskeg is to place large logs on the ground, covered with a thick layer of clay or other stable material. This is commonly called a corduroy road. To increase the effectiveness of the corduroy, prevent erosion, and allow removal of material with less disturbance to the muskeg, a geotextile fabric is sometimes placed down before the logs. However temporary winter access roads on muskeg (ice road), created by clearing the insulating snow and allowing the muskeg to freeze, are more commonly used as they are cheaper to construct and easier to decommission. Water is often sprayed on these roads to thicken the ice allowing heavy trucks and equipment to safely access remote sites in the winter.\nIn fiction.\nIn Jack London's short story, \"Love of Life,\" the starving protagonist eats muskeg berries along the trail. \"A muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water. In the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter. The man knew there was no nourishment in the berries, but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience.\"\nIn Martha Ostenso's novel \"Wild Geese\", the land owned and beloved by the antagonist plays an important role:\n\"Southeast, under the ridge, bottomless and foul, lay the muskeg, the sore to Caleb's eye. In the heat of summer it gave up sickly vapours in which clouds of mosquitoes rose. Cattle and horses, breaking through the pasture fence and heading for the hay field, had disappeared beneath its spongy surface.\" (p. 12)\nIn Rick Riordan's novel \"The Son of Neptune\" (in the Heroes of Olympus series), Percy Jackson steps off a path near Seward, Alaska, and falls through the muskeg. He would have drowned if another character, Hazel Levesque, had not jumped in after him. Frank Zhang, the third of their trio, pulled them out using his bow, with Hazel holding onto it and Percy holding onto her ankles.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the well-known \"Gang of Four\" design patterns, which describe how to solve recurring problems in object-oriented software. The pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.\nMore specifically, the singleton pattern allows classes to:\nThe term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.\nCommon uses.\nSingletons are often preferred to global variables because they do not pollute the global namespace (or their containing namespace). Additionally, they permit lazy allocation and initialization, whereas global variables in many languages will always consume resources.\nThe singleton pattern can also be used as a basis for other design patterns, such as the abstract factory, factory method, builder and prototype patterns. Facade objects are also often singletons because only one facade object is required.\nLogging is a common real-world use case for singletons, because all objects that wish to log messages require a uniform point of access and conceptually write to a single source.\nImplementations.\nImplementations of the singleton pattern ensure that only one instance of the singleton class ever exists and typically provide global access to that instance.\nTypically, this is accomplished by:\nThe instance is usually stored as a private static variable; the instance is created when the variable is initialized, at some point before when the static method is first called.\nThis C++23 implementation is based on the pre-C++98 implementation in the book .\nimport std;\nclass Singleton {\nprivate:\n Singleton() = default; // no public constructor\n ~Singleton() = default; // no public destructor\n inline static Singleton* instance = nullptr; // declaration class variable\n int value;\npublic:\n // defines a class operation that lets clients access its unique instance.\n static Singleton&amp; getInstance() {\n if (!instance) {\n instance = new Singleton();\n return *instance;\n \n Singleton(const Singleton&amp;) = delete(\"Copy construction disabled\");\n Singleton&amp; operator=(const Singleton&amp;) = delete(\"Copy assignment disabled\");\n static void destroy() {\n delete instance;\n instance = nullptr;\n // existing interface goes here\n nodiscard\n int getValue() const noexcept {\n return value;\n void setValue(int newValue) noexcept {\n value = newValue;\n};\nint main() {\n Singleton::getInstance().setValue(42);\n std::println(\"value = {}\", Singleton::getInstance().getValue());\n Singleton::destroy();\nThe program output is\nvalue=42\nThis is an implementation of the Meyers singleton in C++11. The Meyers singleton has no destruct method. The program output is the same as above.\nimport std;\nclass Singleton {\nprivate:\n Singleton() = default;\n ~Singleton() = default;\n int value;\npublic:\n static Singleton&amp; getInstance() {\n static Singleton instance;\n return instance;\n \n nodiscard\n int getValue() const noexcept {\n return value;\n \n void setValue(int newValue) noexcept {\n value = newValue;\n};\nint main() {\n Singleton::getInstance().setValue(42);\n std::println(\"value = {}\", Singleton::getInstance().getValue());\nLazy initialization.\nA singleton implementation may use lazy initialization in which the instance is created when the static method is first invoked. In multithreaded programs, this can cause race conditions that result in the creation of multiple instances. The following Java 5+ example is a thread-safe implementation, using lazy initialization with double-checked locking.\npublic class Singleton {\n private static volatile Singleton instance = null;\n public static Singleton getInstance() {\n if (instance == null) {\n synchronized (Singleton.class) {\n if (instance == null) {\n instance = new Singleton();\n return instance;\nCriticism.\nSome consider the singleton to be an anti-pattern that introduces global state into an application, often unnecessarily. This introduces a potential dependency on the singleton by other objects, requiring analysis of implementation details to determine whether a dependency actually exists. This increased coupling can introduce difficulties with unit testing. In turn, this places restrictions on any abstraction that uses the singleton, such as preventing concurrent use of multiple instances.\nSingletons also violate the single-responsibility principle because they are responsible for enforcing their own uniqueness along with performing their normal functions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is used for native executables (.exe), dynamic link libraries (.dll, .ocx), system drivers (.sys), object code (.obj) and many other types of files. The PE format supports storing the data required to load and start an operating system process \u2013 including references to dynamic link libraries, tables for importing and exporting application programming interface (API) functions, resource management data and thread-local storage (TLS) information.\nAccording to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specification, the PE format is also the accepted standard for executables in EFI environments. On Windows NT systems, it currently supports a range of instruction sets, including IA-32, x86-64 (AMD64/Intel 64), IA-64, ARM and ARM64. Before the advent of Windows 2000, Windows NT (and by extension the PE format) also supported MIPS, Alpha, and PowerPC architectures. Moreover, thanks to its use in Windows CE, PE has maintained compatibility with several MIPS, ARM (including Thumb), and SuperH variants.\nFunctionally, the PE format is similar to other platform-specific executable formats, such as the ELF format used in Linux and most Unix-like systems, and the Mach-O format found in macOS and iOS.\nHistory.\nMicrosoft first introduced the PE format with Windows NT 3.1, replacing the older 16-bit New Executable (NE) format. Soon after, Windows 95, 98, ME, and the Win32s extension for Windows 3.1x, all adopted the PE structure. Each PE file includes a DOS executable header, which generally displays the message \"This program cannot be run in DOS mode\". However, this DOS section can be replaced by a fully functional DOS program, as demonstrated in the Windows 98 SE installer. Developers can add such a program using the codice_1 switch with Microsoft's linker, effectively creating a fat binary.\nOver time, the PE format has grown with the Windows platform. Notable extensions include the .NET PE format for managed code, PE32+ for 64-bit address space support, and a specialized version for Windows CE.\nTo determine whether a PE file is intended for 32-bit or 64-bit architectures, one can examine the Machine field in the IMAGE_FILE_HEADER. Common machine values are codice_2 for 32-bit Intel processors and codice_3 for x64 processors. Additionally, the Magic field in the codice_4 reveals whether addresses are 32-bit or 64-bit. A value of codice_5 indicates a 32-bit (PE32) file, while codice_6 indicates a 64-bit (PE32+) file.\nTechnical details.\nLayout.\nA PE file consists of several headers and sections that instruct the dynamic linker about on how to map the file into memory. An executable image consists of several different regions, each requiring different memory protection attributes. To ensure proper alignment, the start of each section must align to a page boundary. For instance, the \".text\" section, which contains program code, is typically mapped as an execute/read-only. Conversely, the \".data\" section, which holds global variables, is mapped as no-execute/read write. However, to conserve space, sections are not aligned on disk in this manner. The dynamic linker maps each section to memory individually and assigns the correct permissions based on the information in the headers.\nImport table.\nThe \"import address table\" (IAT) is used as a lookup table when the application calls a function in a different module. The imports can be specified by ordinal or by name. Because a compiled program cannot know the memory locations of its dependent libraries beforehand, an indirect jump is necessary for API calls. As the dynamic linker holds modules and resolves dependencies, it populates the IAT slots with actual addresses of the corresponding library functions. Although this adds an extra jump, incurring a performance penalty compared to intermodular calls, it minimizes the number of memory pages that that require copy-on-write changes, thus conserving memory and disk I/O. If a call is known to be intermodular beforehand (if indicated by a dllimport attribute), the compiler can generate optimized code with a simple indirect call opcode.\nAddress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).\nModern operating systems use Address space layout randomization (ASLR), a process that makes a PE file's in-memory layout unpredictable and therefore harder to exploit. During ASLR, the loader randomizes the virtual addresses where key components reside. This includes the executable's base, shared libraries, the heap, and the stack. Most PE files are not position-independent because mainstream compilers emit some absolute references relative to an assumed base. To cope with randomized rebasing, the linker stores a .reloc table that lets the loader adjust those references at load time.\n.NET, metadata, and the PE format.\nIn a .NET executable, the PE code section contains a stub that invokes the CLR virtual machine startup entry, codice_7 or codice_8 in codice_9, much like it was in Visual Basic executables. The virtual machine then makes use of .NET metadata present, the root of which, codice_10 (also called \"CLR header\") is pointed to by codice_11 (the entry was previously used for COM+ metadata in COM+ applications, hence the name) entry in the PE header's data directory. codice_10 strongly resembles PE's optional header, essentially playing its role for the CLR loader.\nThe CLR-related data, including the root structure itself, is typically contained in the common code section, codice_13. It is composed of a few directories: metadata, embedded resources, strong names and a few for native-code interoperability. Metadata directory is a set of tables that list all the distinct .NET entities in the assembly, including types, methods, fields, constants, events, as well as references between them and to other assemblies.\nUse on other operating systems.\nThe PE format is also used by ReactOS, an open-source operating system created to be binary-compatible with Windows. Historically, it has also been used by other operating systems such as SkyOS and BeOS R3. However, both SkyOS and BeOS eventually moved to ELF.\nThe Mono development platform, which aims to be binary compatible with the Microsoft .NET Framework, uses the same PE format as the Microsoft implementation. The same goes for Microsoft's own cross-platform .NET Core.\nOn x86(-64) Unix-like operating systems, Windows binaries (in PE format) can be executed using Wine. The HX DOS Extender also uses the PE format for native DOS 32-bit binaries, and can execute some Windows binaries in DOS, thus acting like an equivalent of Wine for DOS.\nMac OS X 10.5 has the ability to load and parse PE files, although it does not maintain binary compatibility with Windows.\nUEFI and EFI firmware use PE files as well as the Windows ABI x64 calling convention for applications.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A founding father of the modern Singaporean state, his political leadership transformed post-independence Singapore into a highly developed country and one of the four Asian Tigers.\nBorn in Singapore during British colonial rule to a family of Chinese descent, Lee studied law in England at Cambridge University and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1950. Shortly after, he returned to Singapore and practised law, founding the law firm Lee &amp; Lee. In 1954, Lee co-founded the People's Action Party (PAP), which won significant support among the working class and trade unions in the lead up to the 1955 general election, securing him a seat in the Tanjong Pagar division and making him the \"de facto\" leader of the opposition. In 1959, Lee led the PAP to its first electoral victory, becoming Singapore's first prime minister. Seeking sovereignty from the British Empire, Lee led Singapore to a merger with Malaya along with Sarawak and Sabah, forming Malaysia in 1963. Racial strife and ideological differences later led to Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia and consequent independence in 1965.\nLee oversaw major economic reforms and urban development, instituting policies promoting meritocracy, multiracialism and anti-corruption. His administration, generally characterised as an illiberal democracy with nanny state tendencies, restricted press freedoms, public assembly, labour activism and civil liberties. From 1968 to 1981, Singapore was a \"de facto\" one-party state, with the PAP facing no opposition in Parliament. Although Lee maintained legal and institutional procedures that formally characterised Singapore as a democratic parliamentary republic, he employed defamation laws, detention without trial and social engineering to ensure continued electoral success.\nIn justifying his policies, Lee was a major proponent of Asian values, arguing that communitarianism and limited human rights were necessary for the social cohesion, political stability and rapid economic development of Singapore. Lee stepped down as prime minister in 1990 but continued to serve in the Cabinet as senior minister until 2004 and subsequently as minister mentor until his retirement in 2011. Throughout his political career, he remained an influential figure in shaping Singapore's domestic and foreign policies, at the same time serving as an advisor to foreign leaders as an elder statesman. Lee died of pneumonia on 23 March 2015 at the age of 91.\nWithin Singapore, Lee is widely regarded as instrumental in the development of Singapore's economy, bureaucracy, education system, foreign policy, public housing and healthcare, with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy of the National University of Singapore named after him. Following his death, a week of national mourning was announced, during which approximately 1.7 million people paid their respects at tribute sites around the country.\nEarly life.\nChildhood and early education.\nHarry Lee Kuan Yew was born on 16 September 1923, the first child of Lee Chin Koon, a Semarang-born Singaporean, and Chua Jim Neo, at 92 Kampong Java Road in Singapore, then part of the British Empire. Both of Lee's parents were English-educated third-generation Peranakan Chinese, with his paternal side being of Hakka descent from Dabu County. He was named 'Kuan Yew', meaning 'light and brightness', alternately meaning 'bringing great glory to one's ancestors'.\nLee's paternal grandfather Lee Hoon Leong, who was described as \"especially westernised\", had worked on British ships as a purser, and hence gave Lee the Western name 'Harry'. While the family spoke English as its first language, Lee also learned Malay. Lee had three brothers and one sister, all of whom lived to old age.\nLee was not close to his father, who worked as a storekeeper within the Shell Oil Company and had a gambling addiction. His mother Chua often stood up against her husband for his poor financial management and parenting skills. The family was considered prosperous with a high social standing compared to recent immigrants, and had the means to hire servants. During the Great Depression the family fortunes declined considerably, though Lee's father retained his job at Shell. Later in life, Lee described his father as a man with a nasty temper, and he credited his mother with holding the family together amidst her husband's gambling addiction.\nIn 1930, Lee enrolled at Telok Kurau English School where he spent six years of his primary education. Attending Raffles Institution in 1935, Lee did poorly in his first two years but later topped the Junior Cambridge examinations. He also joined the Scouts and partook in several physical activities such as cricket, tennis, swimming as well as debates. Lee was the top scorer in the Senior Cambridge examinations in 1940 across the Straits Settlements and Malaya, earning the John Anderson scholarship to attend Raffles College, as well as the Tan Jiak Kim scholarship. During the prize-awarding ceremony, Lee met his future wife Kwa Geok Choo; she was the only girl at the school.\nLee's subsequent university studies at Raffles College were disrupted by the onset of World War II in Asia, with the school being converted into a medical facility in 1941. The war arrived in December of that year and following the British surrender in February 1942, the Japanese occupation of Singapore began.\nWorld War II.\nLee was amongst the Chinese men rounded up by the Japanese \"Sook Ching\" operation. By his own account, he feared getting caught by the \"Kempeitai\" (military police) and reported with a friend to be screened. He attempted to leave the next morning but was ordered to join a group of already segregated men. Lee requested to collect his clothes first and managed to spend a second night in the dormitory before successfully leaving the site the next day when a different guard cleared him through. He later learned that the group of men were likely taken to the beach and executed.\nLee obtained a Japanese language proficiency certificate in August 1942 and worked in a friend's company and then the \"Kumiai\", which controlled essential items. He got a job with the Japanese propaganda department (\"H\u014dd\u014dbu\") in late 1943 and worked for the Japanese occupation force as an English specialist. Working at the top of the Cathay Building, he was assigned to listen to Allied radio stations for Morse code signals. By late 1944, Lee knew Japan had suffered major setbacks and planned to move to the Cameron Highlands with his family to avoid a possible British invasion. He was tipped off that he was being followed and abandoned the plan. He engaged in private enterprises and black market sales for the rest of the war. During this time, Lee helped develop a glue based on tapioca, which he sold under the name Stikfas, as a means to support himself during the war. The Stikfas logo later appeared on the base of his wedding cake.\nThe rapid Japanese victory in the Malaya and Singapore campaign had a major impact on Lee as he recalled: \"In 70 days of surprises, upsets and stupidities, British colonial society was shattered, and with it all the assumptions of the Englishman's superiority\". In a radio broadcast made in 1961, Lee said he \"emerged [from the war] determined that no one\u2014neither Japanese nor British\u2014had the right to push and kick us around... (and) that we could govern ourselves.\" It also influenced his perceptions of raw power and the effectiveness of harsh punishment in deterring crime.\nUniversity, marriage and politics.\nLee chose not to return to Raffles College after the war and pursued higher education in the United Kingdom. He sailed from Singapore in 1946 on his 23rd birthday on the MV \"Britannic\", arriving in the UK on 3 October. He initially enrolled at the London School of Economics, but found himself disliking life in the British capital. He visited Cambridge in November and was introduced to W. S. Thatcher, Censor of Fitzwilliam House. He was admitted into the following year's Lent term and matriculated in January 1947, reading law at Fitzwilliam College.\nPrior to his departure from Singapore, Lee had begun a relationship with Kwa, with whom he had kept in contact during the war. They married in secret at Stratford-upon-Avon in December. Lee achieved a first class result in both the Prelims and Part I of the Tripos, and graduated with a Starred First for Part II Law in 1949. As the top student of his cohort, he was awarded the Fitzwilliam's Whitlock Prize; Lee was called to the bar from the Middle Temple in 1950.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf you value fairness and social justice, not only to the people of Britain but also to the millions of British subjects in the colonies, return another Labour government.\nLee to voters in the Totnes constituency\nDuring his studies, Lee's political convictions and anti-colonial sentiments were hardened by personal experiences and an increasing belief that the British were ruling Singapore for their own benefit. He supported the Labour Party against the Conservatives whom he perceived as opposing decolonisation. In the leadup to the 1950 United Kingdom general election, Lee engaged in politics for the first time and actively campaigned for a friend, David Widdicombe in Totnes constituency, driving Widdicombe around in a lorry and delivering several speeches on his behalf.\nBefore returning to Singapore, Lee dropped his English name, Harry. Notwithstanding, even until the end of his life, old friends and relatives referred to him as Harry.\nEarly career (1951\u20131955).\nLitigation practice.\nLee and his wife returned to Singapore in August 1950 on board the MS \"Willem Ruys\". He joined the Laycock and Ong law firm founded by British lawyer John Laycock. Laycock was a co-founder of the pro-British Progressive Party and Lee represented the party during the 1951 legislative council election as an election agent. Lee was called to the Singapore bar on 7 August 1951.\nDuring the postal union strike in May 1952, Lee negotiated a settlement marking his first step into the labour movement. In due course, Lee represented nearly fifty trade unions and associations against the British authorities on a \"pro bono\" basis. The disputes often centered around wages and Laycock eventually requested Lee to cease taking on such cases as it was hurting the firm.\nIn May 1954, the left-wing University Socialist Club published an article 'Aggression in Asia' in the club's magazine \"The Fajar\", and the student editors were charged with sedition. Lee became junior counsel to Denis Pritt. The court quashed the charges and the two counsel gained a reputation through the trial, with Lee thereafter becoming a \"major leader\" of the movement against British rule. During the same year, Lee also appealed on behalf of the students arrested during the 13 May incident. The colonial government upheld the sentences, though the case enhanced Lee's reputation as a \"left-wing lawyer\" and marked his first involvement with the Chinese intelligentsia.\nForming the PAP.\nDuring his studies in Britain, Lee met Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye via the Malayan Forum. The forum sought to promote an independent Malaya which included Singapore and met at 44 Bryanston Square in London. Lee and his contemporaries deliberately avoided the topic of forming a political party to avoid charges of subversion, beginning work on forming a political party only after returning to Singapore.\nLee had sought to build support among the English-educated, Malay, and Indian communities by taking on cases against the British authorities. In the course of his work, Lee became acquainted with the journalist Sinnathamby Rajaratnam; Abdul Samad Ismail, a writer for the Malay newspaper \"Utusan Melayu\"; and Devan Nair. He next turned his attention to the Chinese-speaking majority and was introduced to Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan, leaders of the influential bus and factories unions. While the unions had been infiltrated by communists, Lee consciously sought their support as he wanted a popular front. With elections approaching in 1955, Lee and his associates debated the name, ideology, and policies of the party they wanted to create at 38 Oxley Road.\nThe People's Action Party (PAP) was inaugurated on 21 November 1954 at the Victoria Memorial Hall. As the party still lacked members, trade union leaders rounded up an estimated audience of 800 to 1,500 supporters. Lee had also invited Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tan Cheng Lock, presidents of the United Malays National Organisation and Malayan Chinese Association. In his inaugural speech, Lee denounced the British for the slow transition to self-rule, demanded their immediate withdrawal, and said that the PAP would pursue a Singapore-Malaya union. Lee became secretary-general of the party, a post he held until 1992, barring a brief period in 1957 when the post was taken up by T. T. Rajah.\nIn July 1953, Governor John Nicoll initiated the Rendel Commission to provide for a transition to self-rule. The commission created the legislative assembly and opened 25 of 32 seats for direct contest in the upcoming 1955 election. The PAP and Labour Front, led by Lee and David Marshall respectively, both criticised the concessions as \"inadequate\". The PAP faced manpower constraints but decided to prioritise resources and contest four seats as a protest gesture. In a rally speech, Lee said he chose the Tanjong Pagar division as it was a \"working class area\" and that he did not want to represent \"wealthy merchants or landlords\".\nDuring the campaigning period, the British press labelled Lee as a \"commissar\" and accused the PAP of being a \"communist-backed party\". Democratic Party (DP) challenger Lam Thian also capitalised on Lee's inability to converse in Chinese. Lee's proposal for a multilingual debate was never reciprocated by Thian, though he eventually made his maiden Chinese speech after several hours of coaching. On polling day, 2 April, the ruling Progressive Party captured only four seats, shocking both the British establishment and its opposition. Lee defeated his competitors and won Tanjong Pagar, with the PAP winning three of their four contested seats. He pledged to work with Marshall and the new Labour Front government.\nAs independent member Ahmad Ibrahim joined PAP following the election, PAP had 4 members in the Assembly and thus Lee became the new Leader of the Opposition.\nLeader of the Opposition (1955\u20131959).\nStrikes and power struggle.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAny man in Singapore who wants to carry the Chinese-speaking people with him cannot afford to be anti-Communist. The Chinese are very proud of China. If I had to choose between colonialism and communism, I would vote for communism and so would the great majority.\nLee to an Australian journalist a week before the riot\nOn 23 April 1955, workers from the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company began a strike under the direction of Fong Swee Suan, leader of the Singapore Buses Workers' Union (SBWU). As SBWU's legal advisor, Lee worked with Marshall's government to negotiate a resolution, which was initially agreed by the SBWU but then reneged on by the company. Seeking to exert greater pressure, Lee, Fong and Lim Chin Siong addressed the strikers on 1 May (May Day), where Lee called the government a \"half-past six democracy\". The strike subsequently escalated into a riot on 12 May.\nLee, Marshall and the company agreed on a further resolution on 14 May, which conceded to several of the strikers' demands. In an emergency legislative assembly sitting on 16 May, Chief Secretary William Goode accused Lee of losing control of the PAP to Lim. Lee was constrained between defending the actions of his colleagues and denouncing them, instead reiterating the PAP's committal to non-violence. Marshall defended him and the PAP as \"decent men\" against Goode's accusations and called upon the party to \"purge themselves of communists\".\nThe riot led the public to perceive the PAP as being led by \"young, immature and troublesome politicians\", resulting in a shortfall of new members. It deepened the divide between two emerging factions, with Lee's faction advocating Fabian's brand of socialism for gradual reform and Lim's faction, later described by Fong as \"favour(ing) a more radical approach\". Lee was convinced that Lim and Fong's influence were pushing the party toward \"political disaster\". After consulting his allies Toh Chin Chye, S. Rajaratnam and Byrne, Lee censured the two men privately and demanded they change strategies or leave the party.\nBy 1956, Lee believed that the PAP \"had been captured by the communists\" and privately endorsed the Labour Front government purge of suspected \"leftists\" in the aftermath of the 1956 Chinese middle schools riots. The arrestees included his rival Lim and several other PAP members. When other leftist members captured six seats in the PAP central executive committee (CEC) elections on 4 August 1957, Lee refused to allow his allies to assume their appointments and said that his faction had \"lost their moral right\" to enforce the party's founding philosophy. Overtures were made by fellow CEC member T. T. Rajah to remain in his post, to which he declined. The government arrested the leftist leaders on 22 August and Lee was restored as secretary-general on 20 October. He later blamed the attempted takeover on lax admission rules to the party and permanently distrusted the leftists thereafter. On 23 November 1958, the party constitution was amended to implement a cadre system. The right to vote in party elections and run for office were revoked from ordinary party members, whom now had to seek approval from the CEC to be a cadre and regain these privileges. Lee credited the Vatican system where the pope pre-selects its cardinals for the idea.\nMerdeka talks.\nThe Labour Front government's conciliatory approach to the Hock Lee strikers led to a drastic increase in strikes. Frustrated by his limited powers, Marshall demanded further constitutional reforms towards the aim of \"true self-government\". Lee supported Marshall in his efforts, though he initially threatened an opposition boycott over wording disputes in the agreement.\nBetween 1956 and 1958, there were three rounds of constitutional talks. Lee was part of Marshall's 13-member delegation to London in April 1956. Marshall's demands for independence were repeatedly rejected by Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd and Lee departed early over Marshall's refusal to compromise. He criticised Marshall for his \"political ineptitude\" in the British press and received widespread media and radio coverage. He returned to London in March 1957 as part of a five-member delegation led by the new chief minister Lim Yew Hock. Britain conceded to Singapore's self-governance but also demanded that a tripartite Internal Security Council be established, which proved controversial back home. Marshall challenged Lee to seek a fresh mandate from his Tanjong Pagar constituents, which Lee accepted. In the June 1957 by-elections, Lee was reelected with 68.1% of the vote.\nLee returned to London for the third and final talks in May 1958, where it was agreed that Singapore would assume self-governance with a Yang di-Pertuan Negara as head of state, with Britain retaining control of defence and foreign policy. The British House of Lords passed the State of Singapore Act on 24 July 1958, which received royal assent on 1 August, and became law following the subsequent general election.\n1957 and 1959 elections.\nAs the 1957 City Council election in December approached, a Hokkien-speaking candidate, Ong Eng Guan, became the PAP's new face to the Chinese electorate. The 32-seat city council's functions were restricted to up-keeping public amenities within city limits, but party leaders decided to contest the election as a \"dry run\" for the upcoming general election. Lee limited the PAP to contesting 14 seats to avoid provoking the government and formed an electoral pact with the Labour Front and United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) to jointly tackle the new Liberal Socialist Party. The PAP campaigned on a slogan to \"sweep the city clean\" and emerged with 13 seats, allowing it to form a minority administration with UMNO's support. Lee and the rest of the CEC unanimously endorsed Ong to become mayor.\nEarly in 1959, Communications and Works Minister Francis Thomas received evidence of corruption on Education Minister Chew Swee Kee. Thomas brought the evidence to Lee after the chief minister dismissed the matter. Lee tabled a motion in the assembly on 17 February, which forced Chew's resignation. As the expiry of the assembly's term approached, the PAP was initially split on whether to capture power but Lee chose to proceed. While picking the candidates, Lee deliberately chose people from different racial and education backgrounds to repair the party's image of being run by intellectuals. In the 1959 general election held on 30 May 1959, the PAP won a landslide victory with 43 of the 51 seats, though with only 53.4% of the popular vote which Lee noted.\nThe PAP's victory reportedly created a dilemma within the 12-member CEC as there was no formal process in place to choose a prime minister-elect. A vote was purportedly held between Lee and Ong Eng Guan and after both men received six votes, party chairman Toh Chin Chye cast the tie-breaking vote for Lee. When interviewed nearly five decades later, Toh and one other party member recalled the vote, but Lee and several others denied the account. Lee was summoned by Governor William Goode to form a new government on 1 June, to which he requested the release of arrested PAP members. On 3 June, Singapore became a self-governing state, ending 140 years of direct British rule. Lee was sworn in as Prime Minister of Singapore on 5 June at City Hall, along with the rest of his Cabinet.\nPrime Minister, State of Singapore (1959\u20131963).\nFirst years in power.\nLee's first speech as prime minister to a 50,000-strong audience at the Padang sought to dampen his supporters' euphoria of the PAP's electoral win. In the first month of Lee taking power, Singapore experienced an economic slump as foreign capital fell and Western businesses and expatriates left for Kuala Lumpur in Malaya, fearing the new government's anti-colonial zeal. As part of an 'anti-yellow culture' drive, Lee banned jukeboxes and pinball machines, while the police under Home Affairs Minister Ong Pang Boon raided pubs and pornography publications. The government cracked down on secret societies, prostitution and other illegal activities, with \"TIME\" magazine later reporting that a full week passed without \"kidnapping, extortion or gangland rumble(s)\" for the first time. Lee also spearheaded several 'mobilisation campaigns' to clean the city, introduced air-conditioning to government offices, and slashed the salaries of civil servants. The last act provoked anger from the sector, which Lee justified as necessary to balance the budget.\nIn February 1960, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) superseded the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) and assumed responsibility of public housing. With strong government support, the HDB under chairman Lim Kim San completed more flats in three years than its predecessor did in thirty-two. Government expenditure for public utilities, healthcare and education also increased significantly. By the end of the year, however, unemployment began to rise drastically as the economy slowed. Lee reversed anti-colonial policies and launched a five-year plan to build new industries, seeking to attract foreign investors and rival Hong Kong. Jurong, a swampland to the island's western coast was chosen to be the site of a new industrial estate and would house steel mills, shipyards, and oil refineries, though Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee was initially worried the venture would fail.\nThe government promoted multiculturalism by recognising Chinese, English, Malay, and Tamil as the official languages of the new state and sought to create a new national Malayan identity. The Ministry of Culture under S. Rajaratnam held free outdoor concerts with every ethnic race represented in the performances. Lee also introduced the People's Association, a government-linked organisation to run community centers and youth clubs, with its leaders trained to spread the PAP's ideology. Youth unemployment was alleviated by the establishment of work brigades.\nPAP split of 1961.\nLee took measures to secure his position in the aftermath of the 1957 party elections. In 1959, he delayed the release of leftist PAP members arrested under the former Labour Front government and appointed five of its leaders, including Lim Chin Siong, as parliamentary secretaries lacking political power. Lee clashed further with Lim when the government sought to create a centralised labour union in the first half of 1960. Trouble also arose from former mayor and Minister of National Development Ong Eng Guan, who Lee had appointed in recognition of Ong's contribution to the PAP's electoral win. Ong's relocation of his ministry to his Hong Lim stronghold and continued castigation of the British and civil servants was regarded by his colleagues as disruptive and Lee removed several portfolios from Ong's purview in February 1960.\nIn the party conference on 18 June 1960, Ong filed \"16 resolutions\" against the leadership, accusing Lee of failing to seek party consensus when deciding policy, not adhering to anti-colonialism and suspending left-wing unions. Lee regarded it as a move to split the party and together with his allies expelled Ong from the party. Ong resigned his seat in December, precipitating the Hong Lim by-election on in April 1961 which he won against a PAP candidate. The death of the PAP assemblyman for Anson that April triggered a second by-election. For the first time, Lim's faction openly revolted against Lee and endorsed Workers' Party chairman David Marshall who won the seat.\nLee assumed responsibility for the two by-election defeats and submitted his resignation to party chairman Toh Chin Chye on 17 July. Toh rejected it and upheld Lee's mandate. Lee moved a motion of confidence in his own government in the early hours of 21 July after a thirteen-hour debate which had begun the preceding day, narrowly surviving it with 27 \"Ayes\", 8 \"Noes\" and 16 abstentions. The PAP now commanded a single seat majority in the 51-seat assembly after 13 of its members had abstained. Lee expelled the 13 who had broken ranks in addition to Lim, Fong and Woodhull.\nLeadup to referendum and merger.\nLee and his colleagues believed that Singapore could only survive through merger with Malaya and was unwilling to call for complete independence. Merger would allow goods to be exported to the peninsula under a common market, while devolving unpopular internal security measures to Kuala Lumpur. Malaya's ruling Alliance Party coalition dominated by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) had repeatedly opposed the scheme and was apprehensive that Singapore's Chinese majority would reduce 'Malay political supremacy'. Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman backtracked after the PAP's Hong Lim by-election defeat, fearing a \"pro-communist government\" in Singapore should Lee fall from power. On 27 May 1961, Tunku announced that Malaya, Singapore, and the British colonies of North Borneo and Sarawak should pursue \"political and economic cooperation\". Lee endorsed the program six days later and commenced negotiations on the formation of Malaysia.\nIn August 1961, Lee and Tunku agreed that Singapore's defence, foreign affairs and internal security would be transferred to the federal government, while education and labour policy remained with the state government. Lim Chin Siong and his supporters saw Lee's ceding control of internal security\u2014then controlled by the Internal Security Council with British, Malayan, Singaporean representatives\u2014to the federal government as a threat as Tunku was convinced they were communists. In a meeting with British Commissioner General Lord Selkirk, Selkirk reaffirmed that the British would not suspend Singapore's constitution should Lee be voted out. Lee saw the meeting as a British endorsement of Lim and accused it as a plot against his government. On 13 August, Lim founded the Barisan Sosialis and became its secretary-general, with 35 of 51 branches of the PAP defecting. Lee anticipated a Barisan win in the next election and saw 'independence through merger' as the only means for the PAP to retain power.\nBeginning on 13 September 1961, Lee gave twelve multilingual radio speeches outlining the benefits of merger in what he called the 'Battle for Merger'. The speeches proved to be a massive success for Lee's campaign, while Barisan's demands for equal airtime were rejected. Lee employed full use of state resources to suppress his opponents by revoking the Barisan's printing permits, banning or relocating its rallies, and purging its supporters from the government, while the judiciary and police engaged to \"obstruct, provoke and isolate\" the party. The Barisan lambasted Lee for securing only 15 seats in the Malaysian parliament for Singapore in contrast to North Borneo (16) and Sarawak (24), despite both having a combined population well below Singapore's 1.7 million. Singapore citizens would also be categorised as \"nationals\" and not be granted Malaysian citizenship. On 6 December, the legislative assembly voted 33\u20130 in favour of the agreements struck by Lee and Tunku, which the Barisan boycotted.\nA referendum for merger was scheduled for 1 September 1962. Lee ensured that the ballot lacked a \"no\" option, with all three options having varying terms for admission into Malaysia. The ballot was crafted by Lee and Goh Keng Swee to capitalise on a mistake which the Barisan had made the previous year. The Barisan had inadvertently endorsed merger under terms \"like Penang\" (a state of Malaya) with full citizenship rights, not realising that Malayan law entitled only a native-born to qualify for automatic citizenship, which would disenfranchise nearly one third of those eligible to vote; it issued a clarification but never recovered from the mistake. Lee placed the flag of Singapore alongside option A with the terms of Singapore retaining control of education and labour policy, while portraying the Barisan's choice as option B favouring entry into the federation with no special rights, next to the flag of Penang. When Lim called for his supporters to submit blank votes, Lee countered that blank votes would count as a vote for the majority choice. 71% eventually voted for option A, while 26% cast blank votes. In November, Lee embarked on a ten-month visit to all fifty-one constituencies, prioritising those with the highest count of blank votes.\nOperation Coldstore detentions.\nThe Malayan government considered the arrests of Singapore's left-wing groups as non-negotiable for the formation of Malaysia. Tunku felt that Lee lacked the initiative to suppress \"pro-communist elements\" and warned that a Malay-led dictatorship would be instated to prevent a \"socialist majority\" in the next Malayan election. As the Malayans increased pressure on the Internal Security Council (ISC) to take action, Lee began supporting the idea of a purge in March 1962. The Malayan and Singapore special branches collaborated on an arrest list of major opposition members, though doubts arose if Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan could be classified as 'communists'. Up until the end of November 1962, the British declined to support the operation without a pretext, noting that Lim and the Barisan Sosialis had not broken any laws.\nThe Brunei revolt on 8 December led by A. M. Azahari provided a \"heaven-sent opportunity\" to take action, as Lim had met Azahari on 3 December. The Malayan government convened the ISC to discuss the operation, while Singapore's Special Branch produced alleged evidence of the communist control of Barisan. On 13 December, Lord Selkirk gave his authorisation for the arrests to proceed on 16 December. However, Lee's attempt to add two Malayan parliamentarians opposed to the formation of Malaysia into the arrest list caused the Malayan representative to rescind his consent, stopping the operation. Tunku suspected that Lee was trying to eliminate his entire opposition, while Lee felt that Tunku was evading his shared responsibility for the arrests.\nAn ISC meeting was scheduled to be held on 1 February 1963 to remount the operation. During the interim period, Lee had added three names from the United People's Party, one of them being former PAP minister Ong Eng Guan. Selkirk expressed concerns that Ong's arrest lacked any justification and Lee conceded that it was meant as a \"warning\" to Ong. Tunku told Geofroy Tory, the British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur on 30 January, that 'if this operation failed, merger with Singapore was off'. Selkirk was pressured to put his reservations aside and finally consented. On 2 February, Operation Coldstore commenced across Singapore, with 113 detained including Lim and 23 others from Barisan Sosialis. Lee offered Lim a path into exile which Lim rejected. The Malayans and British later pressured Lee to retract his comment when he said he \"disapproved\" of the operation.\nIn his memoirs, Lee portrayed himself as reluctant in supporting the operation, though declassified British documents revealed that Lee was \"somewhat more enthusiastic\" than he eventually admitted.\nPrime Minister, Singapore in Malaysia (1963\u20131965).\nElections and tensions.\nOn 31 August 1963, Lee declared Singapore's independence in a ceremony at the Padang and pledged loyalty to the federal government. With the conclusion of the trials of Barisan Sosialis' leaders, Lee dissolved the legislative assembly on 3 September and called for a snap election. He touted \"independence through merger\" as a success and utilised television and the mass media effectively. In conjunction with Sabah (formerly North Borneo) and Sarawak, Lee proclaimed Singapore as part of Malaysia in a second ceremony on 16 September accompanied by a military parade. Lim Chin Siong's arrest had, however, generated widespread sympathy for the Barisan and a close result was predicted. Australian and British officials expected a Barisan win. When the PAP defeated the Barisan in a landslide victory on 21 September, it was seen as a public endorsement of merger and Lee's socio-economic policies.\nRelations between the PAP and Malaysia's ruling Alliance Party quickly deteriorated as Lee began espousing his policies to the rest of the country. The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) was also shocked by the loss of three Malay-majority seats to the PAP in the recent 1963 Singapore election. Ultra-nationalists within UMNO alleged that Lee sought to overthrow the Malay monarchies and infringe on rural life. Lee's attempts to reconcile the PAP with UMNO were rebuffed as the latter remained committed to the Malaysian Chinese Association. Further hostility ensued when the PAP decided to contest in the 1964 Malaysian general election in contravention of a gentlemen's agreement that it disavow itself from peninsula politics, but PAP already regarded the agreement to be rendered moot as the Alliance contested the 1963 Singapore state election and broke the agreement first. Lee's speeches in Malaysia attracted large crowds and he expected the PAP to win at least seven parliamentary seats. The party ultimately won only one seat in Bangsar, Selangor under Devan Nair. Lee and other party insiders later conceded that UMNO's portrayal of the PAP as a \"Chinese party\" and its lack of grassroots in the peninsula had undermined its support from the Malay majority.\nEthnic tensions had risen prior to the April election when UMNO secretary-general Syed Jaafar Albar utilised the \"Utusan Melayu\" to accuse Lee of evicting Malays from their homes in March 1964. Lee explained personally to the affected neighbourhoods that the scheme was part of an urban renewal plan and that eviction notices had been sent to everyone irrespective of race. Albar responded by warning Lee to not \"treat the sons of the soil as step-children\" and led calls for the deaths of Lee and Social Affairs Minister Othman bin Wok on 12 July. On 21 July, the 1964 race riots in Singapore erupted during a celebration of Prophet Muhammad's birthday, lasting four days, killing 22 and injuring 461. Further riots occurred in late-August and early-September resulting in communities self-segregating from each other, which Lee characterised as \"terribly disheartening\" and against \"everything we had believed in and worked for\". Lee never forgot the Malay PAP leaders who stood against UMNO during the turmoil and as late as 1998, paid tribute to them for Singapore's survival.\nMalaysian Malaysia and separation.\nLee's perceptions that merger was becoming infeasible was also due to the federal government's obstruction of his industrialisation program and its imposition of new taxes on Singapore in the November 1964 federal budget. Tunku mentioned to deputy prime minister Goh Keng Swee in December 1964 about his desire to have Singapore \u201chived off\u201d from Malaysia. Lee authorized Goh to renegotiate with Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Razak Hussein on Singapore's place in the federation in early 1965.\nSeeking to provide an alternative to the Alliance Party government, Lee and his colleagues formed the Malaysian Solidarity Convention (MSC) with the Malayan and Sarawakian opposition on 9 May, with its goals for a Malaysian Malaysia and race-blind society. The MSC was seen by UMNO as a threat to the Malay monopoly of power and special rights granted to Malays under Article 153. UMNO supreme council member and future prime minister Mahathir Mohamad called the PAP \"pro-Chinese, communist-oriented and positively anti-Malay\", while others called for Lee's arrest under the Internal Security Act for trying to split the federation. Mathathir in his speech stated the \"huaren\" (ethnic Chinese) of Singapore were of \"the insular, selfish and arrogant type of which Mr. Lee is a good example...They are in fact Chinese first, seeing China as the center of the world and Malaysia as a very poor second\".\nSuch fears were sincerely felt by the UMNO leaders as one UMNO politician who was friendly with Lee privately told him: \"You Chinese are too energetic and clever for us...we cannot stand the pressure\". Many UMNO politicians felt threatened by Lee, a politician who sought to appeal to both ethnic Chinese and Malay voters. Albar warned in a speech that the Malay voters of Singapore must have been \"misled\" into voting for the PAP, and the UNMO would not allow this to happen in the next election. Lee later wrote of Tunku that was \"a nice man\", but \"he was a prince who understood power and knew how to use it. He did not carry a big stick, but he had many hatchet-bearers who would do the job for him while he looked the other way and appeared as benign as ever\". Tunku was a Malay aristocrat who spent his undergraduate years at Cambridge by his own admission on \"fast women\" rather than studying and whom Lee contemptuously noted had been awarded a degree at Cambridge that he did not deserve solely because he was an aristocrat. Tunku in turn felt threatened by Lee, a man who had worked his way up via his intelligence and self-discipline, which made him very different from the people in his world.\nOn 26 May 1965, Lee addressed the Malaysian parliament for the final time, delivering his speech entirely in the Malay language. He challenged the Alliance Party to commit itself to a Malaysian Malaysia and denounce its extremists, and also argued that the PAP could better uplift the livelihood of the Malays. Then-social affairs minister Othman Wok later recounted: \"I noticed that while he was speaking, the Alliance leaders sitting in front of us, they sank lower and lower because they were embarrassed this man (Lee) could speak Malay better than them\". Then-national development minister Lim Kim San also noted: \"That was the turning point. They perceived [Lee] as a dangerous man who could one day be the prime minister of Malaya. This was the speech that changed history.\" Prime Minister Tunku labelled the speech as the final straw which contributed to his decision in July 1965, while being treated for shingles in London, that Singapore's secession was necessary. The more extreme UMNO politicians such as Albar were pressing to have Lee arrested and martial law proclaimed, but Tunku chose to accept Singapore's secession instead. The British government received allegations of a plot to arrest Lee, and thus the British prime minister Harold Wilson quietly pressured Tunku against taking any such action, warning of potential repercussions on the Malaysian government. As Britain was defending Malaysia from Indonesian attempts to annex the country, Britain was in a strong position to apply pressure on Malaysia. Lee in his memoirs stated that Singapore owed Wilson a major debt for his role in pressuring Tunku for a peaceful resolution of the crisis, calling Wilson a \"good friend\".\nOn 13 July 1965, Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee met with Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak Hussein and Home Affairs Minister Ismail Abdul Rahman, in Razak's office while Tunku was still overseas, being treated for shingles. Goh proposed separation of Singapore from Malaysia, before reporting back to Lee about the proposal. Lee agreed, and during another meeting between Goh, Razak and Ismail on 20 July 1965, Goh told the Malaysians that Lee had given the greenlight for separation arrangements to be done quickly. Lee then summoned Law Minister E. W. Barker to draft documents effecting Singapore's separation from the federation and its proclamation of independence. To ensure that a 1962 agreement to draw water from Johor was retained, Lee insisted that it be enshrined in the separation agreement and Malaysian constitution. The negotiations of post-separation relations were held in utmost secrecy and Lee tried to prevent secession to the last minute, trying to convince Tunku upon his return from London to continue negotiating a looser confederation. However, Tunku's mind was already made up. Lee was persuaded to finally relent by Goh on 7 August. That day, Lee and several cabinet ministers signed the separation agreement at Razak's home, which stipulated continued co-operation in trade and mutual defence. Cabinet ministers Toh Chin Chye and S. Rajaratnam, were asked to meet Lee in Kuala Lumpur. Upon being informed of the impending separation, they refused to sign the agreement at first and were distraught at the idea, before the fear of further violence and bloodshed finally convinced them to sign. Lee returned to Singapore the following day and convened the rest of his cabinet to sign the document, whereupon it was flown back to Kuala Lumpur.\nOn 9 August 1965 at 10am, Tunku convened the Malaysian parliament and moved the Constitution of Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Bill 1965, which passed unanimously by a vote of 126\u20130 with no PAP representatives present. Singapore's independence was announced locally via radio at the same time and Lee broke the news to senior diplomats and civil servants. In a televised press conference that day, Lee fought back tears and briefly stopped to regain his composure as he formally announced the news to an anxious population:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every time we look back on this moment when we signed this agreement which severed Singapore from Malaysia, it will be a moment of anguish. For me it is a moment of anguish because all my life. ... You see, the whole of my adult life [...] I have believed in Malaysian merger and the unity of these two territories. You know, it's a people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship... We could not achieve multiracialism and integration in Malaysia.\nPrime Minister, Republic of Singapore (1965\u20131990).\nDespite the momentous event, Lee did not call for the parliament to convene to reconcile the issues that Singapore would face immediately as a new nation. Without giving further instructions on who should act in his absence, he went into isolation for six weeks, unreachable by phone, at Changi Cottage. According to then-deputy prime minister Toh Chin Chye, the parliament hung in \"suspended animation\" until the sitting in December that year.\nIn his memoirs, Lee said that he was unable to sleep and was prescribed tranquilizers from doctors. Upon learning of Lee's condition from the British High Commissioner to Singapore, John Robb, the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, expressed concern, in response to which Lee replied:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do not worry about Singapore. My colleagues and I are sane, rational people even in our moments of anguish. We will weigh all possible consequences before we make any move on the political chessboard.\nLee began to seek international recognition of Singapore's independence. Singapore joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, and founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 8 August 1967 with four other South-East Asian countries. Lee made his first official visit to Indonesia on 25 May 1973, just a few years after the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation under Sukarno's regime. Relations between Singapore and Indonesia substantially improved as subsequent visits were made between the two countries.\nSingapore has never had a dominant culture to which immigrants could assimilate, even though Malay was the dominant language at that time. Together with efforts from the government and ruling party, Lee tried to create a unique Singaporean identity in the 1970s and 1980s\u2014one which heavily recognised racial consciousness within the umbrella of multiculturalism.\nLee and his government stressed the importance of maintaining religious tolerance and racial harmony, and they were ready to use the law to counter any threat that might incite ethnic and religious violence. For example, Lee warned against \"insensitive evangelisation\", by which he referred to instances of Christian proselytising directed at Malays. In 1974 the government advised the Bible Society of Singapore to stop publishing religious material in Malay.\nDefence.\nThe vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt, with threats from multiple sources, including the communists and Indonesia with its confrontational stance. Adding to this vulnerability was the impending withdrawal of British forces from East of Suez. As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations, Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapore's independence. He appointed Goh Keng Swee as Minister for the Interior and Defence to build up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and requested help from other countries, particularly Israel and Taiwan, for advice, training and facilities. In 1967, Lee introduced conscription for all able-bodied male Singaporean citizens 18 years of age to serve National Service (NS) either in the SAF, Singapore Police Force or the Singapore Civil Defence Force. By 1971, Singapore had 17 national service battalions (16,000 men) with 14 battalions (11,000 men) in the reserves. In 1975, Lee and Republic of China premier Chiang Ching-kuo signed an agreement permitting Singaporean troops to train in Taiwan, under the codename \"Project Starlight\".\nEconomy.\nOne of Lee's most urgent tasks upon Singapore's independence was to address high unemployment. Together with his economic aide, Economic Development Board chairman Hon Sui Sen, and in consultation with Dutch economist Albert Winsemius, Lee set up factories and initially focused on the manufacturing industry. Before the British completely withdrew from Singapore in 1971, Lee also persuaded the British not to destroy their dock and had the British naval dockyard later converted for civilian use.\nEventually, Lee and his cabinet decided the best way to boost Singapore's economy was to attract foreign investments from multinational corporations (MNCs). By establishing First World infrastructure and standards in Singapore, the new nation could attract American, Japanese and European business. By the 1970s multinational corporations like Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, and General Electric began turning Singapore into a major electronics exporter. Workers were frequently trained to familiarise themselves with the work systems and cultures of foreign companies. The government also started several new industries, such as steel mills under 'National Iron and Steel Mills', service industries like Neptune Orient Lines, and the Singapore Airlines.\nLee and his cabinet also worked to establish Singapore as an international financial centre. Foreign bankers were assured of the reliability of Singapore's social conditions, with top-class infrastructure and skilled professionals, and investors were made to understand that the Singapore government would pursue sound macroeconomic policies, with budget surpluses, leading to a stable valued Singapore dollar.\nThroughout the tenure of his office, Lee placed great importance on developing the economy, and his attention to detail on this aspect went even to the extent of connecting it with other facets of Singapore, including the country's extensive and meticulous tending of its international image of being a \"Garden City\". The 1967 \"Garden City\" planning initiative included prominent roadside greenery along the East Coast Parkway (ECP) highway connecting Singapore Changi Airport with Singapore Central Area.\nAnti-corruption measures.\nLee introduced legislation giving the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) greater power to conduct arrests, search, call up witnesses, and investigate bank accounts and income-tax returns of suspected persons and their families. Lee believed that ministers should be well paid in order to maintain a clean and honest government. On 21 November 1986, Lee received a complaint of corruption against then Minister for National Development Teh Cheang Wan. Lee authorised the CPIB to carry out investigations on Teh, but Teh committed suicide before any charges could be pressed against him. In 1994, he proposed to link the salaries of ministers, judges, and top civil servants to the salaries of top professionals in the private sector, arguing that this would help recruit and retain talent to serve in the public sector.\nPopulation policies.\nIn the late 1960s, fearing that Singapore's growing population might overburden the developing economy, Lee started a \"Stop at Two\" family planning campaign. Couples were urged to undergo sterilisation after their second child. Third or fourth children were given lower priorities in education and such families received fewer economic rebates.\nIn 1983, Lee sparked the \"Great Marriage Debate\" when he encouraged Singapore men to choose highly educated women as wives. He was concerned that a large number of graduate women were unmarried. Some sections of the population, including graduate women, were upset by his views. Nevertheless, a match-making agency, the Social Development Unit (SDU), was set up to promote socialising among men and women graduates. In the Graduate Mothers Scheme, Lee also introduced incentives such as tax rebates, schooling, and housing priorities for graduate mothers who had three or four children, in a reversal of the over-successful \"Stop at Two\" family planning campaign in the 1960s and 1970s.\nLee suggested that perhaps the campaign for women's rights had been too successful:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Equal employment opportunities, yes, but we shouldn't get our women into jobs where they cannot, at the same time, be mothers...our most valuable asset is in the ability of our people, yet we are frittering away this asset through the unintended consequences of changes in our education policy and equal career opportunities for women. This has affected their traditional role ... as mothers, the creators and protectors of the next generation.\"\u2014\u200a\nThe uproar over the proposal led to a swing of 12.9 per cent against the PAP government in the 1984 general election. In 1985, some especially controversial portions of the policy, that gave education and housing priorities to educated women, were abandoned or modified.\nBy the late 1990s the birth rate had fallen so low that Lee's successor Goh Chok Tong extended these incentives to all married women, and gave even more incentives, such as the \"baby bonus\" scheme.\nWater resources.\nSingapore has traditionally relied on water from Malaysia. However, this reliance has made Singapore subject to the possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as political leverage by threatening to cut off supply. To reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974. As a result of such efforts, Singapore has achieved self-sufficiency with its water supply since the mid-2010s.\nUnder Lee tree planting was pursued, in 1963 he began a tree-planting campaign which aimed to plant 10,000 saplings a year and in 1971 a 'Tree-Planting Day' was established. One of the goals of this was to increase rainfall. He also made efforts to clean Singapore's waters for collection and use.\nEnvironment.\nLee envisioned Singapore as a garden city, declaring that \"no other hallmark of success will be more distinctive than that of achieving our position as the cleanest and greenest city in Southeast Asia\". He later said that \"greening is the most cost-effective project I have launched\".\nLee set up an 'Anti-Pollution Unit' stating that its importance resided in giving citizens \"respite from city centres\" and in the small size of Singapore which made it necessary to \"preserve a clean and gracious environment for rich and poor alike\". In 1995 Lee declared \"I have always believed that a blighted urban landscape, a concrete jungle, destroys the human spirit. We need the greenery of nature to lift our spirits\".\nLee saw this as a means of attracting tourists and businesspeople to the city. He wrote that \"without a word being said, they would know that Singaporeans were competent, disciplined, and reliable, a people who would learn the skills they required soon enough\". After independence Lee sought for \"some dramatic way to distinguish ourselves from other Third World countries. I settled for a clean and green Singapore\" because \"if we had First World standards then business people and tourists would make us a base for their business and tours of the region\".\nLee considered air conditioning the most important invention of the 20th century for Singapore. Air quality relates to work quality and as such Lee made sure air conditioning was installed in the offices of the Singaporean civil service in the 1960s.\nForeign policy.\nMalaysia and Mahathir Mohamad.\nLee looked forward to improving relationships with Mahathir Mohamad upon the latter's promotion to Deputy Prime Minister. Knowing that Mahathir was in line to become the next Prime Minister of Malaysia, Lee invited Mahathir to visit Singapore in 1978. The first and subsequent visits improved both personal and diplomatic relationships between them. Then UMNO's Secretary-General Mahathir asked Lee to cut off all links with the Democratic Action Party (DAP); in exchange, Mahathir undertook not to interfere in the affairs of Malay Singaporeans.\nIn June 1988, Lee and Mahathir reached an agreement in Kuala Lumpur to build the Linggui dam on the Johor River. Lee said he had made more progress solving bilateral issues with Dr Mahathir from 1981 to 1990 than in the previous 12 years with the latter's two predecessors. Mahathir ordered the lifting of the ban on the export of construction materials to Singapore in 1981, agreed to sort out Malaysia's claim to Pedra Branca island and affirmed it would honour the 1962 Water Agreement.\nOne day before Lee left office in November 1990, Malaysia and Singapore signed the Malaysia\u2013Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990 (POA). Malayan Railways (KTM) would vacate the Tanjong Pagar railway station and move to Bukit Timah while all KTM's land between Bukit Timah and Tanjong Pagar would revert to Singapore. Railway land at Tanjong Pagar would be handed over to a private limited company for joint development, the equity of which would be divided 60% to Malaysia and 40% to Singapore. However, Prime Minister Mahathir expressed his displeasure with the POA, for it failed to include a piece of railway land in Bukit Timah for joint development in 1993.\nFollowing Lee's death, Mahathir posted a blog post that suggested his respect for Lee despite their differences, stating that while \"I am afraid on most other issues we could not agree [...] [h]is passage marks the end of the period when those who fought for independence lead their countries and knew the value of independence. ASEAN lost a strong leadership after President Suharto and Lee Kuan Yew\".\nIndonesia.\nIn March 1967, the president of Indonesia, Sukarno, who had initiated the \"Konfrontasi\", resigned from the presidency under pressure by military general Suharto amidst the 30 September Movement. A clemency plea by President Suharto for Osman bin Mohamed Ali and Harun bin Said, the perpetrators of the MacDonald House bombing in March 1965 during \"Konfrontasi\", was rejected. The Singapore Embassy in Jakarta was occupied on the day of the saboteurs' hanging by 300 students. However, Bilateral relations between Singapore and Indonesia would improve after 1973, when Lee visited the graves of Harun and Osman in Indonesia (\"nyekar\") and scattered flowers on them. This was followed by Suharto's visit to Singapore in 1974. From the 1980s, exchanges would sharply increase between the two countries in politics, tourism, defence, business, and student and community-based exchanges.\nLee and Suharto developed a strong relationship, with the growing trust between both leaders developing into friendship. Lee and Suharto regarded each other as trustworthy and reliable. Lee kept up his relationship with Suharto until his death in 2008, even advising him and his children during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis which led to Suharto's fall from power.\nIn 1978, Suharto rallied ASEAN to oppose Australia's newly proclaimed integrated civil aviation policy, which cut Kangaroo Route air access to Singapore while providing inducements to Indonesia and other countries in the region. Suharto believed that ASEAN should not give in to such tactics and inducements, and Australia relented. Singapore remains a crucial stopover for Kangaroo Route flights between the United Kingdom and Australia.\nSingapore and Indonesia entered joint projects such as the Batam Industrial Park, Bintan Resorts, the Riau Water Agreement and the Air Combat Manoeuvring Range in Pekan Baru proceeded smoothly. Swift implementation of factory and hotel development proposals by foreign investors demonstrated Singapore's honesty and reliability to Suharto.\nUnited States.\nIn his book The \"Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew\", Lee detailed an incident where in 1960, the CIA allegedly attempted to bribe certain members of his party, the PAP, in an attempt to create division and weaken his leadership, however the official had reported the bribery attempt instead of accepting the money. According to Lee, this was part of a broader strategy by the United States to influence the political landscape in Southeast Asia during the Cold War. He mentioned that he confronted the CIA's representative in Singapore and demanded an explanation and compensation for this interference. After having two CIA agents arrested, Lee requested 3.5 million dollars in economic aid in exchange for the covert release of the two agents. The Americans rejected this offer and presented a counter-offer of 3.3 million dollars to be given directly to Lee and the People's Action Party, but the men were later released without any financial exchange. However instead of taking a passive approach, Lee negotiated with the CIA and eventually the US government agreed to pay a sum of 3.3 million dollars in formal economic aid to Singapore, which Lee claimed was to ensure that the U.S. would not interfere in Singapore's internal affairs. Lee revealed this incident in 1965, which led to the Americans to deny it ever occurred; however, Lee later made public a letter of apology from the US Secretary of State Dean Rusk over the incident.\nLee fully supported the US involvement in the Vietnam War. Even as the war began to lose its popularity in the United States, Lee made his first official visit to the United States in October 1967, and declared to President Lyndon B. Johnson that his support for the war in Vietnam was \"unequivocal\". Lee saw the war as necessary for states in Southeast Asia like Singapore to buy time for stabilising their governments and economies. Lee cultivated close relationships with presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, as well as former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. In 1967 Nixon, who was running for president in 1968, visited Singapore and met with Lee, who advised that the United States had much to gain by engaging with China, culminating in Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China.\nIn the 1980s, closer defence relations between Singapore and the United States enabled Singapore to acquire advanced American weapon platforms and capabilities. The United States provided Singapore with aircraft such as the F-16 and the E-2C airborne early warning (AEW) to strengthen its air defences.\nIn October 1985, Lee made a state visit to the United States on the invitation of President Reagan and addressed a joint session of the United States Congress. Lee stressed to Congress the importance of free trade and urged it not to turn towards protectionism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is inherent in America's position as the preeminent economic, political and military power to have to settle and uphold the rules for orderly change and progress... In the interests of peace and security America must uphold the rules of international conduct which rewards peaceful cooperative behaviour and punishes transgressions of the peace. A replay of the depression of the 1930s, which led to World War II, will be ruinous for all. All the major powers of the West share the responsibility of not repeating this mistake. But America's is the primary responsibility, for she is the anchor economy of the free-market economies of the world.\nIn May 1988, E. Mason \"Hank\" Hendrickson was serving as the First Secretary of the United States Embassy when he was expelled by the Singapore government. The Singapore government alleged that Hendrickson attempted to interfere in Singapore's internal affairs by cultivating opposition figures in a \"Marxist conspiracy\". Then-First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong claimed that Hendrickson's alleged conspiracy could have resulted in the election of 20 or 30 opposition politicians to Parliament, which in his words could lead to \"horrendous\" effects, possibly even the paralysis and fall of the Singapore government. In the aftermath of Hendrickson's expulsion, the U.S. State Department praised Hendrickson's performance in Singapore and denied any impropriety in his actions. The State Department also expelled Robert Chua, a senior-level Singaporean diplomat equal in rank to Hendrickson, from Washington, D.C., in response. The State Department's refusal to reprimand Hendrickson, along with its expulsion of the Singaporean diplomat, sparked a rare protest in Singapore by the National Trades Union Congress; they drove buses around the U.S. embassy, held a rally attended by four thousand workers, and issued a statement deriding the U.S. as \"sneaky, arrogant, and untrustworthy\".\nChina.\nSingapore did not establish diplomatic relations with China until the U.S. and Southeast Asia had decided they wanted to do so in order to avoid portraying a pro-China bias. His official visits to China starting in 1976 were conducted in English, to assure other countries that he represented Singapore, and not a \"Third China\" (the first two being the Republic of China (Taiwan) and People's Republic of [ Mainland ] China ).\nIn November 1978, after China had stabilised following political turmoil in the aftermath of Mao Zedong's death and the Gang of Four, Deng Xiaoping visited Singapore and met Lee. Deng, who was very impressed with Singapore's economic development, greenery and housing, and later sent tens of thousands of Chinese to Singapore and countries around the world to learn from their experiences and bring back their knowledge as part of the opening of China beginning in December 1978. Lee, on the other hand, advised Deng to stop exporting Communist ideologies to Southeast Asia, an advice that Deng later followed. This culminated in the exchange of Trade Offices between the two nations in September 1981. In 1985, commercial air services between mainland China and Singapore commenced and China appointed Goh Keng Swee, Singapore's finance minister in the post-independence years, as advisor on the development of Special Economic Zones.\nOn 3 October 1990, Singapore revised diplomatic relations from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China.\nUnited Kingdom.\nLee developed friendships with Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher.\nLee regarded Wilson's support and swift recognition of Singapore's independence crucial to Singapore's survival in its early days. Singapore was still heavily dependent on Britain for its defence and economy, and the British military bases were contributing over 20 percent to Singapore's gross national product. About 15 per cent of Singapore's workforce had jobs linked to British military bases on the island. However, mounting economic problems in Britain led to a weakening faith in the pound sterling, and the Singapore Government began reducing its sterling holdings from about 90 percent to just 50 percent by November 1967, when the Labour government devaluated pound sterling. Chancellor of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins, in a letter to Goh Keng Swee, expressed his \u201cregret that [Singapore] did not take [the UK] into their confidence\u201d when diversifying out of Sterling. To which Goh retorted in reply that Singapore sustained losses of about US$157 million as a result of the pound's devaluation.\nNo longer able to afford its military commitment in Southeast Asia, Britain announced in January 1968, the total withdrawal of its troops East of Suez, with the pullout from Malaysia and Singapore to be done by 31 March 1971 \u2013 four years earlier than planned. The announcement came as a shock to Singapore, because the British had earlier committed to a phased withdrawal.\nAs the first batch of 900 national servicemen had just started their training on 17 August 1967, Singapore was ill-equipped to take up its own defence. It was projected that about 25,000 base workers in Singapore would be rendered unemployed in 1971 as a result of the military withdrawal. When informed of the decision, Lee's government responded with dismay and anger. Lee threatened to withdraw from the sterling area, give the dockyards to the Japanese, and disrupt British shipping and trade. He also suggested that if the British forces withdrew too quickly, he would have to \u201chire mercenaries to defend Singapore\u201d. Lee and Minister for Finance Goh Keng Swee left for London, meeting with British political leaders, rallying for support through television appearances. With intense lobbying by Lee and Goh, the Wilson government went ahead with withdrawal, but agreed to a compromise to extend the withdrawal deadline from March to December 1971. Lee successfully negotiated with the British for a soft loan of \u00a350 million, free transfer of key assets, help with operating air defence systems, and training of military staff. Plans were set up to oversee the conversion and commercialisation of lands and facilities including the naval bases that had belonged to the British, which later proved instrumental in propelling Singapore's shipbuilding industry forward. Singapore acquired a squadron of British Hawker Hunter planes for its new air force, arriving in Singapore in 1970.\nTo make up for Britain's withdrawal, Singapore's military spending was tripled, and an air force and a navy were added to support the army. When Wilson's Labour government lost the 1970 election to the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the new Conservative government facilitated the Five Power Defence Arrangements, comprising the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore, to give a deterrent message that any attack on Singapore or Malaysia would lead to a potential intervention of British, Australian and New Zealand forces. Although most of the British troops had withdrawn from Singapore by October 1971, a small contingent of British, Australian and New Zealand forces stayed on as a token military presence. The last British soldier left Singapore in March 1976.\nLee and Thatcher, who became Britain's prime minister in 1979, admired each other's leadership qualities and had \"ideological convergence\" in policies like cracking down on trade union power, privatisation, low taxation and trimming the excesses of the welfare state. Lee also advised Thatcher while Britain was negotiating with China on the handover of Hong Kong.\nAustralia.\nAustralia, under Prime Minister Robert Menzies was one of the first countries to recognise Singapore's independence.\nHowever, Lee would later clash with Australian leaders John Gorton and Gough Whitlam who were inclined to pull Australia back from the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA). Lee clashed fiercely with Whitlam. Whitlam was initially reluctant to take too many of the Vietnamese boat people and tried to make Singapore take the first refugees from the Vietnam War. Lee retorted that Whitlam \u2018a very sympathetic Prime Minister who believes the White Australia policy is most deplorable and damnable and here is his chance.\u2019 Lee criticised Whitlam's pro-Asian rhetoric as political posturing because of his stance on the Vietnam boat refugees, and blocking Asian imports into Australia. In his memoirs, Lee wrote of his verbal jousts with Whitlam at Commonwealth meetings. Lee called Whitlam \u2018quick-witted but also quick-tempered\u2019, and was glad to see the end of the \u2018acerbic\u2019 Whitlam, calling it \u2018a relief when their Governor-General removed Whitlam\u2026\u2019.\nSingapore-Australia relations improved with Whitlam's successor, Malcolm Fraser. Lee held him in high regard for his support in confronting communism and defending the FPDA. However, he urged Fraser to reform the Australian economy, prompting the famous remark from Lee that Australia was in danger of becoming the \"poor white trash of Asia\" if it did not open up its economy. The comments were widely circulated in Australian political circles. Bob Hawke, who led the Labor party to a victory over Fraser in 1983, said \"I thought [Lee] was right, and his harsh but fair comment helped galvanise my determination to undertake the reforms that would save us from that fate and set us on a better path.\" Upon Lee's death, Hawke said \"Lee Kuan Yew was a great friend of Australia, if at times an outspoken one\".\nSingapore was Australia's strongest backer within ASEAN in the effort to create APEC in 1989.\nCambodia.\nLee opposed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978. The Singapore government organised an international campaign to condemn Vietnam and provided aid to the Khmer Rouge which was fighting against Vietnamese occupation during the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War from 1978 to 1989. In his memoirs, Lee recounted that in 1982, \"Singapore gave the first few hundreds of several batches of AK-47 rifles, hand grenades, ammunition and communication equipment\" to the Khmer Rouge resistance forces.\nSenior Minister (1990\u20132004).\nAfter leading the PAP to victory in seven elections, Lee stepped down on 28 November 1990, handing over the prime ministership to Goh Chok Tong. By that time, he had become the world's longest-serving prime minister. This was the first leadership transition since independence. Goh was elected as the new prime minister by the younger ministers then in office. When Goh Chok Tong became head of government, Lee remained in the cabinet with a non-executive position of Senior Minister and played a role he described as advisory. Lee subsequently stepped down as secretary-general of the PAP and was succeeded by Goh Chok Tong on 2 December 1992.\nCondominium rebates.\nIn April 1996, Lee and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, disclosed that they had purchased apartments located at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28 from Hotel Properties Ltd, a real estate developer listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore, at substantial discounts ranging from 5 to 12 per cent. The dispute arose amidst rampant property speculation in Singapore. Upon learning of the issue, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong swiftly initiated an immediate investigation into the matter. While Singapore law permits the provision of special discounts or rebates to relatives and associates of directors, it is imperative that such transactions receive approval from shareholders.\nThis disclosure prompted sufficient public disquiet for Lee to appear before Parliament to explain the purchases. Lee said that as he was a prominent figure, the developer had a \"legitimate incentive\" to provide discounts for publicity, and that he had previously purchased a car and acquired services from his tailor and cobbler at a discount. The amount saved was donated to charity.\nMinister Mentor (2004\u20132011).\nIn December 2004, Lee stepped down to become Minister Mentor. Expressing concern about the declining proficiency of Mandarin among younger Chinese Singaporeans, he started a year-long campaign called \"\" (Mandarin is Cool!) to garner interest in using Mandarin.\nOn 13 September 2008, Lee underwent treatment for abnormal heart rhythm (atrial flutter) at Singapore General Hospital. The treatment was successful, and he was well enough to address a philanthropy forum via video link from the hospital. On 28 September 2010, he was hospitalised for a chest infection, cancelling plans to attend the wake of the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Balaji Sadasivan.\nIn November 2010, Lee's private conversations with James Steinberg, US Deputy Secretary of State, on 30 May 2009 were among the leaked US Embassy cables. In a US Embassy report classified as \"Secret\", Lee gave his assessment of a number of Asian leaders and views on political developments in North Asia, including implications for nuclear proliferation.\nIn January 2011, the Straits Times Press published the book \"Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths To Keep Singapore Going\". Targeted at younger Singaporeans, it was based on 16 interviews with Lee by seven local journalists in 2008\u20132009. The first print run of 45,000 copies sold out in less than a month after it was launched in January 2011. Another batch of 55,000 copies was made available shortly after.\nAfter the 2011 general elections in which the Workers' Party, a major opposition political party in Singapore, made unprecedented gains by winning a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), Lee announced that he decided to leave the Cabinet for his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and his team to have a clean slate. Some analysts, such as Citigroup economist Kit Wei Zheng, believed that the senior Lee had contributed to the PAP's poor performance. In particular, he stated during campaigning that the voters of Aljunied constituency had \"five years to live and repent\" if they elected the Workers' Party, which some viewed as having backfired for the PAP as the opposition went on to win Aljunied.\nIn a column in the \"Sunday Times\" on 6 November 2011, Lee's daughter, Lee Wei Ling, revealed that her father had peripheral neuropathy. In the column, she recounted how she first noticed her father's ailments when she accompanied him to meet the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Connecticut in October 2009. Wei Ling, a neurologist, \"did a few simple neurological tests and decided the nerves to his legs were not working as they should\". A day later, when interviewed at a constituency tree-planting event, Lee stated: \"I have no doubt at all that this has not affected my mind, my will nor my resolve\" and that \"people in wheel chairs can make a contribution. I've still got two legs, I will make a contribution\".\nIllness and death.\nOn 15 February 2013, Lee was admitted to Singapore General Hospital following a prolonged cardiac dysrhythmia, which was followed by a brief stoppage of blood flow to the brain. For the first time in his career as a Member of Parliament (MP), Lee missed the annual Chinese New Year dinner at his constituency, where he was supposed to be the guest-of-honour. He was subsequently discharged, but continued to receive anti-coagulant therapy.\nThe following year, Lee missed his constituency's Chinese New Year dinner for the second consecutive time owing to bodily bacterial invasion. In April 2014, a photo depicting a thin and frail Lee was released online, drawing strong reactions from netizens. According to Lee's daughter, Lee Wei Ling, Lee had discussed euthanasia which is not a legal option in Singapore.\nOn 5 February 2015, Lee was hospitalised for pneumonia and was put on a ventilator at the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, although his condition was reported initially as \"stable\". A 26 February update stated that he was again being given antibiotics, while being sedated and still under mechanical ventilation. From 17 to 22 March, Lee continued weakening as he developed an infection while on life support, and he was described as \"critically ill\".\nOn 18 March that year, a death hoax website reported false news of Lee's death. The suspect is an unidentified minor who created a false webpage that resembled the PMO official website. Several international news organisations reported on Lee's death based on this and later retracted their statements.\nOn 23 March 2015, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced his father's death at the age of 91. Lee had died at 03:18 Singapore Standard Time (). A week of national mourning took place, during which time Lee was lying in state at Parliament House. As a mark of respect, State flags at all Government buildings were flown at half-mast. During this time, 1.7 million Singaporean residents as well as world leaders paid tribute to him at Parliament house and community tribute sites throughout the country. A state funeral for Lee was held on 29 March and attended by world leaders. Later that day, Lee was cremated in a private ceremony at the Mandai Crematorium.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI'm not saying that everything I did was right, but everything I did was for an honourable purpose. I had to do some nasty things, locking fellows up without trial.\nLee in 2010 during an interview with Seth Mydans of the \"New York Times\" and the former \"International Herald Tribune\", reflecting on his legacy during his premiership\nAs prime minister from 1959 to 1990, Lee presided over many of Singapore's advancements. He oversaw Singapore's transformation from an island nation with a high illiteracy rate and no natural resources into a developed country with a high-income economy within a single generation, commonly termed (from his autobiography) as 'From the third world to the first world'. Singapore's gross national product per capita (GNP) rose from $1,240 in 1959 to $18,437 in 1990. The unemployment rate in Singapore dropped from 13.5% in 1959 to 1.7% in 1990. External trade increased from $7.3\u00a0billion in 1959 to $205\u00a0billion in 1990. In other areas, the life expectancy at birth for Singaporeans rose from 65 years in 1960 to 74 years in 1990. The population of Singapore increased from 1.6\u00a0million in 1959 to 3 million in 1990. The number of public flats in Singapore rose from 22,975 in 1959 (then under the Singapore Improvement Trust) to 667,575 in 1990. The Singaporean literacy rate increased from 52% in 1957 to 90% in 1990. Telephone lines per 100 Singaporeans increased from 3 in 1960 to 38 in 1990. Visitor arrivals to Singapore rose from 100,000 in 1960 to 5.3\u00a0million in 1990.\nThese economic accomplishments were achieved in large part due to Lee's stewardship of public administration through relevant and targeted public policy; Lee introduced measures to jumpstart manufacturing of finished goods for export (export-oriented industrialisation) and sought to create a conducive business environment in the trading nation to attract foreign direct investment (through the establishment of the Economic Development Board, EDB). Lee also forged a symbiotic and mutually dependent relationship between the People's Action Party with the National Trades Union Congress, whereby the governing political party received certain input from the labour grassroots, whilst the national trade union centre is led by prominent PAP party politicians who usually have ministerial portfolios within the Government. The Government's tight control over trade union activities and industrial relations, ensured near-total industrial peace, that was assessed to be a prerequisite for rapid economic development.\nLee was a staunch promoter of economic globalisation and a vocal opponent of protectionism. Lee said that Singapore's only natural resources are its people and their strong work ethic. In addition, Lee was focused on social policies such as improving and mandating higher public standards for education, sanitation and hygiene, whilst concurrently improving public health by expanding modern health care and greatly increasing the quantity and quality of high-rise affordable housing (through the establishment of the Housing and Development Board, HDB) for working- and middle-class families. Various world leaders had also praised Lee. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once wrote of Lee: \"One of the asymmetries of history is the lack of correspondence between the abilities of some leaders and the power of their countries.\" Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher praised \"his way of penetrating the fog of propaganda and expressing with unique clarity the issues of our time and the way to tackle them\". Former president of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev stated in his memoirs that after the independence of Kazakhstan from the Soviet Union in 1991, he met Lee and stated Lee's \"observations and advice became for us [Kazakhstan] guidelines in the development of long-term state strategies.\"\nLee's achievements in Singapore were a major source of inspiration on Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship and suppression of dissent. From 1996 to 2019, 55,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods. He has also had a major influence on thinking in Russia in recent years. On the other hand, proponents of liberal democracy especially in the West criticised Lee's rule as authoritarian and as intolerant of dissent, citing his numerous attempts to sue political opponents and newspapers who express unfavourable opinions of Lee. Reporters Without Borders, an international media advocacy group, requested Lee and other senior Singaporean officials to stop taking libel suits against journalists. Lee was a co-inventor of \"Asian values\".\nLee was criticised for curtailing press freedoms, often imposing limits on public protests which prevented further occurrences, restricting labour movements from industrial action or strike action, suppressing wage growth of skilled workers (in order to be competitive with developing countries) amid widening and high levels of income inequality along with wealth inequality (relative to other developed countries), had encouraged an elitist mindset as well as filing defamation lawsuits against prominent political opponents. However, supporters argued in retrospect that his actions were necessary for the country's early development, and various international political analysts note that Lee's governance was generally pragmatic and benevolent. During the three decades in which Lee held office, Singapore grew from a developing country to one of the most developed nations in Asia and the world. Singapore was described as an illiberal democracy and a nanny state under his rule.\nLegal suits.\nAction against \"Far Eastern Economic Review\".\nIn April 1977, just months after a general election which saw the People's Action Party winning all 69 seats, the Internal Security Department, under orders from Lee, detained Ho Kwon Ping, the Singapore correspondent of the \"Far Eastern Economic Review\", as well as his predecessor Arun Senkuttavan, over their reporting. Ho was detained under the Internal Security Act which allows for indefinite trial, held in solitary confinement for two months, and charged with endangering national security. Following a televised confession in which Ho confessed to \"pro-communist activities\", he was fined $3,000. Lee Kuan Yew later charged \"FEER\" editor, Derek Davies, of participating in \"a diabolical international Communist plot\" to poison relations between Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia.\nIn 1987 Lee restricted sale of the \"Review\" in Singapore after it published an article about the detention of Roman Catholic church workers, reducing circulation of the magazine from 9,000 to 500 copies, on the grounds that it was \"interfering in the domestic politics of Singapore.\"\nOn 24 September 2008 the High Court of Singapore, in a summary judgment by Justice Woo Bih Li, ruled that the \"Far Eastern Economic Review\" magazine (Hugo Restall, editor), defamed Lee and his son, the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. The court found the 2006 article \"Singapore's 'Martyr': Chee Soon Juan\" suggested that Lee \"ha[d] been running and continue[d] to run Singapore in the same corrupt manner as Durai operated [the National Kidney Foundation] and he ha[d] been using libel actions to suppress those who questioned [him] to avoid exposure of his corruption\". The court ordered the Review, owned by Dow Jones &amp; Company (in turn owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp), to pay damages to the complainants. The magazine appealed but lost.\nAction against J.B. Jeyaretnam.\nLee commenced proceedings for slander against opposition leader J. B. Jeyaretnam for comments he made at a Workers' Party rally in the 1988 general election. Lee alleged that Jeyaretnam's speech at the rally implied he had tried to cover up the corruption of the former Minister for National Development, Teh Cheang Wan, by aiding and abetting his suicide. The action was heard by Justice Lai Kew Chai, who ruled against Jeyaretnam and ordered him to pay damages of S$260,000 plus costs to Lee. Jeyaretnam lost an appeal against the judgment.\nAction against Devan Nair.\nIn 1999, the former president of the Republic of Singapore Devan Nair who was living in Canada, remarked in an interview with the Toronto \"The Globe and Mail\" that Lee's technique of suing his opponents into bankruptcy or oblivion was an abrogation of political rights. Devan Nair also described Lee as \"an increasingly self-righteous know-all\" surrounded by \"department store dummies\". In response to these remarks, Lee sued Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair's counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair's counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the Singapore government. However, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice refused to throw out Nair's counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair had a reasonable cause of action.\nLee wrote in one of his memoirs that Nair was forced to resign as president due to his alleged alcoholism, a charge which Nair denied.\n\"International Herald Tribune\" defamation case.\nIn 2010 Lee, together with his son Lee Hsien Loong, and Goh Chok Tong, threatened legal action against The New York Times Company, which owns the \"International Herald Tribune\", regarding an op-ed piece titled \"All in the Family\" of 15 February 2010 by Philip Bowring, a freelance columnist and former editor of the \"Far Eastern Economic Review\". The \"International Herald Tribune\" apologised in March that readers of the article may \"infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit\". The New York Times Company and Bowring also agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee Hsien Loong, S$50,000 to Lee and S$50,000 to Goh (totalling about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to \"dynastic politics\" in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew. In response, media-rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders wrote an open letter to urge Lee and other top officials of the Singapore government to stop taking \"libel actions\" against journalists.\nPolitical positions.\nCriticism of Chinese marginalisation.\nOn 15 September 2006, at the Raffles Forum hosted by the School of Public Policy, Lee made a remark as to how the \"Malaysian and Indonesian governments systematically marginalise its Chinese people\", by bringing up topics such as the May 1998 riots of Indonesia and \"Ketuanan Melayu\", which subsequently caused a short diplomatic spat. He then described the systematic marginalisation of the Chinese in Malaysia, which aroused a strong response from the Malaysian government. Politicians in Malaysia and Indonesia expressed dissatisfaction with this and demanded the Singaporean government explain and apologise for Lee's remarks.\nFormer Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad criticised Lee Kuan Yew for his \"arrogance and disrespect\" for neighbouring countries and countered that Malaysia could also question Singapore's marginalisation of its local Malays and other minorities such as the Eurasians and Indians. Former Indonesian president B. J. Habibie also described the \"little red dot\" term in reference to Singapore as an incentive for Indonesian youth to learn from Singapore's achievements, and that the original intention was distorted. On 30 September, while Lee Kuan Yew apologised to the Malaysian prime minister at the time Abdullah Badawi for his remarks, he did not fully retract his remarks.\nEugenics.\nLee expressed views that have been characterised as pro-eugenics. He maintained that the educational background and intelligence of parents played a decisive role in shaping the abilities of their children, and he promoted policies designed to encourage highly educated women to have more children. Concerned by the sharp decline in Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR), Lee introduced the \"Graduate Mothers' Scheme\" in 1983, which offered tax incentives for children born to women with university degrees and gave priority in primary school admissions to the children of graduate mothers with three or more offspring. In his speech at the 1983 National Day Rally, Lee stated that if women graduates \"were not in the breeding pool\", society might become more \"stupid\" and that \"there will be less bright people to support dumb people in the next generation.\"\nIn June 1984, Lee's government introduced grants for low-income and low-education women to undergo sterilisation. Women whose husbands and themselves lacked passes at the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level and had fewer than three children could receive a $10,000 grant for sterilisation. Sterilised lower-class parents were also given priority in primary school admission for their existing first and second children. The controversy surrounding the proposal contributed to a 12.9 per cent swing against the PAP in the general election later that year, although the party still secured 64 per cent of the popular vote and the vast majority of seats. By 1985, particularly contentious aspects of the policy, such as granting education and housing advantages to educated women, were either abandoned or modified. A proponent of nature over nurture, Lee asserted that \"intelligence is 80% nature and 20% nurture\" and attributed the achievements of his children to genetics.\nIslam.\nIn 1999, in a discussion forum, Lee was asked whether the emotional bonds of various ethnic groups in Singapore could be a hurdle to nation building, Lee replied by alluding that an ethnic Malay and highly religious officer of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) might be hesitant to engage against an hypothetical war with Singapore's direct neighbours such as Malaysia.\nIn 2011, leaked diplomatic cables attributed to Lee some controversial comments regarding Islam. The cables quoted Lee as having described Islam as a \"venomous religion\". Lee called the remarks \"false\" and looked up to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)'s filenote of the meeting and found no record of the claim, stating that he was referring to extremists such as the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). He added that he recognises that Muslims in Singapore are largely rational and that one of the solutions to extremism was to give \"moderate Muslims the courage to stand up and speak out against radicals who hijacked Islam to recruit volunteers for their violent ends\".\nIn his book \"Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going\", Lee stated that Singaporean Muslims faced difficulties in integrating because of their religion and urged them to \"be less strict on Islamic observances\". His remarks drew fire from Malay\u2013Muslim leaders and MPs in Singapore, prompting a strong reaction from his son Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister at that time, who said his views differs from his father and that he values and respects the Malay\u2013Muslim community \"who have done a good deal to strengthen our harmony and social cohesion.\" Lee Kuan Yew eventually made a further comment that his comment was \"out of date\" and that he recognises the efforts made by Muslims to integrate with the other communities.\nHomosexuality.\nSection 377A of the Penal Code, which was first introduced in 1938 under British colonial rule that criminalised sex between adult males, remained enforced under Lee's premiership. In his later years, Lee appeared to become more supportive of LGBTQ+ issues and rights, expressing a belief that homosexuality was genetic and questioning the rationale behind its criminalisation. In 2007, he believed that homosexuality would eventually be accepted in Singapore, but advocated for a measured and \"pragmatic approach\" toward the matter \"to maintain social cohesion.\" Section 377A was eventually repealed in 2022.\nCorporal punishment.\nOne of Lee's abiding beliefs was in the efficacy of corporal punishment in the form of caning. In his autobiography \"The Singapore Story\", Lee described his time at Raffles Institution in the 1930s, mentioning that he was often caned there for chronic lateness by the then headmaster, D. W. McLeod. He added that he never understood why Western educationists were so much against corporal punishment as \"it did my fellow students and me no harm\".\nLee's government inherited judicial corporal punishment from British rule, but greatly expanded its scope. Under the British, it had been used as a penalty for offences involving personal violence, amounting to a handful of caning sentences per year. The PAP government under Lee extended its use to an ever-expanding range of crimes. By 1993, it was mandatory for 42 offences and optional for a further 42. Those routinely ordered by the courts to be caned now include drug addicts and illegal immigrants. From 602 canings in 1987, the figure rose to 3,244 in 1993 and to 6,404 in 2007.\nIn 1994, judicial caning was publicised in the rest of the world when an American teenager, Michael P. Fay, was caned under the vandalism legislation. School corporal punishment (for male students only) was likewise inherited from the British, and is still in use in schools, permitted under legislation from 1957. Lee also introduced caning in the Singapore Armed Forces, and Singapore is one of the few countries in the world where corporal punishment is an official penalty in military discipline.\nPress.\nIn his interview with Charlie Rose in October 2000, when asked whether he believed in the idea of a free press, Lee responded \"I believe in truth\" and \"I don't believe that the press should be crusading and putting a spin on things\" and asserted that newspapers should keep news reporting and editorials separate.\nImmigration.\nLee believed that the benefits of immigration had to be carefully balanced against the associated \"social load\". In a speech he made in 1971, Lee explained that it was necessary to have non-Singapore workers take up jobs that Singaporeans were not willing to do, but observed that it was important that the number of such migrant workers be carefully controlled because \"[t]hey dirty the place... they litter... if you take too many... they will bring us down to their values because it's easier to be untidy, scruffy, dirty, anti-social than to be disciplined, well-behaved and a good citizen\".\nPersonal life.\nLee and his wife, Kwa Geok Choo, were married on 30 September 1950. Both spoke English as their first language. Lee first started learning Chinese in 1955, at the age of 32. During World War II, he learned the Japanese language to help him survive, and worked as a Japanese translator during the Japanese occupation of Singapore.\nLee and Kwa have two sons and a daughter. His elder son, Lee Hsien Loong, was the third prime minister of Singapore. Several members of the Lee family hold prominent positions in the Singapore society. His younger son Lee Hsien Yang was president and CEO of SingTel, and Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). Lee's daughter Lee Wei Ling, a neurologist and epileptologist, was director of the National Neuroscience Institute. Lee's daughter-in-law Ho Ching was executive director and CEO of Temasek Holdings. His wife Kwa Geok Choo died on 2 October 2010, at the age of 89.\nLee had variously described himself as an agnostic and a \"nominal Buddhist\". He also mentioned that he was brought up in a family which practiced Chinese ancestor worship but stopped after his father died, and that he \"neither [denies] nor [accepts] that there is a God\". In his later years, Lee practised meditation under the tutelage of Benedictine monk Laurence Freeman, director of the World Community for Christian Meditation.\nLee was diagnosed with dyslexia in adulthood.\nLee was a founding member of the Fondation Chirac's honour committee, which was launched by former French president Jacques Chirac to promote world peace. He was also a member of David Rockefeller's \"International Council\", which included Henry Kissinger, Riley P. Bechtel, George Shultz and others. Additionally, he was one of the \"Forbes' Brain Trust\", along with Paul Johnson and Ernesto Zedillo.\nCultural depictions.\nIn 1979, oil painter Chua Mia Tee depicted Lee's return from London after the Merdeka Talks. In the early 1980s, Lee agreed to have a sculpture and oil painting of him done, on the condition that they not be exhibited in his lifetime. The works, respectively by British sculptor Sydney Harpley and American portrait painter Marion Pike, were commissioned by a group of Singaporeans, including first Chief Minister David Marshall. They are now part of the National Heritage Board's national collection, but only the bronze bust has gone on public display, briefly at the Istana and Parliament House. An artist's proof of the sculpture was exhibited in 2025.\nIn 1991, Chua Mia Tee presented an oil painting of Lee to the Minister himself, depicting him against a backdrop of Singapore's transformation. The untitled painting was commissioned by fifth president Ong Teng Cheong. In 1992, artist Lai Kui Fang presented historical oil paintings of Lee's 1959 swearing-in ceremony as prime minister, which are now part of the National Museum of Singapore's collection. Also in 1992, watercolourist Ong Kim Seng painted Lee visiting the aftermath of the Bukit Ho Swee fire, based on a 1961 photograph. The painting was reproduced in \"The Straits Times\" and sold to an unknown collector. In 2025, Ong recreated the painting, on a larger canvas, for an exhibition.\nIn 2008, artist Ben Puah unveiled \"Hero\", a solo exhibition of Lee portraits at Forth Gallery. In 2009, artist Richard Lim Han presented \"Singapore Guidance Angel\", a solo exhibition of Lee portraits at Forth Gallery. In the same year, freelance designer, Christopher \"Treewizard\" Pereira, began making caricature figurines of Lee which range from 12\u00a0cm to 30\u00a0cm. Comics artist and painter Sonny Liew depicted Lee as part of the series \"Eric Khoo is a Hotel Magnate\" at Mulan Gallery. In addition, Cultural Medallion recipient Tan Swie Hian also began a painting of Lee and his late wife titled \"A Couple\". The painting, which took Tan five years to complete, was partially damaged by a fire in 2013. It depicts Lee and Kwa in their youth, is based on a 1946 black-and-white photograph of the couple in Cambridge University and incorporates in its background Tan's poem in memory of Kwa. \"A Couple\" was purchased by art collector Wu Hsioh Kwang.\nIn 2010, Valentine Willie Fine Art gallery asked 19 local artists to imagine a future without Lee. The resulting exhibition, \"Beyond LKY\", included artist a triptych of Lee as a father figure looming over a tiny kneeling figure with the words, \"Papa can you hear me\"; an installation of a broken piano with a tape recorder playing a crackling version of Singapore's National Anthem; white ceramic chains hanging on a wall; and an installation of hammers smashed together. That year, Korean artist Kim Dong Yoo depicted Lee in \"Lee Kuan Yew &amp; Queen Elizabeth II\" (2010), an oil-on-canvas portrait of Lee using small images of Queen Elizabeth II's head, a reference to Singapore being a former British colony and current member of the Commonwealth. Indian-Swiss novelist Meira Chand's \"A Different Sky\", published by UK's Harvill Secker in 2010, features Lee in his early years as a lawyer and co-founder of the People's Action Party.\nIn 2011, the iris image of Lee's eye was captured and artistically rendered to resemble a sand art gallery piece. His eye image with his autograph was auctioned off to raise funds for the Singapore Eye Research Institute. In 2012, urban artist Sam Lo depicted Lee in their controversial \"Limpeh\" series, featuring his image in Shepard Fairey-inspired stickers, mirrors and collages.\nIn 2013, poet Cyril Wong published \"The Dictator's Eyebrow\", a poetry collection revolving around a Lee-like figure and his eyebrow's thirst for recognition and power. In the same year, a group of Tamil poets from three countries, including Singapore Literature Prize winner Ramanathan Vairavan, produced \"Lee Kuan Yew 90\", a collection of 90 new poems celebrating Lee's legacy. Artist Sukeshi Sondhi also staged \"An Icon &amp; A Legend\", a solo exhibition at featuring 20 pop art style paintings of Lee. Speed painter Brad Blaze was commissioned to craft a portrait of Lee, \"Trailblazer: Singapore\", to raise funds for Reach Community Services Society. In August, a bronze bust of Lee, cast by contemporary French artist-sculptor Nacera Kainou, was unveiled at the Singapore University of Technology and Design as an early birthday present to Lee from the Lyon-Singapore Association and the municipality of Lyon.\nIn 2014, Bruneian painter Huifong Ng landed an exhibition after painting a portrait of Lee. In May of that year, illustrator Patrick Yee produced the children's picture book \"A Boy Named Harry: The Childhood of Lee Kuan Yew\", published by Epigram Books. The series was later translated into Mandarin. Chinese artist Ren Zhenyu also created expressionist portraits of Lee in electric hues as part of his \"Pop and Politics\" series. Vietnamese artist Mai Huy Dung has crafted a series of oil painting portraits of Lee. Ukrainian artist Oleg Lazarenko also depicted Lee as part of his painting \"Lion of Singapore\". In October 2014, cartoonist Morgan Chua released \"LKY: Political Cartoons\", an anthology of cartoons about Lee published by Epigram Books, featuring a 1971 \"Singapore Herald\" cartoon of Lee on a tank threatening to crush a baby representing press freedoms. The Madame Tussauds Singapore museum also unveiled a wax figure of Lee and his late wife, Madam Kwa Geok Choo seated and smiling together against a backdrop of red flowers formed in the shape of two hearts. The statues were created based on a photograph that was taken by Madam Kwa's niece, Ms Kwa Kim Li, of the pair on Valentine's Day in 2008 at Sentosa.\nIn February 2015, weeks before Lee's death, Helmi Yusof of \"The Business Times\" reported on how \"[i]n the last few years, artworks featuring Lee Kuan Yew have turned into a flourishing cottage industry\". Artworks included Jeffrey Koh's seven LKY Pez candy-dispenser sculptures, paintings of Lee in the manner of Van Gogh, and Korean sculptor Park Seung Mo's three-dimensional image of Lee made using stainless steel wires. In the same month, illustrator Patrick Yee launched the second title in his picture book series about Lee, called \"Harry Grows Up: The Early Years of Lee Kuan Yew\", at an exhibition at the National Library, Singapore. In March, Singaporean artist Fan Shaohua and Lebanese-British artist Laudi Abilama exhibited their portraits of Lee. In the same month, the National Parks Board named a Singapore Botanic Gardens orchid hybrid called the \"Aranda Lee Kuan Yew\" in honour of Lee's efforts work in conservation and environmentalism. Also in March, a portrait of Lee by Ong Yi Teck, comprising Lee's name written about 18,000 times, went viral on social media. The portrait was made in tribute to Lee, who was then critically ill.\nDays after Lee died in 2015, the Asian edition of \"Time\" featured the late Lee Kuan Yew on its cover, while the 16-year-old blogger Amos Yee released a video, \"Lee Kuan Yew is Finally Dead!\", which criticised Lee and negatively compared him to Jesus Christ. Yee also posted on his blog a stick-figure cartoon depicting Lee having sex with Margaret Thatcher, a personal and political ally of Lee's. For his actions, Yee was charged with insulting religious feelings and obscenity, and sentenced to four weeks imprisonment despite his youth. In April 2015, an exhibition of 300 oil paintings on Lee and Singapore opened at Suntec City. Presented by art collector Vincent Chua, \"The Singapore Story\" featured 80 portraits of Lee and a life-size statue of Lee shaking hands with Deng Xiaoping when the Chinese statesman visited Singapore in 1978. In May, Sonny Liew released his graphic novel \"The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye\", in which Lee is central, while Patrick Yee launched the third and final title in his Harry Lee picture book series, \"Harry Builds a Nation: The Legacy of Lee Kuan Yew\", which were later translated to Chinese.\nIn July 2015, veteran actor Lim Kay Tong portrayed Lee in the historical film \"1965\", including a re-enactment of the iconic press conference when Lee announced that Singapore would be separated from Malaysia That same month, actor Adrian Pang played Lee in \"The LKY Musical\" opposite Sharon Au's Kwa Geok Choo. In October 2015, sculptor Lim Leong Seng exhibited a 75\u00a0cm bronze sculpture he made of Lee, entitled \"Weathering Storms As One\". In November 2015, the Singaporean Honorary Consulate General in Barcelona unveiled a bust of Lee at Cap Roig Gardens in Costa Brava, while pop artist Andre Tan showed his series of portraits of Lee, \"1965\" and \"Father of the Nation\" (\u56fd\u7236) at the Affordable Art Fair Singapore.\nIn 2016, to mark the first death anniversary of Lee, Lee's brother Lee Suan Yew and nephew Shaun Lee completed the art installation by young Singaporeans of Singapore flag erasers put together to form Lee's face, titled \"Our Father, Our Country, Our Flag\".\nIn 2023, the centenary of Lee's birth, American artist Daniel Arsham was commissioned to create two sculptures of Lee, \"Eroded Bronze LKY Bust 1:1\" and \"LKY Full Body 1:2\", using bronze, stainless steel, and patina. They were exhibited, along with AI-generated videos and portraits of Lee, at the immersive exhibition \"Now Is Not The Time\" in September. In the same month, paintings of Lee were exhibited at Tanjong Pagar Community Club in the show \"LKY100\".\nIn 2024, Singaporean artist David Chan showed his painting \"Lee And Raffles \u2013 5 Stars Rising\" at Art Seasons Gallery's booth at the Art SG fair, where it sold to a collector.\nIn 2025, Lee's ten-year death anniversary and \"SG60\" (Singapore's 60th year of independence), INSTINC gallery's exhibition \"10 Years: Remembering LKY\" showcased artworks reflecting on Lee's legacy, including portraits of Lee by Boo Sze Yang, Chang Hui Fang, and Laudi Abilama; Justin Lee's series \"LKY Quotes\"; and Yeo Shih Yun's screenprint of Lee planting a tree in 1973. The exhibition was a follow-up to \"Remembering LKY\" in 2015. In July, Cuturi Gallery showcased Singaporean artist Yom Bo Sung's small-scale sculpture of Lee, \"Elegy\", as part of the exhibition \"Sixty Summers Here\". Also in July, the group exhibition \"Artist\u2019s Proof: Singapore At 60 \" showed, alongside an artist's proof of Harpley's bust of Lee, cartoonist Sonny Liew's figurine of Lee, as part of commissioned project \"P.A.P. x P.A.\"; Foo Kwee Horng's painting portrait of Lee, \"Majulah\" (2016); a portrait of Lee by Rajesh P Kargutkar; and Jon Chan's oil paintings of the offices of Lee and former political detainee Chia Thye Poh. In August, movie director Jack Neo uploaded a music video for his song, \"We Are Singapore\", including AI-generated images of the late Lee.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65071", "revid": "318802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65071", "title": "Monster", "text": "Fearsome or grotesque fictional being\nA monster is a type of imaginary or fictional creature found in literature, folklore, mythology, horror, fantasy, fiction and religion. They are very often depicted as dangerous and aggressive, with a strange or grotesque appearance that causes terror and fear, often in humans. Monsters usually resemble bizarre, deformed, otherworldly and/or mutated animals or entirely unique creatures of varying sizes, but may also take a human form, such as mutants, ghosts, spirits, vampires or zombies, among other things. They may or may not have supernatural powers, but are usually capable of killing or causing some form of destruction, threatening the social or moral order of the human world in the process.\nAnimal monsters are outside the moral order, but sometimes have their origin in some human violation of the moral law (e.g. in the Greek myth, Minos does not sacrifice to Poseidon the white bull which the god sent him, so as punishment Poseidon makes Minos' wife, Pasipha\u00eb, fall in love with the bull. She copulates with the beast, and gives birth to the man with a bull's head, the Minotaur). Human monsters are those who by birth were never fully human (Medusa and her Gorgon sisters) or who through some supernatural or unnatural act lost their humanity (werewolves, Frankenstein's monster), and so who can no longer, or who never could, follow the moral law of human society.\nMonsters may also be depicted as misunderstood and friendly creatures who frighten individuals away without wanting to, or may be so large, strong and clumsy that they cause unintentional damage or death. Some monsters in fiction are depicted as mischievous and boisterous but not necessarily threatening (such as a sly goblin), while others may be docile but prone to becoming angry or hungry, thus needing to be tamed and taught to resist savage urges, or killed if they cannot be handled or controlled successfully.\nMonsters pre-date written history, and the academic study of the particular cultural notions expressed in a society's ideas of monsters is known as \"monstrophy\". Monsters have appeared in literature and in feature-length films. Well-known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, vampires, demons, reanimated mummies, and zombies.\nEtymology.\n\"Monster\" derives from the Latin \"monstrum\", itself derived ultimately from the verb \"moneo\" (\"to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell\"), and denotes anything \"strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature, by which the gods give notice of evil,\" \"a strange, unnatural, hideous person, animal, or thing,\" or any \"monstrous or unusual thing, circumstance, or adventure.\"\nCultural heritage.\nIn the words of Tina Marie Boyer, assistant professor of medieval German literature at Wake Forest University, \"monsters do not emerge out of a cultural void; they have a literary and cultural heritage\".\nIn the religious context of ancient Greeks and Romans, monsters were seen as signs of \"divine displeasure\", and it was thought that birth defects were especially ominous, being \"an unnatural event\" or \"a malfunctioning of nature\".\nMonsters are not necessarily abominations however. The Roman historian Suetonius, for instance, describes a snake's absence of legs or a bird's ability to fly as monstrous, as both are \"against nature\". Nonetheless, the negative connotations of the word quickly established themselves, and by the playwright and philosopher Seneca's time, the word had extended into its philosophical meaning, \"a visual and horrific revelation of the truth\".\nIn spite of this, mythological monsters such as the Hydra and Medusa are not natural beings, but divine entities. This seems to be a holdover from Proto-Indo-European religion and other belief systems, in which the divisions between \"spirit,\" \"monster,\" and \"god\" were less evident.\nMonsters in fiction.\nProse fiction.\nThe history of monsters in fiction is long. For instance, Grendel in the epic poem \"Beowulf\" is an archetypal monster: deformed, brutal, and with enormous strength, he raids a human settlement nightly to slay and feed on his victims. The modern literary monster has its roots in examples such as the monster in Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" and the vampire in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\".\nMonsters are a staple of fantasy fiction, horror fiction, and science fiction (where the monsters are often extraterrestrial in nature). There also exists monster erotica, a subgenre of erotic fiction that involves monsters.\nFilm.\nPre\u2013World War II monster films.\nDuring the age of silent films, monsters tended to be human-sized, e.g. Frankenstein's monster, the Golem, werewolves and vampires. The film \"Siegfried\" featured a dragon that consisted of stop-motion animated models, as in RKO's \"King Kong\", the first giant monster film of the sound era.\nUniversal Studios specialized in monsters, with Bela Lugosi's reprisal of his stage role, Dracula, and Boris Karloff playing Frankenstein's monster. The studio also made several lesser films, such as \"Man-Made Monster\", starring Lon Chaney Jr. as a carnival side-show worker who is turned into an electrically charged killer, able to dispatch victims merely by touching them, causing death by electrocution.\nThere was also a variant of Dr. Frankenstein, the mad surgeon Dr. Gogol (played by Peter Lorre), who transplanted hands that were reanimated with malevolent temperaments, in the film \"Mad Love\".\nWerewolves were introduced in films during this period. Mummies were cinematically depicted as fearsome monsters as well. As for giant creatures, the cliffhanger of the first episode of the 1936 \"Flash Gordon\" serial did not use a costumed actor, instead using real-life lizards to depict a pair of battling dragons via use of camera perspective. However, the cliffhanger of the ninth episode of the same serial had a man in a rubber suit play the Fire Dragon, which picks up a doll representing Flash in its claws. The cinematic monster cycle eventually wore thin, having a comedic turn in \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948).\nPost\u2013World War II monster films.\nIn the post\u2013World War II era, however, giant monsters returned to the screen with a vigor that has been causally linked to the development of nuclear weapons. One early example occurred in the American film \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\", which was about a dinosaur that attacked a lighthouse. Subsequently, there were Japanese film depictions, (Godzilla, Gamera), British depictions (\"Gorgo\"), and even Danish depictions (\"Reptilicus\"), of giant monsters attacking cities. A recent depiction of a giant monster is depicted in J. J. Abrams's \"Cloverfield\", which was released in theaters 18 January 2008. The intriguing proximity of other planets brought the notion of extraterrestrial monsters to the big screen, some of which were huge in size (such as King Ghidorah and Gigan), while others were of a more human scale. During this period, the fish-human monster Gill-man was developed in the film series \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\".\nBritain's Hammer Film Productions brought color to the monster movies in the late 1950s. Around this time, the earlier Universal films were usually shown on American television by independent stations (rather than network stations) by using announcers with strange personas, who gained legions of young fans. Although they have since changed considerably, movie monsters did not entirely disappear from the big screen as they did in the late 1940s.\nOccasionally, monsters are depicted as friendly or misunderstood creatures. King Kong and Frankenstein's monster are two examples of misunderstood creatures. Frankenstein's monster is frequently depicted in this manner, in series and films such as \"Monster Squad\" and \"Van Helsing\". The Hulk is an example of the \"Monster as Hero\" archetype. The theme of the \"Friendly Monster\" is pervasive in pop-culture. Chewbacca, Elmo, and Shrek are notable examples of friendly \"monsters\". In the \"Monsters, Inc.\" franchise by Pixar, the monster characters scare (and later entertain) children in order to create energy for running machinery in their home world, while the furry monsters of \"The Muppets\" and \"Sesame Street\" live in harmony with animals and humans alike. Japanese culture also commonly features monsters which are benevolent or likable, with the most famous examples being the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" franchise and the pioneering anime \"My Neighbor Totoro\". The book series/webisodes/toy line of Monster High is another example.\nGames.\nMonsters are commonly encountered in fantasy or role-playing games, as well as video games, as enemies for players to fight against. They may include aliens, legendary creatures, extra-dimensional entities or mutated versions of regular animals.\nEspecially in role-playing games, \"monster\" is a catch-all term for hostile characters that are fought by the player. Sentient fictional races are usually not referred to as monsters. At other times, the term can carry a neutral connotation, such as in the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" franchise, where it is used to refer to cute fictional creatures that resemble real-world animals.

Commercially available triticale is almost always a second-generation hybrid, i.e., a cross between two kinds of primary (first-cross) triticales. As a rule, triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance (including soil conditions) of rye. Only in 1970 did the first commercial variety become available. Depending on the cultivar, triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents. It is grown mostly for forage or fodder, although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores and can be found in some breakfast cereals.\nWhen crossing wheat and rye, wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent (pollen donor). The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself.\nThe primary producers of triticale are Poland, Germany, Belarus, France and Russia. In 2014, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 17.1 million tons were harvested in 37 countries across the world.\nThe triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid, which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species. In other words, triticale is an allotetraploid. In earlier years, most work was done on octoploid triticale. Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time. The tetraploids showed little promise, but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application.\nThe CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) triticale improvement program was intended to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries. Triticale was thought to have potential in the production of bread and other food products, such as cookies, pasta, pizza dough and breakfast cereals. The protein content is higher than that of wheat, although the glutenin fraction is less. The grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat. Acceptance would require the milling industry to adapt to triticale, as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to triticale. Past research indicated that triticale could be used as a feed grain and, particularly, later research found that its starch is readily digested. As a feed grain, triticale is already well established and of high economic importance. It has received attention as a potential energy crop, and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crop's biomass in bioethanol production. Triticale has also been used to produce vodka.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century, crossing cultivars or species became better understood, allowing the controlled hybridization of more plants and animals. In 1873, Alexander Wilson first managed to manually fertilize the female organs of wheat flowers with rye pollen (male gametes), but found that the resulting plants were sterile, much the way the offspring of a horse and donkey is an infertile mule. Fifteen years later in 1888, a partially-fertile hybrid was produced by Wilhelm Rimpau, \"Tritosecale Rimpaui Wittmack\". Such hybrids germinate only when the chromosomes spontaneously double.\nUnfortunately, \"partially fertile\" was all that was produced until 1937. In that year, it was discovered that the chemical colchicine, which is used both for general plant germination and as a treatment for gout, would force chromosome doubling by keeping them from pulling apart during cell division. Triticale had become viable, though at that point the cost of producing the seeds was disproportionate to the yield.\nBy the 1960s, triticale was being produced that was far more nutritious than normal wheat. However, it was a poorly-producing crop, sometimes yielding shriveled kernels, germinating poorly or prematurely, and did not bake well.\nModern triticale has overcome most of these problems, after decades of additional breeding and gene transfer with wheat and rye. Millions of acres/hectares of the crop are grown around the world, slowly increasing toward becoming a significant source of food-calories.\nSpecies.\nTriticale hybrids are currently classified by ploidy into three nothospecies:\nThe current treatment follows the Mac Key 2005 treatment of \"Triticum\" using a broad species concept based on genome composition. Traditional classifications used a narrow species concept based on the treatment of wheats by Dorofeev \"et al.\", 1979, and hence produced many more species names. The genome notation follows , with the rye genome notated as R.\nBiology and genetics.\nEarlier work with wheat-rye crosses was difficult due to low survival of the resulting hybrid embryo and spontaneous chromosome doubling. These two factors were difficult to predict and control. To improve the viability of the embryo and thus avoid its abortion, \"in vitro\" culture techniques were developed (Laibach, 1925). Colchicine was used as a chemical agent to double the chromosomes. After these developments, a new era of triticale breeding was introduced. Earlier triticale hybrids had four reproductive disorders, namely meiotic instability, high aneuploid frequency, low fertility and shriveled seed (Muntzing 1939; Krolow 1966). Cytogenetical studies were encouraged and well funded to overcome these problems.\nIt is especially difficult to see the expression of rye genes in the background of wheat cytoplasm and the predominant wheat nuclear genome. This makes it difficult to realise the potential of rye in disease resistance and ecological adaptation.\nTriticale is essentially a self-fertilizing, or naturally inbred crop. This mode of reproduction results in a more homozygous genome. The crop is, however, adapted to this form of reproduction from an evolutionary point of view. Cross-fertilization is also possible, but it is not the primary form of reproduction.\n\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Sr27\" is a stem rust resistance gene which is commonly found in triticale. Originally from rye (Imperial rye), now (as of 2021[ [update]]) widely found in triticale. Located on the 3A chromosome arm, originally from 3R. Virulence has been observed in field by \"Puccinia graminis\" f. sp. \"secalis\" (\"Pgs\") and in an artificial cross \"Pgs\" \u00d7 \"Puccinia graminis\" f. sp. \"tritici\" (\"Pgt\"). When successful, \"Sr27\" is among the few \"Sr\"s that does not even allow the underdeveloped uredinia and slight degree of sporulation commonly allowed by most \"Sr\"s. Instead there are necrotic or chlorotic flecks. Deployment in triticale in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, however, rapidly showed virulence between 1982 and 1984 \u2013 the first virulence on this gene in the world. (This was especially associated with the cultivar Coorong.) Therefore, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center's triticale offerings were tested and many were found to depend solely on \"Sr27\". Four years later, in 1988 virulence was found in South Africa. \"Sr27\" has become less common in CIMMYT triticales since the mid-'80s.\nConventional breeding approaches.\nThe aim of a triticale breeding programme is mainly focused on the improvement of quantitative traits, such as grain yield, nutritional quality and plant height, as well as traits which are more difficult to improve, such as earlier maturity and improved test weight (a measure of bulk density). These traits are controlled by more than one gene. Problems arise, however, because such polygenic traits involve the integration of several physiological processes in their expression. Thus the lack of single-gene control (or simple inheritance) results in low trait heritability (Zumelz\u00fa \"et al.\" 1998).\nSince the induction of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale breeding programme in 1964, the improvement in realised grain yield has been remarkable. In 1968, at Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n, Sonora, in northwest Mexico, the highest yielding triticale line produced 2.4 t/ha. Today, CIMMYT has released high yielding spring triticale lines (e.g. Pollmer-2) which have surpassed the 10 t/ha yield barrier under optimum production conditions.\nBased on the commercial success of other hybrid crops, the use of hybrid triticales as a strategy for enhancing yield in favourable, as well as marginal, environments has proven successful over time. Earlier research conducted by CIMMYT made use of a chemical hybridising agent to evaluate heterosis in hexaploid triticale hybrids. To select the most promising parents for hybrid production, test crosses conducted in various environments are required, because the variance of their specific combining ability under differing environmental conditions is the most important component in evaluating their potential as parents to produce promising hybrids. The prediction of general combining ability of any triticale plant from the performance of its parents is only moderate with respect to grain yield. Commercially exploitable yield advantages of hybrid triticale cultivars is dependent on improving parent heterosis and on advances in inbred-line development.\nTriticale is useful as an animal feed grain. However, it is necessary to improve its milling and bread-making quality aspects to increase its potential for human consumption. The relationship between the constituent wheat and rye genomes were noted to produce meiotic irregularities, and genome instability and incompatibility presented numerous problems when attempts were made to improve triticale. This led to two alternative methods to study and improve its reproductive performance, namely, the improvement of the number of grains per floral spikelet and its meiotic behaviour. The number of grains per spikelet has an associated low heritability value (de Zumelz\u00fa et al. 1998). In improving yield, indirect selection (the selection of correlated/related traits other than that to be improved) is not necessarily as effective as direct selection. (Gallais 1984)\nLodging (the toppling over of the plant stem, especially under windy conditions) resistance is a polygenically inherited (expression is controlled by many genes) trait, and has thus been an important breeding aim in the past. The use of dwarfing genes, known as \"Rht\" genes, which have been incorporated from both \"Triticum\" and \"Secale\", has resulted in a decrease of up to in plant height without causing any adverse effects.\nA 2013 study found that hybrids have better yield stability under yield stress than do inbred lines.\nApplication of newer techniques.\nAbundant information exists concerning R-genes (for disease resistance) in wheat, and a continuously updated on-line catalogue, the Catalogue of Gene Symbols, of these genes can be found at https:// . Another online database of cereal rust resistance genes is available at https://. Unfortunately, less is known about rye and particularly triticale R-genes. Many R-genes have been transferred to wheat from its wild relatives, and appear in such papers and catalogues, thus making them available for triticale breeding. The two mentioned databases are significant contributors to improving the genetic variability of the triticale gene pool through gene (or more specifically, allele) provision. Genetic variability is essential for progress in breeding. In addition, genetic variability can also be achieved by producing new primary triticales, which essentially means the reconstitution of triticale, and the development of various hybrids involving triticale, such as triticale-rye hybrids. In this way, some chromosomes from the R genome have been replaced by some from the D genome. The resulting so-called substitution and translocation triticale facilitates the transfer of R-genes.\nIntrogression.\nIntrogression involves the crossing of closely related plant relatives, and results in the transfer of 'blocks' of genes, i.e. larger segments of chromosomes compared to single genes. R-genes are generally introduced within such blocks, which are usually incorporated/translocated/introgressed into the distal (extreme) regions of chromosomes of the crop being introgressed. Genes located in the proximal areas of chromosomes may be completely linked (very closely spaced), thus preventing or severely hampering recombination, which is necessary to incorporate such blocks. Molecular markers (small lengths of DNA of a characterized/known sequence) are used to 'tag' and thus track such translocations. A weak colchicine solution has been employed to increase the probability of recombination in the proximal chromosome regions, and thus the introduction of the translocation to that region. The resultant translocation of smaller blocks that indeed carry the R-gene(s) of interest has decreased the probability of introducing unwanted genes.\nThe \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Sr59\" resistance gene was introgressed into wheat from the 2R chromosome of rye. However this was actually done \"through\" triticale. Triticale has been the amphiploid for several such rye\u21e8wheat introgressions.\nA 2014 study found that \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Ddw1\" dwarfing gene from the rye 5R chromosome also provides Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in this host.\nProduction of doubled haploids.\nDoubled haploid (DH) plants have the potential to save much time in the development of inbred lines. This is achieved in a single generation, as opposed to many, which would otherwise occupy much physical space/facilities. DHs also express deleterious recessive alleles otherwise masked by dominance effects in a genome containing more than one copy of each chromosome (and thus more than one copy of each gene). Various techniques exist to create DHs. The \"in vitro\" culture of anthers and microspores is most often used in cereals, including triticale. These two techniques are referred to as androgenesis, which refers to the development of pollen. Many plant species and cultivars within species, including triticale, are recalcitrant in that the success rate of achieving whole newly generated (diploid) plants is very low. Genotype by culture medium interaction is responsible for varying success rates, as is a high degree of microspore abortion during culturing. The response of parental triticale lines to anther culture is known to be correlated to the response of their progeny. Chromosome elimination is another method of producing DHs, and involves hybridisation of wheat with maize (\"Zea mays\" L.), followed by auxin treatment and the artificial rescue of the resultant haploid embryos before they naturally abort. This technique is applied rather extensively to wheat. Its success is in large part due to the insensitivity of maize pollen to the crossability inhibitor genes known as Kr1 and Kr2 that are expressed in the floral style of many wheat cultivars. The technique is unfortunately less successful in triticale. However, \"Imperata cylindrica\" (a grass) was found to be just as effective as maize with respect to the production of DHs in both wheat and triticale.\nApplication of molecular markers.\nAn important advantage of biotechnology applied to plant breeding is the speeding up of cultivar release that would otherwise take 8\u201312 years. It is the process of selection that is actually enhanced, i.e., retaining that which is desirable or promising and ridding that which is not. This carries with it the aim of changing the genetic structure of the plant population. The website https:// is a valuable resource for marker assisted selection (MAS) protocols relating to R-genes in wheat. MAS is a form of indirect selection. The Catalogue of Gene Symbols mentioned earlier is an additional source of molecular and morphological markers. Again, triticale has not been well characterised with respect to molecular markers, although an abundance of rye molecular markers makes it possible to track rye chromosomes and segments thereof within a triticale background.\nYield improvements of up to 20% have been achieved in hybrid triticale cultivars due to heterosis. This raises the question of what inbred lines should be crossed (to produce hybrids) with each other as parents to maximize yield in their hybrid progeny. This is termed the 'combining ability' of the parental lines. The identification of good combining ability at an early stage in the breeding programme can reduce the costs associated with 'carrying' a large number of plants (literally thousands) through it, and thus forms part of efficient selection. Combining ability is assessed by taking into consideration all available information on descent (genetic relatedness), morphology, qualitative (simply inherited) traits and biochemical and molecular markers. Exceptionally little information exists on the use of molecular markers to predict heterosis in triticale. Molecular markers are generally accepted as better predictors than morphological markers (of agronomic traits) due to their insensitivity to variation in environmental conditions.\nA useful molecular marker known as a simple sequence repeat (SSR) is used in breeding with respect to selection. SSRs are segments of a genome composed of tandem repeats of a short sequence of nucleotides, usually two to six base pairs. They are popular tools in genetics and breeding because of their relative abundance compared to other marker types, a high degree of polymorphism (number of variants), and easy assaying by polymerase chain reaction. However, they are expensive to identify and develop. Comparative genome mapping has revealed a high degree of similarity in terms of sequence colinearity between closely related crop species. This allows the exchange of such markers within a group of related species, such as wheat, rye and triticale. One study established a 58% and 39% transferability rate to triticale from wheat and rye, respectively. Transferability refers to the phenomenon where the sequence of DNA nucleotides flanking the SSR locus (position on the chromosome) is sufficiently homologous (similar) between genomes of closely related species. Thus, DNA primers (generally, a short sequence of nucleotides used to direct the copying reaction during PCR) designed for one species can be used to detect SSRs in related species. SSR markers are available in wheat and rye, but very few, if any, are available for triticale.\nGenetic transformation.\nThe genetic transformation of crops involves the incorporation of 'foreign' genes or, rather, very small DNA fragments compared to introgression discussed earlier. Amongst other uses, transformation is a useful tool to introduce new traits or characteristics into the transformed crop. Two methods are commonly employed: infectious bacterial-mediated (usually \"Agrobacterium\") transfer and biolistics, with the latter being most commonly applied to allopolyploid cereals such as triticale. \"Agrobacterium\"-mediated transformation, however, holds several advantages, such as a low level of DNA rearrangement in the transgenic plant, a low number of introduced copies of the transforming DNA, stable integration of an a-priori characterized T-DNA fragment (containing the DNA expressing the trait of interest) and an expected higher level of transgene expression. Triticale has, until recently, only been transformed via biolistics, with a 3.3% success rate. Little has been documented on \"Agrobacterium\"-mediated transformation of wheat: while no data existed with respect to triticale until 2005, the success rate in later work was nevertheless low.\nResearch.\nTriticale holds much promise as a commercial crop, as it has the potential to address specific problems within the cereal industry. Research is currently being conducted worldwide in places like Stellenbosch University in South Africa.\nConventional plant breeding has helped establish triticale as a valuable crop, especially where conditions are less favourable for wheat cultivation. Triticale being a synthesized grain notwithstanding, many initial limitations, such as an inability to reproduce due to infertility and seed shrivelling, low yield and poor nutritional value, have been largely eliminated.\nTissue culture techniques with respect to wheat and triticale have seen continuous improvements, but the isolation and culturing of individual microspores seems to hold the most promise. Many molecular markers can be applied to marker-assisted gene transfer, but the expression of R-genes in the new genetic background of triticale remains to be investigated. More than 750 wheat microsatellite primer pairs are available in public wheat breeding programmes, and could be exploited in the development of SSRs in triticale. Another type of molecular marker, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), is likely to have a significant impact on the future of triticale breeding.\nHealth concerns.\nLike both its hybrid parents \u2013 wheat and rye \u2013 triticale contains gluten and is therefore unsuitable for people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy, among others.\nIn fiction.\nAn episode of the popular TV series \"Star Trek\", \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", revolved around the protection of a grain developed from triticale. This grain was named \"quadro-triticale\" by writer David Gerrold at the suggestion of producer Gene Coon, with four distinct lobes per kernel. In that episode Mr. Spock attributes the ancestry of the nonfictional grain to 20th-century Canada.\nIndeed, in 1953 the University of Manitoba began the first North American triticale breeding program. Early breeding efforts concentrated on developing a high-yield, drought-tolerant human food crop species suitable for marginal wheat-producing areas. (Later in the episode, Chekov claims that the fictional quadro-triticale was a \"Russian invention\".)\nA later episode titled \"More Tribbles, More Troubles\", in , also written by Gerrold, dealt with \"quinto-triticale\", an improvement on the original, having apparently five lobes per kernel.\nThree decades later the spinoff series \"\" revisited quadro-triticale and the depredations of the Tribbles in the episode \"Trials and Tribble-ations\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is most widely known for his 1978 book \"Faeries\" with Alan Lee, and as the conceptual designer of the Jim Henson films \"The Dark Crystal\" (1982) and \"Labyrinth\" (1986). According to \"Wired\", Froud is \"one of the most pre-emiminent visualizers of the world of faerie and folktale\".\nMost recently, Froud developed the 2019 streaming television series \"\".\nEarly life.\nFroud was born in Winchester, England in 1947. An only child, he grew up in rural Hampshire before moving to Kent. In 1967 he enrolled as a painter at Maidstone College of Art, where he graduated with a first class honors diploma in Graphic Design in 1971.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating, Froud spent five years working as a commercial illustrator in Soho, London before moving to Chagford, Devon in 1975. Between 1972 and 1976, he illustrated four books by children's author Margaret Mahy and \"Are All the Giants Dead?\" by Mary Norton. In 1976, Froud was featured in \"Once Upon a Time: Some Contemporary Illustrators of Fantasy\", a survey of modern British illustrators. In 1977, an anthology of his artwork, \"The Land of Froud\", was published.\nIn collaboration with his friend and fellow artist Alan Lee, Froud created the 1978 book \"Faeries\", an illustrated compendium of faerie folklore. \"Faeries\" reached number four on the \"New York Times\" Best Sellers list, and by 2003 had sold over five million copies.\nFroud's artwork in \"Once Upon a Time\" and \"The Land of Froud\" brought him to the attention of Jim Henson, who sought out Froud to collaborate on his all-puppetry film \"The Dark Crystal\". Froud served as the conceptual designer of \"The Dark Crystal\", released in 1982. The same year, his concept art for the film was published in the companion book \"The World of the Dark Crystal\". Froud was also the conceptual designer for Henson's next feature film, \"Labyrinth\", released in 1986, as well as for the pilot episode of Henson's television series \"The Storyteller\", first aired in 1987. Following his collaborations with Henson, Froud's filmography continued; as a designer for the 1989 Japanese animated film '; as a visual consultant on the 2000 American animated film \"The Life &amp; Adventures of Santa Claus\" and P. J. Hogan\u2019s 2003 live-action film \"Peter Pan\"; and as a concept artist on the 2016 Disney film \"Pete's Dragon\". Froud returned to working with the Jim Henson Company as the primary conceptual designer of the 2019 Netflix series ', a prequel to \"The Dark Crystal\".\nIn the late 1980s, Froud formed an artistic-literary partnership with Terry Jones, who was a screenwriter on \"Labyrinth\". Together they produced \"The Goblins of Labyrinth\" (1986), a companion book containing Froud's concept art for the film, and subsequently a number of non-\"Labyrinth\"-related books about fairies and goblins. Their \"Lady Cottington\" series parodied the Cottingley Fairies phenomenon. For his artwork in the first book of the series, \"Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book\" (1994), Froud won the Hugo Award for Best Original Artwork and the Chesley Award for Best Interior Illustration.\nIn 1991, Froud created over 50 paintings and drawings for his \"Faerielands\" series, a collaborative project in which he invited four fantasy authors \u2014 Charles de Lint, Patricia A. McKillip, Terri Windling and Midori Snyder \u2014 to choose their favourite of his pieces and write stories to go with them, based on the premise that \"Faerie, inextricably bound as it is to nature and natural forces, is gravely threatened by the ecological crises that human beings have brought to our world\u201d. The resulting novels were to be published by Bantam Books. However, only de Lint's \"The Wild Wood\" and McKillip's \"Something Rich and Strange\" were published in 1994 under the banner \"Brian Froud's Faerielands\" before the project was cancelled.\nHis artwork has been exhibited in the United Kingdom and the United States. By 2003, Froud had sold over eight million large-format books of his paintings of fairies.\nPersonal life.\nFroud is married to Wendy Froud (\"n\u00e9e\" Midener), a puppet-maker and sculptor whom he met at Jim Henson Studios in 1978 while working on \"The Dark Crystal\". The couple married on 31 May 1980, in Chagford. Their son Toby (born 1984) portrayed the infant of the same name in \"Labyrinth\" at the age of one, and later became a puppeteer and creature fabricator, working alongside his parents on \"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance\" as design supervisor. Through his son, Froud has one grandson.\nArtistic style and influences.\nFroud's artwork frequently draws upon fairy tales and European folklore. His paintings of fairies are known for recontexualising Victorian and Edwardian-era beliefs about fairies and were part of a revival of fairy painting seen during the late 20th century. \nAmong Froud's major influences are the 19th and early 20th-century illustrators Arthur Rackham, Edmund Dulac, and Richard Dadd. Froud cites the early influence of Rackham, \"in particular, [Rackham's] drawings of trees that had faces\", as sparking his interest in illustrating fairy tales, and describes having had a love of nature from childhood that has informed his style. He is frequently inspired by the landscape of Dartmoor. Other influences Froud cites include the Robinson brothers (Thomas, Charles and William), the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris and Northern European art from the 1500s and 1600s. He has stated that he was fascinated by Greek, Druid, Celtic and German 15th-century history and mythology. Froud's work has also been influenced by Arthurian legend, \"com[ing] from Glastonbury as a sacred centre\". Jeremiah Horrigan of the \"Poughkeepsie Journal\" wrote that Froud's style \"echoes not only the great 19th century illustrators he reveres, but also harbors a wealth of elements ranging from Medieval to ancient Celtic and Nordic folk art.\"\nAwards and nominations.\nIllustration.\nIn 1979, Froud was nominated for the British Fantasy Award for Best Artwork for Plate 12 of his 1977 book, \"The Land of Froud\". For his 1978 book with Alan Lee, \"Faeries\", Froud won second place in the 1979 Locus Award for Best Art Book (Froud has been a runner up four times through to 2015). \"Faeries\" was also nominated for the 1979 Balrog Award for Best Professional Publication. The same year, Froud was also runner up for the Locus Award for Best Artist (he has been a runner up four times through to 1999).\nFour years later, Froud was a nominee at the 1983 Hugo Awards in the category of Best Non-Fiction Book for \"The World of the Dark Crystal\", for which Froud was the illustrator in a partnership with writer J. J. Llewellyn. \"The World of the Dark Crystal\" won fifth place in the 1983 Locus Award for Best Nonfiction/Reference Book. The same year, Froud was also nominated for the Balrog Award for Best Artist.\nFroud was honoured by the World Fantasy Convention with a nomination for the World Fantasy Award for Best Artist in 1991, and again four years later.\nIn 1995, Froud won the Hugo Award for Best Original Artwork for his illustrations in \"Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book\", a collaboration with writer Terry Jones. The book also won the Chesley Award for Best Interior Illustration, and Froud was also nominated that year for the Chesley Award for Artistic Achievement. For \"The Wise Woman\", Froud won a certificate in the 1995 Spectrum Award for Best Book.\nFor his illustrations in Terry Windling's novel, \"The Wood Wife\", Froud was nominated for the BSFA Award for Best Artwork in 1998. The following year, for his artwork in \"Good Faeries/Bad Faeries\", another collaboration with Windling, Froud won his second Chesley Award for Best Interior Illustration (he has been a finalist six times through to 2008).\nIn 2001, Froud, along with his wife, was awarded the Inkpot Award. Froud received a lifetime achievement award from the New York Society of Illustrators Museum in 2011.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is used for any member of the Ochotonidae (), a family within the order of lagomorphs, the order which also includes the Leporidae (rabbits and hares). They are the smallest animal in the lagomorph group. Only one genus, Ochotona ( ), is extant within the family, covering 37 species, though many fossil genera are known. Another species, the Sardinian pika, belonging to the separate genus \"Prolagus\", has become extinct within the last 2,000 years owing to human activity.\nPikas prefer rocky slopes and graze on a range of plants, primarily grasses, flowers, and young stems. In the autumn, they pull hay, soft twigs, and other stores of food under rocks to eat during the long, cold winter. The pika is also known as the whistling hare because of its high-pitched alarm call it gives when alarmed. The two species found in North America are the American pika, found primarily in the mountains of the western United States and far southwestern Canada, and the collared pika of northern British Columbia, the Yukon, western Northwest Territories and Alaska.\nHabitat.\nPikas are native to cold climates in Asia and North America. Most species live on rocky mountain sides, where numerous crevices are available for their shelter, although some pikas also construct crude burrows. A few burrowing species are native to open steppe land. In the mountains of Eurasia, pikas often share their burrows with snowfinches, which build their nests there. Changing temperatures have forced some pika populations to restrict their ranges to even higher elevations.\nCharacteristics.\nPikas are small mammals, with short limbs and rounded ears. They are about in body length and weigh between , depending on species.\nThese animals are herbivores and feed on a wide variety of plant matter, including forbs, grasses, sedges, shrub twigs, moss and lichens. Easily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract and expelled as regular feces. But in order to get nutrients out of hard to digest fiber, pika ferment fiber in the cecum (in the GI tract) and then expel the contents as soft pellets, or cecotropes, which are reingested. This process is known as cecotrophy, and is a common behavior among all lagomorphs. The cecotropes are absorbed in the small intestine after consumption to utilize the nutrients.\nCollared pikas have been known to store dead birds in their burrows for food during winter and eat the feces of other animals.\nAs with other lagomorphs, pikas have gnawing incisors and no canines, although they have fewer molars than rabbits. They have a dental formula of 2.0.3.21.0.2.3 = 26. Another similarity that pikas share with other lagomorphs is that the bottom of their paws are covered with fur and lack paw pads.\nRock-dwelling pikas have small litters of fewer than five young, whilst the burrowing species tend to give birth to more young and to breed more frequently, possibly owing to a greater availability of resources in their native habitats. The young are born altricial (eyes and ears closed, no fur) after a gestation period of between 25 and 30 days.\nActivity.\nPikas are active during daylight (diurnal) or twilight hours (crepuscular), with higher-elevation species generally being more active during the daytime. They show their peak activity just before the winter season. Pikas do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored. Rock-dwelling pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store in a \"haypile\" of cached plants.\nThe impact of human activity on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the 1970s. Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a process called \"haying\". They eat the dried plants during the winter. When pikas mistake humans as predators, they may respond to humans as they do to other species that do prey on pikas. Such interactions with humans have been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months. Pikas prefer foraging in temperatures below , so they generally spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high. A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time, where for every increase of to the ambient temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Some species are territorial. North American pikas (\"O. princeps\" and \"O. collaris\") are asocial, leading solitary lives outside the breeding season.\nVocalization.\nPikas have distinct calls, which vary in duration. The call can be short and quick, a little longer and more drawn out or long songs. The short calls are an example of geographic variation. The pikas determine the appropriate time to make short calls by listening for cues for sound localization. The calls are used for individual recognition, predator warning signals, territory defense, or as a way to attract potential mates. There are also different calls depending on the season. In the spring the songs become more frequent during the breeding season. In late summer the vocalizations become short calls. Through various studies, the acoustic characteristics of the vocalizations can be a useful taxonomic tool.\nLifespan.\nThe average lifespan of pikas in the wild is roughly seven years. A pika's age may be determined by the number of adhesion lines on the periosteal bone on the lower jaw. The lifespan does not differ between the sexes.\nTaxonomy.\nThe 29 extant species of pika currently recognized are:\nExtinct species.\nMany fossil forms of \"Ochotona\" are described in the literature, from the Miocene epoch to the early Holocene (extinct species) and present (16.4-0 Ma). They lived in Europe, Asia, and North America.Some species listed below are common for Eurasia and North America (\"O. gromovi\", \"O. tologoica\", \"O. zazhigini\", and probably \"O. whartoni\").\nPaleontologists have also described multiple forms of pika not referred to specific species (\"Ochotona\" indet.) or not certainly identified (\"O.\" cf. \"antiqua\", \"O.\" cf. \"cansus\", \"O.\" cf. \"daurica\", \"O.\" cf. \"eximia\", \"O.\" cf. \"gromovi\", \"O.\" cf. \"intermedia\", \"O.\" cf. \"koslowi\", \"O.\" cf. \"lagrelii\", \"O.\" cf. \"nihewanica\"). The statuses of \"Ochotona\" (\"Proochotona\") \"kirgisica\" and \"O. spelaeus\" are uncertain. The \"pusilla\" group of pikas is characterized by archaic (plesiomorphic) cheek teeth and small size. Pikas on the whole have been described as \"one of the most complex and problematic groups in mammalian systematics\".\nThe North American species migrated from Eurasia. They invaded the New World twice:\n\"Ochotona\" cf. \"whartoni\" and small pikas of the \"O. pusilla\" group are also known from Siberia. The extant, endemic North American species appeared in the Pleistocene. The North American collared pika (\"O. collaris\") and American pika (\"O. princeps\") have been suggested to have descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (\"O. pusilla\").\nThe range of \"Ochotona\" was larger in the past, with both extinct and extant species inhabiting Western Europe and Eastern North America, areas that are currently free of pikas. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika \"O. pusilla\" currently native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern pika \"O. hyperborea\" in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.\nWhile \"Ochotona\" is the only currently living genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include \u2020\"Albertona\", \u2020\"Alloptox\", \u2020\"Amphilagus\", \u2020\"Australagomys\", \u2020\"Austrolagomys\", \u2020\"Bellatona\", \u2020\"Bellatonoides\", \u2020\"Bohlinotona\", \u2020\"Cuyamalagus\", \u2020\"Desmatolagus\", \u2020\"Eurolagus\", \u2020\"Gripholagomys\", \u2020\"Gymnesicolagus\", \u2020\"Hesperolagomys\", \u2020\"Heterolagus\", \u2020\"Kenyalagomys\", \u2020\"Lagopsis\", \u2020\"Marcuinomys\", \u2020\"Ochotonoides\", \u2020\"Ochotonoma\", \u2020\"Oklahomalagus\", \u2020\"Oreolagus\", \u2020\"Paludotona\", \u2020\"Piezodus\", \u2020\"Plicalagus\", \u2020\"Pliolagomys\", \u2020\"Prolagus\", \u2020\"Proochotona\" (syn. \"Ochotona\"), \u2020\"Pseudobellatona\", \u2020\"Ptychoprolagus\", \u2020\"Russellagus\", \u2020\"Sinolagomys\", \u2020\"Titanomys\" and \u2020\"Tonomochota\". The earliest one is \"Desmatolagus\" (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma), usually included in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid stem-lagomorphs.\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \"climatic optimum\" from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. They thrived in Eurasia, North America, and even Africa. The peak of their diversity occurred during the period from the early Miocene to middle Miocene. Most of them became extinct during the transition from the Miocene to Pliocene, which was accompanied by an increase in diversity of the \"leporids\". It has been proposed that this switch between ochotonids and larger leporids was caused by expansion of C4 plants (particularly the Poaceae) related to global cooling in the late Miocene, since extant pikas reveal a strong preference for C3 plants (Asteraceae, Rosaceae, and Fabaceae, many of them C3). Replacement of large areas of forests by open grassland first started probably in North America and is called sometimes \"nature's green revolution\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditional references of the Paleobiology Database.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her work mostly depicted magical creatures, such as elves and fairies.\nEarly life.\nIda Rentoul was born in Carlton, Victoria, the youngest child of four and second daughter of the Rev. John Laurence Rentoul, an Irish-born Presbyterian minister and academic, and his wife Annie Isobel (n\u00e9e Rattray). At the time of her birth, her father was a professor at Ormond College, University of Melbourne, and later moderator-general of his church between 1912 and 1914. When World War I broke out, he became chaplain-general of the First Australian Imperial Force.\nShe was educated at Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne. After she married Arthur Grenbry Outhwaite on 8 December 1909, she was generally known as Ida Rentoul Outhwaite. Before this, she had variously signed her work I.S.R. and at some point changed this to I.R.O. She also occasionally used I.S.R.O. and full spellings rather than abbreviations.\nCareer.\nOuthwaite worked predominantly with pen and ink, and watercolour. Her first illustration was published by \"New Idea\" magazine in 1903 when she was just 15 years of age \u2013 it accompanied a story written by her older sister, Annie Rattray Rentoul. In the years that followed, the sisters collaborated on a number of stories.\nIn 1907 the important Australian Exhibition of Women's Work took place for five weeks in Melbourne.

Most of the works for which he is best known were created while he was a patient in Bethlem and Broadmoor hospitals.\nEarly life.\nDadd was born at Chatham, Kent, on 1 August 1817, the son of chemist Robert Dadd (1788/9\u20131843) and Mary Ann (1790\u20131824), daughter of the shipwright Richard Martin. He was educated at King's School, Rochester, where his aptitude for drawing was evident at an early age, leading to his admission to the Royal Academy Art Schools at the age of 20. He was awarded the medal for life drawing in 1840. With William Powell Frith, Augustus Egg, Henry O'Neil and others, he founded The Clique, of which he was generally considered to be the leading talent. He was also trained at William Dadson's Academy of Art.\nCareer.\nAmong his best-known early works are the illustrations he produced for \"The Book of British Ballads\" (1842), and a frontispiece he designed for \"The Kentish Coronal\" (1840).\nIn July 1842, Sir Thomas Phillips, the former mayor of Newport, chose Dadd to accompany him as his draughtsman on an expedition through Europe to Greece, Turkey, Southern Syria and finally Egypt. In November of that year they spent a gruelling two weeks in Southern Syria, passing from Jerusalem to Jordan and returning across the Engaddi wilderness. Toward the end of December, while travelling up the Nile by boat, Dadd underwent a dramatic personality change, becoming delusional, increasingly violent, and believing himself to be under the influence of the Egyptian god Osiris. His condition was initially thought to be sunstroke.\nMental illness and hospitalization.\nOn his return to England in May 1843, Dadd was diagnosed to be of unsound mind and was taken by his family to recuperate in the rural village of Cobham, Kent. In August of that year, having become convinced that his father was the Devil in disguise, Dadd killed him with a knife and fled to France. En route to Paris, Dadd attempted to kill a fellow passenger with a razor but was overpowered and arrested by police. Dadd confessed to killing his father and was returned to England, where he was committed to the criminal department of Bethlem psychiatric hospital (also known as Bedlam). There and subsequently at the newly created Broadmoor Hospital, Dadd was cared for in an enlightened manner by Doctors William Wood, William Orange and Sir William Charles Hood.\nDadd probably had paranoid schizophrenia. Two of his siblings had the condition, while a third had \"a private attendant\" for unknown reasons.\nIn hospital, Dadd was encouraged to continue painting, and in 1852 he created a portrait of one of his doctors, Alexander Morison, which now hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Dadd painted many of his best pictures in Bethlem and Broadmoor, including \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\", which he worked on between 1855 and 1864. Dadd was pictured at work on his \"Contradiction: Oberon and Titania\" by the London society photographer Henry Hering. Also dating from the 1850s are the 33 watercolour drawings titled \"Sketches to Illustrate the Passions\", which include \"Grief or Sorrow\", \"Love\", and \"Jealousy\", as well as \"Agony-Raving Madness\" and \"Murder\". Like most of his works, these are executed on a small scale and feature protagonists whose eyes are fixed in a peculiar, unfocused stare. Dadd also produced many shipping scenes and landscapes during his hospitalization, such as the ethereal 1861 watercolour \"Port Stragglin\". These are executed with a miniaturist's eye for detail, which belies the fact that they are products of imagination and memory.\nDeath.\nAfter 20 years at Bethlem, Dadd was moved to Broadmoor Hospital, a newly built high-security facility in Berkshire. There he remained for the remainder of his life, painting constantly and receiving infrequent visitors; he died on 7 January 1886, \"from an extensive disease of the lungs\". A \"substantial number\" of his works are on display in the Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum.\nLegacy.\nFreddie Mercury was inspired to write the song 'The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke' based on Dadd's painting, which he had seen at the Tate Gallery. In 2013 Neil Gaiman wrote an essay about the painting for the magazine \"Intelligent Life\" (now called \"1843\").\nAngela Carter wrote \"Come unto these Yellow Sands\", a radio-play based on Dadd's life, first broadcast in 1979.\nCanadian author R. J. Anderson acknowledges Dadd as the basis of her fictional painter Alfred Wrenfield, who figures prominently in her young adult fantasy novel \"Knife\" (2009).\nIn 1987, a long-lost watercolour by Dadd, \"The Artist's Halt in the Desert\", was discovered by Peter Nahum on the BBC TV programme \"Antiques Roadshow\". Made while the artist was incarcerated, it is based on sketches made during his tour of the Middle East, and shows his party encamped by the Dead Sea, with Dadd at the far right. It was later sold for \u00a3100,000 to the British Museum.\nLoreena McKennitt features Dadd's 1862 painting \"Bacchanalian Scene\" on the cover of her 1987 Christmas CD \"To Drive the Cold Winter Away\".\nTerry Pratchett included \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\" in his 2003 Discworld novel \"The Wee Free Men\". Tiffany, the protagonist, finds it in a book of fairy-tales and later escapes from a dream set within the picture. In the author's note, Pratchett describes the painting and gives a brief but sympathetic summary of Dadd's personal history and struggle with mental illness.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a child, she was greatly influenced by the works of the illustrator Kate Greenaway, whom she assiduously copied in her formative years. Her principal influence, however, which she duly credited, was the artwork of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\nEarly life.\nCicely Mary Barker was born in 1895 in Croydon, England. She suffered from epilepsy as a child and remained physically delicate for most of her life. She was unable to go to school, so she was educated at home and spent much of her time on her own, reading and drawing.\nIn 1908, when Cicely was 13, her father enrolled her at the Croydon Art Society, where they both exhibited work. She also enrolled in a Correspondence Art course which she continued until 1918. At 16, Cicely was elected a life member of Croydon Art Society, the youngest person ever to receive this honour. The art critic for the \"Croydon Advertiser\" commented: \"Her drawings show a remarkable freedom of spirit. She has distinct promise.\"\nIn 1911, when she was 15 her father submitted some of her work to Raphael Tuck, the stationery printer, who bought four of her pictures for greeting cards. From this time onwards, she was able to sell her work to magazines, to postcard and greeting card manufacturers, and later to book publishers. This was very helpful to the family finances for her father died when she was 17, leaving Cicely, her elder sister and her mother in difficult circumstances.\nCicely was industrious and determined. She sent her flower fairy paintings to several publishers before Blackie accepted them for publication in 1923. She was paid only \u00a325 for a total of twenty-four illustrations and verses in \"Flower Fairies of the Spring\", the first of the Flower Fairy series. Seven more little books about Fairies were to follow.\nFairy art.\nCicely was also influenced by the huge popular interest in fairies which developed from the Victorian enthusiasm for fairy stories and was epitomised by the immense popularity of J. M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan\" in the early part of the 20th century. Published in 1923, \"Flower Fairies of the Spring\" was well received by a post-industrial, war-weary public who were charmed by her vision of hope and innocence, which seemed to evoke a less aggressively modern world.\nQueen Mary did much to encourage the vogue for fairy paintings during the 1920s by frequently sending postcards depicting fairies to her friends. This popularity saw the publication of Cicely Mary Barker's Elves and Fairies postcards in 1918.\nBarker always used real-life models for her paintings. Most of the models came from the kindergarten her sister Dorothy ran in the back room of the house in which they lived. She also painted the children and relatives. One of her models was Gladys Tidy, the young girl who came to the house every Saturday to do the household work.\nBarker always asked the child model to hold the flower, twig or blossom of a particular fairy, for she wanted to be sure of the accuracy of her depiction of the shape, texture and form of the plant. Her only alteration was to the size, she enlarged the flower to make it the same size as the child.\nHer flowers are always botanically accurate. If she could not find a flower close at hand, she enlisted the help of staff at Kew Gardens, who would often visit with specimens for her to paint. She wrote in the foreword to \"Flower Fairies of the Wayside\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So let me say quite plainly, that I have drawn all the plants and flowers very carefully, from real ones; and everything that I have said about them is as true as I could make it. But I have never seen a fairy; the fairies and all about them are just \"pretend\".\nChristian art.\nBarker's art reflects several strong influences. Her family was deeply religious and she retained a strong Christian faith all her life. She greatly admired the work of the Pre-Raphaelites and her own work echoes their philosophy of being true to nature both in her meticulous depiction of flowers and plants and in the way in which the fairies represent their spirit.\nCanon Ingram Hill remembers her as \"one of the pillars\" of St. Andrew's Church, Croydon. Her faith informed all of her work, religious or secular, whether in cards, children's books or decorating the churches with which she was affiliated.\nIn 1916, Barker designed eight mission postcards, including \"Prayer\", a picture of a young woman kneeling before an open window, possibly modelled on her sister. In 1923, she painted a series of five birthday cards featuring angels and babies for The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.\nStarting in 1920, Barker painted many religious works, including illustrated Bible stories, written with her sister Dorothy. She also painted panels and triptych for chapels and churches including \"The Feeding of the Five Thousand\" for the chapel at Penarth and \"The Parable of the Great Supper\" for the chapel of St. George's Waddon.\nIn 1926, Queen Mary purchased one of her religious paintings,\u00a0entitled \"The Darling of the World Has Come\".\nBibliography.\nParker's publications include: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thomas' gift of prophecy is linked to his poetic ability.\nHe is often cited as the author of the English \"Sir Tristrem\", a version of the Tristram legend, and some lines in Robert Mannyng's \"Chronicle\" may be the source of this association. It is not clear if the name \"Rhymer\" was his actual surname or merely a sobriquet.\nIn literature, he appears as the protagonist in the tale about Thomas the Rhymer carried off by the \"Queen of Elfland\" and returned having gained the gift of prophecy, as well as the inability to tell a lie. The tale survives in a medieval verse romance in five manuscripts, as well as in the popular ballad \"Thomas Rhymer\" (Child Ballad number 37). The romance occurs as \"Thomas off Ersseldoune\" in the Lincoln Thornton Manuscript.\nThe original romance (from c. 1400) was probably condensed into ballad form (c. 1700) though there are dissenting views on this. Walter Scott expanded the ballad into three parts, adding a sequel which incorporated the prophecies ascribed to Thomas, and an epilogue where Thomas is summoned back to Elfland after the appearance of a sign, in the form of the milk-white hart and hind. Numerous prose retellings of the tale of Thomas the Rhymer have been undertaken, and included in fairy tale or folk-tale anthologies; these often incorporate the return to Fairyland episode that Scott reported to have learned from local legend.\nHistorical figure.\nSir Thomas was born in Erceldoune (also spelled \"Ercildoune\"\u00a0\u2013 now Earlston), Berwickshire, sometime in the 13th century, and has a reputation as the author of many prophetic verses. Little is known for certain of his life but two charters from 1260 to 1280 and 1294 mention him, the latter referring to \"Thomas de Ercildounson son and heir of Thome Rymour de Ercildoun\".\nThomas became known as \"True Thomas\", supposedly because he could not tell a lie. Popular lore recounts how he prophesied many great events in Scottish history, including the death of Alexander III of Scotland.\nPopular esteem of Thomas lived on for centuries after his death, and especially in Scotland, overtook the reputation of all rival prophets including Merlin, whom the 16th century pamphleteer of \"The Complaynt of Scotland\" denounced as the author of the prophecy (unity under one king) which the English used as justification for aggression against his countrymen. It became common for fabricated prophecies (or reworkings of earlier prophecies) to be attributed to Thomas to enhance their authority, as seen in collections of prophecies which were printed, the earliest surviving being a chapbook entitled \"The Whole Prophecie of Scotland, England, etc.\" (1603).\nProphecies attributed to Thomas.\nDescriptions and paraphrases of Thomas's prophecies were given by various Scottish historians of yore, though none of them quoted directly from Thomas.\nThis prophecy predicted the death of Alexander III in 1286. Thomas gave this prediction to the Earl of Dunbar, but when there was no change in weather patterns discernible at the ninth hour, the Earl sent for the prophet to be reproved. Thomas replied the appointed hour has not come, and shortly thereafter, the news came reporting of the king's death.\nThe earliest notice of this prophecy occurs in Bower's 15th-century \"Scotichronicon\", written in Latin. An early English vernacular source is John Bellenden's 16th century \"Croniklis of Scotland,\" a translation of Hector Boece.\n\"A French wife shal beare the Son, / Shall rule all Bretaine to the sey,\"\n\"that of the Bruces blood shall come / As neere as the nint degree.\"\nThe lines given are structured in the form of one man's questions, answered by another, who goes on to identify himself: \"In Erlingstoun, I dwelle at hame/Thomas Rymour men calles me.\"\nPrinted in the aforementioned chapbook \"The Whole Prophecie\" of 1603, published upon the death of Elizabeth I, the prophecy purports to have presaged Scottish rule of all of Britain by James I, whose mother Mary Stewart, had been raised in her own mother's native France and was briefly their Queen Consort during her first childless marriage to Francis II.\nThis \"became in the sequel by far the most famous of all the prophecies,\" but it has been argued that this is a rehash of an earlier prophecy that was originally meant for John Stewart, Duke of Albany (d. 1536), whose mother was Anna de la Tour d'Auvergne, daughter of the Count of Auvergne. Words not substantially different are also given in the same printed book, under the preceding section for the prophecy of John of Bridlington, and the additional date clue there \"1513 &amp; thrise three there after\" facilitating the identification \"Duke's son\" in question as Duke of Albany, although Murray noted that the Duke's \"performance of ... doubty deeds\" was something he \"utterly failed to do\".\nPopular folkloric prophecies.\nWalter Scott was familiar with rhymes purported to be the Rhymer's prophecies in the local popular tradition, and published several of them. Later Robert Chambers printed additional collected rhyme prophecies ascribed to Thomas, in \"Popular Rhymes\" (1826).\n\"a brig ower Tweed yon there may see.\"\nScott identifies the tree as that on Eildon Hill in Melrose, some five miles away from today's Earlston. Three bridges built across the river were visible from that vantage point in Scott's day.\n\"Earlstoun sall possess a' her lands.\"\nor \"As long as the Thorn Tree stands / Ercildourne shall keep its lands\". This was first of several prophecies attributed to the Rhymer collected by Chambers, who identified the tree in question as one that fell in a storm in either 1814 or 1821, presumably on the about the last remaining acre belonging to the town of Earlstoun. The prophecy was lent additional weight at the time, because as it so happened, the merchants of the town had fallen under bankruptcy by a series of \"unfortunate circumstances\". According to one account, \"Rhymer's thorn\" was a huge tree growing in the garden of the Black Bull Inn, whose proprietor, named Thin, had its roots cut all around, leaving it vulnerable to the storm that same year.\n\"The Day o' Judgment's near at hand\"\nThe \"Ewes of Gowrie\" are two boulders near Invergowrie protruding from the Firth of Tay, said to approach the land at the rate of an inch a year. This couplet was also published by Chambers, though filed under a different locality (Perthshire), and he ventured to guess that the ancient prophecy was \"perhaps by Thomas the Rhymer.\" Barbara Ker Wilson's retold version has altered the rhyme, including the name of the rocks thus: \"When the Cows o' Gowrie come to land / The Judgement Day is near at hand.\"\n\"the biggest and the bonniest o' a' the three\"\nCollected from a 72-year-old man resident in Edinburgh.\nThe Weeping Stones Curse:\n\"lang's there's in thee stanes three :\"\n\"There's ane intill the highest tower,\"\n\"There's ane intill the ladye's bower,\"\n\"There's ane aneath the water-yett, \"\n\"And thir three stanes ye'se never get.\"\nTradition in Aberdeenshire said that Fyvie Castle stood seven years awaiting arrival of \"True Tammas,\" as the Rhymer was called in the local dialect. The Rhymer arrived carrying a storm that brewed all around him, though perfectly calm around his person, and pronounced the above curse. Two of the stones were found, but the third stone of the water-gate eluded discovery. And since 1885 no eldest son has lived to succeed his father.\n\"Haig shall be Haig of Bemerside.\"\nThis prophesied the ancient family of the Haigs of Bemerside will survive for perpetuity. Chambers, in a later editions his \"Popular Rhymes\" (1867) prematurely reported that \"the prophecy has come to a sad end, for the Haigs of Bemerside have died out.\" In fact, Field Marshal Douglas Haig hails from this family, and was created earl in 1919, currently succeeded by the 3rd Earl (b. 1961).\nBallad.\nThe ballad (Roud 219) around the legend of Thomas was catalogued Child Ballad #37 \"Thomas the Rymer,\" by Francis James Child in 1883. Child published three versions, which he labelled A, B and C, but later appended two more variants in Volume 4 of his collection of ballads, published in 1892. Some scholars refer to these as Child's D and E versions. Version A, which is a Mrs Brown's recitation, and C, which is Walter Scott's reworking of it, were together classed as the Brown group by C.E. Nelson, while versions B, D, E are all considered by Nelson to be descendants of an archetype that reduced the romance into ballad form in about 1700, and classed as the 'Greenwood group'. (See \u00a7Ballad sources).\nChild provided a critical synopsis comparing versions A, B, C in his original publication, and considerations of the D, E versions have been added below.\nBallad synopsis.\nThe brief outline of the ballad is that while Thomas is lying outdoors on a slope by a tree in the Erceldoune neighborhood, the queen of Elfland appears to him riding upon a horse and beckons him to come away. When he consents, she shows him three marvels: the road to Heaven, the road to Hell, and the road to her own world (which they follow). After seven years, Thomas is brought back into the mortal realm. Asking for a token by which to remember the queen, he is offered the choice of having powers of harpistry, or else of prophecy, and of these he chooses the latter.\nThe scene of Thomas's encounter with the elf-queen is \"Huntly Bank\" and the \"Eildon Tree\" (versions B, C, and E) or \"Farnalie\" (version D) All these refer to the area of Eildon Hills, in the vicinity of Earlston: Huntly Bank was a slope on the hill and the tree stood there also, as Scott explained: Emily B. Lyle was able to localize \"farnalie\" there as well.\nThe queen wears a skirt of grass-green silk and a velvet mantle, and is mounted either on a milk-white steed (in Ballad A), or on a dapple-gray horse (B, D, E and R (the Romance)). The horse has nine and fifty bells on each \"tett\" (Scots English. \"lock of matted hair\") on its mane in A, nine hung on its mane in E, and three bells on either side of the bridle in R, whereas she had nine bells in her hand in D, offered as a prize for his harping and carping (music and storytelling).\nThomas mistakenly addresses her as the \"Queen of Heaven\" (i.e. the Virgin Mary), which she corrects by identifying herself as \"Queen of fair Elfland\" (A, C). In other variants, she reticently identifies herself only as \"lady of an unco land\" (B), or \"lady gay\" (E), much like the medieval romance. But since the unnamed land of the queen is approached by a path leading neither to Heaven nor Hell, etc., it can be assumed to be \"Fairyland,\" to put it in more modern terminology.\nIn C and E, the queen dares Thomas to kiss her lips, a corruption of Thomas's embrace in the romance that is lacking in A and B though crucial to a cogent plot, since \"it is contact with the fairy that gives her the power to carry her paramour off\" according to Child. Absent in the ballads also is the motif of the queen losing her beauty (Loathly lady motif): Child considered that the \"ballad is no worse, and the romance would have been much better\" without it, \"impressive\" though it may be, since it did not belong in his opinion to the \"proper and original story,\" which he thought was a blithe tale like that of Ogier the Dane and Morgan le fay. If he chooses to go with her, Thomas is warned he will be unable to return for seven years (A, B, D, E). In the romance the queen's warning is \"only for a twelvemonth\", but he overstays by more than three (or seven) years.\nThen she wheels around her milk-white steed and lets Thomas ride on the crupper behind (A, C), or she rides the dapple-gray while he runs (B, E). He must wade knee-high through a river (B, C, E), exaggerated as an expanse of blood (perhaps \"river of blood\"), in A. They reach a \"garden green,\" and Thomas wants to pluck a fruit to slake his hunger but the queen interrupts, admonishing him that he will be accursed or damned (A, B, D, E). The language in B suggests this is \"the fruit of the Forbidden Tree\", and variants D, E call it an apple. The queen provides Thomas with food to sate his hunger.\nThe queen now tells Thomas to lay his head to rest on her knee (A, B, C), and shows him three marvels (\"ferlies three\"), which are the road to Hell, the road to Heaven, and the road to her homeland (named Elfland in A). It is the road beyond the meadow or lawn overgrown with lilies that leads to Heaven, except in C where the looks deceive and the lily road leads to Hell, while the thorny road leads to Heaven.\nThe queen instructs Thomas not to speak to others in Elfland, and to allow her to do all the talking. In the end, he receives as present \"a coat of the even cloth, and a pair of shoes of velvet green\" (A) or \"tongue that can never lie\" (B) or both (C). Version E uniquely mentions the Queen's fear that Thomas may be chosen as \"teinding unto hell\", that is to say, the tithe in the form of humans that Elfland is obliged to pay periodically. In the romance, the Queen explains that the collection of the \"fee to hell\" draws near, and Thomas must be sent back to earth to spare him from that peril. (See \u00a7 Literary criticism for further literary analysis.)\nBallad sources.\nThe ballad was first printed by Walter Scott (1803), and then by Robert Jamieson (1806). Both used Mrs Brown's manuscript as the underlying source. Child A is represented by Mrs Brown's MS and Jamieson's published version (with only slight differences in wording). Child C is a composite of Mrs Brown's and another version. In fact, 13 of the 20 stanzas are the same as A, and although Scott claims his version is from a \"copy, obtained from a lady residing not far from Ercildoun\" corrected using Mrs Brown's MS, Nelson labels the seven different stanzas as something that is \"for most part Scott's own, Gothic-romantic invention\".\nChild B is taken from the second volume of the Campbell manuscripts entitled \"Old Scottish Songs, Collected in the Counties of Berwick, Roxburgh, Selkirk &amp; Peebles\", dating to ca. 1830. The Leyden transcript, or Child \"D\" was supplied to Walter Scott before his publication, and influenced his composition of the C version to some degree. The text by Mrs Christiana Greenwood, or Child \"E\" was \"sent to Scott in May of 1806 after reading his C version in the \"Minstrelsey\", and was dated by Nelson as an \"early to mid-eighteenth-century text\". These two versions were provided to Scott and were among his papers at Abbotsford.\nMrs Brown's ballads.\nMrs Brown, also known as Anna Gordon or Mrs Brown of Falkland (1747\u20131810), who was both Scott's and Jamieson's source, maintained that she had heard them sung to her as a child. She had learned to sing a repertoire of some three dozen ballads from her aunt, Mrs Farquheson. Mrs Brown's nephew Robert Eden Scott transcribed the music, and the manuscript was available to Scott and others. However different accounts have been given, such as \"an old maid-servant who had been long as the nursemaid being the one to teach Mrs Brown.\"\nWalter Scott's ballads in three parts.\nIn \"Minstrelsy\", Walter Scott published a second part to the ballad out of Thomas's prophecies, and yet a third part describing Thomas's return to Elfland. The third part was based on the legend with which Scott claimed to be familiar, telling that \"while Thomas was making merry with his friends in the Tower of Ercildoune,\" there came news that \"a hart and hind... was parading the street of the village.\" Hearing this, Thomas got up and left, never to be seen again, leaving a popular belief that he had gone to Fairyland but was \"one day expected to revisit earth\". Murray cites Robert Chambers's suspicion that this may have been a mangled portrayal of a living local personage, and gives his own less marvellous traditional account of Thomas's disappearance, as he had received it from an informant.\nIn Walter Scott's \"Third Part\" to the ballad, Thomas finds himself in possession of a \"elfin harp he won\" in Fairyland in a minstrel competition. This is a departure both from the traditional ballad and from the medieval romance, in which the queen tells Thomas to choose whether \"to harpe or carpe,\" that is, to make a choice either of the gift of music or of the gift of speech. The \"hart and hind\" is now being sung as being \"white as snow on Fairnalie\" (Farnalie has been properly identified by Lyle, as discussed above). Some prose retellings incorporate some features derived from this third part (See \u00a7Retellings).\nDuncan Williamson.\nThe traditional singer Duncan Williamson, a Scottish traveller who learned his songs from his family and fellow travellers, had a traditional version of the ballad which he was recorded singing on several occasions. One recording (and discussion of the song) can be heard on the Tobar an Dualchais website.\nMedieval romance.\nThe surviving medieval romance is a lengthier account which agrees with the content of the ballad.\nThe romance opens in the first person (migrating to the third), but probably is not genuinely Thomas's own work. Murray dated the authorship to \"shortly after 1400, or about a hundred years after Thomas's death\", but more recent researchers set the date earlier, to the (late) 14th century. The romance often alludes to \"the story,\" as if there had been a preceding recension, and Child supposed that the \"older story,\" if any such thing actually existed, \"must be the work of Thomas\".\nAs in ballad C, Huntley banks is the locale where Thomas made sighting of the elfin lady. The \"Eldoune, Eldone tree (Thornton, I, 80, 84)\" is also mentioned as in the ballad. Thomas is captivated by her, addressing her as queen of heaven, and she answers she is not so lofty, but hints she is of fairy kind. Thomas propositions her, but she warns him off saying that the slightest sin will undo her beauty. Thomas is undaunted, so she gives the \"Mane of Molde\" (i.e. Man of Earth; mortal man) (I, 117) consent to marry her and to accompany her.\n\"Seven tymes by hyr he lay,\" (I, 124), but she transforms into a hideous hag immediately after lying with him, and declares he shall not see \"Medill-erthe\" (I,160) for a twelvemonth (\"twelmoneth\", \"xij Mones\" vv.152, 159). As in the ballad, the lady points out one way towards heaven and another towards hell during their journey to her dominion (ca.200\u2013220). The lady is followed by greyhounds and \"raches\" (i.e. scent dogs) (249\u201350). On arrival, Thomas is entertained with food and dancing, but then the lady tells him he must leave. To Thomas, his sojourn seems to last for only three days, but the lady tells him that three years (\"thre \u021dere\"), or seven years (\"seuen \u021dere\"), have passed (284\u20136) (the manuscripts vary), and he is brought back to the Elidon tree.\nFytte II is mostly devoted to prophecies. In the opening, Thomas asks for a token by which to remember the queen, and she offers him the choice of becoming a harper or a prophet (\"harpe or carpe\"). Rather than the \"instrumental\" gift, Thomas opts for the \"vocal (rather \"oral\") accomplishments.\" Thomas asks her to abide a bit and tell him some \"ferlys\" (marvels). She now starts to tell of future battles at Halidon Hill, Bannockburn, etc., which are easily identifiable historic engagements. (These are tabulated by Murray in his introduction.)\nThe prophecies of battles continue into Fytte III, but the language becomes symbolic. Near the end Thomas asks why Black Agnes of Dunbar (III, 660) imprisoned him, and she predicts her death. This mention of Black Agnes is an anachronism, Thomas of Erceldoune having lived a whole generation before her, and she was presumably confused with an earlier Countess of the March.\nManuscript sources.\nThe medieval romance survives complete or in fragments in five manuscripts, the earliest of which is the Lincoln codex compiled by Robert Thornton:\nAll these texts were edited in parallel by J. A. H. Murray in \"The Romance and Prophecies of Thomas of Erceldoune\" (1875).\nThe Cotton MS. gives an \"Incipit prophecia Thome Arseldon\" and an \"Explicit prophetia thome de Arseldoune\", thus this was the version that Walter Scott excerpted as Appendix. The Sloane MS. begins the second fytte with: \"Heare begynethe \u00fee ijd fytt I saye / of S\"ir\" thom\"as\" of Arseldon,\" and the Thornton MS. gives the \"Explicit Thomas of Erseldowne\" after the 700th line.\nRelationship between romance and ballad forms.\nThe romance dates from the late 14th to the early 15th century (see below), while the ballad texts available do not antedate ca. 1700\u20131750 at the earliest. While some people believe that the romance gave rise to the ballads (in their existing forms) at a relatively late date, this view is not uncontroversial.\nWalter Scott stated that the romance was \"the undoubted original\", the ballad versions having been corrupted \"with changes by oral tradition\". Murray flatly dismisses this inference of oral transmission, characterizing the ballad as a modernization by a contemporary versifier. Privately, Scott also held his \"suspicion of modern manufacture.\"\nC. E. Nelson argued for a common archetype (from which all the ballads derive), composed around the year 1700 by \"a literate individual of antiquarian bent\" living in Berwickshire. Nelson starts off with a working assumption that the archetype ballad, \"a not too remote ancestor of [Mrs] Greenwood['s version]\" was \"purposefully reduced from the romance\". What made his argument convincing was his observation that the romance was actually \"printed as late as the seventeenth century\" (a printing of 1652 existed, republished ), a fact missed by several commentators and not noticed in Murray's \"Published Texts\" section.\nThe localization of the archetype to Berwickshire is natural because the Greenwood group of ballads (which closely abide by the romance) belong to this area, and because this was the native place of the traditionary hero, Thomas of Erceldoune. Having made his examination, Nelson declared that his assumptions were justified by evidence, deciding in favour of the \"eighteenth-century origin and the subsequent tradition of [the ballad of] 'Thomas Rhymer'\", a conclusion applicable not only to the Greenwood group of ballads but also to the Brown group. This view is followed by Katharine Mary Briggs's folk-tale dictionary of 1971, and David Fowler.\nFrom the opposite point of view, Child thought that the ballad \"must be of considerable age\", even though the earliest available to him was datable only to ca. 1700\u20131750. E. B. Lyle, who has published extensively on Thomas the Rhymer, presents the hypothesis that the ballad had once existed in a very early form upon which the romance was based as its source. One supporter of this view is Helen Cooper who remarks that the ballad \"has one of the strongest claims to medieval origins\"; another is Richard Firth Green who has provided strong evidence for his contention that \"continuous oral transmission is the only credible explanation,\" by showing that one detail in the medieval romance, omitted from the seventeenth-century print, is preserved in the Greenwood version.\nLiterary criticism.\nIn the romance, the queen declares that Thomas has stayed three years but can remain no longer, because \"the foul fiend of Hell will come among the (fairy) folk and fetch his fee\" (modernized from Thornton text, vv.289\u2013290). This \"fee\" \"refers to the common belief that the fairies \"paid kane\" to hell, by the sacrifice of one or more individuals to the devil every seventh year.\" (The word teind is actually used in the Greenwood variant of Thomas the Rymer: \"Ilka seven year, Thomas, / We pay our teindings unto hell, ... I fear, Thomas, it will be yerself\".) The situation is akin to the one presented to the title character of \"Tam Lin\" who is in the company of the Queen of Fairies, but says he fears he will be given up as the tithe ( or kane) paid to hell. The common motif has been identified as type F.257 \"Tribute taken from fairies by fiend at stated periods\" except that while Tam Lin must devise his own rescue, in the case of the Rymer, \"the kindly queen of the fairies will not allow Thomas of Erceldoune to be exposed to this peril, and hurries him back to earth the day before the fiend comes for his due\". J. R. R. Tolkien also alludes to the \"Devil's tithe\" as concerns the Rhymer's tale in a passing witty remark\nInfluences.\nIt has been suggested that John Keats's poem \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" borrows motif and structure from the legend of Thomas the Rhymer.\nWashington Irving, while visiting Walter Scott, was told the legend of Thomas the Rhymer, and it became one of the sources for Irving's short story \"Rip van Winkle\".\nAdaptations.\nRetellings.\nThere have been numerous prose retelling of the ballad or legend.\nJohn Tillotson's version (1863) with \"magic harp he had won in Elfland\" and Elizabeth W. Greierson's version (1906) with \"harp that was fashioned in Fairyland\" are couple of examples that incorporate the theme from Scott's Part Three of Thomas vanishing back to Elfland after the sighting of a hart and hind in town.\nBarbara Ker Wilson's retold tale of \"Thomas the Rhymer\" is a patchwork of all the traditions accrued around Thomas, including ballad and prophecies both written and popularly held.\nAdditional, non-exhaustive list of retellings as follows:\nFootnotes.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65104", "revid": "50091307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65104", "title": "Great Ocean Road", "text": "Road in Victoria, Australia\nThe Great Ocean Road is an Australian National Heritage-listed stretch of road along the south-eastern coast of Australia, between the Victorian towns of Torquay and Allansford. Built by returned soldiers between 1919 and 1932, and dedicated to soldiers killed during World War I, the road is the world's largest war memorial. Winding through varying terrain along the coast, and providing access to several prominent landmarks, including the Twelve Apostles limestone stack formations, the road is an important tourist attraction.\nThe city of Geelong, close to Torquay, experiences great benefit from Australian and international visitors to the road, with Geelong Otway Tourism affirming it as an invaluable asset. In 2008, the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) listed the road as the state's top tourism experience in its \"Victoria 101 survey\", based on places that members of the public would recommend to visitors.\nRoute.\nThe Great Ocean Road starts at Torquay and runs westward to finish at Allansford, near Warrnambool. The road is two lanes (one in each direction), and has a speed limit which varies between 50\u00a0km/h and 100\u00a0km/h.\nA prime tourist attraction, much of the road hugs the coastline along what is known, east of the Otway Ranges, as the Surf Coast and, west of Cape Otway, as the Shipwreck Coast. It provides extensive views over Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean.\nThe road runs through rainforests, as well as alongside beaches and cliffs composed of limestone and sandstone, which are susceptible to erosion. The road travels via Anglesea, Lorne, Apollo Bay, and Port Campbell, the latter being notable for its natural limestone and sandstone rock formations, including Loch Ard Gorge, The Grotto, London Bridge and The Twelve Apostles. The stretch of the Great Ocean Road nearer to Torquay closely follows the coast, with some sheer cliffs on the seaward side. Road signs warn motorists of possible rockfalls.\nHistory.\nThe Great Ocean Road was first planned towards the end of World War I, when Chairman of the Country Roads Board, William Calder, asked the State War Council for funds to be provided for returned soldiers to work on roads in sparsely populated areas in the Western District. At the time, the rugged south-west coast of Victoria was accessible only by sea or rough bush track. It was envisaged that the road would connect isolated settlements on the coast and become a vital transport link for the timber industry and tourism.\nSurveying of the road, tentatively titled the \"South Coast Road\", started in 1918. It was suggested that it run from Barwon Heads in the east, follow the coast west around Cape Otway, and end near Warrnambool. In 1918, the Great Ocean Road Trust was formed as a private company, under the helm of president Howard Hitchcock. The company managed to secure \u00a381,000 in capital from private subscriptions and borrowing, with Hitchcock himself contributing \u00a33000. The money was to be repaid by charging drivers a toll until the debt was cleared, and the road would then be gifted to the state.\nConstruction.\nConstruction began on 19 September 1919. Approximately 3,000 returned servicemen worked on the project, which was a war memorial for servicemen killed in World War I. The advance survey team progressed through dense scrub at a rate of approximately three kilometres a month. Construction was mostly by hand, using explosives, pick and shovel, wheelbarrows, and some small machinery, and was at times perilous, with several workers being killed. The final sections, along steep coastal cliffs, were the most difficult to work on. Anecdotal evidence from ABC archives in 1982 suggested workers would rest detonators on their knees during travel, because it gave the explosives the softest ride.\nWorkers were paid 10 shillings and sixpence for an eight-hour day, also working a half-day on Saturdays. They were accommodated in tents, and were provided with meals in a communal dining marquee. Food cost up to 10 shillings a week. Despite the isolation of the camps, the workers had access to a piano, gramophone, games, newspapers and magazines.\nIn 1924, the coastal steamer \"Casino\" became stranded near Cape Patton, after having hit a reef at Point Hawdon, near the Grey River. Legend has it that 500 barrels of beer and 120 cases of spirits were jettisoned and that road workers salvaged them, resulting in an unscheduled two-week-long drinking break. However, Museums Victoria notes only that most of the cargo, largely composed of Christmas goods, was dumped into the sea. \"The Age\" reported that, \"The Great Ocean-road [sic] proved a boon to the passengers, who were enabled without much inconvenience to reach Wood's farm house, Apollo Bay. However, if the road were finished, the vessel's cargo could be safely conveyed to either Apollo Bay, the Wye River, or Lorne.\"\nCompletion and early use.\nOn 18 March 1922, the section from Eastern View to Lorne was officially opened, with celebrations. However, it was then closed from 10 May 1922 for further work, opening again on 21 December, along with tolls to help recoup construction costs. The charge, payable at the Eastern View toll gate, was two shillings for motor cars, and 10 shillings for wagons with more than two horses.\nIn November 1932, the section from Lorne to Apollo Bay was finished, bringing the road to completion. It was officially opened by Victoria's Lieutenant-Governor Sir William Irvine, during a ceremony near the Grand Pacific Hotel at Lorne, and the road has subsequently been acknowledged as the world's largest war memorial. At the time, \"The Age\" commented, \"In the face of almost insurmountable odds, the Great Ocean Road has materialised from a dream or 'wild-cat scheme', as many dubbed it, into concrete reality\". Although Hitchcock had died of heart disease on 22 August 1932, before the road was completed, his car was driven behind the governor's in the procession along the road during the opening ceremony. A memorial in his name was constructed on the road at Mount Defiance, near Lorne, and he is generally considered to be the Father of the Road.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the face of almost insurmountable odds, the Great Ocean Road has materialised from a dream or 'wild-cat scheme', as many dubbed it, into concrete reality\nIn its original state, the road was considered a formidable drive, comfortably accommodating only a single vehicle at a time. Areas with sheer cliffs were the most hazardous, with only few places where drivers could pull over to allow others to proceed in the opposite direction. For \u00a35, any \"public-spirited citizen\" could request that a crossover be cut into the road. On 2 October 1936, the road was handed to the State Government, with the deed for the road being presented to the Victorian Premier at a ceremony at the Cathedral Rock toll gate. Tolls were removed at that time.\nIn 1939, following the death of the chairman of the Country Roads Board, W.T.B. McCormick, who was also honorary engineer for the Great Ocean Road Trust, it was decided to build a memorial arch in his honour, across the road at Eastern View. The arch was opened 4 November 1939, and was built of timber logs on a stone base, with a tablet memorial to Mr McCormick on one side, and another to the returned servicemen on the other. The arch was rebuilt in 1973 when the road was widened, and again in 1983, after being destroyed in the Ash Wednesday bushfires. It had to be rebuilt yet again after it collapsed during a storm in 1990.\nIn 1962, the Tourist Development Authority deemed the road to be \"one of the world's great scenic roads\". Despite improvements, the road was still considered a challenging drive, and the Victorian Police motor school was using it for training around 1966.\nOver its life, the Great Ocean Road has been susceptible to natural elements. In 1960, the section at Princetown was partially washed away by water during storms. There were landslides on 11 August 1964, and 1971, both closing sections of the road near Lorne. Because of the terrain surrounding the road, it was also closed due to bushfires in 1962 and 1964, particularly in areas with nearby campsites. In January 2011, a section of a cutting collapsed due to heavy rain.\nIn 2011, the road was added to the Australian National Heritage List.\nRoad classification.\nGreat Ocean Road was signed as State Route 100 between Torquay and Allansford in 1986. With Victoria's conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, this was updated to route B100 in 1996.\nThe passing of the \"Road Management Act 2004\" granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria's major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Great Ocean Road (Arterial #4890), beginning at Surf Coast Highway at Torquay and ending at Princes Highway in Allansford.\nGreat Ocean Walk.\nIn 2004, the Great Ocean Walk opened, connecting 104\u00a0km of walking trails that follow the coastline near the Great Ocean Road, stretching from Apollo Bay to the 12 Apostles.\nEngineering heritage award.\nThe road received an Engineering Heritage National Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\"Great Ocean Road Protection Act\".\nIn December 2020, the \"Great Ocean Road and Environs Protection Act 2020\" went into effect, giving legal protection to the Great Ocean Road.\nEvents.\nGreat Ocean Road Marathon.\nA 45-kilometre section of the Great Ocean Road, between Lorne and Apollo Bay, is the location of the annual \"Great Ocean Road Marathon\". First run in 2005, the marathon is part of the Great Ocean Road Running Festival. The course record of 2:27:37 was set in 2019 by English runner Nick Earl. Earl broke the previous record of 2:27:42 set in 2011 by James Kipkelwon of Kenya, who also won the event in 2012.\nCycling.\nIn July 2015, former World Road Cycling Champion and Tour de France winner Cadel Evans announced that the Great Ocean Road would play host to the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race in early 2015, including elite races for men and women and a mass participation People's Ride. As of 2019, the People's Ride includes three distance options\u201435\u00a0km, 65\u00a0km, or 115\u00a0km.\nWiggle Amy's Gran Fondo cycling event is held in September and uses the section between Lorne and Skenes Creek. One of the only cycling events in Australia held on a fully closed road, it is named for Amy Gillett, who was killed in a collision between the Australian women's cycling squad and a driver in Germany in 2005.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a population of 127.06{{nbsp}}million (as of 2023) across a total area of about {{convert|179,800|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, Guangdong is China's most populous province and its 15th-largest by area, as well as the third-most populous country subdivision in the world.\nGuangdong's economy is the largest of any provincial-level division in China, with a GDP of {{CNY|14.16\u00a0trillion}} (US$2.0\u00a0trillion in GDP nominal) in 2024, contributing approximately 10.5\u00a0percent of mainland China's economic output. It has a diversified economy, and was known as the starting point of ancient China's Maritime Silk Road. It is home to the production facilities and offices of a wide-ranging set of Chinese and foreign corporations. Guangdong has benefited from its proximity to the financial hub of Hong\u00a0Kong, which it borders to the south. Guangdong also hosts the largest import and export fair in China, the Canton Fair, in Guangzhou. The Pearl River Delta Economic Zone, a Chinese megalopolis, is a core for high tech, manufacturing and international trade. In this zone are two of the four top Chinese cities and the top two Chinese prefecture-level cities by GDP: Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the first special economic zone in the country. These two are among China's most populous and important cities, and have become two of the world's most populous megacities and leading financial centres in the Asia\u2013Pacific region.\nGuangdong surpassed Henan and Shandong to become China's most populous province in January 2005, registering 79.1\u00a0million permanent residents and 31\u00a0million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 126,012,510 in the 2020 Chinese census, accounting for 8.93\u00a0percent of mainland China's population. This makes it the most populous first-level administrative subdivision of any country outside South Asia. The vast majority of the historical Guangdong Province is administered by the People's Republic of China (PRC). Pratas Island in the South China Sea is part of Cijin District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan (ROC); the island was part of Guangdong before the Chinese Civil War.\nAfter the unification of Lingnan region during the Qin dynasty, immigrants from the Central Plains moved in and formed a local culture with a unique style. With the outward movement of the Guangdong people, the Cantonese, Hakka and Teochew languages, music, cuisine, opera and tea ceremony have spread throughout the nation, Southeast Asia, and other countries. Guangdong was also the birthplace of the father of modern China and the founder of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. He declared a military government there in the Warlord Era. The two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau fall within the scope of Guangdong's cultural influence, and its culture still has profound influences on the Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia, with the vast majority of the Chinese diaspora in the two countries claiming ancestry from Guangdong.\nGuangdong is also one of the leading provinces in research and education in China. It hosts 160 institutions of higher education, ranking first in the South Central China region and second among all Chinese provinces/municipalities, after Jiangsu. As of 2025, two major cities in the province ranked in the world's top 20 cities (Guangzhou 6th and Shenzhen 18th) by scientific research output.\nName.\n\"Gu\u01ceng\" ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=\u5ee3|s=\u5e7f}}) means \"wide\" or \"vast\", and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in AD 226. The name \"Guang\" ultimately came from Guangxin ({{lang-zh|labels=no|first=t|t={{linktext|\u5ee3\u4fe1}} |s=\u5e7f\u4fe1}}), an outpost established in Han dynasty near modern Wuzhou, whose name is a reference to an order by Emperor Wu of Han to \"widely bestow favors and sow trust\". Together, Guangdong and Guangxi are called \"Loeng gwong\" ({{lang-zh|labels=no|first=t|t=\u5169\u5ee3|s=\u4e24\u5e7f |p=li\u01ceng gu\u01ceng}}) During the Song dynasty, the Two Guangs were formally separated as \"Gu\u01cengn\u00e1n D\u014dngl\u00f9\" ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=\u5ee3\u5357\u6771\u8def|s=\u5e7f\u5357\u4e1c\u8def|l=East Circuit in Southern Guang |labels=no}}) and \"Gu\u01cengn\u00e1n X\u012bl\u00f9\" ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=\u5ee3\u5357\u897f\u8def|s=\u5e7f\u5357\u897f\u8def|l=West Circuit in Southern Guang |labels=no}}), which became abbreviated as \"Gu\u01cengd\u014dng L\u00f9\" ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=\u5ee3\u6771\u8def|s=\u5e7f\u4e1c\u8def |labels=no}}) and \"Gu\u01cengx\u012b L\u00f9\" ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=\u5ee3\u897f\u8def|s=\u5e7f\u897f\u8def |labels=no}}).\n\"D\u014dng\" ({{lang-zh|first=t|t=\u6771|s=\u4e1c}}) means \"east\".\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe Neolithic era began in the Pearl River Delta ({{Lang|zh|\u73e0\u6c5f\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32}}) 7,000 years before present (BP), with the early period from around 7000 to 5000 BP (c. 5050\u20133050 BC), and the late period from about 5000 to 3500 BP (c. 3050\u20131550 BC). In coastal Guangdong, the Neolithic was likely introduced from the middle Yangtze River area (Jiao 2013). In inland Guangdong, the Neolithic appeared in Guangdong 4,600 years before present (BP). The Neolithic in northern inland Guangdong is represented by the Shixia culture ({{Lang|zh|\u77f3\u5cfd\u6587\u5316}}), which occurred from 4600 to 4200 BP (c. 2650\u20132250 BC).\nImperial.\nCanton was a prosperous port city along a tropical frontier region beset by disease and wild animals, but rich in oranges, banyan, bananas, and lychee fruits. They traded slaves, silk and chinaware with Persians, Brahmans and Malays in exchange for their renowned medicines and fragrant tropical woods. Shi'a Muslims who had fled persecution in Khorasan and Buddhists from India lived side by side in the thriving town each erecting their own houses of worship. A foreign quarter sprang up along the river where many traders of diverse backgrounds including Arabs and Singhalese took up residence.\nThe port's importance declined after it was raided by Arabs and Persians in 758 and the foreign residents were at times troubled by the corrupt local officials, sometimes responding violently. During one incident in 684, for example, a merchant vessel's captain murdered a corrupt governor who had used his position to steal from the merchant.\nAs time passed, the demographics of what is now Guangdong gradually shifted to (Han){{when|date=February 2020}} Chinese dominance as the populations intermingled due to commerce along the great canals. From the fall of the Han dynasty onwards, it shifted more abruptly through massive migration from the north during periods of political turmoil and nomadic incursions. For example, internal strife in northern China following the rebellion of An Lushan resulted in a 75% increase in the population of Guangzhou prefecture between the 740s\u2013750s and 800s\u2013810s. As more migrants arrived, the local population was gradually assimilated to Han Chinese culture or displaced.\nAs Mongols from the north engaged in their conquest of China in the 13th century, the Southern Song court fled southwards from its capital in Hangzhou. The defeat of the Southern Song court by Mongol naval forces in The Battle of Yamen 1279 in Guangdong marked the end of the Southern Song dynasty (960\u20131279).\nDuring the Mongol Yuan dynasty, large parts of current Guangdong belonged to Jiangxi. Its present name, \"Guangdong Province\" was given in early Ming dynasty.\nDue to the large number of people that emigrated out of the Guangdong province, and in particular the ease of immigration from Hong Kong to other parts of the British Empire (later British Commonwealth), many overseas Chinese communities have their origins in Guangdong and/or Cantonese culture. In particular, the Cantonese, Hakka, Teochew dialects have proportionately more speakers among overseas Chinese people than Mandarin-speaking Chinese. Additionally, many Taishanese-speaking Chinese emigrated to Western countries, with the results that many Western versions of Chinese words were derived from the Cantonese dialects rather than through the mainstream Mandarin language, such as \"dim sum\". Some Mandarin Chinese words originally of foreign origin also came from the original foreign language by way of Cantonese. For example, the Mandarin word \"{{transliteration|zh|n\u00edngm\u00e9ng}}\" ({{lang-zh|s=\u67e0\u6aac|t=\u6ab8\u6aac}}), meaning \"Lemon\", came from Cantonese, in which the characters are pronounced as \"{{transliteration|zh|l\u00ecng mung}}\". In the United States, there is a large number of Chinese who are descendants of immigrants from the county-level city of Taishan (Toisan in Cantonese), who speak a distinctive dialect related to Cantonese called Taishanese (or Toishanese).\nDuring the 1850s, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, whose leader Hong Xiuquan was born in Guangdong and received a pamphlet from a Protestant Christian missionary in Guangdong, was allied with a local Guangdong Red Turban Rebellion (1854\u20131856). Because of direct contact with the West, Guangdong was the centre of anti-Manchu and anti-imperialist activity. The generally acknowledged founder of modern China, Sun Yat-sen, was also from Guangdong.\n20th century.\nDuring the early 1920s of the Republic of China, Guangdong was the staging area for the Kuomintang (KMT) to prepare for the Northern Expedition, an effort to bring the various warlords of China back under a unified central government. The Whampoa Military Academy was built near Guangzhou to train military commanders.\nAt the end of the Chinese Civil War Guangdong became one of the Nationalist government's final footholds in Mainland China, with Guangzhou temporarily serving as the Kuomintang's provisional capitol. The People's Liberation Army seized control of the province after the retreat of the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan.\nDuring Reform and Opening Up, Guangdong was supported by the central government to be \"one step ahead\" of the rest of the country.{{Rp|page=43}} Most major cities in Guangdong underwent liberalizing economic reforms in the mid-1980s.{{Rp|page=43}} Since Reform and Opening Up, the province has seen extremely rapid economic growth, aided in part by its close trading links with Hong Kong, which borders it. It is now the province with the highest gross domestic product in China.\nIn 1952, a small section of Guangdong's coastline (Qinzhou, Lianzhou (now Hepu County), Fangchenggang and Beihai) was given to Guangxi, giving it access to the sea. This was reversed in 1955, and then restored in 1965. Hainan Island was originally part of Guangdong, but it was separated into its own province in 1988.\nGeography.\nGuangdong faces the South China Sea to the south and has a total of {{convert|4,300|km|abbr=on}} of coastline. The Leizhou Peninsula is on the southwestern end of the province. There are a few inactive volcanoes on Leizhou Peninsula. The Pearl River Delta is the convergent point of three upstream rivers: the East River, North River, and West River. The river delta is filled with hundreds of small islands. The province is geographically separated from the north by a few mountain ranges collectively called the Nan Mountains (Nan Ling). The highest peak in the province is Shikengkong with an elevation of {{convert|6,240|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level.\nGuangdong borders Fujian to the northeast, Jiangxi and Hunan to the north, Guangxi autonomous region to the west, and Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions to the south. Hainan is offshore across from the Leizhou Peninsula. Pratas Island, which were traditionally governed as part of Guangdong, are part of Cijin District, Kaoshiung, Taiwan (ROC). The PRC continues to claim Pratas Island as part of Guangdong under the district of Chengqu, Shanwei.\nCities around the Pearl River Delta include Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, Shunde, Taishan, Zhongshan, and Zhuhai. Other cities in the province include Chaozhou, Chenghai, Nanhai, Shantou, Shaoguan, Zhanjiang, Zhaoqing, Yangjiang, and Yunfu.\nGuangdong has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\" inland, \"Cwa\" along the coast). Winters are short, mild, and relatively dry, while summers are long, hot, and very wet. Average daily highs in Guangzhou in January and July are {{convert|18|and|33|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, although the humidity makes it feel hotter in summer. Frost is rare on the coast but may happen a few days each winter.\nEconomy.\nIn 2022, Guangdong's GDP was 13.57{{nbsp}}trillion RMB ($1.9{{nbsp}}trillion in GDP nominal, $3.78{{nbsp}}trillion in PPP), with a per capita GDP of {{CNY|102,465}} ({{US$|15,234}} in nominal or US$25,016 in PPP). It is the richest province in South Central China region and the seventh richest among all provinces by GDP per capita. Guangdong has been the largest province by GDP since 1989 in Mainland China. Its GDP exceeded that of Australia ($1.70{{nbsp}}trillion) and South Korea ($1.67{{nbsp}}trillion), the world's 12th and 13th largest economy, respectively. If it was a country, Guangdong would be the 12th-largest economy as of 2022 and the 11th most populous. Compared to country subdivisions in dollar terms, Guangdong's GDP in nominal is larger than all but four country subdivisions: California, Texas, New York State, and England. Compared to country subdivisions in PPP terms, Guangdong's GDP is larger than all, except California. By PPP terms, as of 2022, Guangdong's economy ranked between Turkey and Italy with a GDP of $3.35{{nbsp}}trillion and US$3.06{{nbsp}}trillion respectively, the 11th and 12th largest in the world respectively.\nGuangdong's economic boom began with the early 1990s and has since spread to neighboring provinces, and also pulled their populations inward. The economic growth of Guangdong province owes much to the low-value-added manufacturing which characterized (and in many ways still defines) the province's economy following Deng Xiaoping's reforms. Guangdong is not only China's largest exporter of goods, it is the country's largest importer as well.\nThe province is now one of the richest in the nation, with the most billionaires in mainland China, the highest GDP among all the provinces, although wage growth has only recently begun to rise due to a large influx of migrant workers from neighboring provinces. By 2015, the local government of Guangdong hopes that the service industry will account for more than 50\u00a0percent of the provinces GDP and high-tech manufacturing another 20\u00a0percent.\nIn 2021, Guangdong's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 534{{nbsp}}billion RMB (US$79.4{{nbsp}}billion), 5.28{{nbsp}}trillion RMB (US$785.6{{nbsp}}billion), and 7.09{{nbsp}}trillion RMB (US$1.05{{nbsp}}trillion), respectively. Guangdong contributes approximately 10.6% of the total national economic output. Now, it has three of the six Special Economic Zones: Shenzhen, Shantou and Zhuhai. The affluence of Guangdong, however, remains very concentrated near the Pearl River Delta.\nDemographics.\nGuangdong officially became the most populous province in 2005. Official statistics had traditionally placed Guangdong as the fourth-most populous province of China with about 80\u00a0million people, though an influx of migrants, temporary workers, and newly settled individuals numbered around 30\u00a0million. The massive influx of migrants from other provinces, dubbed the \"floating population\", is due to Guangdong's booming economy and high demand for labor. If Guangdong were an independent nation, it would rank among the twelfth largest countries of the world by population.\nUrbanization.\nIn 2021, Guangdong's population is 74.6% urban and 25.4% rural.\nGenealogy.\nGuangdong is the ancestral home of large numbers of overseas Chinese. Most of the railroad laborers in Canada, the Western United States and Panama in the 19th century came from Guangdong, especially the Siyi area. Many people from the region also traveled to California and other parts of the United States during the gold rush of 1849, and also to Australia during its gold rush a decade or so later.\nLanguages and ethnicities.\nThe majority of the province's population is Han Chinese, though the Han population is so diverse that the province has been called the \"treasure trove of regional languages\" ({{lang|zh|\u65b9\u8a00\u5bf6\u5eab}}). Within the Han Chinese, the largest subgroup in Guangdong are the Cantonese people, with significant Hakka and Teoswa populations east of the Pearl River Delta. Guangdong is also home to small Mien, She, Hmong, Li, and Zhuang minorities.\nYue Chinese.\nCantonese and other Yue varieties spoken at the delta such as Waitaunese and Shiqi Yue make up the greatest number of speakers, numbering at around {{sigfig|20720000|4}} speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} Due to the large overseas population and cultural impact of Cantopop and Cantonese television shows, Cantonese is a well-known variety of Chinese throughout the world.\nSiyi or Szeyap Yue, including Hoisanese, is spoken in much of Jiangmen prefecture, numbering at around {{sigfig|3880000|3}} speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} Siyi was once the representative variety of Chinese in many Chinese American communities.\nHakka Chinese.\nThe highlands of the Jiangxi-Fujian-Guangdong tripoint are the traditional heartland of the Hakka Chinese ({{lang-zh|s=\u5ba2\u5bb6\u8bdd|t=\u5ba2\u5bb6\u8a71|p=k\u00e8ji\u0101hu\u00e0|j=haak3 gaa1 waa6-2}}; Moiyenese: \"hag5 ga1 fa4\")-speaking people, and Meizhou is often dubbed the capital of Hakka culture. Downhill Hakka migrations started in the early modern period, and due to them being newcomers to the lowlands, they were dubbed \"guest families\" by the original inhabitants (the Puntis). There are around {{sigfig|20000000|4}} Neo-Hakka speakers in Guangdong, of which {{sigfig|2000000|3}} live significantly west of the traditional Hakka area.\nMin Chinese.\nTeoswa or Chaoshan Min ({{lang-zh|t=\u6f6e\u6c55\u8a71|s=\u6f6e\u6c55\u8bdd|p=ch\u00e1osh\u00e0nhu\u00e0|j=ciu4 saan3 waa6-2}}; Peng'im: \"di\u00ea5 suan1 u\u00ea7\") is spoken primarily in the Chaoshan area, that is to say, Chaozhou, Jieyang, Shantou, and Shanwei prefectures, by around {{sigfig|14120000|4}} speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} It is a Southern Min branch, but has little mutual intelligibility with Hokkien.\nLeizhou Min ({{lang-zh|t=\u9ece\u8a71|s=\u9ece\u8bdd|p=l\u00edhu\u00e0|j=leoi4 waa6-2}}; Leizhounese: [{{IPA|l\u0254i\u02e8 ue\u02e7\u02e5}}]) is spoken primarily in the Leizhou peninsula of Zhanjiang prefecture by around {{sigfig|4510000|3}} speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} It is closely related to Hainanese.\nOther Chinese.\nAround {{sigfig|500000|2}} speakers of Shaozhou Tuhua live in small communities in Shaoguan prefecture, typically surrounded by Hakka speakers.{{sfnp|Li|2012|page=161}} These varieties have been observed to be similar to Hakka, and have been dubbed \"Paleo-Hakka\" by, for instance, W. South Coblin.\nGender ratio.\nGuangdong has a highly unbalanced gender ratio that is among the highest of all provinces in China. According to a 2009 study published in \"The British Medical Journal\", in the 1\u20134 age group, there are over 130 boys for every 100 girls.\nReligion.\nAccording to a 2012 survey only around 7% of the population of Guangdong belongs to organised religions, the largest groups being Buddhists with 6.2%, followed by Protestants with 1.8% and Catholics with 1.2%. Around 90% of the population is either irreligious or may be involved in Chinese folk religion worshipping nature gods, ancestral deities, popular sects, Taoist traditions, Buddhist religious traditions &amp; Confucian religious traditions.\nAccording to a survey conducted in 2007, 43.71% of the population believes and is involved in ancestor veneration, the traditional Chinese religion of the lineages organised into lineage churches and ancestral shrines.\nPolitics.\nLike all governing institutions in mainland China, Guangdong has a parallel party-government system, in which the CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee Secretary outranks the Governor. The CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and has control over the Guangdong Provincial People's Government.\nLaw enforcement and emergency services.\nProvincial law enforcement in Guangdong is provided by the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department. The {{Ill|People's Armed Police Guangdong Corps|zh|\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u6b66\u88c5\u8b66\u5bdf\u90e8\u961f\u5e7f\u4e1c\u7701\u603b\u961f}} provides paramilitary law enforcement and disaster relief in the province while the {{Ill|Guangdong Provincial Fire and Rescue Department|zh|\u5e7f\u4e1c\u7701\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u603b\u961f}} provides firefighting and rescue services in the province.\nThe primary domestic intelligence and security agency in Guangdong is the Guangdong Provincial state security department. \nCorrections facilities in Guangdong are managed by the Guangdong Prison Administrative Bureau.\nDissent.\nAccording to Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor, Guangdong accounted for 17% of dissent events in the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 over 100 events despite heavy Censorship in China. In 2024, Freedom House rated China as below zero on political rights (\u22122 out of 40).\nRelations with Hong Kong and Macau.\nHong Kong and Macau, while historically parts of Guangdong before becoming colonies of the United Kingdom and Portugal, respectively, are special administrative regions (SARs). Furthermore, the Basic Laws of both SARs explicitly forbid provincial governments from intervening in local politics. As a result, many issues with Hong Kong and Macau, such as border policy and water rights, have been settled by negotiations between the SARs' governments and the Guangdong provincial government.\nMedia.\nGuangdong and the greater Guangzhou area are served by several Radio Guangdong stations, Guangdong Television, Southern Television Guangdong, Shenzhen Television, and Guangzhou Television. There is an English programme produced by Radio Guangdong which broadcasts information about this region to the entire world through the WRN Broadcast.\nCulture.\nThe central region, which is also the political and economic center, is populated predominantly by Yue Chinese speakers, though the influx in the last three decades of millions of Mandarin-speaking immigrants has slightly diminished Cantonese linguistic dominance. This region is associated with Cantonese cuisine. Dim sum is one famous example of Cantonese cuisine, dividing Cantonese food into small portions and served with small dishes. Cantonese opera is a form of Chinese opera popular in Cantonese speaking areas. Related Yue dialects are spoken in most of the western half of the province.\nThe area comprising the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang in coastal east Guangdong, known as Chaoshan, forms its own cultural sphere. The Teochew people here, along with Hailufeng Hoklo people in Shanwei, speak Haklau, which is a Southern Min variety closely related to mainstream Hokkien and their cuisine is Teochew cuisine. Teochew opera is also well-known and has a unique form.\nThe Hakka people live in large areas of Guangdong, including Huizhou, Meizhou, Shenzhen, Heyuan, Shaoguan and other areas. Much of the Eastern part of Guangdong is populated by the Hakka people except for the Chaozhou and Hailufeng area. Hakka culture include Hakka cuisine, Han opera ({{lang-zh|s=\u6c49\u5267 |t=\u6f22\u5287}}), Hakka \"Hanyue\" and \"sixian\" (traditional instrumental music) and Hakka folk songs ({{lang|zh|\u5ba2\u5bb6\u5c71\u6b4c}}).\nThe outcast Tanka people traditionally live on boats throughout the coasts and rivers of Guangdong and much of Southern China.\nZhanjiang in southern Guangdong is dominated by Leizhounese, a variety of Min; Cantonese and Hakka are also spoken there.\nMandarin is the language used in education and government and in areas where there are migrants from other provinces, above all in Shenzhen. Cantonese maintains a strong and dominant position in common usage and media, even in eastern areas of the province where the local languages and dialects are non-Yue ones.\nGuangdong Province is notable for being the birthplace of many famous Xiangqi (Chinese chess) grandmasters such as L\u00fc Qin, Yang Guanli, Cai Furu and Xu Yinchuan.\nEducation and research.\nAs of 2022, Guangdong hosts 160 institutions of higher education, ranking first in South Central China region and 2nd among all Chinese provinces/municipalities after Jiangsu (168). Guangdong is also the seat of 14 adult higher education institutions. Many universities and colleges are located in major cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, hosts 83 institutions of higher education (excluding adult colleges), ranking 1st in South China region and 2nd (tie) nationwide after Beijing. Guangdong Province Department of Education is the department of the provincial government that oversees education.\nAs of 2025, two major cities in the province ranked in the top 20 cities in the world (Guangzhou 6th and Shenzhen 18th) by scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index.\nSports.\nList of current professional sports based in Guangdong:\nTourism.\nNotable attractions include Danxia Mountain in Shaoguan, Yuexiu Hill, Baiyun Mountain in Guangzhou, Star Lake and the Seven Star Crags, Dinghu Mountain in Zhaoqing, the Huangmanzhai waterfalls in Jieyang, and the Zhongshan Sun Wen Memorial Park for Sun Yat-sen in Zhongshan. In Shenzhen, there are Window of the World, Tencent Building, Happy Valley theme park, Rose Beach, Xiaomeisha Beach, etc.\nAdministrative divisions.\nGuangdong is divided into twenty-one prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities (including two sub-provincial cities):\nThe twenty-one Prefecture of Guangdong are subdivided into 122 county-level divisions (65 districts, 20 county-level cities, 34 counties, and 3 autonomous counties). For county-level divisions, see the list of administrative divisions of Guangdong.\nInternational relations.\nGuangdong is twinned with:"}

During the 1970s, he became active in the pro-democracy \"Tangwai\" movement, which resulted in two prison sentences as a political prisoner.\nAfter martial law was lifted in Taiwan in 1987, Li frequently ran for public office. In 2000, he ran for the presidency of Taiwan as the New Party candidate. From 2004 to 2008, he served as an independent legislator in the Legislative Yuan. After leaving office, Li focused on writing and teaching, and became a media personality hosting shows such as \"Li Ao Speaks His Mind\" (\u674e\u6556\u6709\u8bdd\u8bf4) and \"Li Ao's Wit and Humor\" (\u674e\u6556\u8bed\u5999\u5929\u4e0b).\nOver his career, Li espoused liberalism, Chinese nationalist ideals, anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiments. He was prominent critic of the Chiang family and of the Kuomintang's authoritarian rule in Taiwan. Following Taiwan's democratization in the late 1980s, he also criticized the Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwanese independence movement. In his later years, Li praised the Chinese Communist Party for revitalizing China but also condemned its authoritarianism.\nEarly life and education.\nLi was born in Harbin, Manchukuo, to Li Dingyi (\u674e\u9f0e\u5f5d), a prominent professor of Chinese, and Zhang Kuichen (). His family had ancestry in Wei County (modern-day Weifang), Shandong, and Fuyu, Jilin. When Li was two years old, the family moved to Beijing, where Li's father worked in the government's opium suppression bureau.\nWhile the family lived in Beijing, Li's father was accused of being a traitor to the Kuomintang by his superiors. Li then began feeling enmity towards the party. The entire Li family, except for two children, moved to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Li earned his bachelor's degree in history from National Taiwan University (NTU) in 1959. In 1963, he earned a master's degree in history from NTU. As a graduate student, he was the executive editor of the magazine \"Wen Hsing\", a liberal literary magazine.\nWriting career.\nLi participated in the democratic movement in Taiwan between the 1960s and 1980s. In the 1960s, he was the editor-in-chief of pro-democracy magazine \"Wen Hsing\" (\u6587\u661f). He was jailed by the Kuomintang government from 1971 to 1976, for helping a pro-Taiwan independence legal scholar, Peng Ming-min, escape to Japan in 1970; even though Li himself had a long history of being an advocate of reunification. Throughout the 1970s, Li received international attention for his imprisonment. He was highlighted by Amnesty International as one of the three most important political prisoners in Taiwan in 1974. From 1981 to 1982 Li was imprisoned over a dispute with a former employer.\nLi's novel \"Mountaintop Love\" (), about a mother and a daughter who fall in love with the same man, though several years apart, established his status as a novelist, solidified by \"Martyrs' Shrine: The Story of the Reform Movement of 1898 in China\" (\u5317\u4eac\u6cd5\u6e90\u5bfa), a novel about the Hundred Days' Reform. Ninety-six of his books were banned in Taiwan until 1991. Popular in mainland China in the 1990s and 2000s, the majority of his books have been prohibited from republishing since 2012 amid China's tightened censorship under General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping, except his two memoirs and \"Martyrs' Shrine.\"\nPolitical career.\nLi participated in Taiwan's presidential election in 2000 as a candidate for the New Party. Li usually played the role of a political gadfly, and his campaign was largely symbolic. He took the election as an opportunity to \"educate\" the people of Taiwan. Both Li and his party publicly encouraged people to vote for James Soong. During the presidential debates, Li even stated that he was not planning to vote for himself and that people should vote for Soong.\nSince the 2000 Taiwanese presidential election, Li had bitterly spoken out against pro-independence Nobel laureate Yuan T. Lee, who publicly supported Chen Shui-bian. He also accused former President Lee Teng-hui of corruption. In October 2004, Li ran in the December 11 legislative election as a non-partisan candidate of the South Taipei constituency, and was subsequently elected to be the last winning place. He took office as an independent legislator on 1 February 2005.\nIn February 2005, Li held a press conference, accusing the PFP leader, James Soong of having changed his opposition towards military weapons purchase from the United States under the influence of people of pro-American inclination, people with CIA backgrounds and arms traders who would receive kick-backs. Li threatened Soong that he would reveal the names of the people with CIA backgrounds, who were influencing Soong, to the general public unless Soong reverted to his previous opposition position. PFP legislators dismissed the accusation and responded that Li Ao should reveal his evidence to support his story.\nLater that year, in June, Li claimed to the Taiwanese press that he had exclusive information from the CIA concerning the 3-19 shooting incident. He alleged that the real motive of the killer was to assassinate the Vice-President Annette Lu in order to garner sympathy votes for Chen Shui-bian, and that the killer had been condoned by the governing party for ulterior political reasons. After flashing several allegedly CIA-endorsed documents to reporters, he mailed them to Annette Lu, claiming that she needed to know the truth about the assassination attempt to the full extent.\nOn 19 September 2005, Li returned to Mainland China for the first time in 56 years. He was invited to give speeches at Peking University, Tsinghua University and Fudan University where he was warmly received, and the trip was claimed to have had significant impact on observers of Cross-Strait relations.\nLi was a candidate for the 2006 Taipei Mayoral election, and a candidate for the 2012 Legislative Yuan elections, campaigning in Taipei City District 8 under the People First Party (PFP) banner. Li also satirized Mao Zedong's Little Red Book in his article.\nOn 24 October 2006, Li sprayed tear gas and wielded a stun gun during a Legislative Yuan National Defense Committee meeting, forcing several members of the parliament to flee. He was attempting to stop debate on purchasing attack submarines and Patriot anti-aircraft missiles for $16 billion from the U.S. He was also wearing the Guy Fawkes mask from \"V for Vendetta\".\nPersonal life.\nIn the early 1960s, Li cohabited with Wang Shangqin, a National Taiwan University student and the younger sister of the writer Wang Shangyi. In 1964, Wang went to the United States for study, only to discover that she was pregnant with Li\u2019s child. She gave birth to their daughter, Hedy W. Lee, out of wedlock in Seattle. However, during Wang Shangqin\u2019s pregnancy, Li Ao became romantically involved with another woman, Wu Haidi. In 1966, Wang brought their daughter to Taiwan and briefly reconciled with Li, but their relationship ultimately ended due to his involvement with multiple other women. Wang has acrimonious relationships with both Li and their daughter Lee thereafter. After she returned to the US from Taiwan, she remarried Wen Naijian, an engineer. Lee, in a book published in 2004, accused Wen, her stepfather, of molesting her when she was 14, which Wang denied.\nOn 6 May 1980, Li married Taiwanese actress Terry Hu. The couple divorced on 28 August 1980.\nOn 8 March 1992, Li married his second wife, Wang Zhihui (). They had one son and one daughter. Their son, Li Kan (), graduated with a BA degree in history from Peking University and with a PhD degree in Chinese Studies from the University of Cambridge.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65118", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65118", "title": "Poplog", "text": "Programming language\n \nPoplog is a reflective, incrementally compiled software development computer programming integrated development environment and system platform for the programming languages POP-11, Common Lisp, Prolog, and Standard ML. It was created originally in the United Kingdom for teaching and research in artificial intelligence, at the University of Sussex, and later marketed as a commercial package for software development, teaching, and research. It was one of the initiatives supported for a time by the UK government-funded Alvey Programme.\nIt was licensed originally from 1982 to 1999, as proprietary software, then released in 1999 as open-source software, under a mix of MIT and then XFree86 licenses.\nHistory.\nAfter an incremental compiler for Prolog had been added to an implementation of POP-11, the name POPLOG was adopted, to reflect that the expanded system supported programming in both languages. The name was retained, as a trade mark of the University of Sussex, when the system was later (mid 1980s) extended with incremental compilers for Common Lisp and Standard ML based on a set of tools for implementing new languages in the Poplog Virtual Machine. The user-accessible incremental-compiler tools that allow compilers for all these languages to be added also allow extensions to be made within a language to provide new abilities that cannot be added via standard macros that merely allow new text to be equivalent to a longer portion of old text.\nFor some time after 1983, Poplog was sold and supported internationally as a commercial product, on behalf of the University of Sussex by Systems Designers Ltd (SDL), whose name changed as ownership changed. The main development work continued to be done by a small team at Sussex University until 1998, while marketing, sales, and support (except for UK academic users, who dealt directly with the Sussex team) was done by SDL and its successors (SD, then SD-Scicon then Electronic Data Systems (EDS)) until 1991. At that time a management buy-out produced a spin-off company Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL), to sell and support Poplog in collaboration with Sussex University, who retained the rights to the name 'Poplog' and were responsible for the core software development while it was a commercial product. In 1992 ISL and Sussex University won a \"Smart Award\" in recognition of Poplog sales worth $5M.\nISL and its clients used Poplog for many development projects, especially ISL's data-mining system Clementine, mostly implemented in POP-11, using powerful graphical tools implemented also in POP-11 running on the X Window System. Clementine was so successful that in 1998 ISL was bought by http:// who had been selling the statistics and data-mining package SPSS for which they needed a better graphical interface suited to expert and non-expert users. SPSS did not wish to sell and support Poplog as such, so Poplog then became available as a free open source software package, hosted at the University of Birmingham, which had also been involved in development after 1991. Later IBM bought SPSS and Clementine is now marketed and supported as SPSS Modeler.\nSupported languages.\nPoplog's core language is POP-11. It is used to implement the other languages, all of them incrementally compiled, with an integrated common editor. In the Linux/Unix versions, POP-11 provides support for 2-D graphics via X.\nPoplog supports incrementally compiled versions of Common Lisp, POP-11, Prolog, and Standard ML. A separate package implemented by Robin Popplestone supports a version of Scheme.\nPoplog has been used both for academic research and teaching in artificial intelligence and also to develop several commercial products, apart from Clementine. In 1992, ISL and Sussex University won an ICP Million Dollar award in recognition of Poplog exceeding sales of US$5 million.\nPlatforms.\nPOP-11 was at first implemented on a DEC PDP-11 computer in 1976, and was ported to VAX/VMS in 1980. It became Poplog around 1982. Although the first commercial sales were for VAX/VMS, from the mid-1980s, the main Poplog development work was done on Sun SPARC computers running Solaris, although several different versions were sold, including versions for HP-UX and a 64-bit version of Poplog for DEC Alpha running Digital UNIX. After about 1999, when Poplog became available as free, open source, most development work was done on the Linux version, including porting to 64-bit Linux. A partial port to Mac OS X on PowerPC was done in 2005.\nThere is a version for Windows, originally developed to support Clementine, but the Unix/Linux graphical subsystem does not work on Windows Poplog. The Windows version of Clementine depended on a commercial package that supported X functionality on Windows.\nThere is also an open source project which aimed to produce a more platform neutral version of Poplog, including Windows. The most recent development by this project includes a web server component for integrating into Poplog applications, and the OpenPoplog Widget Collection for supporting client user interfaces running in a web browser. A more narrowly focused open source Poplog project, restricted to the 64-bit AMD64/X86-64 architecture was set up on GitHub by Waldek Hebisch: https://. This is now the basis of Poplog Version 16 hosted at the University of Birmingham https://.\nAdditional information about the history and features of Poplog can be found in the entries for POP-2 and POP-11. The chief architect of Poplog, responsible for many innovations related to making an incrementally compiled system portable, and providing support for a collection of languages was John Gibson, at Sussex University, though the earliest work was done by Steve Hardy. Chris Mellish helped with the initial Prolog implementation in POP-11. John Williams, working under supervision of Jonathan Cunningham implemented the Common Lisp subsystem. Robert Duncan and Simon Nichols added Standard ML. Between about 1980 and 1991, the project was managed by Aaron Sloman, until he went to the University of Birmingham, though he continued to collaborate with Sussex and ISL on Poplog development after that. Since 1999, he has been responsible for the main Poplog web site, as well as some of the extensions to be found there, listed under POP-11.\nImplementation.\nThe Prolog subset of Poplog is implemented using the extendable incremental compiler of POP-11, the core language of Poplog, which is a general purpose Lisp-like language with a more conventional syntax. The implementation required the Poplog Virtual Machine to be extended to provide support for Prolog continuations, Prolog variables, the Prolog \"trail\" (recording undoable variable bindings), and Prolog terms. The implementation was constrained by the need to allow data-structures to be shared with the other Poplog languages, especially POP-11 and Common Lisp, thereby providing support for a mixture of programming styles.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
