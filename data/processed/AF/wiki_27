{"id": "61091", "revid": "41044949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61091", "title": "Cake (band)", "text": "American rock band\nCAKE is an American rock band from Sacramento, California, consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Daniel McCallum, and drummer Todd Roper. The band has been through many lineup changes but in all of them lead singer John McCrea and trumpeter Vince DiFiore have been consistently in the band since the start. The band has also been noted for McCrea's droll sarcastic lyrics and deadpan vocals, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including norte\u00f1o, country music, mariachi, disco, rock, funk, folk music, and hip hop.\nCAKE was formed in August of 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown (guitar), Frank French (drums), and Shon Meckfessel (bass) who soon left and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, \"Motorcade of Generosity\", the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number\u00a035 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's \"120 Minutes\"; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's \"Fashion Nugget\", went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.\n\"Prolonging the Magic\", the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units featuring the single \"Never There\" which hit number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart; this was followed three years later by \"Comfort Eagle\", the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number\u00a07 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released \"Pressure Chief\" in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released \"Showroom of Compassion\" in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the \"Billboard\" charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release. Their studio output has been minimal since 2011, although they have continued to tour and have occasionally hinted at an upcoming album.\nHistory.\nFormation and \"Motorcade of Generosity\" (1991\u20131996).\nCake was formed in 1991 when John McCrea, a Sacramento, California native who had moved to Los Angeles with a band only to see it \"quickly crumble around him\", returned to Sacramento. He began looking for a new band to play with, having \"grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit\", and quickly attracted trumpet player Vince DiFiore, guitarist Greg Brown, bassist Shon Meckfessel, and drummer Frank French. All were active in the music scene at the time; DiFiore notes that \"[McCrea] came back and stole us from other bands\". The band soon came up with the name \"Cake\"; rather than referring to the food, the name is meant to be \"like when something insidiously becomes a part of your life...[we] mean it more as something that cakes onto your shoe and is just sort of there until you get rid of it\". Meckfessel soon left to attend college and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. After touring and becoming part of the club scene in San Francisco, the band independently recorded and released \"Motorcade of Generosity\" in 1994, selling copies from their van as a method of paying touring expenses.\n\"Motorcade\" was named one of the best indie releases of 1994 by \"Pulse!\", and after a concert at the Great American Music Hall, Bonnie Simmons agreed to manage the band, leading to them signing a deal with Capricorn Records, who re-released the album in 1995. The first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", hit number\u00a035 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes. Critical reactions to the album were largely positive; Stephen Thompson in the \"Wisconsin State Journal\" described it as possessing \"great lyrics, creative instrumentation and production that's about as simple as production gets\", Thomas Conner praised it for being \"soulful and smooth, witty and gritty, this record makes the ghosts of Bob Wills, Buddy Holly and Lou Reed smile\" in the \"Tulsa World\", and Matt Weitz in the \"Dallas Observer\" noted its \"gimlet eye and sardonic humor\". The album was eventually nominated for a Bammy Award in the category of \"Outstanding Debut Album\".\nNevertheless, some critics were less appreciative; John Wirt, in \"The Advocate\", praised the album's sense of humor and \"delicious\" irreverence but noted that \"[the] musicianship in \"Motorcade of Generosity\" suggests the Cake guys are mediocre players\". Mindy LaBernz, in \"The Austin Chronicle\", described the album as \"cover-free, and, since we're on the subject, genre-free. A quartet made five by a trumpet player, Cake carry themselves with the snittiness of technically proficient, lyrically aware music lovers, who are almost anachronistically untrendy and brazenly proud of it\". The signing to Capricorn and re-release of \"Motorcade\" led to both French and Nelson leaving the band, citing their dislike of \"the prospect of extensive national touring\"; they were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani, respectively.\n\"Fashion Nugget\" (1996\u20131998).\n\"Fashion Nugget\", Cake's second album, was released on 17 September 1996. Like \"Motorcade\", it was produced by the band and released on Capricorn Records. Cake considered the album more professionally produced than \"Motorcade\", despite references to its \"raw\" sound, and the reception was again generally positive; critics noted the broadening of Cake's sound, with Joshua Green noting in the \"Westword\" that \"\"Nugget\" spans a broader range of topics than did \"Motorcade\", with similarly appealing results\", and Matt Weitz in the \"Dallas Observer\" saying that \"The gimlet eye and sardonic humor of 1994's \"Motorcade of Generosity\" is intact, but \"Fashion Nugget\" is aptly named; it updates \"Motorcade\" with beatboxy soul and hip-hop rhythms\". The album's first single, \"The Distance\", written by Greg Brown, became the band's biggest hit to date and is considered their \"ubiquitous\" song; it hit number 5 on the RPM Alternative 30, and entered the Modern Rock Tracks top\u00a05.\nOn the strength of \"The Distance\", \"Fashion Nugget\" was certified gold on December\u00a09,\u00a01996 and platinum on April\u00a010,\u00a01997. The second single from \"Fashion Nugget\", a cover of the Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris song \"I Will Survive\", hit number\u00a038 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. Although the band described it as a serious take on the original, one they'd been playing live for years, original performer Gloria Gaynor considers it her least favorite version of the song due to its use of profanity. Following \"Fashion Nugget\"'s release, the band toured the United States, playing in cities including Tulsa, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Dallas. They later toured overseas, visiting the United Kingdom as a support act for Counting Crows, playing their own shows alongside the tour at venues including Dingwalls in London. The band also toured Japan; a later tour of the US, starting in Minneapolis in June 1997, was cancelled due to illness when McCrea was diagnosed with \"fatigue and extreme exhaustion\". After McCrea recovered, the band continued touring, playing at the Big Stink festival in Estacada, Oregon, and the Jayhawk Music Festival in Lawrence, Kansas.\n1997 also saw lineup changes; bassist Victor Damiani and guitarist Greg Brown both left, prompting speculation about the band's survival; McCrea noted that \"Musically, there was a really great symbiosis and I really felt that it (their departures, especially Brown's) was the most stupid thing in the world\", and said that he had considered dissolving the band. Damiani and McCrea have not been on good terms ever since his departure. Brown and Damiani formed the \"new-wave influenced\" Deathray; their places within Cake were taken by Xan McCurdy and Gabe Nelson, whom McCrea persuaded to rejoin the band.\n\"Prolonging the Magic\" (1998\u20132001).\nWith Brown and Damiani's departure, McCrea felt \"free to experiment\" with the next album, 1998's \"Prolonging the Magic\"; he wrote and produced every song. As a result of this experimentation, the album was noted as \"loaded with spiced-up instrumentation, including a few new ingredients like the pedal steel guitar and musical saw thrown in for extra flavour\". McCrea stated that he deliberately \"approached writing this record without the guitar as the central assumption of all life in the universe\". \"Music Week\" described it as an \"inspired collection of leftfield rock\", while Thor Christensen of \"The Dallas Morning News\" said that it \"brims with the same dry humor the Sacramento band displayed in past hits such as 'The Distance' and 'Rock and Roll Lifestyle': The leadoff track, 'Satan Is My Motor', puts a devilish new spin on the rock 'n' roll car-song tradition, while 'When You Sleep' revolves around the question of what your fingers do while the rest of the body snoozes\". Other reviewers were less complimentary, with Mike Pattenden in \"The Times\" writing that \"\"Prolonging the Magic\" suggests that [Cake] may well be destined to go down as one-hit wonders\u00a0...\u00a0While a handful stand out \u2013 the country waltz 'Mexico', 'You Turn the Screws' and 'Hem of Your Garment' \u2013 'Prolonging the Magic' shows McRea and company to be little more than an above average bar-room act. Cake are surviving on songwriting crumbs\". The album peaked at number\u00a033 on the \"Billboard\" 200, was listed in \"The Columbian\" as the second best album of 1998, and eventually went platinum after shipping over 1\u00a0million units.\nThe album's first single, \"Never There\", hit number 1 on \"Billboard\"'s Modern Rock Tracks chart, and was followed by \"Let Me Go\" in 1999, which hit number\u00a030. Following \"Prolonging the Magic\"'s release, the band toured the United States, playing in cities including San Diego and Los Angeles. A tour of Europe was temporarily postponed in March after McCrea broke a bone in his hand while moving furniture, which also led to the delay of the European release of \"Prolonging the Magic\". Both the album release and the tour happened in mid-April, with Cake playing at the London Astoria. Later show locations in North America included Chicago, St. Louis, Missouri, and Toronto. A third single, \"Sheep Go to Heaven\", was released in 2001.\n\"Comfort Eagle\" (2001\u20132004).\nFor their fourth album, \"Comfort Eagle\", the band signed a deal with Columbia Records. \"Comfort Eagle\" was both produced and arranged by the band, and was recorded at Paradise Studios in Sacramento and Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco. Following the recording, drummer Todd Roper left the band, citing the demands extended touring would put on his time, and the commitments his two children represented. He was replaced by Pete McNeal. The album's release was preceded by the release of its first single, \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\", described as a parable about \"the relationship between prosperity and the population boom\u00a0...\u00a0There's nothing more procreational than economic prosperity\". An accompanying video was directed by McCrea, and recorded using the DV system; it featured \"vox populi\" recordings of members of the public listening to the song and giving their opinion. \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" hit number\u00a02 on the Bear Rock Top\u00a010 in Canada and number\u00a07 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks; the video became one of the 30 most requested tracks on MTV; \"Billboard\" writers later listed the video as the 5th best of 2001.\n\"Comfort Eagle\" itself was released on July\u00a024,\u00a02001, to good reviews; Michael D. Clark of \"The Houston Chronicle\" described it as \"Cake at its best\", while a reviewer for \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" stated that the album's songs were \"among the best of the band's career\", praising McCrea for widening his vocal repertoire. James Montgomery, writing for \"UWIRE\", noted a stylistic change, saying that \"While the core sound of the band \u2013 honky tonk guitars, mariachi horns and salsa rhythms \u2013 remain intact, they have been stripped down to the core, replaced instead with ill Casio beats, rubbery funk and Stax-style horn bleats\". The album sold 22,000 copies in its first week, the highest sales in the band's history, and eventually went gold. With the exception of a slot at the Atlanta On The Bricks Festival, playing for 90,000 people, the band chose to start the tour with small rather than large shows, such as in the Sacramento area, where they played for around 100 people. They launched their first full tour for the album in September, playing in the United States, Canada, and across Europe.\nA second single, \"Love You Madly\", was released in 2002, with an accompanying video again produced by McCrea. The video featured DiFiore and McNeal competing in a cooking competition, judged by Rick James, Phyllis Diller, and Jeff Smith, and was noted by \"Billboard\" as \"continuing the fresh, witty, and downright fun style seen in the \"Short Skirt\" video\". Cake had planned a second tour of Europe, followed by a series of shows around the United States, but in view of the September 11 attacks chose not to travel overseas. Instead, the band streamed a performance internationally from the Yahoo! headquarters in California, playing emailed requests. The United States tour went ahead as planned, with Cake playing concerts in Birmingham, Alabama, St. Petersburg, Florida, Salt Lake City, and Las Vegas. This was followed by the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, a traveling festival headlined and planned by the band and featuring Modest Mouse, De La Soul, and the Flaming Lips. A second Unlimited Sunshine Tour was undertaken in 2003, featuring Cake, Cheap Trick, and the Hackensaw Boys.\n\"Pressure Chief / B-Sides and Rarities\" (2004\u20132011).\nCake's fifth album, \"Pressure Chief\", was recorded in June\u00a02004 in a converted house in Sacramento; the album was again released on Columbia Records. Before its official release date on October\u00a05, the band played at the Austin City Limits Music Festival and KBCO's World Class Rockfest. The album was also preceded by its first single, \"No Phone\", which hit number\u00a013 on \"Billboard\"'s Modern Rock Tracks chart; the song covered the ubiquitous and privacy-invading use of cell phones, and was described by Jeremy Mahadevan of the \"New Straits Times\" as \"a traditionally minimalist Cake anthem, with a killer melody and, unique to this album, fairly extensive use of synths\". A second single, \"Wheels\", was also released but failed to chart. \"Pressure Chief\" itself hit number\u00a017 on the \"Billboard\" top\u00a0200, spending seven weeks in the charts, and received mixed reviews from critics. Although it was acknowledged as a continuation of their old work, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers, Sam Spies of the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" noted that \"the experiments in style that made Cake fun to listen to have all but disappeared from 'Pressure Chief'\u00a0...\u00a0What's left is mostly uninspired, so-called alternative rock\", and Graeme Hammond of the \"Sunday Herald Sun\" wrote that \"the melodies are listless, the album bereft of anything with the verve of Short Skirt/Long Jacket or Comfort Eagle\".\nOther critics were more generous; Doug Elfman of the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" called it \"another great and bizarre, twangy album of alternative-singer-songwriting stories about cars and horrible relationships\", while a reviewer in the \"New Straits Times\" noted its \"smart, subtly dissident, and always catchy pop\". Following \"Pressure Chief\"'s release, the band toured North America, playing in cities including Albany, New York, and Montreal. A second tour, in 2005, saw the band headline the 20-city Virgin College Mega Tour, playing alongside Gomez; while the tour was in California, the band announced that it had been dropped from Columbia Records. This was followed by a tour of Europe, as well as concerts in Australia and Jakarta, along with a 2006 repeat of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, featuring Cake, Tegan and Sara, and Gogol Bordello.\nOn August 10, 2004, Cake performed at Buck Owens Crystal Palace in Bakersfield California to celebrate Buck Owens' 75th birthday, along with The Mavericks. Cake had previously covered and performed several Buck Owens songs.\nCake later formed its own label, Upbeat Records, which allowed the band to release the compilation album \"B-Sides and Rarities\" on August\u00a014,\u00a02007. This was followed by a series of concerts, including at the IndigO2 in London, and a performance in Anchorage, Alaska. Reviews of \"B-Sides and Rarities\" were generally good; Devin Grant of \"The Post and Courier\" wrote that \"For an album full of odds and ends, this Cake release is every bit as good, and every bit as fun, as the band's previous studio releases\", while Catherine P. Lewis of \"The Washington Post\" noted that, although several live tracks reduced the album's strength, \"there are still enough charming nuggets to make this album less disposable than the typical rarities compilation\".\n\"Showroom of Compassion\" (2010\u20132011).\nAfter six years without a studio album, Cake recorded \"Showroom of Compassion\" in 2010 and released it on 11 January 2011. Rather than having it professionally recorded, the band built their own solar-powered studio in Sacramento over five years and chose to produce the album themselves there. The album was preceded by its first single, \"Sick of You\", which was released in September\u00a02010, hitting number\u00a04 on the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs chart. The album debuted at number\u00a01 on the \"Billboard\" 200 Albums chart, selling 44,000 copies in its first week of release. It marked the first time a Cake album had hit the number\u00a01 spot, and at the time was the lowest sales numbers for album at the top of the \"Billboard\" 200.\nThe album received mostly positive reviews. Scott Bergen of \"The Record\" described it as \"one of their best albums\", while Jim Farber of the \"Daily News\" wrote that \"Fifteen years after they batted out their first left-field hit with 'The Distance,' the band's sound and words still have bite\". George Lang of \"The Oklahoman\", however, wrote that it was \"frustratingly lacking in many more songs worthy of the band's late-'90s boom period\".\nTo promote the album, Cake performed on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" before releasing \"Showroom of Compassion\"'s second single, \"Long Time\". This was followed by a spring tour of both Europe and North America, concluding with a show in Toronto on May\u00a021. The song \"Long Time\" was also played in season 1 episode 12 of Showtime's series \"Shameless\".\nOn 26 February 2011, Cake performed a live set for \"Guitar Center Sessions\" on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host Nic Harcourt. In September 2011, Cake released a 24-page, hand-made visual book for their song, \"Bound Away\".\nLater history (2011\u2013present).\nThe band released a vinyl box set consisting of their six studio albums, their rarities album, and the previously unreleased \"Live from the Crystal Palace\" for Record Store Day 2014. A new studio album was announced for an early 2014 release, although in September 2014, McCrea admitted they hadn't yet begun to record a new album. In fall 2015, bassist Gabe Nelson and drummer Paulo Baldi left the band. In summer 2016, Todd Roper rejoined the group as drummer. Daniel McCallum and Casey Lipka have both played as bassist during live performances since 2016.\nOn August 3, 2018, Cake released \"Sinking Ship\", supposedly the lead single from an upcoming seventh studio album. On August 31, 2018, \"King of the Road: A Tribute to Roger Miller\" was released with Cake providing their version of Roger Miller's \"Reincarnation\" Cake also hinted at an upcoming seventh studio album in their bio for the Kaaboo Music Festival website, saying the album was due for release in late 2018. On October 25, 2018, the band released the music video for 'Sinking Ship\", also announcing that money raised by single sales would go towards Doctors Without Borders. On 19 January 2021, they released a demo for a new song titled \"Hold You (Responsible)\" on Instagram and Twitter. On October 18, 2024, the compilation album \"Songs For Sex\" by Noise For Now included the full version of \"Hold You (Responsible)\".\nDuring a live performance for Texas Public Radio on 22 October 2024, Cake performed a new song titled \"Billionaire in Space\", set to be included off a new album \"to be released [in 2025].\"\nMusical style.\nCake incorporates a wide range of genres into its music, including country music, mariachi, new wave, college rock, jazz, funk, Iranian folk music, Brazilian music, and hip hop. McCrea himself cites Hank Williams, Tom Z\u00e9, the Golden Gate Quartet, and Sly and the Family Stone as particular influences. The band is most often noted for four things: the prominence of DiFiore's trumpet lines; McCrea's ironic, sarcastic lyrics; his \"droll, deadpan\u00a0...\u00a0monotone\" vocals; and the use of the vibraslap. DiFiore's trumpet work originated with McCrea's desire for a second melodic instrument to go with a song he had written; \"A lead guitar playing those lines would have been really hokey. I like it when it's a contrapuntal thing, where the guitar is doing one melody, the vocal is doing another melody, and the trumpet plays this third melody. If the music can be transparent enough, you can hear all three at the same time\".\nBand members.\nCurrent members\nFormer members\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nAwards and nominations.\nCake have been nominated for five awards: four California Music Awards and one MTV Video Music Award.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61093", "revid": "46869372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61093", "title": "Deductive reasoning", "text": "Form of reasoning\nDeductive reasoning is the process of drawing valid inferences. An inference is valid if its conclusion follows logically from its premises, meaning that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises \"all men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\" to the conclusion \"Socrates is mortal\" is deductively valid. An argument is \"sound\" if it is valid \"and\" all its premises are true. One approach defines deduction in terms of the intentions of the author: they have to intend for the premises to offer deductive support to the conclusion. With the help of this modification, it is possible to distinguish valid from invalid deductive reasoning: it is invalid if the author's belief about the deductive support is false, but even invalid deductive reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning. \nDeductive logic studies under what conditions an argument is valid. According to the semantic approach, an argument is valid if there is no possible interpretation of the argument whereby its premises are true and its conclusion is false. The syntactic approach, by contrast, focuses on rules of inference, that is, schemas of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises based only on their logical form. There are various rules of inference, such as modus ponens and modus tollens. Invalid deductive arguments, which do not follow a rule of inference, are called formal fallacies. Rules of inference are definitory rules and contrast with strategic rules, which specify what inferences one needs to draw in order to arrive at an intended conclusion.\nDeductive reasoning contrasts with non-deductive or ampliative reasoning. For ampliative arguments, such as inductive or abductive arguments, the premises offer weaker support to their conclusion: they indicate that it is most likely, but they do not guarantee its truth. They make up for this drawback with their ability to provide genuinely new information (that is, information not already found in the premises), unlike deductive arguments.\nCognitive psychology investigates the mental processes responsible for deductive reasoning. One of its topics concerns the factors determining whether people draw valid or invalid deductive inferences. One such factor is the form of the argument: for example, people draw valid inferences more successfully for arguments of the form modus ponens than of the form modus tollens. Another factor is the content of the arguments: people are more likely to believe that an argument is valid if the claim made in its conclusion is plausible. A general finding is that people tend to perform better for realistic and concrete cases than for abstract cases. Psychological theories of deductive reasoning aim to explain these findings by providing an account of the underlying psychological processes. \"Mental logic theories\" hold that deductive reasoning is a language-like process that happens through the manipulation of representations using rules of inference. \"Mental model theories\", on the other hand, claim that deductive reasoning involves models of possible states of the world without the medium of language or rules of inference. According to \"dual-process theories\" of reasoning, there are two qualitatively different cognitive systems responsible for reasoning.\nThe problem of deduction is relevant to various fields and issues. Epistemology tries to understand how justification is transferred from the belief in the premises to the belief in the conclusion in the process of deductive reasoning. Probability logic studies how the probability of the premises of an inference affects the probability of its conclusion. The controversial thesis of deductivism denies that there are other correct forms of inference besides deduction. Natural deduction is a type of proof system based on simple and self-evident rules of inference. In philosophy, the geometrical method is a way of philosophizing that starts from a small set of self-evident axioms and tries to build a comprehensive logical system using deductive reasoning.\nDefinition.\nDeductive reasoning is the psychological process of drawing deductive inferences. An inference is a set of premises together with a conclusion. This psychological process starts from the premises and reasons to a conclusion based on and supported by these premises. If the reasoning was done correctly, it results in a valid deduction: the truth of the premises ensures the truth of the conclusion. For example, in the syllogistic argument \"all frogs are amphibians; no cats are amphibians; therefore, no cats are frogs\" the conclusion is true because its two premises are true. But even arguments with wrong premises can be deductively valid if they obey this principle, as in \"all frogs are mammals; no cats are mammals; therefore, no cats are frogs\". If the premises of a valid argument are true, then it is called a sound argument.\nThe relation between the premises and the conclusion of a deductive argument is usually referred to as \"logical consequence\". According to Alfred Tarski, logical consequence has 3 essential features: it is necessary, formal, and knowable a priori. It is necessary in the sense that the premises of valid deductive arguments necessitate the conclusion: it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false, independent of any other circumstances. Logical consequence is formal in the sense that it depends only on the form or the syntax of the premises and the conclusion. This means that the validity of a particular argument does not depend on the specific contents of this argument. If it is valid, then any argument with the same logical form is also valid, no matter how different it is on the level of its contents. Logical consequence is knowable a priori in the sense that no empirical knowledge of the world is necessary to determine whether a deduction is valid. So it is not necessary to engage in any form of empirical investigation. Some logicians define deduction in terms of possible worlds: A deductive inference is valid if and only if, there is no possible world in which its conclusion is false while its premises are true. This means that there are no counterexamples: the conclusion is true in \"all\" such cases, not just in \"most\" cases.\nIt has been argued against this and similar definitions that they fail to distinguish between valid and invalid deductive reasoning, i.e. they leave it open whether there are invalid deductive inferences and how to define them. Some authors define deductive reasoning in psychological terms in order to avoid this problem. According to Mark Vorobey, whether an argument is deductive depends on the psychological state of the person making the argument: \"An argument is deductive if, and only if, the author of the argument believes that the truth of the premises necessitates (guarantees) the truth of the conclusion\". A similar formulation holds that the speaker \"claims\" or \"intends\" that the premises offer deductive support for their conclusion. This is sometimes categorized as a \"speaker-determined\" definition of deduction since it depends also on the speaker whether the argument in question is deductive or not. For \"speakerless\" definitions, on the other hand, only the argument itself matters independent of the speaker. One advantage of this type of formulation is that it makes it possible to distinguish between good or valid and bad or invalid deductive arguments: the argument is good if the author's belief concerning the relation between the premises and the conclusion is true, otherwise it is bad. One consequence of this approach is that deductive arguments cannot be identified by the law of inference they use. For example, an argument of the form modus ponens may be non-deductive if the author's beliefs are sufficiently confused. That brings with it an important drawback of this definition: it is difficult to apply to concrete cases since the intentions of the author are usually not explicitly stated.\nDeductive reasoning is studied in logic, psychology, and the cognitive sciences. Some theorists emphasize in their definition the difference between these fields. On this view, psychology studies deductive reasoning as an empirical mental process, i.e. what happens when humans engage in reasoning. But the descriptive question of how actual reasoning happens is different from the normative question of how it \"should\" happen or what constitutes \"correct\" deductive reasoning, which is studied by logic. This is sometimes expressed by stating that, strictly speaking, logic does not study deductive reasoning but the deductive relation between premises and a conclusion known as logical consequence. But this distinction is not always precisely observed in the academic literature. One important aspect of this difference is that logic is not interested in whether the conclusion of an argument is sensible. So from the premise \"the printer has ink\" one may draw the unhelpful conclusion \"the printer has ink and the printer has ink and the printer has ink\", which has little relevance from a psychological point of view. Instead, actual reasoners usually try to remove redundant or irrelevant information and make the relevant information more explicit. The psychological study of deductive reasoning is also concerned with how good people are at drawing deductive inferences and with the factors determining their performance. Deductive inferences are found both in natural language and in formal logical systems, such as propositional logic.\nConceptions of deduction.\nDeductive arguments differ from non-deductive arguments in that the truth of their premises ensures the truth of their conclusion. There are two important conceptions of what this exactly means. They are referred to as the syntactic and the semantic approach. According to the syntactic approach, whether an argument is deductively valid depends only on its form, syntax, or structure. Two arguments have the same form if they use the same logical vocabulary in the same arrangement, even if their contents differ. For example, the arguments \"if it rains then the street will be wet; it rains; therefore, the street will be wet\" and \"if the meat is not cooled then it will spoil; the meat is not cooled; therefore, it will spoil\" have the same logical form: they follow the modus ponens. Their form can be expressed more abstractly as \"if A then B; A; therefore B\" in order to make the common syntax explicit. There are various other valid logical forms or rules of inference, like modus tollens or the disjunction elimination. The syntactic approach then holds that an argument is deductively valid if and only if its conclusion can be deduced from its premises using a valid rule of inference. One difficulty for the syntactic approach is that it is usually necessary to express the argument in a formal language in order to assess whether it is valid. This often brings with it the difficulty of translating the natural language argument into a formal language, a process that comes with various problems of its own. Another difficulty is due to the fact that the syntactic approach depends on the distinction between formal and non-formal features. While there is a wide agreement concerning the paradigmatic cases, there are also various controversial cases where it is not clear how this distinction is to be drawn.\nThe semantic approach suggests an alternative definition of deductive validity. It is based on the idea that the sentences constituting the premises and conclusions have to be interpreted in order to determine whether the argument is valid. This means that one ascribes semantic values to the expressions used in the sentences, such as the reference to an object for singular terms or to a truth-value for atomic sentences. The semantic approach is also referred to as the model-theoretic approach since the branch of mathematics known as model theory is often used to interpret these sentences. Usually, many different interpretations are possible, such as whether a singular term refers to one object or to another. According to the semantic approach, an argument is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible interpretation where its premises are true and its conclusion is false. Some objections to the semantic approach are based on the claim that the semantics of a language cannot be expressed in the same language, i.e. that a richer metalanguage is necessary. This would imply that the semantic approach cannot provide a universal account of deduction for language as an all-encompassing medium.\nRules of inference.\nDeductive reasoning usually happens by applying rules of inference. A rule of inference is a way or schema of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises. This happens usually based only on the logical form of the premises. A rule of inference is valid if, when applied to true premises, the conclusion cannot be false. A particular argument is valid if it follows a valid rule of inference. Deductive arguments that do not follow a valid rule of inference are called formal fallacies: the truth of their premises does not ensure the truth of their conclusion.\nIn some cases, whether a rule of inference is valid depends on the logical system one is using. The dominant logical system is classical logic and the rules of inference listed here are all valid in classical logic. But so-called deviant logics provide a different account of which inferences are valid. For example, the rule of inference known as double negation elimination, i.e. that if a proposition is \"not not true\" then it is also \"true\", is accepted in classical logic but rejected in intuitionistic logic.\nProminent rules of inference.\nModus ponens.\nModus ponens (also known as \"affirming the antecedent\" or \"the law of detachment\") is the primary deductive rule of inference. It applies to arguments that have as first premise a conditional statement (formula_1) and as second premise the antecedent (formula_2) of the conditional statement. It obtains the consequent (formula_3) of the conditional statement as its conclusion. The argument form is listed below:\nIn this form of deductive reasoning, the consequent (formula_3) obtains as the conclusion from the premises of a conditional statement (formula_1) and its antecedent (formula_2). However, the antecedent (formula_2) cannot be similarly obtained as the conclusion from the premises of the conditional statement (formula_1) and the consequent (formula_3). Such an argument commits the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent.\nThe following is an example of an argument using modus ponens:\nModus tollens.\nModus tollens (also known as \"the law of contrapositive\") is a deductive rule of inference. It validates an argument that has as premises a conditional statement (formula) and the negation of the consequent (formula_13) and as conclusion the negation of the antecedent (formula_14). In contrast to modus ponens, reasoning with modus tollens goes in the opposite direction to that of the conditional. The general expression for modus tollens is the following:\nThe following is an example of an argument using modus tollens:\nHypothetical syllogism.\nA \"hypothetical syllogism\" is an inference that takes two conditional statements and forms a conclusion by combining the hypothesis of one statement with the conclusion of another. Here is the general form:\nIn there being a subformula in common between the two premises that does not occur in the consequence, this resembles syllogisms in term logic, although it differs in that this subformula is a proposition whereas in Aristotelian logic, this common element is a term and not a proposition.\nThe following is an example of an argument using a hypothetical syllogism:\nFallacies.\nVarious formal fallacies have been described. They are invalid forms of deductive reasoning. An additional aspect of them is that they appear to be valid on some occasions or on the first impression. They may thereby seduce people into accepting and committing them. One type of formal fallacy is affirming the consequent, as in \"if John is a bachelor, then he is male; John is male; therefore, John is a bachelor\". This is similar to the valid rule of inference named modus ponens, but the second premise and the conclusion are switched around, which is why it is invalid. A similar formal fallacy is denying the antecedent, as in \"if Othello is a bachelor, then he is male; Othello is not a bachelor; therefore, Othello is not male\". This is similar to the valid rule of inference called modus tollens, the difference being that the second premise and the conclusion are switched around. Other formal fallacies include affirming a disjunct, denying a conjunct, and the fallacy of the undistributed middle. All of them have in common that the truth of their premises does not ensure the truth of their conclusion. But it may still happen by coincidence that both the premises and the conclusion of formal fallacies are true.\nDefinitory and strategic rules.\nRules of inferences are definitory rules: they determine whether an argument is deductively valid or not. But reasoners are usually not just interested in making any kind of valid argument. Instead, they often have a specific point or conclusion that they wish to prove or refute. So given a set of premises, they are faced with the problem of choosing the relevant rules of inference for their deduction to arrive at their intended conclusion. This issue belongs to the field of strategic rules: the question of which inferences need to be drawn to support one's conclusion. The distinction between definitory and strategic rules is not exclusive to logic: it is also found in various games. In chess, for example, the definitory rules state that bishops may only move diagonally while the strategic rules recommend that one should control the center and protect one's king if one intends to win. In this sense, definitory rules determine whether one plays chess or something else whereas strategic rules determine whether one is a good or a bad chess player. The same applies to deductive reasoning: to be an effective reasoner involves mastering both definitory and strategic rules.\nValidity and soundness.\nDeductive arguments are evaluated in terms of their \"validity\" and \"soundness\".\nAn argument is \"valid\" if it is impossible for its premises to be true while its conclusion is false. In other words, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. An argument can be \"valid\" even if one or more of its premises are false.\nAn argument is \"sound\" if it is \"valid\" and the premises are true.\nIt is possible to have a deductive argument that is logically \"valid\" but is not \"sound\". Fallacious arguments often take that form.\nThe following is an example of an argument that is \"valid\", but not \"sound\":\nThe example's first premise is false \u2013 there are people who eat carrots who are not quarterbacks \u2013 but the conclusion would necessarily be true, if the premises were true. In other words, it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is \"valid\", but not \"sound\". False generalizations \u2013 such as \"Everyone who eats carrots is a quarterback\" \u2013 are often used to make unsound arguments. The fact that there are some people who eat carrots but are not quarterbacks proves the flaw of the argument.\nIn this example, the first statement uses categorical reasoning, saying that all carrot-eaters are definitely quarterbacks. This theory of deductive reasoning \u2013 also known as term logic \u2013 was developed by Aristotle, but was superseded by propositional (sentential) logic and predicate logic. \nDeductive reasoning can be contrasted with inductive reasoning, in regards to validity and soundness. In cases of inductive reasoning, even though the premises are true and the argument is \"valid\", it is possible for the conclusion to be false (determined to be false with a counterexample or other means).\nDifference from ampliative reasoning.\nDeductive reasoning is usually contrasted with non-deductive or ampliative reasoning. The hallmark of valid deductive inferences is that it is impossible for their premises to be true and their conclusion to be false. In this way, the premises provide the strongest possible support to their conclusion. The premises of ampliative inferences also support their conclusion. But this support is weaker: they are not necessarily truth-preserving. So even for correct ampliative arguments, it is possible that their premises are true and their conclusion is false. Two important forms of ampliative reasoning are inductive and abductive reasoning. Sometimes the term \"inductive reasoning\" is used in a very wide sense to cover all forms of ampliative reasoning. However, in a more strict usage, inductive reasoning is just one form of ampliative reasoning. In the narrow sense, inductive inferences are forms of statistical generalization. They are usually based on many individual observations that all show a certain pattern. These observations are then used to form a conclusion either about a yet unobserved entity or about a general law. For abductive inferences, the premises support the conclusion because the conclusion is the best explanation of why the premises are true.\nThe support ampliative arguments provide for their conclusion comes in degrees: some ampliative arguments are stronger than others. This is often explained in terms of probability: the premises make it more likely that the conclusion is true. Strong ampliative arguments make their conclusion very likely, but not absolutely certain. An example of ampliative reasoning is the inference from the premise \"every raven in a random sample of 3200 ravens is black\" to the conclusion \"all ravens are black\": the extensive random sample makes the conclusion very likely, but it does not exclude that there are rare exceptions. In this sense, ampliative reasoning is defeasible: it may become necessary to retract an earlier conclusion upon receiving new related information. Ampliative reasoning is very common in everyday discourse and the sciences.\nAn important drawback of deductive reasoning is that it does not lead to genuinely new information. This means that the conclusion only repeats information already found in the premises. Ampliative reasoning, on the other hand, goes beyond the premises by arriving at genuinely new information. One difficulty for this characterization is that it makes deductive reasoning appear useless: if deduction is uninformative, it is not clear why people would engage in it and study it. It has been suggested that this problem can be solved by distinguishing between surface and depth information. On this view, deductive reasoning is uninformative on the depth level, in contrast to ampliative reasoning. But it may still be valuable on the surface level by presenting the information in the premises in a new and sometimes surprising way.\nA popular misconception of the relation between deduction and induction identifies their difference on the level of particular and general claims. On this view, deductive inferences start from general premises and draw particular conclusions, while inductive inferences start from particular premises and draw general conclusions. This idea is often motivated by seeing deduction and induction as two inverse processes that complement each other: deduction is \"top-down\" while induction is \"bottom-up\". But this is a misconception that does not reflect how valid deduction is defined in the field of logic: a deduction is valid if it is impossible for its premises to be true while its conclusion is false, independent of whether the premises or the conclusion are particular or general. Because of this, some deductive inferences have a general conclusion and some also have particular premises.\nIn various fields.\nCognitive psychology.\nCognitive psychology studies the psychological processes responsible for deductive reasoning. It is concerned, among other things, with how good people are at drawing valid deductive inferences. This includes the study of the factors affecting their performance, their tendency to commit fallacies, and the underlying biases involved. A notable finding in this field is that the type of deductive inference has a significant impact on whether the correct conclusion is drawn. In a meta-analysis of 65 studies, for example, 97% of the subjects evaluated modus ponens inferences correctly, while the success rate for modus tollens was only 72%. On the other hand, even some fallacies like affirming the consequent or denying the antecedent were regarded as valid arguments by the majority of the subjects. An important factor for these mistakes is whether the conclusion seems initially plausible: the more believable the conclusion is, the higher the chance that a subject will mistake a fallacy for a valid argument.\nAn important bias is the \"matching bias\", which is often illustrated using the Wason selection task. In an often-cited experiment by Peter Wason, four cards are presented to the participant. In one case, the visible sides show the symbols D, K, 5, and 7 on the different cards. The participant is told that every card has a letter on one side and a number on the other side, and that \"[e]very card which has a D on one side has a 5 on the other side\". Their task is to identify which cards need to be turned around in order to confirm or refute this conditional claim. The correct answer, only given by about 10%, is the cards D and 7. Many select card 5 instead, even though the conditional claim does not involve any requirements on what symbols can be found on the opposite side of card 5. But this result can be drastically changed if different symbols are used: the visible sides show \"drinking a beer\", \"drinking a coke\", \"16 years of age\", and \"22 years of age\" and the participants are asked to evaluate the claim \"[i]f a person is drinking beer, then the person must be over 19 years of age\". In this case, 74% of the participants identified correctly that the cards \"drinking a beer\" and \"16 years of age\" have to be turned around. These findings suggest that the deductive reasoning ability is heavily influenced by the content of the involved claims and not just by the abstract logical form of the task: the more realistic and concrete the cases are, the better the subjects tend to perform.\nAnother bias is called the \"negative conclusion bias\", which happens when one of the premises has the form of a negative material conditional, as in \"If the card does not have an A on the left, then it has a 3 on the right. The card does not have a 3 on the right. Therefore, the card has an A on the left\". The increased tendency to misjudge the validity of this type of argument is not present for positive material conditionals, as in \"If the card has an A on the left, then it has a 3 on the right. The card does not have a 3 on the right. Therefore, the card does not have an A on the left\".\nPsychological theories of deductive reasoning.\nVarious psychological theories of deductive reasoning have been proposed. These theories aim to explain how deductive reasoning works in relation to the underlying psychological processes responsible. They are often used to explain the empirical findings, such as why human reasoners are more susceptible to some types of fallacies than to others.\nAn important distinction is between \"mental logic theories\", sometimes also referred to as \"rule theories\", and \"mental model theories\". \"Mental logic theories\" see deductive reasoning as a language-like process that happens through the manipulation of representations. This is done by applying syntactic rules of inference in a way very similar to how systems of natural deduction transform their premises to arrive at a conclusion. On this view, some deductions are simpler than others since they involve fewer inferential steps. This idea can be used, for example, to explain why humans have more difficulties with some deductions, like the modus tollens, than with others, like the modus ponens: because the more error-prone forms do not have a native rule of inference but need to be calculated by combining several inferential steps with other rules of inference. In such cases, the additional cognitive labor makes the inferences more open to error.\n\"Mental model theories\", on the other hand, hold that deductive reasoning involves models or mental representations of possible states of the world without the medium of language or rules of inference. In order to assess whether a deductive inference is valid, the reasoner mentally constructs models that are compatible with the premises of the inference. The conclusion is then tested by looking at these models and trying to find a counterexample in which the conclusion is false. The inference is valid if no such counterexample can be found. In order to reduce cognitive labor, only such models are represented in which the premises are true. Because of this, the evaluation of some forms of inference only requires the construction of very few models while for others, many different models are necessary. In the latter case, the additional cognitive labor required makes deductive reasoning more error-prone, thereby explaining the increased rate of error observed. This theory can also explain why some errors depend on the content rather than the form of the argument. For example, when the conclusion of an argument is very plausible, the subjects may lack the motivation to search for counterexamples among the constructed models.\nBoth mental logic theories and mental model theories assume that there is one general-purpose reasoning mechanism that applies to all forms of deductive reasoning. But there are also alternative accounts that posit various different special-purpose reasoning mechanisms for different contents and contexts. In this sense, it has been claimed that humans possess a special mechanism for permissions and obligations, specifically for detecting cheating in social exchanges. This can be used to explain why humans are often more successful in drawing valid inferences if the contents involve human behavior in relation to social norms. Another example is the so-called dual-process theory. This theory posits that there are two distinct cognitive systems responsible for reasoning. Their interrelation can be used to explain commonly observed biases in deductive reasoning. System 1 is the older system in terms of evolution. It is based on associative learning and happens fast and automatically without demanding many cognitive resources. System 2, on the other hand, is of more recent evolutionary origin. It is slow and cognitively demanding, but also more flexible and under deliberate control. The dual-process theory posits that system 1 is the default system guiding most of our everyday reasoning in a pragmatic way. But for particularly difficult problems on the logical level, system 2 is employed. System 2 is mostly responsible for deductive reasoning.\nIntelligence.\nThe ability of deductive reasoning is an important aspect of intelligence and many tests of intelligence include problems that call for deductive inferences. Because of this relation to intelligence, deduction is highly relevant to psychology and the cognitive sciences. But the subject of deductive reasoning is also pertinent to the computer sciences, for example, in the creation of artificial intelligence.\nEpistemology.\nDeductive reasoning plays an important role in epistemology. Epistemology is concerned with the question of justification, i.e. to point out which beliefs are justified and why. Deductive inferences are able to transfer the justification of the premises onto the conclusion. So while logic is interested in the truth-preserving nature of deduction, epistemology is interested in the justification-preserving nature of deduction. There are different theories trying to explain why deductive reasoning is justification-preserving. According to reliabilism, this is the case because deductions are truth-preserving: they are reliable processes that ensure a true conclusion given the premises are true. Some theorists hold that the thinker has to have explicit awareness of the truth-preserving nature of the inference for the justification to be transferred from the premises to the conclusion. One consequence of such a view is that, for young children, this deductive transference does not take place since they lack this specific awareness.\nProbability logic.\nProbability logic is interested in how the probability of the premises of an argument affects the probability of its conclusion. It differs from classical logic, which assumes that propositions are either true or false but does not take into consideration the probability or certainty that a proposition is true or false.\nHistory.\nAristotle, a Greek philosopher, started documenting deductive reasoning in the 4th century BC. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, in his book Discourse on Method, refined the idea for the Scientific Revolution. Developing four rules to follow for proving an idea deductively, Descartes laid the foundation for the deductive portion of the scientific method. Descartes' background in geometry and mathematics influenced his ideas on the truth and reasoning, causing him to develop a system of general reasoning now used for most mathematical reasoning. Similar to postulates, Descartes believed that ideas could be self-evident and that reasoning alone must prove that observations are reliable. These ideas also lay the foundations for the ideas of rationalism.\nRelated concepts and theories.\nDeductivism.\nDeductivism is a philosophical position that gives primacy to deductive reasoning or arguments over their non-deductive counterparts. It is often understood as the evaluative claim that only deductive inferences are \"good\" or \"correct\" inferences. This theory would have wide-reaching consequences for various fields since it implies that the rules of deduction are \"the only acceptable standard of evidence\". This way, the rationality or correctness of the different forms of inductive reasoning is denied. Some forms of deductivism express this in terms of degrees of reasonableness or probability. Inductive inferences are usually seen as providing a certain degree of support for their conclusion: they make it more likely that their conclusion is true. Deductivism states that such inferences are not rational: the premises either ensure their conclusion, as in deductive reasoning, or they do not provide any support at all.\nOne motivation for deductivism is the problem of induction introduced by David Hume. It consists in the challenge of explaining how or whether inductive inferences based on past experiences support conclusions about future events. For example, a chicken comes to expect, based on all its past experiences, that the person entering its coop is going to feed it, until one day the person \"at last wrings its neck instead\". According to Karl Popper's falsificationism, deductive reasoning alone is sufficient. This is due to its truth-preserving nature: a theory can be falsified if one of its deductive consequences is false. So while inductive reasoning does not offer positive evidence for a theory, the theory still remains a viable competitor until falsified by empirical observation. In this sense, deduction alone is sufficient for discriminating between competing hypotheses about what is the case. Hypothetico-deductivism is a closely related scientific method, according to which science progresses by formulating hypotheses and then aims to falsify them by trying to make observations that run counter to their deductive consequences.\nNatural deduction.\nThe term \"natural deduction\" refers to a class of proof systems based on self-evident rules of inference. The first systems of natural deduction were developed by Gerhard Gentzen and Stanislaw Jaskowski in the 1930s. The core motivation was to give a simple presentation of deductive reasoning that closely mirrors how reasoning actually takes place. In this sense, natural deduction stands in contrast to other less intuitive proof systems, such as Hilbert-style deductive systems, which employ axiom schemes to express logical truths. Natural deduction, on the other hand, avoids axioms schemes by including many different rules of inference that can be used to formulate proofs. These rules of inference express how logical constants behave. They are often divided into introduction rules and elimination rules. Introduction rules specify under which conditions a logical constant may be introduced into a new sentence of the proof. For example, the introduction rule for the logical constant \"formula_21\" (and) is \"formula_22\". It expresses that, given the premises \"formula_23\" and \"formula_24\" individually, one may draw the conclusion \"formula_25\" and thereby include it in one's proof. This way, the symbol \"formula_21\" is introduced into the proof. The removal of this symbol is governed by other rules of inference, such as the elimination rule \"formula_27\", which states that one may deduce the sentence \"formula_23\" from the premise \"formula_29\". Similar introduction and elimination rules are given for other logical constants, such as the propositional operator \"formula_30\", the propositional connectives \"formula_31\" and \"formula_32\", and the quantifiers \"formula_33\" and \"formula_34\".\nThe focus on rules of inferences instead of axiom schemes is an important feature of natural deduction. But there is no general agreement on how natural deduction is to be defined. Some theorists hold that all proof systems with this feature are forms of natural deduction. This would include various forms of sequent calculi or tableau calculi. But other theorists use the term in a more narrow sense, for example, to refer to the proof systems developed by Gentzen and Jaskowski. Because of its simplicity, natural deduction is often used for teaching logic to students.\nGeometrical method.\nThe geometrical method is a method of philosophy based on deductive reasoning. It starts from a small set of self-evident axioms and tries to build a comprehensive logical system based only on deductive inferences from these first axioms. It was initially formulated by Baruch Spinoza and came to prominence in various rationalist philosophical systems in the modern era. It gets its name from the forms of mathematical demonstration found in traditional geometry, which are usually based on axioms, definitions, and inferred theorems. An important motivation of the geometrical method is to repudiate philosophical skepticism by grounding one's philosophical system on absolutely certain axioms. Deductive reasoning is central to this endeavor because of its necessarily truth-preserving nature. This way, the certainty initially invested only in the axioms is transferred to all parts of the philosophical system.\nOne recurrent criticism of philosophical systems build using the geometrical method is that their initial axioms are not as self-evident or certain as their defenders proclaim. This problem lies beyond the deductive reasoning itself, which only ensures that the conclusion is true if the premises are true, but not that the premises themselves are true. For example, Spinoza's philosophical system has been criticized this way based on objections raised against the causal axiom, i.e. that \"the knowledge of an effect depends on and involves knowledge of its cause\". A different criticism targets not the premises but the reasoning itself, which may at times implicitly assume premises that are themselves not self-evident.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tomasz Arciszewski, the Polish prime minister in-exile, supported the annexation of German territory but opposed the idea of expulsion, wanting instead to naturalize the Germans as Polish citizens and to assimilate them. Joseph Stalin, in concert with other Communist leaders, planned to expel all ethnic Germans from east of the Oder and from lands which from May 1945 fell inside the Soviet occupation zones. In 1941, his government had already transported Germans from Crimea to Central Asia.\nBetween 1944 and 1948, millions of people, including ethnic Germans () and German citizens (), were permanently or temporarily moved from Central and Eastern Europe. By 1950, about 12 million Germans had fled or been expelled from east-central Europe into Allied-occupied Germany and Austria. The West German government put the total at 14.6\u00a0million, including a million ethnic Germans who had settled in territories conquered by Nazi Germany during World War II, ethnic German migrants to Germany after 1950, and the children born to expelled parents. The largest numbers came from former eastern territories of Germany ceded to the Polish People's Republic and Soviet Union (about seven million), and from Czechoslovakia (about three million).\nThe areas affected included the former eastern territories of Germany, which were annexed by Poland, as well as the Soviet Union after the war and Germans who were living within the borders of the pre-war Second Polish Republic, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Baltic states. The death toll attributable to the flight and expulsions is disputed, with estimates ranging from 500,000 up to 2.5\u00a0million according to the German government.\nThe removals occurred in three overlapping phases, the first of which was the organized evacuation of ethnic Germans by the Nazi state in the face of the advancing Red Army from mid-1944 to early 1945. The second phase was the disorganised flight of ethnic Germans immediately following the 's surrender. The third phase was a more organised expulsion following the Allied leaders' Potsdam Agreement, which redefined the Central European borders and approved expulsions of ethnic Germans from the former German territories transferred to Poland, Russia, and Czechoslovakia. Many German civilians were sent to internment and labour camps where they were used as forced labour as part of German reparations to countries in Eastern Europe. The major expulsions were completed in 1950. Estimates for the total number of people of German ancestry still living in Central and Eastern Europe in 1950 ranged from 700,000 to 2.7\u00a0million.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nBefore World War II, East-Central Europe generally lacked clearly delineated ethnic settlement areas. There were some ethnic-majority areas, but there were also vast mixed areas and abundant smaller pockets settled by various ethnicities. Within these areas of diversity, including the major cities of Central and Eastern Europe, people in various ethnic groups had interacted every day for centuries, while not always harmoniously, on every civic and economic level.\nWith the rise of nationalism in the 19th century, the ethnicity of citizens became an issue in territorial claims, the self-perception/identity of states, and claims of ethnic superiority. The German Empire introduced the idea of ethnicity-based settlement in an attempt to ensure its territorial integrity. It was also the first modern European state to propose population transfers as a means of solving \"nationality conflicts\", intending the removal of Poles and Jews from the projected post\u2013World War I \"Polish Border Strip\" and its resettlement with Christian ethnic Germans.\nFollowing the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Russian Empire, and the German Empire at the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles pronounced the formation of several independent states in Central and Eastern Europe, in territories previously controlled by these imperial powers. None of the new states were ethnically homogeneous. After 1919, many ethnic Germans emigrated from the former imperial lands back to the Weimar Republic and the First Austrian Republic after losing their privileged status in those foreign lands, where they had maintained minority communities. In 1919 ethnic Germans became national minorities in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania. In the following years, the Nazi ideology encouraged them to demand local autonomy. In Germany during the 1930s, Nazi propaganda claimed that Germans elsewhere were subject to persecution. Nazi supporters throughout eastern Europe (Czechoslovakia's Konrad Henlein, Poland's Deutscher Volksverband and Jungdeutsche Partei, Hungary's \"Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn\") formed local Nazi political parties sponsored financially by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, e.g. by the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle. However, by 1939 more than half of Polish Germans lived outside of the formerly German territories of Poland due to improving economic opportunities.\nPopulation movements.\nNotes:\nDuring the Nazi German occupation, many citizens of German descent in Poland registered with the Deutsche Volksliste. Some were given important positions in the hierarchy of the Nazi administration, and some participated in Nazi atrocities, causing resentment towards German speakers in general. These facts were later used by the Allied politicians as one of the justifications for the expulsion of the Germans. The contemporary position of the German government is that, while the Nazi-era war crimes resulted in the expulsion of the Germans, the deaths due to the expulsions were an injustice.\nDuring the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, especially after the reprisals for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, most of the Czech resistance groups demanded that the \"German problem\" be solved by transfer/expulsion. These demands were adopted by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, which sought the support of the Allies for this proposal, beginning in 1943. The final agreement for the transfer of the Germans was not reached until the Potsdam Conference.\nThe expulsion policy was part of a geopolitical and ethnic reconfiguration of postwar Europe. In part, it was retribution for Nazi Germany's initiation of the war and subsequent atrocities and ethnic cleansing in Nazi-occupied Europe. Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and Joseph Stalin of the USSR, had agreed in principle before the end of the war that the border of Poland's territory would be moved west (though how far was not specified) and that the remaining ethnic German population were subject to expulsion. They assured the leaders of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia, both occupied by Nazi Germany, of their support on this issue.\nReasons and justifications for the expulsions.\nGiven the complex history of the affected regions and the divergent interests of the victorious Allied powers, it is difficult to ascribe a definitive set of motives to the expulsions. The respective paragraph of the Potsdam Agreement only states vaguely: \"The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, will have to be undertaken. They agreed that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner.\" The major motivations revealed were:\nEthnically homogeneous nation-state.\nThe creation of ethnically homogeneous nation states in Central and Eastern Europe was presented as the key reason for the official decisions of the Potsdam and previous Allied conferences as well as the resulting expulsions. The principle of every nation inhabiting its own nation state gave rise to a series of expulsions and resettlements of Germans, Poles, Ukrainians and others who after the war found themselves outside their supposed home states. The 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey lent legitimacy to the concept. Churchill cited the operation as a success in a speech discussing the German expulsions.\nIn view of the desire for ethnically homogeneous nation-states, it did not make sense to draw borders through regions that were already inhabited homogeneously by Germans without any minorities. As early as 9 September 1944, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Polish communist Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski of the Polish Committee of National Liberation signed a treaty in Lublin on population exchanges of Ukrainians and Poles living on the \"wrong\" side of the Curzon Line. Many of the 2.1\u00a0million Poles expelled from the Soviet-annexed Kresy, so-called 'repatriants', were resettled to former German territories, then dubbed 'Recovered Territories'. Czech Edvard Bene\u0161, in his decree of 19 May 1945, termed ethnic Hungarians and Germans \"unreliable for the state\", clearing a way for confiscations and expulsions.\nView of German minorities as potential fifth columns.\nDistrust and enmity.\nOne of the reasons given for the population transfer of Germans from the former eastern territories of Germany was the claim that these areas had been a stronghold of the Nazi movement. Neither Stalin nor the other influential advocates of this argument required that expellees be checked for their political attitudes or their activities. Even in the few cases when this happened and expellees were proven to have been bystanders, opponents or even victims of the Nazi regime, they were rarely spared from expulsion. Polish Communist propaganda used and manipulated hatred of the Nazis to intensify the expulsions.\nWith German communities living within the pre-war borders of Poland, there was an expressed fear of disloyalty of Germans in Eastern Upper Silesia and Pomerelia, based on wartime Nazi activities. Created on order of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi ethnic German organisation called Selbstschutz carried out executions during \"Intelligenzaktion\" alongside operational groups of German military and police, in addition to such activities as identifying Poles for execution and illegally detaining them.\nTo Poles, expulsion of Germans was seen as an effort to avoid such events in the future. As a result, Polish exile authorities proposed a population transfer of Germans as early as 1941. The Czechoslovak government-in-exile worked with the Polish government-in-exile towards this end during the war.\nPreventing ethnic violence.\nThe participants at the Potsdam Conference asserted that expulsions were the only way to prevent ethnic violence. As Winston Churchill expounded in the House of Commons in 1944, \"Expulsion is the method which, insofar as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting. There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble... A clean sweep will be made. I am not alarmed by the prospect of disentanglement of populations, not even of these large transferences, which are more possible in modern conditions than they have ever been before\".\nPolish resistance fighter, statesman and courier Jan Karski warned President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943 of the possibility of Polish reprisals, describing them as \"unavoidable\" and \"an encouragement for all the Germans in Poland to go west, to Germany proper, where they belong.\"\nPunishment for Nazi crimes.\nThe expulsions were also driven by a desire for retribution, given the brutal way German occupiers treated non-German civilians in the German-occupied territories during the war. Thus, the expulsions were at least partly motivated by the animus engendered by the war crimes and atrocities perpetrated by the German belligerents and their proxies and supporters. Czechoslovak President Edvard Bene\u0161, in the National Congress, justified the expulsions on 28 October 1945 by stating that the majority of Germans had acted in full support of Hitler; during a ceremony in remembrance of the Lidice massacre, he blamed all Germans as responsible for the actions of the German state. In Poland and Czechoslovakia, newspapers, leaflets and politicians across the political spectrum, which narrowed during the post-war Communist take-over, asked for retribution for wartime German activities. Responsibility of the German population for the crimes committed in its name was also asserted by commanders of the late and post-war Polish military.\nKarol \u015awierczewski, commander of the Second Polish Army, briefed his soldiers to \"exact on the Germans what they enacted on us, so they will flee on their own and thank God they saved their lives.\"\nIn Poland, which had suffered the loss of six million citizens, including its elite and almost its entire Jewish population due to Lebensraum and the Holocaust, most Germans were seen as Nazi-perpetrators who could now finally be collectively punished for their past deeds.\nSoviet political considerations.\nStalin, who had earlier directed several population transfers in the Soviet Union, strongly supported the expulsions, which worked to the Soviet Union's advantage in several ways. The satellite states would now feel the need to be protected by the Soviets from German anger over the expulsions. The assets left by expellees in Poland and Czechoslovakia were successfully used to reward cooperation with the new governments, and support for the Communists was especially strong in areas that had seen significant expulsions. Settlers in these territories welcomed the opportunities presented by their fertile soils and vacated homes and enterprises, increasing their loyalty.\nMovements in the later stages of the war.\nEvacuation and flight to areas within Germany.\nLate in the war, as the Red Army advanced westward, many Germans were apprehensive about the impending Soviet occupation. Most were aware of the Soviet reprisals against German civilians. Soviet soldiers committed numerous rapes and other crimes. News of atrocities such as the Nemmersdorf massacre were exaggerated and disseminated by the Nazi propaganda machine.\nPlans to evacuate the ethnic German population westward into Germany, from Poland and the eastern territories of Germany, were prepared by various Nazi authorities toward the end of the war. In most cases, implementation was delayed until Soviet and Allied forces had defeated the German forces and advanced into the areas to be evacuated. The abandonment of millions of ethnic Germans in these vulnerable areas until combat conditions overwhelmed them can be attributed directly to the measures taken by the Nazis against anyone suspected of 'defeatist' attitudes (as evacuation was considered) and the fanaticism of many Nazi functionaries in their execution of Hitler's 'no retreat' orders.\nThe first exodus of German civilians from the eastern territories was composed of both spontaneous flight and organized evacuation, starting in mid-1944 and continuing until early 1945. Conditions turned chaotic during the winter when kilometers-long queues of refugees pushed their carts through the snow trying to stay ahead of the advancing Red Army.\nRefugee treks which came within reach of the advancing Soviets suffered casualties when targeted by low-flying aircraft, and some people were crushed by tanks. The German Federal Archive has estimated that 100\u2013120,000 civilians (1% of the total population) were killed during the flight and evacuations. Polish historians and maintain that civilian deaths in the flight and evacuation were \"between 600,000 and 1.2\u00a0million. The main causes of death were cold, stress, and bombing.\" The mobilized Strength Through Joy liner \"Wilhelm Gustloff\" was sunk in January 1945 by Soviet Navy submarine S-13, killing about 9,000 civilians and military personnel escaping East Prussia in the largest loss of life in a single ship sinking in history. Many refugees tried to return home when the fighting ended. Before 1 June 1945, 400,000 people crossed back over the Oder and Neisse rivers eastward, before Soviet and Polish communist authorities closed the river crossings; another 800,000 entered Silesia through Czechoslovakia.\nIn accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, at the end of 1945\u2014wrote Hahn &amp; Hahn\u20144.5\u00a0million Germans who had fled or been expelled were under the control of the Allied governments. From 1946 to 1950 around 4.5\u00a0million people were brought to Germany in organized mass transports from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. An additional 2.6\u00a0million released POWs were listed as expellees.\nEvacuation and flight to Denmark.\nFrom the Baltic coast, many soldiers and civilians were evacuated by ship in the course of Operation Hannibal.\nBetween 23 January and 5 May 1945, up to 250,000 Germans, primarily from East Prussia, Pomerania, and the Baltic states, were evacuated to Nazi-occupied Denmark, based on an order issued by Hitler on 4 February 1945. When the war ended, the German refugee population in Denmark amounted to 5% of the total Danish population. The evacuation focused on women, the elderly and children\u2014a third of whom were under the age of fifteen.\nAfter the war, the Germans were interned in several hundred refugee camps throughout Denmark, the largest of which was the Oksb\u00f8l Refugee Camp with 37,000 inmates. The camps were guarded by Danish Defence units. The situation eased after 60 Danish clergymen spoke in defence of the refugees in an open letter, and Social Democrat Johannes Kj\u00e6rb\u00f8l took over the administration of the refugees on 6 September 1945. On 9 May 1945, the Red Army occupied the island of Bornholm; between 9 May and 1 June 1945, the Soviets shipped 3,000 refugees and 17,000 Wehrmacht soldiers from there to Kolberg. In 1945, 13,492 German refugees died, among them 7,000 children under five years of age.\nAccording to Danish physician and historian Kirsten Lylloff, these deaths were partially due to denial of medical care by Danish medical staff, as both the Danish Association of Doctors and the Danish Red Cross began refusing medical treatment to German refugees starting in March 1945. The last refugees left Denmark on 15 February 1949. In the Treaty of London, signed 26 February 1953, West Germany and Denmark agreed on compensation payments of 160\u00a0million Danish kroner for its extended care of the refugees, which West Germany paid between 1953 and 1958.\nFollowing Germany's defeat.\nThe Second World War ended in Europe with Germany's defeat in May 1945. By this time, all of Eastern and much of Central Europe was under Soviet occupation. This included most of the historical German settlement areas, as well as the Soviet occupation zone in eastern Germany.\nThe Allies settled on the terms of occupation, the territorial truncation of Germany, and the expulsion of ethnic Germans from post-war Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to the Allied Occupation Zones in the Potsdam Agreement, drafted during the Potsdam Conference between 17 July and 2 August 1945. Article XII of the agreement is concerned with the expulsions to post-war Germany and reads:\nThe Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, will have to be undertaken. They agree that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner.\nThe agreement further called for equal distribution of the transferred Germans for resettlement among American, British, French and Soviet occupation zones comprising post\u2013World War II Germany.\nExpulsions that took place before the Allies agreed on the terms at Potsdam are referred to as \"irregular\" expulsions (\"Wilde Vertreibungen\"). They were conducted by military and civilian authorities in Soviet-occupied post-war Poland and Czechoslovakia in the first half of 1945.\nIn Yugoslavia, the remaining Germans were not expelled; ethnic German villages were turned into internment camps where over 50,000 perished from deliberate starvation and direct murders by Yugoslav guards.\nIn late 1945 the Allies requested a temporary halt to the expulsions, due to the refugee problems created by the expulsion of Germans. While expulsions from Czechoslovakia were temporarily slowed, this was not true in Poland and the former eastern territories of Germany. Sir Geoffrey Harrison, one of the drafters of the cited Potsdam article, stated that the \"purpose of this article was not to encourage or legalize the expulsions, but rather to provide a basis for approaching the expelling states and requesting them to co-ordinate transfers with the Occupying Powers in Germany.\"\nAfter Potsdam, a series of expulsions of ethnic Germans occurred throughout the Soviet-controlled Eastern European countries. Property and materiel in the affected territory that had belonged to Germany or to Germans was confiscated; it was either transferred to the Soviet Union, nationalised, or redistributed among the citizens. Of the many post-war forced migrations, the largest was the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, primarily from the territory of 1937 Czechoslovakia (which included the historically German-speaking area in the Sudeten mountains along the German-Czech-Polish border (Sudetenland)), and the territory that became post-war Poland. Poland's post-war borders were moved west to the Oder-Neisse line, deep into former German territory and within 80 kilometers of Berlin.\nPolish refugees expelled from the Soviet Union were resettled in the former German territories that were awarded to Poland after the war. During and after the war, 2,208,000 Poles fled or were expelled from the former eastern Polish regions that were merged to the USSR after the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland; 1,652,000 of these refugees were resettled in the former German territories.\nCzechoslovakia.\nThe final agreement for the transfer of the Germans was reached at the Potsdam Conference.\nAccording to the West German Schieder commission, there were 4.5\u00a0million German civilians present in Bohemia-Moravia in May 1945, including 100,000 from Slovakia and 1.6\u00a0million refugees from Poland.\nBetween 700,000 and 800,000 Germans were affected by irregular expulsions between May and August 1945. The expulsions were encouraged by Czechoslovak politicians and were generally executed by order of local authorities, mostly by groups of armed volunteers and the army.\nTransfers of population under the Potsdam agreements lasted from January until October 1946. 1.9\u00a0million ethnic Germans were expelled to the American zone, part of what would become West Germany. More than 1\u00a0million were expelled to the Soviet zone, which later became East Germany.\nAbout 250,000 ethnic Germans were allowed to remain in Czechoslovakia. According to the West German Schieder commission 250,000 persons who had declared German nationality in the 1939 Nazi census remained in Czechoslovakia; however the Czechs counted 165,790 Germans remaining in December 1955.\nMale Germans with Czech wives were expelled, often with their spouses, while ethnic German women with Czech husbands were allowed to stay. According to the Schieder commission, Sudeten Germans considered essential to the economy were held as forced labourers.\nThe West German government estimated the expulsion death toll at 273,000 civilians, and this figure is cited in historical literature. However, in 1995, research by a joint German and Czech commission of historians found that the previous demographic estimates of 220,000 to 270,000 deaths to be overstated and based on faulty information. They concluded that the death toll was between 15,000 and 30,000 dead, assuming that not all deaths were reported.\nThe German Red Cross Search Service (\"Suchdienst\") confirmed the deaths of 18,889 people during the expulsions from Czechoslovakia. (Violent deaths 5,556; Suicides 3,411; Deported 705; In camps 6,615; During the wartime flight 629; After wartime flight 1,481; Cause undetermined 379; Other misc. 73.)\nHungary.\nIn contrast to expulsions from other nations or states, the expulsion of the Germans from Hungary was dictated from outside Hungary. It began on 22 December 1944 when the Soviet Red Army Commander-in-Chief ordered the expulsions. In February 1945 the Soviet-dominated Allied Control Commission ordered the Hungarian Ministry of Interior to compile lists of all ethnic Germans living in the country. Initially the Census Bureau refused to divulge information on Hungarians who had registered as Volksdeutsche, but acceded under pressure from the Hungarian State Protection Authority. Three percent of the German pre-war population (about 20,000 people) had been evacuated by the Volksbund before that. They went to Austria, but many had returned. Overall, 60,000 ethnic Germans had fled.\nAccording to the West German Schieder commission report of 1956, in early 1945 between 30 and 35,000 ethnic German civilians and 30,000 military POW were arrested and transported from Hungary to the Soviet Union as forced labourers. In some villages, the entire adult population was taken to labor camps in the Donbas. 6,000 died there as a result of hardships and ill-treatment.\nData from the Russian archives, which were based on an actual enumeration, put the number of ethnic Germans registered by the Soviets in Hungary at 50,292 civilians, of whom 31,923 were deported to the USSR for reparation labor implementing Order 7161. 9% (2,819) were documented as having died.\nIn 1945, official Hungarian figures showed 477,000 German speakers in Hungary, including German-speaking Jews, 303,000 of whom had declared German nationality. Of the German nationals, 33% were children younger than 12 or elderly people over 60; 51% were women. On 29 December 1945, the postwar Hungarian Government, obeying the directions of the Potsdam Conference agreements, ordered the expulsion of anyone identified as German in the 1941 census, or who had been a member of the Volksbund, the SS, or any other armed German organisation. Accordingly, mass expulsions began. The rural population was affected more than the urban population or those ethnic Germans determined to have needed skills, such as miners. Germans married to Hungarians were not expelled, regardless of sex. The first 5,788 expellees departed from Wudersch on 19 January 1946.\nAbout 180,000 German-speaking Hungarian citizens were stripped of their citizenship and possessions, and expelled to the Western zones of Germany. By July 1948, 35,000 others had been expelled to the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. Most of the expellees found new homes in the south-west German province of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but many others settled in Bavaria and Hesse. Other research indicates that, between 1945 and 1950, 150,000 were expelled to western Germany, 103,000 to Austria, and none to eastern Germany. During the expulsions, numerous organized protest demonstrations by the Hungarian population took place.\nAcquisition of land for distribution to Hungarian refugees and nationals was one of the main reasons stated by the government for the expulsion of the ethnic Germans from Hungary. The botched organization of the redistribution led to social tensions.\n22,445 people were identified as German in the 1949 census. An order of 15 June 1948 halted the expulsions. A governmental decree of 25 March 1950 declared all expulsion orders void, allowing the expellees to return if they so wished. After the fall of Communism in the early 1990s, German victims of expulsion and Soviet forced labor were rehabilitated. Post-Communist laws allowed expellees to be compensated, to return, and to buy property. There were reportedly no tensions between Germany and Hungary regarding expellees.\nIn 1958, the West German government estimated, based on a demographic analysis, that by 1950, 270,000 Germans remained in Hungary; 60,000 had been assimilated into the Hungarian population, and there were 57,000 \"unresolved cases\" that remained to be clarified. The editor for the section of the 1958 report for Hungary was , a scholar dealing with Balkan affairs since the 1930s when he was a Nazi Party member. During the war, he was an officer in the SS and was directly implicated in the plundering of cultural artifacts in eastern Europe. After the war, he was chosen to author the sections of the demographic report on the expulsions from Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The figure of 57,000 \"unresolved cases\" in Hungary is included in the figure of 2\u00a0million dead expellees, which is often cited in official German and historical literature.\nNetherlands.\nAfter World War II, the Dutch government decided to expel the German expatriates (25,000) living in the Netherlands. Germans, including those with Dutch spouses and children, were labelled as \"hostile subjects\" (\"vijandelijke onderdanen\").\nThe operation began on 10 September 1946 in Amsterdam, when German expatriates and their families were arrested at their homes in the middle of the night and given one hour to pack of luggage. They were only allowed to take 100 guilders with them. The remainder of their possessions were seized by the state. They were taken to internment camps near the German border, the largest of which was Mari\u00ebnbosch concentration camp, near Nijmegen. About 3,691 Germans (less than 15% of the total number of German expatriates in the Netherlands) were expelled. The Allied forces occupying the Western zone of Germany opposed this operation, fearing that other nations might follow suit.\nPoland, including former German territories.\nThroughout 1944 until May 1945, as the Red Army advanced through Eastern Europe and the provinces of eastern Germany, some German civilians were killed in the fighting. While many had already fled ahead of the advancing Soviet Army, frightened by rumors of Soviet atrocities, which in some cases were exaggerated and exploited by Nazi Germany's propaganda, millions still remained. A 2005 study by the Polish Academy of Sciences estimated that during the final months of the war, 4 to 5\u00a0million German civilians fled with the retreating German forces, and in mid-1945, 4.5 to 4.6\u00a0million Germans remained in the territories under Polish control. By 1950, 3,155,000 had been transported to Germany, 1,043,550 were naturalized as Polish citizens and 170,000 Germans still remained in Poland.\nAccording to the West German Schieder commission of 1953, 5,650,000 Germans remained in what would become Poland's new borders in mid-1945, 3,500,000 had been expelled and 910,000 remained in Poland by 1950. According to the Schieder commission, the civilian death toll was 2\u00a0million; in 1974, the German Federal Archives estimated the death toll at about 400,000. (The controversy regarding the casualty figures is covered below in the section on casualties.)\nDuring the 1945 military campaign, most of the male German population remaining east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line were considered potential combatants and held by Soviet military in detention camps subject to verification by the NKVD. Members of Nazi party organizations and government officials were segregated and sent to the USSR for forced labour as reparations.\nIn mid-1945, the eastern territories of pre-war Germany were turned over to the Soviet-controlled Polish military forces. Early expulsions were undertaken by the Polish Communist military authorities even before the Potsdam Conference placed them under temporary Polish administration pending the final Peace Treaty, in an effort to ensure later territorial integration into an ethnically homogeneous Poland. The Polish Communists wrote: \"We must expel all the Germans because countries are built on national lines and not on multinational ones.\" The Polish government defined Germans as either \"Reichsdeutsche\", people enlisted in first or second \"Volksliste\" groups; or those who held German citizenship. Around 1,165,000 German citizens of Slavic descent were \"verified\" as \"autochthonous\" Poles. Of these, most were not expelled; but many chose to migrate to Germany between 1951 and 1982, including most of the Masurians of East Prussia.\nAt the Potsdam Conference (17 July\u00a0\u2013 2 August 1945), the territory to the east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line was assigned to Polish and Soviet Union administration pending the final peace treaty. All Germans had their property confiscated and were placed under restrictive jurisdiction. The Silesian voivode Aleksander Zawadzki in part had already expropriated the property of the German Silesians on 26 January 1945, another decree of 2 March expropriated that of all Germans east of the Oder and Neisse, and a subsequent decree of 6 May declared all \"abandoned\" property as belonging to the Polish state. Germans were also not permitted to hold Polish currency, the only legal currency since July, other than earnings from work assigned to them. The remaining population faced theft and looting, and also in some instances rape and murder by the criminal elements, crimes that were rarely prevented nor prosecuted by the Polish Militia Forces and newly installed communist judiciary.\nIn mid-1945, 4.5 to 4.6\u00a0million Germans resided in territory east of the Oder\u2013Neisse Line. By early 1946, 550,000 Germans had already been expelled from there, and 932,000 had been verified as having Polish nationality. In the February 1946 census, 2,288,000 people were classified as Germans and subject to expulsion, and 417,400 were subject to verification action, to determine nationality. The negatively verified people, who did not succeed in demonstrating their \"Polish nationality\", were directed for resettlement.\nThose Polish citizens who had collaborated or were believed to have collaborated with the Nazis, were considered \"traitors of the nation\" and sentenced to forced labor prior to being expelled. By 1950, 3,155,000 German civilians had been expelled and 1,043,550 were naturalized as Polish citizens. 170,000 Germans considered \"indispensable\" for the Polish economy were retained until 1956, although almost all had left by 1960. 200,000 Germans in Poland were employed as forced labor in communist-administered camps prior to being expelled from Poland. These included Central Labour Camp Jaworzno, Central Labour Camp Potulice, \u0141ambinowice and Zgoda labour camp. Besides these large camps, numerous other forced labor, punitive and internment camps, urban ghettos and detention centers, sometimes consisting only of a small cellar, were set up.\nThe German Federal Archives estimated in 1974 that more than 200,000 German civilians were interned in Polish camps; they put the death rate at 20\u201350% and estimated that over 60,000 probably died. Polish historians and maintain that the internment:resulted in numerous deaths, which cannot be accurately determined because of lack of statistics or falsification. At certain periods, they could be in the tens of percent of the inmate numbers. Those interned are estimated at 200\u2013250,000 German nationals and the indigenous population and deaths might range from 15,000 to 60,000 persons.\" Note: The indigenous population were former German citizens who declared Polish ethnicity. Historian R. M. Douglas describes a chaotic and lawless regime in the former German territories in the immediate postwar era. The local population was victimized by criminal elements who arbitrarily seized German property for personal gain. Bilingual people who were on the Volksliste during the war were declared Germans by Polish officials who then seized their property for personal gain.\nThe Federal Statistical Office of Germany estimated that in mid-1945, 250,000 Germans remained in the northern part of the former East Prussia, which became the Kaliningrad Oblast. They also estimated that more than 100,000 people surviving the Soviet occupation were evacuated to Germany beginning in 1947.\nGerman civilians were held as \"reparation labor\" by the USSR. Data from the Russian archives, newly published in 2001 and based on an actual enumeration, put the number of German civilians deported from Poland to the USSR in early 1945 for reparation labor at 155,262; 37% (57,586) died in the USSR. The West German Red Cross had estimated in 1964 that 233,000 German civilians were deported to the USSR from Poland as forced laborers and that 45% (105,000) were dead or missing. The West German Red Cross estimated at that time that 110,000 German civilians were held as forced labor in the Kaliningrad Oblast, where 50,000 were dead or missing. The Soviets deported 7,448 Poles of the Armia Krajowa from Poland. Soviet records indicated that 506 Poles died in captivity. Tomasz Kamusella maintains that in early 1945, 165,000 Germans were transported to the Soviet Union. According to Gerhardt Reichling, an official in the German Finance office, 520,000 German civilians from the Oder\u2013Neisse region were conscripted for forced labor by both the USSR and Poland; he maintains that 206,000 perished.\nThe attitudes of surviving Poles varied. Many had suffered brutalities and atrocities by the Germans, surpassed only by the German policies against Jews, during the Nazi occupation. The Germans had recently expelled more than a million Poles from territories they annexed during the war. Some Poles engaged in looting and various crimes, including murders, beatings, and rapes against Germans. On the other hand, in many instances Poles, including some who had been made slave laborers by the Germans during the war, protected Germans, for instance by disguising them as Poles. Moreover, in the Opole (Oppeln) region of Upper Silesia, citizens who claimed Polish ethnicity were allowed to remain, even though some, not all, had uncertain nationality, or identified as ethnic Germans. Their status as a national minority was accepted in 1955, along with state subsidies, with regard to economic assistance and education.\nThe attitude of Soviet soldiers was ambiguous. Many committed atrocities, most notably rape and murder, and did not always distinguish between Poles and Germans, mistreating them equally. Other Soviets were taken aback by the brutal treatment of the German civilians and tried to protect them.\nRichard Overy cites an approximate total of 7.5\u00a0million Germans evacuated, migrated, or expelled from Poland between 1944 and 1950. Tomasz Kamusella cites estimates of 7\u00a0million expelled in total during both the \"wild\" and \"legal\" expulsions from the recovered territories from 1945 to 1948, plus an additional 700,000 from areas of pre-war Poland.\nRomania.\nThe ethnic German population of Romania in 1939 was estimated at 786,000. In 1940, Bessarabia and Bukovina were occupied by the USSR, and the ethnic German population of 130,000 was deported to German-held territory during the Nazi\u2013Soviet population transfers, as well as 80,000 from Romania. 140,000 of these Germans were resettled in German-occupied Poland; in 1945, they were caught up in the flight and expulsion from Poland. Most of the ethnic Germans in Romania resided in Transylvania, the northern part of which was annexed by Hungary during World War II. The pro-German Hungarian government, as well as the pro-German Romanian government of Ion Antonescu, allowed Germany to enlist the German population in Nazi-sponsored organizations. During the war, 54,000 of the male population was conscripted by Nazi Germany, many into the Waffen-SS. In mid-1944, roughly 100,000 Germans fled from Romania with the retreating German forces. According to the West German Schieder commission report of 1957, 75,000 German civilians were deported to the USSR as forced labour and 15% (approximately 10,000) did not return. Data from the Russian archives which were based on an actual enumeration put the number of ethnic Germans registered by the Soviets in Romania at 421,846 civilians, of whom 67,332 were deported to the USSR for reparation labour, where 9% (6,260) died.\nThe roughly 400,000 ethnic Germans who remained in Romania were treated as guilty of collaboration with Nazi Germany and were deprived of their civil liberties and property. Many were impressed into forced labour and deported from their homes to other regions of Romania. In 1948, Romania began a gradual rehabilitation of the ethnic Germans: they were not expelled, and the communist regime gave them the status of a national minority, the only Eastern Bloc country to do so.\nIn 1958, the West German government estimated, based on a demographic analysis, that by 1950, 253,000 were counted as expellees in Germany or the West, 400,000 Germans still remained in Romania, 32,000 had been assimilated into the Romanian population, and that there were 101,000 \"unresolved cases\" that remained to be clarified. The figure of 101,000 \"unresolved cases\" in Romania is included in the total German expulsion dead of 2\u00a0million which is often cited in historical literature. 355,000 Germans remained in Romania in 1977. During the 1980s, many began to leave, with over 160,000 leaving in 1989 alone. By 2002, the number of ethnic Germans in Romania was 60,000.\nSoviet Union and annexed territories.\nThe Baltic, Bessarabian and ethnic Germans in areas that became Soviet-controlled following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 were resettled to Nazi Germany, including annexed areas like Warthegau, during the Nazi-Soviet population exchange. Only a few returned to their former homes when Germany invaded the Soviet Union and temporarily gained control of those areas. These returnees were employed by the Nazi occupation forces to establish a link between the German administration and the local population. Those resettled elsewhere shared the fate of the other Germans in their resettlement area.\nThe ethnic German minority in the USSR was considered a security risk by the Soviet government, and they were deported during the war in order to prevent their possible collaboration with the Nazi invaders. In August 1941 the Soviet government ordered ethnic Germans to be deported from the European USSR, by early 1942, 1,031,300 Germans were interned in \"special settlements\" in Central Asia and Siberia. Life in the special settlements was harsh and severe, food was limited, and the deported population was governed by strict regulations. Shortages of food plagued the whole Soviet Union and especially the special settlements. According to data from the Soviet archives, by October 1945, 687,300 Germans remained alive in the special settlements; an additional 316,600 Soviet Germans served as labour conscripts during World War II. Soviet Germans were not accepted in the regular armed forces but were employed instead as conscript labour. The labor army members were arranged into worker battalions that followed camp-like regulations and received Gulag rations. In 1945 the USSR deported to the special settlements 203,796 Soviet ethnic Germans who had been previously resettled by Germany in Poland. These post-war deportees increased the German population in the special settlements to 1,035,701 by 1949.\nAccording to J. Otto Pohl, 65,599 Germans perished in the special settlements. He believes that an additional 176,352 unaccounted for people \"probably died in the labor army\". Under Stalin, Soviet Germans continued to be confined to the special settlements under strict supervision, in 1955 they were rehabilitated but were not allowed to return to the European USSR. The Soviet-German population grew despite deportations and forced labor during the war; in the 1939 Soviet census the German population was 1.427\u00a0million. By 1959 it had increased to 1.619\u00a0million.\nThe calculations of the West German researcher Gerhard Reichling do not agree to the figures from the Soviet archives. According to Reichling a total of 980,000 Soviet ethnic Germans were deported during the war; he estimated that 310,000 died in forced labour. During the early months of the invasion of the USSR in 1941 the Germans occupied the western regions of the USSR that had German settlements. A total of 370,000 ethnic Germans from the USSR were deported to Poland by Germany during the war. In 1945 the Soviets found 280,000 of these resettlers in Soviet-held territory and returned them to the USSR; 90,000 became refugees in Germany after the war.\nThose ethnic Germans who remained in the 1939 borders of the Soviet Union occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941 remained where they were until 1943, when the Red Army liberated Soviet territory and the Wehrmacht withdrew westward. From January 1943, most of these ethnic Germans moved in treks to the Warthegau or to Silesia, where they were to settle. Between 250,000 and 320,000 had reached Nazi Germany by the end of 1944. On their arrival, they were placed in camps and underwent 'racial evaluation' by the Nazi authorities, who dispersed those deemed 'racially valuable' as farm workers in the annexed provinces, while those deemed to be of \"questionable racial value\" were sent to work in Germany. The Red Army captured these areas in early 1945, and 200,000 Soviet Germans had not yet been evacuated by the Nazi authorities, who were still occupied with their 'racial evaluation'. They were regarded by the USSR as Soviet citizens and repatriated to camps and special settlements in the Soviet Union. 70,000 to 80,000 who found themselves in the Soviet occupation zone after the war were also returned to the USSR, based on an agreement with the Western Allies. The death toll during their capture and transportation was estimated at 15\u201330%, and many families were torn apart. The special \"German settlements\" in the post-war Soviet Union were controlled by the Internal Affairs Commissioner, and the inhabitants had to perform forced labor until the end of 1955. They were released from the special settlements by an amnesty decree of 13 September 1955, and the Nazi collaboration charge was revoked by a decree of 23 August 1964. They were not allowed to return to their former homes and remained in the eastern regions of the USSR, and no individual's former property was restored. Since the 1980s, the Soviet and Russian governments have allowed ethnic Germans to emigrate to Germany.\nDifferent situations emerged in northern East Prussia regarding K\u00f6nigsberg (renamed Kaliningrad) and the adjacent Memel territory around Memel (Klaip\u0117da). The K\u00f6nigsberg area of East Prussia was annexed by the Soviet Union, becoming an exclave of the Russian Soviet Republic. Memel was integrated into the Lithuanian Soviet Republic. Many Germans were evacuated from East Prussia and the Memel territory by Nazi authorities during Operation Hannibal or fled in panic as the Red Army approached. The remaining Germans were conscripted for forced labor. Ethnic Russians and the families of military staff were settled in the area. In June 1946, 114,070 Germans and 41,029 Soviet citizens were registered as living in the Kaliningrad Oblast, with an unknown number of unregistered Germans ignored. Between June 1945 and 1947, roughly half a million Germans were expelled. Between 24 August and 26 October 1948, 21 transports with a total of 42,094 Germans left the Kaliningrad Oblast for the Soviet Occupation Zone. The last remaining Germans were expelled between November 1949 (1,401 people) and January 1950 (7). Thousands of German children, called the \"wolf children\", had been left orphaned and unattended or died with their parents during the harsh winter without food. Between 1945 and 1947, around 600,000 Soviet citizens settled in the oblast.\nYugoslavia.\nBefore World War II, roughly 500,000 German-speaking people (mostly Danube Swabians) lived in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Most fled during the war or emigrated after 1950 thanks to the Displaced Persons Act of 1948; some were able to emigrate to the United States. During the final months of World War II a majority of the ethnic Germans fled Yugoslavia with the retreating Nazi forces.\nAfter the liberation, Yugoslav Partisans exacted revenge on ethnic Germans for the wartime atrocities of Nazi Germany, in which many ethnic Germans had participated, especially in the Banat area of the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. The approximately 200,000 ethnic Germans remaining in Yugoslavia suffered persecution and sustained personal and economic losses. About 7,000 were killed as local populations and partisans took revenge for German wartime atrocities. From 1945 to 1948 ethnic Germans were held in labour camps where about 50,000 perished. Those surviving were allowed to emigrate to Germany after 1948.\nAccording to West German figures in late 1944 the Soviets transported 27,000 to 30,000 ethnic Germans, a majority of whom were women aged 18 to 35, to Ukraine and the Donbas for forced labour; about 20% (5,683) were reported dead or missing. Data from Russian archives published in 2001, based on an actual enumeration, put the number of German civilians deported from Yugoslavia to the USSR in early 1945 for reparation labour at 12,579, where 16% (1,994) died. After March 1945, a second phase began in which ethnic Germans were massed into villages such as Gakowa and Kru\u0161evlje that were converted into labour camps. All furniture was removed, straw placed on the floor, and the expellees housed like animals under military guard, with minimal food and rampant, untreated disease. Families were divided into the unfit women, old, and children, and those fit for slave labour. A total of 166,970 ethnic Germans were interned, and 48,447 (29%) perished. The camp system was shut down in March 1948.\nIn Slovenia, the ethnic German population at the end of World War II was concentrated in Slovenian Styria, more precisely in Maribor, Celje, and a few other smaller towns (like Ptuj and Dravograd), and in the rural area around Apa\u010de on the Austrian border. The second-largest ethnic German community in Slovenia was the predominantly rural Gottschee County around Ko\u010devje in Lower Carniola, south of Ljubljana. Smaller numbers of ethnic Germans also lived in Ljubljana and in some western villages in the Prekmurje region. In 1931, the total number of ethnic Germans in Slovenia was around 28,000: around half of them lived in Styria and in Prekmurje, while the other half lived in the Gottschee County and in Ljubljana. In April 1941, southern Slovenia was occupied by Italian troops. By early 1942, ethnic Germans from Gottschee/Ko\u010devje were forcefully transferred to German-occupied Styria by the new German authorities. Most resettled to the Posavje region (a territory along the Sava river between the towns of Bre\u017eice and Litija), from where around 50,000 Slovenes had been expelled. Gottschee Germans were generally unhappy about their forced transfer from their historical home region. One reason was that the agricultural value of their new area of settlement was perceived as much lower than the Gottschee area. As German forces retreated before the Yugoslav Partisans, most ethnic Germans fled with them in fear of reprisals. By May 1945, only a few Germans remained, mostly in the Styrian towns of Maribor and Celje. The Liberation Front of the Slovenian People expelled most of the remainder after it seized complete control in the region in May 1945.\nThe Yugoslavs set up internment camps at Sterntal and Teharje. The government nationalized their property on a \"decision on the transition of enemy property into state ownership, on state administration over the property of absent people, and on sequestration of property forcibly appropriated by occupation authorities\" of 21 November 1944 by the Presidency of the Anti-Fascist Council for the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia.\nAfter March 1945, ethnic Germans were placed in so-called \"village camps\". Separate camps existed for those able to work and for those who were not. In the latter camps, containing mainly children and the elderly, the mortality rate was about 50%. Most of the children under 14 were then placed in state-run homes, where conditions were better, though the German language was banned. These children were later given to Yugoslav families, and not all German parents seeking to reclaim their children in the 1950s were successful.\nWest German government figures from 1958 put the death toll at 135,800 civilians. A recent study published by the ethnic Germans of Yugoslavia based on an actual enumeration has revised the death toll down to about 58,000. A total of 48,447 people had died in the camps; 7,199 were shot by partisans, and another 1,994 perished in Soviet labour camps. Those Germans still considered Yugoslav citizens were employed in industry or the military, but could buy themselves free of Yugoslav citizenship for the equivalent of three months' salary. By 1950, 150,000 of the Germans from Yugoslavia were classified as \"expelled\" in Germany, another 150,000 in Austria, 10,000 in the United States, and 3,000 in France. According to West German figures 82,000 ethnic Germans remained in Yugoslavia in 1950. After 1950, most emigrated to Germany or were assimilated into the local population.\nKehl, Germany.\nThe population of Kehl (12,000 people), on the east bank of the Rhine opposite Strasbourg, fled and was evacuated in the course of the Liberation of France, on 23 November 1944. The French Army occupied the town in March 1945 and prevented the inhabitants from returning until 1953.\nLatin America.\nFearing a Nazi Fifth Column, between 1941 and 1945 the US government facilitated the expulsion of 4,058 German citizens from 15 Latin American countries to internment camps in Texas and Louisiana. Subsequent investigations showed many of the internees to be harmless, and three-quarters of them were returned to Germany during the war in exchange for citizens of the Americas, while the remainder returned to their homes in Latin America.\nPalestine.\nAt the start of World War II, colonists with German citizenship were rounded up by the British authorities and sent to internment camps in Bethlehem in Galilee. 661 Templers were deported to Australia via Egypt on 31 July 1941, leaving 345 in Palestine. Internment continued in Tatura, Victoria, Australia, until 1946\u201347. In 1962 the State of Israel paid 54\u00a0million Deutsche Marks in compensation to property owners whose assets were nationalized.\nHuman losses.\nEstimates of total deaths of German civilians in the flight and expulsions, including forced labour of Germans in the Soviet Union, range from 500,000 to a maximum of 3\u00a0million people. Although the German government's official estimate of deaths has stood at 2\u00a0million since the 1960s, the publication in 1987\u201389 of previously classified West German studies has led some historians to the conclusion that the actual number was much lower\u2014in the range of 500,000\u2013600,000. English-language sources have put the death toll at 2\u20133\u00a0million based on West German government figures from the 1960s.\nDiscourse.\nThe West German figure of 2\u00a0million deaths in the flight and expulsions was widely accepted by historians in the West prior to the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War. The recent disclosure of the German Federal Archives study and the Search Service figures have caused some scholars in Germany and Poland to question the validity of the figure of 2\u00a0million deaths; they estimate the actual total at 500\u2013600,000.\nThe German government continues to maintain that the figure of 2\u00a0million deaths is correct. The issue of the \"expellees\" has been a contentious one in German politics, with the Federation of Expellees staunchly defending the higher figure.\nAnalysis by R\u00fcdiger Overmans.\nIn 2000 the German historian R\u00fcdiger Overmans published a study of German military casualties; his research project did not investigate civilian expulsion deaths. In 1994, Overmans provided a critical analysis of the previous studies by the German government which he believes are unreliable. Overmans maintains that the studies of expulsion deaths by the German government lack adequate support; he maintains that there are more arguments for the lower figures than for the higher figures. (\"\")\nIn a 2006 interview, Overmans maintained that new research is needed to clarify the fate of those reported as missing. He found the 1965 figures of the Search Service to be unreliable because they include non-Germans; the figures according to Overmans include military deaths; the numbers of surviving people, natural deaths and births after the war in Eastern Europe are unreliable because the Communist governments in Eastern Europe did not extend full cooperation to West German efforts to trace people in Eastern Europe; the reports given by eyewitnesses surveyed are not reliable in all cases. In particular, Overmans maintains that the figure of 1.9\u00a0million missing people was based on incomplete information and is unreliable. Overmans found the 1958 demographic study to be unreliable because it inflated the figures of ethnic German deaths by including missing people of doubtful German ethnic identity who survived the war in Eastern Europe; the figures of military deaths is understated; the numbers of surviving people, natural deaths and births after the war in Eastern Europe are unreliable because the Communist governments in Eastern Europe did not extend full cooperation to West German efforts to trace people in Eastern Europe.\nOvermans maintains that the 600,000 deaths found by the German Federal Archives in 1974 is only a rough estimate of those killed, not a definitive figure. He pointed out that some deaths were not reported because there were no surviving eyewitnesses of the events; also there was no estimate of losses in Hungary, Romania and the USSR.\nOvermans conducted a research project that studied the casualties of the German military during the war and found that the previous estimate of 4.3\u00a0million dead and missing, especially in the final stages of the war, was about one million short of the actual toll. In his study Overmans researched only military deaths; his project did not investigate civilian expulsion deaths; he merely noted the difference between the 2.2\u00a0million dead estimated in the 1958 demographic study, of which 500,000 have so far have been verified. He found that German military deaths from areas in Eastern Europe were about 1.444\u00a0million, and thus 334,000 higher than the 1.1\u00a0million figure in the 1958 demographic study, lacking documents available today included the figures with civilian deaths. Overmans believes this will reduce the number of civilian deaths in the expulsions. Overmans further pointed out that the 2.225\u00a0million number estimated by the 1958 study would imply that the casualty rate among the expellees was equal to or higher than that of the military, which he found implausible.\nAnalysis by historian Ingo Haar.\nIn 2006, Haar called into question the validity of the official government figure of 2\u00a0million expulsion deaths in an article in the German newspaper \"S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\". Since then Haar has published three articles in academic journals that covered the background of the research by the West German government on the expulsions.\nHaar maintains that all reasonable estimates of deaths from expulsions lie between around 500,000 and 600,000, based on the information of Red Cross Search Service and German Federal Archives. Harr pointed out that some members of the Schieder commission and officials of the Statistisches Bundesamt involved in the study of the expulsions were involved in the Nazi plan to colonize Eastern Europe. Haar posits that figures have been inflated in Germany due to the Cold War and domestic German politics, and he maintains that the 2.225\u00a0million number relies on improper statistical methodology and incomplete data, particularly in regard to the expellees who arrived in East Germany. Haar questions the validity of population balances in general. He maintains that 27,000 German Jews who were Nazi victims are included in the West German figures. He rejects the statement by the German government that the figure of 500\u2013600,000 deaths omitted those people who died of disease and hunger, and has stated that this is a \"mistaken interpretation\" of the data. He maintains that deaths due to disease, hunger and other conditions are already included in the lower numbers. According to Haar the numbers were set too high for decades, for postwar political reasons.\nStudies in Poland.\nIn 2001, Polish researcher Bernadetta Nitschke puts total losses for Poland at 400,000 (the same figure as the German Federal Archive study). She noted that historians in Poland have maintained that most of the deaths occurred during the flight and evacuation during the war, the deportations to the USSR for forced labour and, after the resettlement, due to the harsh conditions in the Soviet occupation zone in postwar Germany. Polish demographer Piotr Eberhardt found that, \"Generally speaking, the German estimates... are not only highly arbitrary, but also clearly tendentious in presentation of the German losses.\" He maintains that the German government figures from 1958 overstated the total number of the ethnic Germans living in Poland prior to the war as well as the total civilian deaths due to the expulsions. For example, Eberhardt points out that \"the total number of Germans in Poland is given as equal to 1,371,000. According to the Polish census of 1931, there were altogether only 741,000 Germans in the entire territory of Poland.\"\nStudy by Hans Henning Hahn and Eva Hahn.\nGerman historians Hans Henning Hahn and Eva Hahn published a detailed study of the flight and expulsions that is sharply critical of German accounts of the Cold War era. The Hahns regard the official German figure of 2\u00a0million deaths as an historical myth, lacking foundation. They place the ultimate blame for the mass flight and expulsion on the wartime policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe. The Hahns maintain that most of the reported 473,013 deaths occurred during the Nazi organized flight and evacuation during the war, and the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union; they point out that there are 80,522 confirmed deaths in the postwar internment camps. They put the postwar losses in eastern Europe at a fraction of the total losses: Poland \u221215,000 deaths from 1945 to 1949 in internment camps; Czechoslovakia \u2013 15,000\u201330,000 dead, including 4,000\u20135,000 in internment camps and ca. 15,000 in the Prague uprising; Yugoslavia \u2013 5,777 deliberate killings and 48,027 deaths in internment camps; Denmark \u2013 17,209 dead in internment camps; Hungary and Romania \u2013 no postwar losses reported. The Hahns point out that the official 1958 figure of 273,000 deaths for Czechoslovakia was prepared by Alfred Bohmann, a former Nazi Party member who had served in the wartime SS. Bohmann was a journalist for an ultra-nationalist \"Sudeten-Deutsch\" newspaper in postwar West Germany. The Hahns believe the population figures of ethnic Germans for eastern Europe include German-speaking Jews killed in the Holocaust. They believe that the fate of German-speaking Jews in Eastern Europe deserves the attention of German historians. (\"Deutsche Vertreibungshistoriker haben sich mit der Geschichte der j\u00fcdischen Angeh\u00f6rigen der deutschen Minderheiten kaum besch\u00e4ftigt.\")\nGerman and Czech commission of historians.\nIn 1995, research by a joint German and Czech commission of historians found that the previous demographic estimates of 220,000 to 270,000 deaths in Czechoslovakia to be overstated and based on faulty information. They concluded that the death toll was at least 15,000 people and that it could range up to a maximum of 30,000 dead, assuming that not all deaths were reported.\nRebuttal by the German government.\nThe German government maintains that the figure of 2\u20132.5\u00a0million expulsion deaths is correct. In 2005 the German Red Cross Search Service put the death toll at 2,251,500 but did not provide details for this estimate.\nOn 29 November 2006, State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Christoph Bergner, outlined the stance of the respective governmental institutions on Deutschlandfunk (a public-broadcasting radio station in Germany) saying that the numbers presented by the German government and others are not contradictory to the numbers cited by Haar and that the below 600,000 estimate comprises the deaths directly caused by atrocities during the expulsion measures and thus only includes people who were raped, beaten, or else killed on the spot, while the above two million estimate includes people who on their way to postwar Germany died of epidemics, hunger, cold, air raids and the like.\n\"Schwarzbuch der Vertreibung\" by Heinz Nawratil.\nA German lawyer, Heinz Nawratil, published a study of the expulsions entitled \"Schwarzbuch der Vertreibung\" (\"Black Book of Expulsion\"). Nawratil claimed the death toll was 2.8\u00a0million: he includes the losses of 2.2\u00a0million listed in the 1958 West German study, and an estimated 250,000 deaths of Germans resettled in Poland during the war, plus 350,000 ethnic Germans in the USSR. In 1987, German historian Martin Broszat (former head of the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich) described Nawratil's writings as \"polemics with a nationalist-rightist point of view and exaggerates in an absurd manner the scale of 'expulsion crimes'.\" Broszat found Nawratil's book to have \"factual errors taken out of context.\" German historian Thomas E. Fischer calls the book \"problematic\". James Bjork (Department of History, King's College London) has criticized German educational DVDs based on Nawratil's book.\nCondition of the expellees after arriving in post-war Germany.\nThose who arrived were in bad condition\u00a0\u2013 particularly during the harsh winter of 1945\u201346, when arriving trains carried \"the dead and dying in each carriage (other dead had been thrown from the train along the way)\". After experiencing Red Army atrocities, Germans in the expulsion areas were subject to harsh punitive measures by Yugoslav partisans and in post-war Poland and Czechoslovakia. Beatings, rapes and murders accompanied the expulsions. Some had experienced massacres, such as the \u00dast\u00ed (Aussig) massacre, in which 80\u2013100 ethnic Germans died, or Postoloprty massacre, or conditions like those in the Upper Silesian Camp \u0141ambinowice (Lamsdorf), where interned Germans were exposed to sadistic practices and at least 1,000 died. Many expellees had experienced hunger and disease, separation from family members, loss of civil rights and familiar environment, and sometimes internment and forced labour.\nOnce they arrived, they found themselves in a country devastated by war. Housing shortages lasted until the 1960s, which along with other shortages led to conflicts with the local population. The situation eased only with the West German economic boom in the 1950s that drove unemployment rates close to zero.\nFrance did not participate in the Potsdam Conference, so it felt free to approve some of the Potsdam Agreements and dismiss others. France maintained the position that it had not approved the expulsions and therefore was not responsible for accommodating and nourishing the destitute expellees in its zone of occupation. While the French military government provided for the few refugees who arrived before July 1945 in the area that became the French zone, it succeeded in preventing entrance by later-arriving ethnic Germans deported from the East.\nBritain and the US protested against the actions of the French military government but had no means to force France to bear the consequences of the expulsion policy agreed upon by American, British and Soviet leaders in Potsdam. France persevered with its argument to clearly differentiate between war-related refugees and post-war expellees. In December 1946 it absorbed into its zone German refugees from Denmark, where 250,000 Germans had traveled by sea between February and May 1945 to take refuge from the Soviets. These were refugees from the eastern parts of Germany, not expellees; Danes of German ethnicity remained untouched and Denmark did not expel them. With this humanitarian act the French saved many lives, due to the high death toll German refugees faced in Denmark.\nUntil mid-1945, the Allies had not reached an agreement on how to deal with the expellees. France suggested immigration to South America and Australia and the settlement of 'productive elements' in France, while the Soviets' SMAD suggested a resettlement of millions of expellees in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\nThe Soviets, who encouraged and partly carried out the expulsions, offered little cooperation with humanitarian efforts, thereby requiring the Americans and British to absorb the expellees in their zones of occupation. In contradiction with the Potsdam Agreements, the Soviets neglected their obligation to provide supplies for the expellees. In Potsdam, it was agreed that 15% of all equipment dismantled in the Western zones\u2014especially from the metallurgical, chemical and machine manufacturing industries\u2014would be transferred to the Soviets in return for food, coal, potash (a basic material for fertiliser), timber, clay products, petroleum products, etc. The Western deliveries started in 1946, but this turned out to be a one-way street. The Soviet deliveries\u2014desperately needed to provide the expellees with food, warmth, and basic necessities and to increase agricultural production in the remaining cultivation area\u2014did not materialize. Consequently, the US stopped all deliveries on 3 May 1946, while the expellees from the areas under Soviet rule were deported to the West until the end of 1947.\nIn the British and US zones the supply situation worsened considerably, especially in the British zone. Due to its location on the Baltic, the British zone already harbored a great number of refugees who had come by sea, and the already modest rations had to be further shortened by a third in March 1946. In Hamburg, for instance, the average living space per capita, reduced by air raids from in 1939 to 8.3 in 1945, was further reduced to in 1949 by billeting refugees and expellees. In May 1947, Hamburg trade unions organized a strike against the small rations, with protesters complaining about the rapid absorption of expellees.\nThe US and Britain had to import food into their zones, even as Britain was financially exhausted and dependent on food imports having fought Nazi Germany for the entire war, including as the sole opponent from June 1940 to June 1941 (the period when Poland and France were defeated, the Soviet Union supported Nazi Germany, and the United States had not yet entered the war). Consequently, Britain had to incur additional debt to the US, and the US had to spend more for the survival of its zone, while the Soviets gained applause among Eastern Europeans\u2014many of whom were impoverished by the war and German occupation\u2014who plundered the belongings of expellees, often before they were actually expelled. Since the Soviet Union was the only power among the Allies that allowed and/or encouraged the looting and robbery in the area under its military influence, the perpetrators and profiteers blundered into a situation in which they became dependent on the perpetuation of Soviet rule in their countries to not be dispossessed of the booty and to stay unpunished. With ever more expellees sweeping into post-war Germany, the Allies moved towards a policy of assimilation, which was believed to be the best way to stabilise Germany and ensure peace in Europe by preventing the creation of a marginalised population. This policy led to the granting of German citizenship to the ethnic German expellees who had held citizenship of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, etc. before World War II. This effort was led by the Sonne Commission, a 14-member body consisting of nine Americans and five Germans within the Economic Cooperation Administration which was tasked with devising strategies to solve the refugee crisis.\nWhen the Federal Republic of Germany was founded, a law was drafted on 24 August 1952 that was primarily intended to ease the financial situation of the expellees. The law, termed the \"Lastenausgleichsgesetz,\" granted partial compensation and easy credit to the expellees; the loss of their civilian property had been estimated at 299.6\u00a0billion Deutschmarks (out of a total loss of German property due to the border changes and expulsions of 355.3\u00a0billion Deutschmarks). Administrative organisations were set up to integrate the expellees into post-war German society. While the Stalinist regime in the Soviet occupation zone did not allow the expellees to organise, in the Western zones expellees over time established a variety of organizations, including the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights. The most prominent\u2014still active today\u2014is the Federation of Expellees (\"Bund der Vertriebenen\", or BdV).\n\"War children\" of German ancestry in Western and Northern Europe.\nIn countries occupied by Nazi Germany during the war, sexual relations between Wehrmacht soldiers and local women (including rape and voluntary relationships) resulted in the birth of significant numbers of children. Relationships between German soldiers and local women were particularly common in countries whose population was not dubbed \"inferior\" (\"Untermensch\") by the Nazis. After the Wehrmacht's withdrawal, these women and their children of German descent were often ill-treated.\nLegacy of the expulsions.\nWith at least 12\u00a0million Germans directly involved, possibly 14\u00a0million or more, it was the largest movement or transfer of any single ethnic population in European history and the largest among the post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe (which displaced 20 to 31\u00a0million people in total).\nThe exact number of Germans expelled after the war is still unknown, because most recent research provides a combined estimate which includes those who were evacuated by the German authorities, fled or were killed during the war. It is estimated that between 12 and 14\u00a0million German citizens and foreign ethnic Germans and their descendants were displaced from their homes. The exact number of casualties is still unknown and is difficult to establish due to the chaotic nature of the last months of the war. Census figures placed the total number of ethnic Germans still living in Eastern Europe in 1950, after the major expulsions were complete, at approximately 2.6 million, about 12 percent of the pre-war total.\nThe events have been usually classified as population transfer, or as ethnic cleansing. R.J. Rummel has classified these events as democide, and a few scholars go as far as calling it a genocide. Polish sociologist and philosopher Lech Nijakowski objects to the term \"genocide\" as inaccurate agitprop.\nThe expulsions created major social disruptions in the receiving territories, which were tasked with providing housing and employment for millions of refugees. West Germany established a ministry dedicated to the problem, and several laws created a legal framework. The expellees established several organisations, some demanding compensation. Their grievances, while remaining controversial, were incorporated into public discourse. During 1945 the British press aired concerns over the refugees' situation; this was followed by limited discussion of the issue during the Cold War outside West Germany. East Germany sought to avoid alienating the Soviet Union and its neighbours; the Polish and Czechoslovakian governments characterised the expulsions as \"a just punishment for Nazi crimes\". Western analysts were inclined to see the Soviet Union and its satellites as a single entity, disregarding the national disputes that had preceded the Cold War. The fall of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany opened the door to a renewed examination of the expulsions in both scholarly and political circles. A factor in the ongoing nature of the dispute may be the relatively large proportion of German citizens who were among the expellees and/or their descendants, estimated at 20% in 2000.\nA 1993 novel, \"Summer of Dead Dreams\", written by Harry Th\u00fcrk\u2014a German author who left Upper Silesia annexed by Poland shortly after the war had ended\u2014contained graphic depictions of the treatment of Germans by Soviets and Poles in Th\u00fcrk's hometown of Prudnik. It depicted the maltreatment of Germans while also acknowledging German guilt, as well as Polish animosity toward Germans and, in specific instances, friendships between Poles and Germans despite the circumstances. Th\u00fcrk's novel, when serialized in Polish translation by the \"Tygodnik Prudnicki\" (\"Prudnik Weekly\") magazine, was met with criticism from some Polish residents of Prudnik, but also with praise, because it revealed to many local citizens that there had been a post-war German ghetto in the town and addressed the tensions between Poles and Soviets in post-war Poland. The serialization was followed by an exhibition on Thurk's life in Prudnik's town museum.\nStatus in international law.\nInternational law on population transfer underwent considerable evolution during the 20th century. Before World War II, several major population transfers were the result of bilateral treaties and had the support of international bodies such as the League of Nations. The tide started to turn when the charter of the Nuremberg trials of German Nazi leaders declared forced deportation of civilian populations to be both a war crime and a crime against humanity, and this opinion was progressively adopted and extended through the remainder of the century. Underlying the change was the trend to assign rights to individuals, thereby limiting the rights of nation-states to impose fiats which could adversely affect such individuals. The Charter of the then-newly formed United Nations stated that its Security Council could take no enforcement actions regarding measures taken against World War II \"enemy states\", defined as enemies of a Charter signatory in WWII. The Charter did not preclude action in relation to such enemies \"taken or authorized as a result of that war by the Governments having responsibility for such action.\" Thus, the Charter did not invalidate or preclude action against World War II enemies following the war. This argument is contested by Alfred de Zayas, an American professor of international law. ICRC's legal adviser Jean-Marie Henckaerts posited that the contemporary expulsions conducted by the Allies of World War II themselves were the reason why expulsion issues were included neither in the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, nor in the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950, and says it \"may be called 'a tragic anomaly' that while deportations were outlawed at Nuremberg they were used by the same powers as a 'peacetime measure'\". It was only in 1955 that the Settlement Convention regulated expulsions, yet only in respect to expulsions of individuals of the states who signed the convention. The first international treaty condemning mass expulsions was a document issued by the Council of Europe on 16 September 1963, \"Protocol No 4 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Securing Certain Rights and Freedoms Other than Those Already Included in the Convention and in the First Protocol\", stating in Article 4: \"collective expulsion of aliens is prohibited.\" This protocol entered into force on 2 May 1968, and as of 1995 was ratified by 19 states.\nThere is now general consensus about the legal status of involuntary population transfers: \"Where population transfers used to be accepted as a means to settle ethnic conflict, today, forced population transfers are considered violations of international law.\" No legal distinction is made between one-way and two-way transfers, since the rights of each individual are regarded as independent of the experience of others. Although the signatories to the Potsdam Agreements and the expelling countries may have considered the expulsions to be legal under international law at the time, there are historians and scholars in international law and human rights who argue that the expulsions of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe should now be considered as episodes of ethnic cleansing, and thus a violation of human rights. For example, Timothy V. Waters argues in \"On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing\" that if similar circumstances arise in the future, the precedent of the expulsions of the Germans without legal redress would also allow the future ethnic cleansing of other populations under international law.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a Harvard-trained lawyer and historian, Alfred de Zayas, published \"Nemesis at Potsdam\" and \"A Terrible Revenge\", both of which became bestsellers in Germany. De Zayas argues that the expulsions were war crimes and crimes against humanity even in the context of international law of the time, stating, \"the only applicable principles were the Hague Conventions, in particular, the Hague Regulations, Articles 42\u201356, which limited the rights of occupying powers\u2014and obviously occupying powers have no rights to expel the populations\u2014so there was the clear violation of the Hague Regulations.\" He argued that the expulsions violated the Nuremberg Principles.\nIn November 2000, a major conference on ethnic cleansing in the 20th century was held at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, along with the publication of a book containing participants' conclusions.\nThe former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Jos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso of Ecuador endorsed the establishment of the Centre Against Expulsions in Berlin. Jos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso recognized the \"expellees\" as victims of gross violations of human rights. De Zayas, a member of the advisory board of the Centre Against Expulsions, endorses the full participation of the organisation representing the expellees, the Bund der Vertriebenen (Federation of Expellees), in the Centre in Berlin.\nBerlin Centre.\nA Centre Against Expulsions was to be set up in Berlin by the German government based on an initiative and with active participation of the German Federation of Expellees. The centre's creation has been criticized in Poland. It was strongly opposed by the Polish government and president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski. Former Polish prime minister Donald Tusk restricted his comments to a recommendation that Germany pursue a neutral approach at the museum. The museum apparently did not materialize. The only project along the same lines in Germany is \"Visual Sign\" (\"Sichtbares Zeichen\") under the auspices of the Stiftung Flucht, Vertreibung, Vers\u00f6hnung (SFVV).\nSeveral members of two consecutive international Advisory (scholar) Councils criticised some activities of the foundation and the new Director Winfried Halder resigned. Dr Gundula Bavendamm is a current Director.\nHistoriography.\nBritish historian Richard J. Evans wrote that although the expulsions of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe was done in an extremely brutal manner that could not be defended, the basic aim of expelling the ethnic German population of Poland and Czechoslovakia was justified by the subversive role played by the German minorities before World War II. Evans wrote that under the Weimar Republic the vast majority of ethnic Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia made it clear that they were not loyal to the states they happened to live under, and under Nazi rule, the German minorities in Eastern Europe were willing tools of German foreign policy. Evans also wrote that many areas of eastern Europe featured a jumble of various ethnic groups aside from Germans, and that it was the destructive role played by ethnic Germans as instruments of Nazi Germany that led to their expulsion after the war. Evans concluded by positing that the expulsions were justified as they put an end to a major problem that plagued Europe before the war; that gains to the cause of peace were a further benefit of the expulsions; and that if the Germans had been allowed to remain in Eastern Europe after the war, West Germany would have used their presence to make territorial claims against Poland and Czechoslovakia, and that given the Cold War, this could have helped cause World War III.\nHistorian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the expulsions of the Sudeten Germans was justified as the Germans themselves had scrapped the Munich Agreement.\nPolitical issues.\nIn January 1990, the president of Czechoslovakia, V\u00e1clav Havel, requested forgiveness on his country's behalf, using the term expulsion rather than transfer. Public approval for Havel's stance was limited; in a 1996 opinion poll, 86% of Czechs stated they would not support a party that endorsed such an apology. The expulsion issue surfaced in 2002 during the Czech Republic's application for membership in the European Union, since the authorisation decrees issued by Edvard Bene\u0161 had not been formally renounced.\nIn October 2009, Czech president V\u00e1clav Klaus stated that the Czech Republic would require exemption from the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to ensure that the descendants of expelled Germans could not press legal claims against the Czech Republic. Five years later, in 2014, the government of Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka decided that the exemption was \"no longer relevant\" and that the withdrawal of the opt-out \"would help improve Prague's position with regard to other EU international agreements.\"\nOn 20 June 2018, which was World Refugee Day, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that there had been \"no moral or political justification\" for the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans.\nMisuse of graphical materials.\nNazi propaganda pictures produced during the \"Heim ins Reich\" and pictures of expelled Poles are sometimes published to show the flight and expulsion of Germans.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is also one of the main characters in Nobel Prize-winning Jos\u00e9 Saramago's \"Baltasar and Blimunda\".\nEarly life.\nGusm\u00e3o was born at Santos, then part of the Portuguese colony of Brazil.\nHe began his novitiate in the Society of Jesus at Bahia when he was about fifteen years old, but left the order in 1701. He went to Portugal and found a patron at Lisbon in the person of the Marquis of Abrantes. He completed his course of study at the University of Coimbra, devoting his attention principally to philology and mathematics, but received the title of Doctor of Canon Law (related to Theology). He is said to have had a remarkable memory and a great command of languages.\nAirship.\nIn 1709, he presented a petition to King Jo\u00e3o V of Portugal, seeking royal favour for his invention of an airship, in which he expressed the greatest confidence. The contents of this petition have been preserved, together with a picture and description of his airship. Developing the ideas of Francesco Lana de Terzi, S.J., Gusm\u00e3o wanted to spread a huge sail over a boat-like body like the cover of a transport wagon; the boat itself was to contain tubes through which, when there was no wind, air would be blown into the sail by means of bellows. The vessel was to be propelled by the agency of magnets which were to be encased in two hollow metal balls. The public test of the machine, which was set for 24 June 1709, did not take place. \nIt is known that Gusm\u00e3o was working on this principle at the public exhibition he gave before the Court on 8 August 1709, in the hall of the Casa da \u00cdndia in Lisbon, when he propelled a small balloon to the roof using combustion from a flame. The king rewarded the inventor by appointing him to a professorship at Coimbra and made him a canon. He was also one of the fifty selected as members of the \"Academia Real de Hist\u00f3ria\", founded in 1720; and in 1722 he was made chaplain to the Court. Gusm\u00e3o also busied himself with other inventions, but in the meantime continued his work on his airship schemes, the idea for which he is said to have conceived while a novice at Bahia. His designs included a \"ship to sail in the air\" consisting of a triangular gas-filled pyramid, but he died without making progress.\nPersecution.\nOne account of Gusm\u00e3o's work suggests that the Portuguese Inquisition forbade him to continue his aeronautic investigations and persecuted him because of them, but this is probably a later invention. It dates, however, from at least the end of the 18th century, as the following article in the London \"Daily Universal Register\" (later \"The Times\") of 20 October 1786, makes clear:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By accounts from Lisbon we are assured, that in consequence of the experiments made there with the Montgolfier balloon, the literati of Portugal had been incited to make numerous researches on the subject; in consequence of which they pretend that the honour of the invention is due to Portugal. They say that in 1720, a Brazilian Jesuit, named Bartholomew Gusmao, possessed of abilities, imagination, and address, by permission of John V. fabricated a balloon in a place contiguous to the Royal Palace, and one day, in presence of their Majesties, and an immense crowd of spectators, raised himself, by means of a fire lighted in the machine, as high as the cornice of the building; but through the negligence and want of experience of those who held the cords, the machine took an oblique direction, and, touching the cornice, burst and fell.\nThe balloon was in the form of a bird with a tail and wings. The inventor proposed to make new experiments, but, chagrined at the raillery of the common people, who called him wizzard, and terrified by the Inquisition, he took the advice of his friends, burned his manuscripts, disguised himself, and fled to Spain, where he soon after died in an hospital.\nThey add, that several learned men, French and English, who had been at Lisbon to verify the fact, had made enquiries at the Carmelite monastery, where Gusmao had a brother, who had preserved some of his manuscripts on the manner of constructing aerostatic machines. Various living persons affirm that they were present at the Jesuit's experiments, and that he received the surname of \"Voador\", or Flying-man.\nContemporary documents do attest that information was laid before the Inquisition against Gusm\u00e3o, but on quite another charge. The inventor fled to Spain and fell ill of a fever, of which he died in Toledo. He wrote: \"Manifesto summ\u00e1rio para os que ignoram poderse navegar pelo elemento do ar\" (\"Short Manifesto for those who are unaware that is possible to sail through the element air\", 1709); and \"V\u00e1rios modos de esgotar sem gente as naus que fazem \u00e1gua\" (\"Several ways of draining, without people, ships that leak water\", 1710); some of his sermons also have been printed.\nLegacy.\nIn 1936, the Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o Airport was built in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin to operate with the rigid airships Graf Zeppelin and Hindenburg. In 1941, it was taken over by the Brazilian Air Force and renamed Santa Cruz Air Force Base. Presently, the airport serving Araraquara is named Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o Airport.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Inside the Roche limit, orbiting material disperses and forms rings, whereas outside the limit, material tends to coalesce. The Roche radius depends on the radius of the second body and on the ratio of the bodies' densities.\nThe term is named after \u00c9douard Roche (, ), the French astronomer who first calculated this theoretical limit in 1848.\nExplanation.\nThe Roche limit typically applies to a satellite's disintegration due to tidal forces induced by its \"primary\", the body around which it orbits. Parts of the satellite that are closer to the primary are attracted more strongly by gravity from the primary than parts that are farther away; this disparity effectively pulls the near and far parts of the satellite apart from each other, and if the disparity (combined with any centrifugal effects due to the object's spin) is larger than the force of gravity holding the satellite together, it can pull the satellite apart. Some real satellites, both natural and artificial, can orbit within their Roche limits because they are held together by forces other than gravitation. Objects resting on the surface of such a satellite would be lifted away by tidal forces. A weaker satellite, such as a comet, could be broken up when it passes within its Roche limit.\nSince, within the Roche limit, tidal forces overwhelm the gravitational forces that might otherwise hold the satellite together, no satellite can gravitationally coalesce out of smaller particles within that limit. Indeed, almost all known planetary rings are located within their Roche limit. (Notable exceptions are Saturn's E-Ring and Phoebe ring. These two rings are formed from particles released from the moons Enceladus and Phoebe due to cryovolcanic plumes and meteoroid impacts, respectively.)\nThe gravitational effect occurring below the Roche limit is not the only factor that causes comets to break apart. Splitting by thermal stress, internal gas pressure, and rotational splitting are other ways for a comet to split under stress.\nDetermination.\nThe limiting distance to which a satellite can approach without breaking up depends on the rigidity of the satellite. At one extreme, a completely rigid satellite will maintain its shape until tidal forces break it apart. At the other extreme, a highly fluid satellite gradually deforms leading to increased tidal forces, causing the satellite to elongate, further compounding the tidal forces and causing it to break apart more readily.\nMost real satellites would lie somewhere between these two extremes, with tensile strength rendering the satellite neither perfectly rigid nor perfectly fluid. For example, a rubble-pile asteroid will behave more like a fluid than a solid rocky one; an icy body will behave quite rigidly at first but become more fluid as tidal heating accumulates and its ices begin to melt.\nBut note that, as defined above, the Roche limit refers to a body held together solely by the gravitational forces which cause otherwise unconnected particles to coalesce, thus forming the body in question. The Roche limit is also usually calculated for the case of a circular orbit, although it is straightforward to modify the calculation to apply to the case (for example) of a body passing the primary on a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory.\nRigid satellites.\nThe \"rigid-body\" Roche limit is a simplified calculation for a spherical satellite. Irregular shapes such as those of tidal deformation on the body or the primary it orbits are neglected. It is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. These assumptions, although unrealistic, greatly simplify calculations.\nThe Roche limit for a rigid spherical satellite is the distance, formula_1, from the primary at which the gravitational force on a test mass at the surface of the object is exactly equal to the tidal force pulling the mass away from the object:\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the radius of the primary, formula_4 is the density of the primary, and formula_5 is the density of the satellite. \nThis represents the orbital distance inside of which loose material (e.g. regolith) on the surface of the satellite closest to the primary would be pulled away, and likewise material on the side opposite the primary will also go away from, rather than toward, the satellite.\nSince the limit depends only on the density, this implies, that the satellite will be torn entirely, if it consists of loose dust or separate rocks bound only by gravity.\nFluid satellites.\nA more accurate approach for calculating the Roche limit takes the deformation of the satellite into account. An extreme example would be a tidally locked liquid satellite orbiting a planet, where any force acting upon the satellite would deform it into a prolate spheroid.\nThe calculation is complex and its result cannot be represented in an exact algebraic formula. Roche himself derived the following approximate solution for the Roche limit:\nformula_6\nHowever, a better approximation that takes into account the primary's oblateness and the satellite's mass is:\nformula_7\nwhere formula_8 is the oblateness of the primary. \nThe fluid solution is appropriate for bodies that are only loosely held together, such as a comet. For instance, comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9's decaying orbit around Jupiter passed within its Roche limit in July 1992, causing it to fragment into a number of smaller pieces. On its next approach in 1994, the fragments crashed into the planet. Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 was first observed in 1993, but its orbit indicated that it had been captured by Jupiter a few decades prior.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Along with direct removal such as deportation or population transfer, it also includes indirect methods aimed at forced migration by coercing the victim group to flee and preventing its return, such as murder, rape, and property destruction. Both the definition and charge of ethnic cleansing is often disputed, with some researchers including and others excluding coercive assimilation or mass killings as a means of depopulating an area of a particular group, or calling it a euphemism for genocide or cultural genocide.\nAlthough scholars do not agree on which events constitute ethnic cleansing, many instances have occurred throughout history. The term was first used to describe Albanian nationalist treatment of the Kosovo Serbs in the 1980s, and entered widespread use during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. Since then, the term has gained widespread acceptance due to journalism. Although research originally focused on deep-rooted animosities as an explanation for ethnic cleansing events, more recent studies depict ethnic cleansing as \"a natural extension of the homogenizing tendencies of nation states\" or emphasize security concerns and the effects of democratization, portraying ethnic tensions as a contributing factor. Research has also focused on the role of war as a causative or potentiating factor in ethnic cleansing. However, states in a similar strategic situation can have widely varying policies towards minority ethnic groups perceived as a security threat.\nEthnic cleansing has no legal definition under international criminal law, but the methods by which it is carried out are considered crimes against humanity and may also fall under the Genocide Convention.\nEtymology.\nAn antecedent to the term is the Greek word (; lit. \"enslavement\"), which was used in ancient texts. e.g., to describe atrocities that accompanied the Athenian general Chares and his seizure and destruction of Sestos in 353 and Alexander the Great's conquest of Thebes in 335 BCE. The expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain between 1609 and 1614 is considered by some authors to be one of the first episodes of state-sponsored ethnic cleansing in the modern western world. Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term \"genocide\", considered the displacement of Native Americans by American settlers as a historical example of genocide. Others, like historian Gary Anderson, contend that genocide does not accurately characterize any aspect of American history, suggesting instead that ethnic cleansing is a more appropriate term. The Circassian genocide, also known as \"Tsitsekun\", is often regarded by various historians as the first large-scale ethnic cleansing campaign launched by a state during the 19th century industrial era. Imperial Russian general Nikolay Yevdakimov, who supervised the operations of Circassian genocide during 1860s, dehumanised Muslim Circassians as \"a pestilence\" to be expelled from their native lands. Russian objective was the annexation of land; and the Russian military operations that forcibly deported Circassians were designated by Yevdakimov as \u201c\"ochishchenie\"\u201d (cleansing).\nIn the early 1900s, regional variants of the term could be found among the Czechs (), the Poles (), the French () and the Germans (). A 1913 Carnegie Endowment report condemning the actions of all participants in the Balkan Wars contained various new terms to describe brutalities committed toward ethnic groups.\nDuring the Holocaust in World War II, Nazi Germany pursued a policy of ensuring that Europe was \"cleaned of Jews\" (). The Nazi called for the genocide and ethnic cleansing of most Slavic people in central and eastern Europe for the purpose of providing more living space for the Germans. During the Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia, the euphemism (\"cleansing the terrain\") was used by the Croatian Usta\u0161e to describe military actions in which non-Croats were purposely systematically killed or otherwise uprooted from their homes. The term was also used in the December 20, 1941, directive of Serbian Chetniks in reference to the genocidal massacres they committed against Bosniaks and Croats between 1941 and 1945. The Russian phrase (; lit. \"cleansing of borders\") was used in Soviet documents of the early 1930s to refer to the forced resettlement of Polish people from the border zone in the Byelorussian and Ukrainian SSRs. This process of the population transfer in the Soviet Union was repeated on an even larger scale in 1939\u20131941, involving many other groups suspected of disloyalty.\nIn its complete form, the term appeared for the first time in the Romanian language () in an address by Vice Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu to cabinet members in July 1941. After the beginning of the invasion by the Soviet Union, he concluded: \"I do not know when the Romanians will have such chance for ethnic cleansing.\" In the 1980s, the Soviets used the term \"etnicheskoye chishcheniye\" which literally translates to \"ethnic cleansing\" to describe Azerbaijani efforts to drive Armenians away from Nagorno-Karabakh. It was widely popularized by the Western media during the Bosnian War (1992\u20131995).\nIn 1992, the German equivalent of \"ethnic cleansing\" (, ) was named German Un-word of the Year by the \"Gesellschaft f\u00fcr deutsche Sprache\" due to its euphemistic, inappropriate nature.\nDefinitions.\nThe Final Report of the Commission of Experts established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780 defined ethnic cleansing as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas\", [noting that in the former Yugoslavia] \" 'ethnic cleansing' has been carried out by means of murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property. Those practices constitute crimes against humanity and can be assimilated to specific war crimes. Furthermore, such acts could also fall within the meaning of the Genocide Convention.\nThe official United Nations definition of ethnic cleansing is \"rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group.\" As a category, ethnic cleansing encompasses a continuum or spectrum of policies. In the words of Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, \"ethnic cleansing ... defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with deportation and genocide. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of a population from a given territory.\"\nTerry Martin has defined ethnic cleansing as \"the forcible removal of an ethnically defined population from a given territory\" and as \"occupying the central part of a continuum between genocide on one end and nonviolent pressured ethnic emigration on the other end.\"\nGregory Stanton, the founder of Genocide Watch, has criticised the rise of the term and its use for events that he feels should be called \"genocide\": because \"ethnic cleansing\" has no legal definition, its media use can detract attention from events that should be prosecuted as genocide. Ethnic cleansing has therefore and for being read as euphemistic alternatively identified as ethnocide or cultural genocide.\nAs a crime under international law.\nThere is no international treaty that specifies a specific crime of ethnic cleansing; however, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense\u2014the forcible deportation of a population\u2014is defined as a crime against humanity under the statutes of both the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The gross human rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under public international law of crimes against humanity and in certain circumstances genocide. There are also situations, such as the expulsion of Germans after World War II, where ethnic cleansing has taken place without legal redress (see \"Preussische Treuhand v. Poland\"). \"Timothy v. Waters\" argues that similar ethnic cleansing could go unpunished in the future.\nMutual ethnic cleansing.\nMutual ethnic cleansing occurs when two groups commit ethnic cleansing against minority members of the other group within their own territories. For instance in the 1920s, Turkey expelled its Greek minority and Greece expelled its Turkish minority following the Greco-Turkish War. Other examples where mutual ethnic cleansing occurred include the First Nagorno-Karabakh War and the population transfers by the Soviets of Germans, Poles, and Ukrainians after World War II.\nCauses.\nAccording to Michael Mann, in \"The Dark Side of Democracy\" (2004), murderous ethnic cleansing is strongly related to the creation of democracies. He argues that murderous ethnic cleansing is due to the rise of nationalism, which associates citizenship with a specific ethnic group. Democracy, therefore, is tied to ethnic and national forms of exclusion. Nevertheless, it is not democratic states that are more prone to commit ethnic cleansing, because minorities tend to have constitutional guarantees. Neither are stable authoritarian regimes (except the Nazi and communist regimes) which are likely perpetrators of murderous ethnic cleansing, but those regimes that are in process of democratization. Ethnic hostility appears where ethnicity overshadows social classes as the primordial system of social stratification. Usually, in deeply divided societies, categories such as class and ethnicity are deeply intertwined, and when an ethnic group is seen as oppressor or exploitative of the other, serious ethnic conflict can develop. Michael Mann holds that when two ethnic groups claim sovereignty over the same territory and can feel threatened, their differences can lead to severe grievances and danger of ethnic cleansing. The perpetration of murderous ethnic cleansing tends to occur in unstable geopolitical environments and in contexts of war. As ethnic cleansing requires high levels of organisation and is usually directed by states or other authoritative powers, perpetrators are usually state powers or institutions with some coherence and capacity, not failed states as it is generally perceived. The perpetrator powers tend to get support by core constituencies that favour combinations of nationalism, statism, and violence.\nEthnic cleansing was prevalent during the Age of Nationalism in Europe (19th and 20th centuries). Multi-ethnic European engaged in ethnic cleansing against minorities in order to pre-empt their secession and the loss of territory. Ethnic cleansing was particularly prevalent during periods of interstate war.\nGenocide.\nEthnic cleansing has been described as part of a continuum of violence whose most extreme form is genocide. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or population transfer. While ethnic cleansing and genocide may share the same goal and methods (e.g., forced displacement), ethnic cleansing is intended to displace a persecuted population from a given territory, while genocide is intended to destroy a group.\nSome academics consider genocide to be a subset of \"murderous ethnic cleansing\". Norman Naimark writes that these concepts are different but related, for \"literally and figuratively, ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide, as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people.\" William Schabas states \"ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come. Genocide is the last resort of the frustrated ethnic cleanser.\" Multiple genocide scholars have criticized distinguishing between ethnic cleansing and genocide, with Martin Shaw arguing that forced deportation necessarily results in the destruction of a group and this must be foreseen by the perpetrators. Furthermore ethnic cleansing has been identified as a euphemism for genocide or cultural genocide.\nAs a military, political, and economic tactic.\nThe foibe massacres (; ; ), or simply \"the foibe\", refers to ethnic cleansing, mass killings and deportations both during and immediately after World War II, mainly committed by Yugoslav Partisans and OZNA in the then-Italian territories of Julian March (Karst Region and Istria), Kvarner and Dalmatia, against local Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) and Slavs, primarily members of fascist and collaborationist forces, and civilians opposed to the new Yugoslav authorities, and Italian, German, Croat and Slovene anti-communists against the regime of Josip Broz Tito, presumed to be associated with fascism, Nazism, collaboration with Axis and reventive purge of real, potential or presumed opponents of Titoism The foibe massacres were followed by the Istrian\u2013Dalmatian exodus, which was the post-World War II exodus and departure of between 230,000 and 350,000 local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) towards Italy, and in smaller numbers, towards the Americas, Australia and South Africa. From 1947, after the war, they were subject by Yugoslav authorities to less violent forms of intimidation, such as nationalization, expropriation, and discriminatory taxation, which gave them little option other than emigration. In 1953, there were 36,000 declared Italians in Yugoslavia, just about 16% of the original Italian population before World War II. According to the census organized in Croatia in 2001 and that organized in Slovenia in 2002, the Italians who remained in the former Yugoslavia amounted to 21,894 people (2,258 in Slovenia and 19,636 in Croatia).\nThe resettlement policy of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 9th and 7th centuries BC is considered by some scholars to be one of the first cases of ethnic cleansing.\nDuring the 1980s, in Lebanon, ethnic cleansing was common during all phases of the conflict, notable incidents were seen in the early phase of the war, such as the Damour massacre, the Karantina massacre, the Siege of the Tel al-Zaatar Palestinian refugee camp, and during the 1982 Lebanon War such as the Sabra and Shatila Massacre committed by Lebanese Maronite forces backed by Israel against Palestinian refugees and Lebanese Shia civilians. After the Israeli withdrawal from the Chouf, the Mountain War broke out, where ethnic cleansings (mostly in the form of tit-for-tat killings) occurred. During that time, the Syrian backed, mostly Druze dominated People's Liberation Army used a policy they called \"territorial cleansing\" to \"drain\" the Chouf of Maronite Christians in order to deny them of resisting the advance of the PSP. As a result, 163,670 Christian villagers were displaced due to these operations. In response to these massacres, the Lebanese Forces conducted a similar policy, which resulted in 20,000 Druze displaced.\nEthnic cleansing was a common phenomenon in the wars in Croatia, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This entailed intimidation, forced expulsion, or killing of the unwanted ethnic group as well as the destruction of the places of worship, cemeteries and cultural and historical buildings of that ethnic group in order to alter the population composition of an area in the favour of another ethnic group which would become the majority.\nAccording to numerous ICTY verdicts and indictments, Serb and Croat forces performed ethnic cleansing of their territories planned by their political leadership to create ethnically pure states (Republika Srpska and Republic of Serbian Krajina by the Serbs; and Herzeg-Bosnia by the Croats).\nSurvivors of the ethnic cleansing were left severely traumatized as a consequence of this campaign.\nIsraeli herders have engaged in a systemic displacement of Palestinian herders in Area C of the West Bank as a form of nationalist and economic warfare.\nAccording to historian Norman Naimark, during an ethnic cleansing process, there may be destruction of physical symbols of the victims including temples, books, monuments, graveyards, and street names: \"Ethnic cleansing involves not only the forced deportation of entire nations but the eradication of the memory of their presence.\"\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61099", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61099", "title": "Crimes against humanity", "text": "Concept in international law\nCrimes against humanity are certain crimes committed as part of a large-scale attack against civilians. Unlike war crimes, crimes against humanity can be committed during both peace and war and against a state's own nationals as well as foreign nationals. Together with war crimes, genocide, and the crime of aggression, crimes against humanity are one of the core crimes of international criminal law and, like other crimes against international law, have no temporal or jurisdictional limitations on prosecution (where universal jurisdiction is recognized).\nThe first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place during the Nuremberg trials and Subsequent Nuremberg trials against defeated leaders of Nazi Germany and collaborators. Crimes against humanity have been prosecuted by other international courts (such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and the International Criminal Court) as well as by domestic courts. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily been developed as a result of the evolution of customary international law. Crimes against humanity are not codified in an international convention, so an international effort to establish such a treaty, led by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative, has been underway since 2008.\nAccording to the Rome Statute, there are eleven types of crimes that can be charged as a crime against humanity when \"committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\": \"murder; extermination; enslavement; deportation or forcible transfer of population; imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; torture; rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity...; enforced disappearance...; the crime of apartheid; other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.\"\nOrigins of the term.\nThe term \"crimes against humanity\" is potentially ambiguous because of the ambiguity of the word \"humanity\", which originally meant the quality of being human (first recorded in 1384) but more recently (in 1450) additionally took on another meaning as a synonym of mankind. The context of the term in documents related to the Nuremberg trials shows that the original sense is intended.\nThe term \"crimes against humanity\" was used by George Washington Williams, an American minister, politician and historian, in a letter he wrote to the United States Secretary of State describing the atrocities committed by Leopold II of Belgium's administration in the Congo Free State in 1890. This was an early but not, as is often claimed, the first use of the term in its modern sense in the English language. In his first annual message in December 1889, U.S. President Benjamin Harrison spoke about the slave trade in Africa as a \"crime against humanity\". Already in 1883, Williams had used the same term in his reflections about slavery in the United States.\nIn treaty law, the term originated in the Second Hague Convention of 1899 preamble and was expanded in the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 preamble and their respective regulations, which were concerned with the codification of new rules of international humanitarian law. The preamble of the two Conventions referenced the \"laws of humanity\" as an expression of underlying inarticulated humanistic values. The term is part of what is known as the Martens Clause.\nOn May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers, Britain, France, and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly and for the first time ever charging another government with committing \"a crime against humanity\". An excerpt from this joint statement reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt the conclusion of the war, the Allied Commission of Responsibilities recommended the creation of a tribunal to try \"violations of the laws of humanity\" because the law of war did not cover atrocities committed by a state against its own nationals or allied persons. However, the US representative objected to references to the \"law of humanity\" as being imprecise and insufficiently developed at that time, and the concept was not pursued.\nNonetheless, a UN report in 1948 referred to the usage of the term \"crimes against humanity\" regarding the Armenian genocide as a precedent to the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials. On May 15, 1948, the Economic and Social Council presented a 384-page report prepared by the United Nations War Crimes Commission (UNWCC), set up in London (October 1943) to collect and collate information on war crimes and war criminals. The report was in compliance with the request by the UN Secretary-General to make arrangements for \"the collection and publication of information concerning human rights arising from trials of war criminals, quislings, and traitors, and in particular from the Nuremberg trials and Tokyo Trials.\" The report had been prepared by members of the Legal Staff of the commission. The report is highly topical regarding the Armenian Genocide, not only because it uses the 1915 events as a historic example but also as a precedent to Articles 6 (c) and 5 (c) of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters, and thereby as a precursor to the then newly adopted UN Genocide Convention, differentiating between war crimes and crimes against humanity. By referring to the information collected during WWI and put forward by the 1919 Commission of Responsibilities, the report titled \"Information Concerning Human Rights Arising from Trials of War Criminals\" used the Armenian case as a vivid example of crimes committed by a state against its own citizens. The report also noted that while the Paris Peace Treaties with Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria did not include any reference to \"laws of humanity\", instead basing the charges on violations of \"laws and customs of war\", the S\u00e8vres Peace Treaty with Turkey did so. In addition to the Articles 226\u2013228, concerning customs of war (corresponding to Articles 228\u2013230 of the Treaty of Versailles), the S\u00e8vres Treaty also contained an additional Article 230, in compliance with the Allied ultimatum of May 24, 1915 regarding \"crimes against humanity and civilization\".\nNuremberg trials.\nAfter the Second World War, the Nuremberg Charter set down the laws and procedures by which the Nuremberg trials were to be conducted. The drafters of this document were faced with the problem of how to charge the men at the Nuremberg Trial with committing the Holocaust and other state-sanctioned atrocities committed in Germany and German-allied states by the Nazi regime. As far as German law was concerned the men had committed no crime, but only followed orders. Not following orders however, in Nazi Germany, was a horribly punished crime. The problem in trying the individuals responsible for the German atrocities lay in the fact that, like in World War I, a traditional understanding of war crimes gave no provision for atrocities committed by a state on its own citizens or its allies. Therefore, to solve this problem and close the loophole, Article 6 of the Charter was drafted to include not only traditional war crimes and crimes against peace, but also \"crimes against humanity\", defined as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.\nUnder this definition, crimes against humanity could be punished only insofar as they could be connected somehow to war crimes or crimes against peace. The jurisdictional limitation was explained by the American chief representative to the London Conference, Robert H. Jackson, who pointed out that it \"has been a general principle from time immemorial that the internal affairs of another government are not ordinarily our business\". Thus, \"it is justifiable that we interfere or attempt to bring retribution to individuals or to states only because the concentration camps and the deportations were in pursuance of a common plan or enterprise of making an unjust war\". The judgement of the first Nuremberg trial found that \"the policy of persecution, repression and murder of civilians\" and persecution of Jews within Germany before the outbreak of war in 1939 were not crimes against humanity, because as \"revolting and horrible as many of these crimes were, it has not been satisfactorily proved that they were done in execution of, or in connection with\", war crimes or crimes against peace. The subsequent Nuremberg trials were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 which included a revised definition of crimes against humanity with a wider scope.\nTokyo trial.\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo trial, was convened to try the leaders of the Empire of Japan for three types of crimes: \"Class A\" (crimes against peace), \"Class B\" (war crimes), and \"Class C\" (crimes against humanity), committed before and during the Second World War.\nThe legal basis for the trial was established by the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (CIMTFE) that was proclaimed on 19 January 1946. The tribunal convened on May 3, 1946, and was adjourned on November 12, 1948.\nIn the Tokyo Trial, Crimes against Humanity (Class C) was not applied for any suspect. Prosecutions related to the Nanking Massacre were categorised as infringements upon the Laws of War.\nA panel of eleven judges presided over the IMTFE, one each from victorious Allied powers (United States, Republic of China, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Provisional Government of the French Republic, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, British India, and the Philippines).\nTypes of crimes against humanity.\nThe definition of a crime against humanity varies both between and within countries and it also varies on both the international and domestic levels. Isolated and inhumane acts of a certain nature which are not committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack may constitute grave infringements of human rights, or \u2013\u00a0depending on the circumstances\u00a0\u2013 war crimes but they are not classified as crimes against humanity.\nAccording to the Rome Statute, there are eleven types of crimes that can be charged as crimes against humanity when they are \"committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\":\nApartheid.\nThe systematic persecution of members of one racial group by members of another racial group, such as the persecution which was practiced by the South African apartheid government, was recognized as a crime against humanity by the United Nations General Assembly in 1976. The Charter of the United Nations, Articles 13, 14, 15 makes actions of the General Assembly advisory to the Security Council. In regard to apartheid in particular, the UN General Assembly has not made any findings, nor have apartheid-related trials for crimes against humanity been conducted.\nRape and sexual violence.\nThe Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters did not contain any explicit provisions which recognized sexual and gender-based crimes as war crimes or crimes against humanity, but Control Council Law No. 10 recognized rape as a crime against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda both included rape as a crime against humanity. The ICC is the first international court which expressly includes various forms of sexual and gender-based crimes\u00a0\u2013 including rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, and other forms of sexual violence\u00a0\u2013 as both an underlying act of crimes against humanity and a war crime which is committed during international and/or non-international armed conflicts.\nIn 2008, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1820, which noted that \"rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide\".\nLegal status of crimes against humanity in international law.\nUnlike genocide and war crimes, which have been widely recognized and prohibited in international criminal law since the establishment of the Nuremberg principles, there has never been a comprehensive convention on crimes against humanity, even though such crimes are continuously perpetrated worldwide in numerous conflicts and crises. There are eleven international texts defining crimes against humanity, but they all differ slightly as to their definition of that crime and its legal elements. In 2008, the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative was launched to address this gap in international law.\nOn July 30, 2013, the United Nations International Law Commission voted to include the topic of crimes against humanity in its long-term program of work. In July 2014, the Commission moved this topic to its active programme of work based largely on a report submitted by Sean D. Murphy (the Special Rapporteur for Crimes Against Humanity).\nThere is some debate on the status of crimes against humanity under customary international law. M. Cherif Bassiouni argues that crimes against humanity are part of \"jus cogens\" and as such constitute a non-derogable rule of international law.\nUnited Nations.\nThe United Nations has been primarily responsible for the prosecution of crimes against humanity since it was chartered in 1948.\nAfter Nuremberg, there was no international court with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity for almost 50 years. However, work continued on developing the definition of crimes against humanity at the United Nations. For instance, in 1947, the International Law Commission was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with the formulation of the principles of international law recognized and reinforced in the Nuremberg Charter and judgment, and they were also tasked with drafting a 'code of offenses against the peace and security of mankind'. Completed 50 years later in 1996, the Draft Code defined crimes against humanity as various inhumane acts, \"i.e.\", \"murder, extermination, torture, enslavement, persecution on political, racial, religious or ethnic grounds, institutionalized discrimination, arbitrary deportation or forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, rape, enforced prostitution and other inhuman acts committed in a systematic manner or on a large scale and instigated or directed by a Government or by any organization or group.\" This definition differs from the one used in Nuremberg, where the criminal acts were to have been committed \"before or during the war\", thus establishing a nexus between crimes against humanity and armed conflict.\nOn 21 March 2013, at its 22nd session, the United Nations Human Rights Council established the Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The Commission was mandated to investigate the systematic, widespread, and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (i.e. North Korea), with a view to ensuring full accountability, in particular for violations that may amount to crimes against humanity. The Commission dealt with matters relating to crimes against humanity on the basis of definitions set out by customary international criminal law and in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The 2014 Report by the Commission found \"the body of testimony and other information it received establishes that crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State [...] These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. The Commission further finds that crimes against humanity are ongoing in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea because the policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart remain in place.\" Additionally, the Commission found that crimes against humanity have been committed against starving populations, particularly during the 1990s and that they were still being committed against persons from other countries who were systematically abducted or denied repatriation because they sought to gain labour and other skills for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\nSecurity Council.\nUN Security Council Resolution 1674, adopted by the United Nations Security Council on 28 April 2006, \"reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\". The resolution commits the Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.\nIn 2008 the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1820, which noted that \"rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide\".\nAccording to the United Nations Security Council resolution 1970 (2011) concerning Libya, any direct or indirect trade of arms to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, in the form of supply, transfer, or sale should be prevented by the member nations. The arms embargo restricts the supply of arms, weapons, military vehicles, spare parts, technical assistance, finances, and the provision of armed mercenaries with origins of a country other than the one providing.\nLater, the United Nations claimed in its November 2019 report that the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Turkey were then violating the arms embargo imposed on Libya under the 1970 resolution. An airstrike on the migrant detention center in Tripoli in July 2019, believed to have been carried out by the United Arab Emirates, can be amounted as a war crime, as stated by the United Nations. The airstrike was deadlier than the 2011 militarized uprising that overthrew the regime of Muammar Gaddafi.\nInternational courts and criminal tribunals.\nAfter the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of 1945\u20131946, another international tribunal with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity was not established for another five decades. In response to atrocities committed in the 1990s, multiple ad hoc tribunals were established with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda each contain different definitions of crimes against humanity.\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia.\nIn 1993, the UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), with jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute three international crimes which had taken place in the former Yugoslavia: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 5 of the ICTY Statute states that: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis definition of crimes against humanity revived the original 'Nuremberg' nexus with armed conflict, connecting crimes against humanity to both international and non-international armed conflict. It also expanded the list of criminal acts used in Nuremberg to include imprisonment, torture and rape. Cherif Bassiouni has argued that this definition was necessary as the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was considered to be a conflict of both an international and non-international nature. Therefore, this adjusted definition of crimes against humanity was necessary to afford the tribunal jurisdiction over this crime.\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\nThe UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994 following the Rwandan genocide. Under the ICTR Statute, the link between crimes against humanity and an armed conflict of any kind was dropped. Rather, the requirement was added that the inhumane acts must be part of a \"systematic or widespread attack against any civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds.\" Unlike the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the conflict in Rwanda was deemed to be non-international, so crimes against humanity would likely not have been applicable if the nexus to armed conflict had been maintained.\nInternational Criminal Court.\nIn 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) was established in The Hague (Netherlands), and the Rome Statute provides for the ICC to have jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. ICC proceedings definitions of a \"crime against humanity\" have evolved significantly from its original legal definition or that used by the UN. Essentially, the Rome Statute employs the same definition of crimes against humanity that the ICTR Statute does, minus the requirement that the attack was carried out 'on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds'. In addition, the Rome Statute definition offers the most expansive list of specific criminal acts that may constitute crimes against humanity to date.\nThe Rome Statute Explanatory Memorandum states that crimes against humanity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTo fall under the Rome Statute, a crime against humanity which is defined in Article 7.1 must be \"part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\". Article 7.2.a states \"For the purpose of paragraph 1: 'Attack directed against any civilian population means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack'.\" This means that an individual crime on its own, or even a number of such crimes, would not fall under the Rome Statute unless they were the result of a state policy or an organizational policy. This was confirmed by Luis Moreno Ocampo in an open letter publishing his conclusions about allegations of crimes committed during the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 which might fall under the ICC. In a section entitled \"Allegations concerning Genocide and Crimes against Humanity,\" Ocampo states that \"the available information provided no reasonable indicator of the required elements for a crime against humanity,\" \"i.e.\", 'a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population'\".\nThe ICC can only prosecute crimes against humanity in situations under which it has jurisdiction. The ICC only has jurisdiction over crimes contained in its statute \u2013 genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity \u2013 which have been committed on the territory of a State party to the Rome Statute, when a non-party State refers a situation within its country to the court, or when the United Nation Security Council refers a case to the ICC. In 2005 the UN referred to the ICC the situation in Darfur. This referral resulted in an indictment of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in 2008. When the ICC President reported to the UN regarding its progress handling these crimes against humanity case, Judge Phillipe Kirsch said \"The Court does not have the power to arrest these persons. That is the responsibility of States and other actors. Without arrests, there can be no trials.\"\nCouncil of Europe.\nThe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 30 April 2002 issued a recommendation to the member states, on the protection of women against violence. In the section \"Additional measures concerning violence in conflict and post-conflict situations\", states in paragraph 69 that member states should: \"penalize rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity as an intolerable violation of human rights, as crimes against humanity and, when committed in the context of an armed conflict, as war crimes;\"\nIn the Explanatory Memorandum on this recommendation when considering paragraph 69:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Reference should be made to the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal adopted in Rome in July 1998. Article 7 of the Statute defines rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity, as crimes against humanity. Furthermore, Article 8 of the Statute defines rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence as a serious breach of the Geneva Conventions and as war crimes.\n20th century.\nNumerous sources cite the 20th century as the bloodiest century in global history. Millions of civilian infants, children, adults, and elderly people died in warfare. One civilian perished for every combatant killed. Prior to World War II, war criminals did not face the possibility of prosecution, apprehension, or imprisonment. Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill favored the outright execution of war criminals. The United States was more lenient and called for a just trial. The British Government was convinced to institute the Nuremberg Trials, which left several legacies. These include worldwide jurisdiction for severe war crimes, the creation of international war crime tribunals, judicial procedures that effectively documented the history of colossal crimes, and the success of UN courts in holding impartial trials.\nSouth Africa operated under apartheid system from 1948 into the 1990s in violation of the 1973 Apartheid convention, which declared apartheid to be a crime against humanity. Following international action and backlash, the apartheid system was dismantled at the end of the 20th century.\nThe UN highlighted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), specifically Article 7 (Crimes against Humanity), which defines large-scale acts of violence against a locality's civilian populace. These acts include murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer of the population, imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of international laws, torture, forced prostitution and rape, persecution against certain groups, apartheid (racial discrimination and segregation), and other inhumane acts. A publication from Trial International mentioned that crimes against humanity have been codified starting in 1990. These include the 1993 Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, the 1994 Statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, and the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The latter contains the latest and most extensive list of detailed crimes against civilians.\n21st century.\nA report on the 2008\u201309 Gaza War by Richard Goldstone accused Israeli and Hamas forces of possibly committing a crime against humanity. The report concluded that Israel had used disproportionate force, targeted Palestinian civilians, used them as human shields, and destroyed civilian infrastructure. Hamas was found to have deliberately targeted Israeli civilians and Israeli infrastructure by mounting indiscriminate rocket attacks. Both the Israeli government and Hamas dismissed the findings of the report. In an April 2011 \"Washington Post\" article Goldstone wrote the report would have been a different document if he had known in 2009 what he knew in 2011. \nIn 2019, United Nations investigators announced that Israeli troops may have committed crimes against humanity. During the Gaza protests 189 Palestinians were killed, investigators said, 183 were shot with live ammunition, including 35 children, three health workers, and two journalists. Amnesty International has accused Israel of committing the crime of apartheid against Palestinians.\nIn 2022, the UN Human Rights Office assessment of human rights concerns in Xinjiang concluded that the extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups in China, since 2017, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.\nThe Myanmar military's targeting of the Rohingya Muslims in which more than 25,000 have been killed and more than 18,000 women and girls have been systematically raped have been labelled as crimes against humanity by United Nations and Amnesty International. OHCHR Independent Fact-Finding Mission have found Tatmadaw of committing crimes against humanity, genocide, and ethnic cleansing.\nA report of a UN fact-finding mission, which was released in March 2024 and presided over by Sara Hossain, revealed that the Iranian regime engaged in systematic and egregious institutionalized crimes against humanity on a large scale. Between 2021 and 2022, 551 protestors were killed during the Woman, Life, Freedom movement, and 834 people were executed in 2023.\nThe International Court of Justice, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, and Michael Lynk (UN Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian occupied territory) have accused Israel of committing apartheid against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Along with the apartheid system, Israel is also implicated in what many legal scholars say are crimes against humanity in the Gaza genocide. Human Rights Watch found that Israeli authorities systematically deprived Palestinian civilians in Gaza of water, food, and medical supplies, leading to widespread deaths and suffering, all acts of genocide. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, citing war crimes and crimes against humanity, with a particular focus on Israel\u2019s deliberate starvation of civilians as a weapon of war.\nIn April 2024, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) adopted a resolution calling for Israel to be held accountable for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, and demanding a halt to all arms sales to the country. 28 countries voted in favor, 13 abstained, and six voted against. Israel's ambassador accused the UN of anti-Israeli bias.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) has faced significant international scrutiny for its crimes against humanity in the ongoing Sudanese conflict, particularly concerning support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Reports indicate that the UAE has been a key supplier of military equipment to the RSF, including weapons and drones, which have been used in operations leading to widespread atrocities in regions like Darfur. Investigations have uncovered evidence suggesting that the UAE violated the United Nations arms embargo on Darfur by providing arms and ammunition to the RSF. This support has allegedly fueled the RSF's campaign of violence, contributing to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Sudan.\nIn early 2025, former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was arrested after an ICC warrant due to extrajudicial killings done during his war on drugs, which are alleged to be crimes against humanity. The killings during his presidency were allegedly done or aided by Philippine National Police generals, particularly former PNP chief now Senator Ronald \"Bato\" dela Rosa.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was termed \"Basic Law\" (, ) to indicate that it was a provisional piece of legislation pending the reunification of Germany. However, when reunification took place in 1990, the Basic Law was retained as the definitive constitution of reunified Germany. Its original field of application ()\u2014that is, the states that were initially included in the Federal Republic of Germany\u2014consisted of the three Western Allies' zones of occupation, but at the insistence of the Western Allies, formally excluded West Berlin. In 1990, the Two Plus Four Agreement between the two parts of Germany and all four Allies stipulated the implementation of a number of amendments.\nThe German word may be translated as either \"Basic Law\" or \"Fundamental Law\". The term \"constitution\" () was avoided as the drafters regarded the as an interim arrangement for a provisional West German state, expecting that an eventual reunified Germany would adopt a proper constitution, enacted under the provisions of Article 146 of the Basic Law, which stipulates that such a constitution must be \"freely adopted by the German people\". Nevertheless, although the amended Basic Law was approved by all four Allied Powers in 1990 (who thereby relinquished their reserved constitutional rights), it was never submitted to a popular vote, neither in 1949 nor in 1990. However, the Basic Law as passed in 1949 also contained Article 23 which provided for \"other parts of Germany\" to \"join the area of applicability of the Basic Law\" which was the provision that was used for German reunification from a constitutional standpoint. As the overwhelming consensus thereafter was that the German question was settled, and to reaffirm the renunciation of any residual German claim to land east of Oder and Nei\u00dfe, Article 23 was repealed the same day as reunification came into force. An unrelated article on the relationship between Germany and the European Union was instead inserted in its place two years later. As a heritage of the Lesser German solution, neither was unification with Austria aspired for. \nIn the preamble to the Basic Law, its adoption was declared as an action of the \"German people\", and Article 20 states \"All state authority is derived from the people\". These statements embody the constitutional principles that 'Germany' is identical with the German people, and that the German people act constitutionally as the primary institution of the German state. Where the Basic Law refers to the territory under the jurisdiction of this German state, it refers to it as the 'federal territory', so avoiding any inference of there being a constitutionally defined 'German national territory'.\nThe authors of the Basic Law sought to ensure that a potential dictator would never again be able to come to power in the country. Although some of the Basic Law is based on the Weimar Republic's constitution, the first article is a protection of human dignity (\"Menschenw\u00fcrde\") and human rights; they are core values protected by the Basic Law. The principles of democracy, republicanism, social responsibility, federalism and rule of law are key components of the Basic Law (Article 20). Articles 1 and 20 are protected by the so-called eternity clause (\"Ewigkeitsklausel\") Article 79 (3) that prohibits any sort of change or removal of the principles laid down in Articles 1 and 20.\nFundamental rights.\nFundamental rights () are guaranteed in Germany by the Federal Constitution and in some state constitutions. In the Basic Law, most fundamental rights are guaranteed in the first section of the same name (Articles 1 to 19). They are subjective public rights with the constitutional rank which bind all institutions and functions of the state. In cases where a federal or state law or public ordinance is alleged to be in violation of these fundamental rights, the Basic Law provides the constitutional complaint with an appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court (Article 93 paragraph 1 No. 4a). Article 1 of these fundamental rights, which states that human dignity shall be inviolable and all state authority shall respect and protect it, cannot be changed or removed. The same is true of Article 20, which enshrines fundamental principles of the state\u2014for example, that Germany is a state of law and a democracy. Laws which limit these basic rights are in no case allowed to affect the essence of these rights (Article 19 paragraph 2). Some people think every basic right cannot be changed or removed. However, that is a misconception as other fundamental rights are not protected by Article 79 paragraph 3 (Eternity Clause).\nAccording to this regulation the Federal Constitutional Court can be called not only because of a violation of fundamental rights, but also by violation \"of the rights set out in Article 20 paragraph 4 and Articles 33, 38, 101, 103 and 104\". Hence, these rights are called the rights identical to fundamental rights.\nExtensions of the field of application by Article 23.\nThe 1949 Basic Law was explicitly irredentist, maintaining that there remained separated parts of 'Germany as a whole' in the form of German peoples living outside the territory under the control of the Federal Republic of 1949, with whom the Federal Republic was constitutionally bound to pursue reunification, and in respect of whom mechanisms were provided by which such other parts of Germany might subsequently declare their accession to the Basic Law. Since initially the Basic Law did not apply for all of Germany, its legal provisions were only valid in its field of application (). This legal term was frequently used in West German legislation when West German laws did not apply to the entirety of German territory, as was usually the case.\nArticle 23 of the Basic Law provided other German states, initially not included in the field of application of the Basic Law, with the right to declare their accession () at a later date. Therefore, although the Basic Law was considered provisional, it allowed more parts of Germany to join its field of application. On one side, it gave the Federal Republic of Germany\u2014composed as it was in 1949\u2014no right to negotiate, reject or deny another German state's declaration of its accession to the FRG, subject to the FRG's recognising that state and being satisfied that the declaration of accession resulted from the free self-determination of its people; while on the other side an acceding state would have to accept the Basic Law and all laws so far legislated under the institutions of the FRG as they were. As the Federal Republic could not itself declare the accession of another part of Germany under Article 23, this provision could not be applied as an instrument of annexation, nor could accession under Article 23 be achieved by international treaty with third party states, although the Federal Constitutional Court recognised that a future declared accession could be framed as a compact between the Federal Republic and the acceding state. It remained unclear whether accession under Article 23 could be achieved by a part of Germany whose government was not recognised by the Federal Republic, and if so how; but in practice this situation did not arise. Article 23, altered after 1990, originally read as follows:\nWhereas the West German state had gained restricted sovereignty in May 1955, the Saarlanders rejected in a referendum (1955) the transformation of their protectorate into an independent state within the emerging European Economic Community. The Saar Treaty then opened the way for the government of the Saar Protectorate to declare its accession to the West German state under Article 23, including the new Saarland into the field of application of the Basic Law. The Saar held no separate referendum on its accession. With effect from 1 January 1957 the Federal Republic regarded itself as including almost all of Western Germany such that the only \"other parts of Germany\" to which Article 23 might be extended were now to the east, hence relinquishing all claims to those western parts of the former German Reich that had been surrendered to France and Denmark. (cf. Little Reunification with the Saar). The towns of Elten, Selfkant, and Suderwick, which had been occupied and annexed by Netherlands in 1949, were reunited with the Federal Republic in 1963 by means of an international treaty without invoking Article 23.\nThe Basic Law, in its original form, maintained the continuing existence of a larger Germany and German people, only parts of whom were currently organised within the Federal Republic. Nevertheless, the full extent of the implied wider German nation is nowhere defined in the Basic Law, although it was always clearly understood that the peoples of both East Germany and Berlin would be included. In its judgement of 1973, confirming the constitutional validity of the Basic Treaty between East Germany and West Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court justified the recognition of East Germany as a valid German state, on the basis that this would enable the GDR in the future to declare accession to the Basic Law under Article 23. But the Court then explicitly acknowledged that this limited recognition of the GDR also implied acceptance of the constitutional power of the GDR in the interim to enter into international treaties on its own account, naming specifically the treaty with Poland which confirmed the transfer of the \"Eastern Territories\" to Polish sovereignty.\nThe Communist regime in East Germany fell in 1990. Following free elections the parliament of the GDR (East Germany) declared the accession of the GDR according to Article 23 to the Federal Republic of Germany to come into effect on 3 October 1990, making unification an act unilaterally initiated by the last East German parliament. East Germany's \"declaration of accession\" () envisaged states within East Germany being included into the field of application of the Basic Law, but subject to the Basic Law first being amended in accordance with both the previously negotiated Unification Treaty between East and West Germany, and also the Two-Plus-Four Treaty, under which the Allied Powers had relinquished their residual German sovereignty. So, on the date of accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic of Germany Article 23 was repealed, representing an explicit commitment under Two-Plus-Four Treaty that, following the unification of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin, no \"other parts of Germany\" remained in east or west to which the Berlin Republic might validly be extended. Rather than adopting a new constitution under Article 146 of the Basic Law, the (Parliament of Germany) amended Article 146 and the Preamble of the Basic Law to state that German unification had now been fully achieved, while also adding a further clause 143(3) to entrench in the Basic Law the irreversibility of acts of expropriation undertaken by the Soviet occupying powers between 1945 and 1949. Hence when the GDR's nominal accession to the Federal Republic under Article 23 came into effect on 3 October 1990, Article 23 was no longer in place. Strictly therefore, German reunification was effected by the Unification Treaty between two sovereign states, the GDR and the Federal Republic, and not by the GDR's prior declaration of accession under Article 23, although the former Article 23 was agreed by both parties to the Treaty as setting the constitutional model by which unification would be achieved.\nAs part of the process, East Germany, which had been a unitary state since 1952, was re-divided into its initial five partially self-governing states (), being granted equal status as the already existing , with East and West Berlin reuniting into a new city-state (like Bremen and Hamburg). After the changes of the Basic Law, mostly pertaining to the accession in 1990, additional major modifications were made in 1994 (), 2002 and 2006 ().\nDrafting process.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We must be sure that what we construct will some day be a good house for all Germans.\u2014\u200a\nBetween February and June 1948, the London Six-Power Conference of the three western occupying powers (US, United Kingdom, France) and the three Western neighbours of Germany (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) was debating the political future of the three western occupation zones of Germany. The negotiations ended with the conclusion that a democratic and federal West German state was to be established.\nAs an immediate consequence of the London Six-Power Conference, the representatives of the three western occupation powers on 1 July 1948, convoked the \"Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten\" (minister-presidents) of the West German \"L\u00e4nder\" in Frankfurt am Main and committed to them the so-called Frankfurt Documents (\"Frankfurter Dokumente\"). The handover took place in the I.G. Farben building on the Campus Westend of today's Goethe University. These papers\u2014amongst other points\u2014summoned the Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten to arrange a constitutional assembly, that should work out a democratic and federal constitution for a West German state. According to Frankfurt Document No 1, the constitution should specify a central power of German government, but nevertheless respect the administration of the \"L\u00e4nder\" and it should contain provisions and guarantees of individual freedom and individual rights of the German people in respect to their government. With the specific request of a federal structure of a future German state the Western Powers followed German constitutional tradition since the foundation of the Reich in 1871.\nThe \"Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten\" were reluctant to fulfill what was expected from them, as they anticipated that the formal foundation of a West German state would mean a permanent disruption of German unity. A few days later they convened a conference of their own on Rittersturz ridge near Koblenz. They decided that any of the Frankfurt requirements should only be implemented in a formally provisional way. So the constitutional assembly was to be called Parlamentarischer Rat (lit. parliamentary council) and the constitution given the name of \"Basic Law\" instead of calling it a \"constitution\". By these provisions they made clear, that any West German state was not a definite state for the German people, and that future German self-determination and the reunification of Germany was still on their agenda. The \"Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten\" prevailed and the Western Powers gave in concerning this highly symbolic question.\nThe draft was prepared at the preliminary Herrenchiemsee convention (10\u201323 August 1948) on the Herreninsel in the Chiemsee, a lake in southeastern Bavaria. The delegates at the convention were appointed by the leaders of the newly formed (or newly reconstituted) \"L\u00e4nder\" (states).\nOn 1 September 1948 the Parlamentarischer Rat assembled and began working on the exact wording of the Basic Law. The 65 members of the Parlamentarischer Rat were elected by the parliaments of the German \"L\u00e4nder\" with one deputy representing about 750,000 people. After being passed by the Parliamentary Council assembled at the Museum Koenig in Bonn on 8 May 1949\u2014the museum was the only intact building in Bonn large enough to house the assembly\u2014and after being approved by the occupying powers on 12 May 1949, it was ratified by the parliaments of all the Trizonal \"L\u00e4nder\" with the exception of Bavaria. The Landtag of Bavaria rejected the Basic Law mainly because it was seen as not granting sufficient powers to the individual \"L\u00e4nder\", but at the same time decided that it would still come into force in Bavaria if two-thirds of the other L\u00e4nder ratified it. On 23 May 1949, in a solemn session of the Parliamentary Council, the German Basic Law was signed and promulgated. The time of \"legal nonentity\" ended, as the new West German state, the Federal Republic of Germany, came into being, although still under Western occupation.\nImportant differences from the Weimar Constitution.\nBasic rights are fundamental to the Basic Law, in contrast to the Weimar Constitution, which listed them merely as \"state objectives\". Pursuant to the mandate to respect human dignity, all state power is directly bound to guarantee these basic rights. Article 1 of the Basic Law, which establishes this principle that \"human dignity is inviolable\" and that human rights are directly applicable law, as well as the general principles of the state in Article 20, which guarantees democracy, republicanism, social responsibility and federalism, remain under the guarantee of perpetuity stated in Article 79 paragraph 3, i.e., the principles underlying these clauses cannot be removed even if the normal amendment process is followed.\nThere were, in the original version, no emergency powers such as those used by the \"Reichspr\u00e4sident\" in the Reichstag Fire Decree of 1933 to suspend basic rights and to remove communist members of the Reichstag from power, an important step for Hitler's . The suspension of human rights would also be illegal under Articles 20 and 79, as above. The right to resist is permitted against anyone seeking to abolish constitutional order, if other remedies were to fail under Article 20.\nThe constitutional position of the federal government was strengthened, as the \"Bundespr\u00e4sident\" has only a small fraction of the former power of the \"Reichspr\u00e4sident\", and in particular, is no longer in Supreme Command of the armed forces. Indeed, the original text of the Basic Law of 1949 made no provision for federal armed forces; only in 1955 was the Basic Law amended with Article 87a to allow the creation of a German military for the Federal Republic. The government now depends only on the parliament; while the military, by contrast with their status in the Weimar Republic, are entirely under parliamentary authority.\nTo remove the chancellor, the parliament has to engage in a Constructive vote of no confidence (\"Konstruktives Misstrauensvotum\"), i.e. the election of a new chancellor. The new procedure was intended to provide more stability than under the Weimar Constitution, when extremists on the left and right would vote to remove a chancellor, without agreeing on a new one, creating a leadership vacuum. In addition it was possible for the parliament to remove individual ministers by a vote of distrust, while it now has to vote against the cabinet as a whole.\nArticle 32 of the Basic Law allows the states to conduct foreign affairs with states with regards to matters falling within their purview, under supervision of the Federal Government.\nArticle 24 states that the Federal Government may \"transfer sovereign powers to international institutions\" and Article 25 states that \"general rules of international law shall be an integral part of federal law\". The latter article was included in deference to the post-war actions of the occupying Western powers; but had the unintended consequence that the Federal Constitutional Court tended to define \"rules of international law\" as applicable to German federal law within Germany, that were nevertheless different from the generality of rules and principles of international law as they might operate between Germany and other nations. Hence, the Federal Constitutional Court could recognise East Germany as a sovereign state in international law in the second sense, while still asserting that it was not a \"sovereign state in international law\" within Germany itself.\nBasic Law and German \"Sonderweg\".\nIn seeking to come to terms with Germany's catastrophic recent history, much discussion has focused on the key theory of a German \"Sonderweg\" (special way): the proposition that Germany had followed a path to modernity radically different from that of its European neighbours, that had rendered it particularly susceptible to militaristic, anti-humanitarian, totalitarian and genocidal impulses. The theory is much contested, but formed the major context for the original formulation of the Basic Law. The Basic Law sought \"to correct the course of Germany's Sonderweg\u2014to reclaim the German State from its special historical path, and to realise in postwar West Germany the Liberal Democratic Republic that had proved unachievable for the Frankfurt patriots of 1848 or the Weimar revolutionaries of 1919.\" In interpreting it, the Federal Constitutional Court seemed to \"have its eye on a Germany that might have been\".\nIn the dominant post-war narrative of West Germany, the Nazi regime was characterised as having been a 'criminal' state, illegal and illegitimate from the outset, while the Weimar Republic was characterised as having been a 'failed' state, whose inherent institutional and constitutional flaws had been exploited by Hitler in his illegal seizure of dictatorial powers. Consequently, following the death of Hitler in 1945 and the subsequent capitulation of the German Armed Forces, the national institutions and constitutional instruments of both Nazi Germany and the Weimar Republic were understood as entirely defunct, such that the Basic Law could be established in a condition of constitutional nullity. Nevertheless, although the Weimar Republic was now wholly irretrievable, avoiding its perceived constitutional weaknesses represented the predominant concern for the framers of the Basic Law.\nThe experience of the Weimar Republic had resulted in a widespread public perception that the principles of representative democracy and of the rule of law (\"Rechtsstaat\") were inherently in conflict with one another, and the Parliamentary Council drafting the Basic Law were well aware that their militantly pro-democratic ideals were far from generally shared in the bleak context of Germany in 1949. Hence they built into the Basic Law a strong instrument for guardianship of the \"free democratic basic order\" of the Federal Republic, in the form of the Federal Constitutional Court, representing a 'staggering conferral of judicial authority'. Unlike the United States Supreme Court the Federal Constitutional Court not only has jurisdiction in constitutional matters, but also exclusive jurisdiction in such matters; all other courts must refer constitutional cases to it. The intention of the framers of the Basic Law was that this court would range widely against any tendency to slip back toward non-democratic ways: \"a strict but benevolent guardian of an immature democracy that cannot quite trust itself\". As such the Federal Constitutional Court had the power to ban political parties whose objectives or actions threatened the 'free democratic basic order'.\nThe Basic Law places at its head a guarantee of inviolable fundamental rights. Initially it was intended to limit these to classic formulations of civil freedoms, as with equality before the law, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of occupation and freedom of religious conscience. In the event particular interests pushed for additional consideration: the Catholic Church (through CDU/CSU representatives) succeeded in inserting protection both for 'Marriage and the Family\" and for parental responsibility for children's education, SPD representatives then amended this to protect additionally the rights of children born outside marriage, and Elisabeth Selbert (one of only four women on the 70-strong panel) was eventually successful in a largely lone campaign to gain constitutional protection for sex equality. Notwithstanding this, there was a striking disjunction between the social context of two-parent, family households assumed in the Basic Law, and the everyday reality of German society in 1949, where over half of adult women were unmarried, separated or widowed, where the effective working population was overwhelmingly female, and where millions of expellees, refugees and displaced families were still without permanent accommodation. It was not until 1994 that constitutional protection was extended against discrimination on grounds of disability, while discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is still not disallowed within the Basic Law.\nLegal status of Germany.\nAs adopted by West Germany in 1949 as an interim constitution, the preamble of the Basic Law looked forward explicitly to a future free and united German state: \"The entire German people is called upon to accomplish, by free self-determination, the unity and freedom of Germany.\" This was understood as embedding in the Basic Law both the proposition that Germany in 1949 was neither unified nor free, and also as binding the new Federal Republic to a duty to pursue the creation of such a free and unified Germany \"on behalf of those Germans to whom participation was denied\". The Basic Law potentially provided two routes for the establishment of a reborn and unified German state: either under Article 23 whereby 'other parts of Germany' over and above the named States of the Federal Republic (\"Bundesl\u00e4nder\") could subsequently declare their accession, or under Article 146 where constituent power (\"pouvoir constituant\") could be exercised by elected representatives of the entirety of the German people in creating a new permanent constitution that would replace the Basic Law. Adoption of a constitution under Article 146 would have implied that the legal validity of a unified German State would rest on \"a free decision by the German people\" as a whole.\nFollowing the surrender of the German High Command and the dissolution of the Flensburg Government in May 1945, no effective national government of any sort existed in Germany and all national military and civil authority and powers were thereon exercised by the four Allies. The Allies maintained in fact that sovereign authorities wielding state powers no longer existed in the former German Reich; so, as the 'highest authority' for Germany, they were entitled to assume all sovereign powers without limitation of duration or scope, and could legitimately impose whatever measures on the German people within German national territory as any government could legally do on its own people\u2014including validly ceding parts of that territory and people to another country. They argued furthermore that international conventions constraining occupying powers in wartime from enforcing fundamental changes of governmental system, economic system or social institutions within the territory under their control\u2014the Hague Regulations of Land Warfare and the Geneva Conventions\u2014did not apply, and could not apply, as the termination of Nazi Germany and the total Denazification of German institutions and legal structures had been agreed by the Allies as absolute moral imperatives. Consequently, the Potsdam Agreement envisaged that an eventual self-governing state would emerge from the wreckage of WWII covering 'Germany as a whole', but that this new state would have no claim to sovereignty other than as derived from the sovereignty then being assumed by the Allies, and its constitution would also require the approval of all the Allies. From the 1950s onwards, however, a school of German legal scholars developed the alternative view that the Allies had only taken custody of German sovereignty while the former German state had been rendered powerless to act, and that consequently, once a freely constituted German government had come into being in the form of the Federal Republic, it could resume the identity and legal status of the former German Reich without reference to the Allied Powers.\nFrom the 1950s, the claim that there was a single continuing German Reich, and that in some sense the Federal Republic and the Federal Republic alone could represent that Reich, was adopted both by the Federal Government itself and by the Federal Constitutional Court. Initially, the 1949 constitution of the German Democratic Republic adopted a mirror image version of this claim, being framed in anticipation of a future all-German constitution on its own political terms, but it was replaced with a new constitution in 1968 that made no references to a wider national German nation, and from that date the GDR maintained that from 1949 there had existed two entirely separate sovereign German states. The Federal Republic's Cold-war Allies supported its claims in part, as they acknowledged the Federal Republic as the sole legitimate democratically organised state within former German territory (the GDR being held to be a Soviet puppet state), but they did not accept the associated arguments for the Reich's continuing 'metaphysical' existence \"de jure\" within the organs of the Federal Republic alone. Subsequently, under the \"Ostpolitik\", the Federal Republic in the early 1970s sought to end hostile relations with the countries of the Eastern Bloc, in the course of which it negotiated in 1972 a Basic Treaty with the GDR, recognising it as one of two German states within one German nation, and relinquishing any claim to \"de jure\" sovereign jurisdiction over East Germany. The Treaty was challenged in the Federal Constitutional court, as apparently contradicting the overriding aspirations of the Basic Law for a unified German state; but the Treaty's legality was upheld by the Court, heavily qualified by a reassertion of the claim that the German Reich continued to exist as an 'overall state' such that the duty to strive for future German unity could not be abandoned while East and West Germany remained disunited, albeit that without any institutional organs of itself the 'overall' Reich was currently not capable of action.\nAccording to the 1973 decision of the Federal Constitutional Court, Article 23 of the Basic Law required the Federal Republic to be \"legally open\" to the accession of those former parts of Germany who were then organised into the German Democratic Republic, and they noted that this implied that the Federal Republic could recognise the capability of the GDR state, as then constituted, of so declaring its accession. In this sense, the Basic Treaty's recognition of the GDR as a \"de jure\" German State and as a valid state in international relations (albeit without then according it within West Germany with the status of a separate sovereign state) could be interpreted as furthering the long-term objective of eventual German unification, rather than as contradicting it. On 23 August 1990 the \"Volkskammer\" of the GDR did indeed declare its accession to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law, but postdated to come into effect on 3 October 1990, and conditional on fundamental amendments being made to the Basic Law in the interim. These amendments were required to implement the series of constitutional changes to the Basic Law that had been agreed both in the Unification Treaty between the GDR and the Federal Republic, and in the 'Two Plus Four Treaty' (Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany), and had the general effect of removing or rewording all the clauses (including Article 23) on which the Federal Constitutional Court had relied in support of its claim to the continued legal identity of the German Reich as an 'overall state'. Specifically too, the Basic Law was then amended such that the constitutional duty of the German people to strive for unity and freedom was stated as now fully realised, and consequently that the expanded 'Berlin Republic' could no longer be \"legally open\" to further accessions of former German territories.\nConstitutional institutions.\nThe Basic Law established Germany as a parliamentary democracy with separation of powers into executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\nThe executive branch consists of the largely ceremonial Federal President as head of state and the Federal Chancellor, the head of government, normally (but not necessarily) the leader of the largest grouping in the Bundestag.\nThe legislative branch is represented by the Bundestag, elected directly through a mixed-member proportional representation, with the German \"L\u00e4nder\" participating in legislation through the Bundesrat, reflecting Germany's federal structure.\nThe judicial branch is headed by the Federal Constitutional Court, which oversees the constitutionality of laws.\nPresidency.\nIn Germany's parliamentary system of government, the Federal Chancellor runs the government and the day-to-day affairs of state. However, the German President's role is more than merely ceremonial. By his or her actions and public appearances, the Federal President represents the state itself, its existence, its legitimacy, and unity. The President's office has an integrative role and the controlling function of upholding the law and the constitution. It has also a \"political reserve function\" for times of crisis in the parliamentary system of government. The Federal President gives direction to general political and societal debates and has some important \"reserve powers\" in case of political instability (such as those provided for by Article 81). \nUnder Article 59 paragraph 1, the Federal President represents the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of international law, concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and accredits diplomats. Furthermore, all federal laws must be signed by the President before they can come into effect; however, he/she can only veto a law that he believes to violate the constitution.\nExecutive branch.\nThe Chancellor is the head of government and the most influential figure in German day-to-day politics, as well as the head of the Federal Government, consisting of ministers appointed by the Federal President on the Chancellor's suggestion. While every minister governs his or her department autonomously, the Chancellor may issue overriding policy guidelines. The Chancellor is elected for a full term of the Bundestag and can only be dismissed by parliament electing a successor in a \"constructive vote of no confidence\".\nJudicial branch.\nFederal Constitutional Court.\nThe guardian of the Basic Law is the German Federal Constitutional Court (\"Bundesverfassungsgericht\") which is both an independent constitutional organ and at the same time part of the judiciary in the sectors of constitutional law and public international law. Its judgements have the legal status of ordinary law. It is required by law to declare statutes as null and void if they are in violation of the Basic Law. Although judgements of the Federal Constitutional Court are supreme over all other counts, it is not a court of appeal; the FCC only hears constitutional cases, and maintains sole jurisdiction in all such cases, to the exclusion of all other courts.\nThe court is famous for nullifying several high-profile laws, passed by large majorities in the parliament. An example is the , which would have allowed the Bundeswehr to shoot down civilian aircraft in case of a terrorist attack. It was ruled to be in violation of the guarantee of life and human dignity in the Basic Law.\nThe Federal Constitutional Court decides on the constitutionality of laws and government actions under the following circumstances:\nThe Weimar Constitution did not institute a court with similar powers. When the Basic Law is amended, this has to be done explicitly; the concerning article must be cited. Under Weimar the constitution could be amended without notice; any law passed with a two-thirds majority vote was not bound by the constitution. Under the Basic Law the fundamentals of the constitution in Articles 1 and 20, the fundamental rights in Articles 1 to 19, and key elements of the federalist state, cannot be removed. Especially important is the protection of the division of state powers into the legislative, executive and judicial branches. This is provided by Article 20. A clear separation of powers was considered imperative to prevent measures like an over-reaching Enabling act, as happened in Germany in 1933. This act had given the government legislative powers which effectively finished the Weimar Republic and led to the dictatorship of Nazi Germany.\nOther courts.\nArticle 95 establishes the Federal Court of Justice, the Federal Administrative Court, the Federal Finance Court, the Federal Labour Court and the Federal Social Court as supreme courts in their respective areas of jurisdiction.\nArticle 96 authorizes the establishment by federal law of the Federal Patent Court, of federal military criminal courts having jurisdiction only in a state of defense or on soldiers serving abroad, and of a federal disciplinary court. Article 92 establishes that all courts other than the federal courts established under the Basic Law are courts of the \"L\u00e4nder\".\nArticle 101 bans extraordinary courts, such as the \"Volksgerichtshof\".\nGeneral provisions for the judiciary and rights of the accused.\nArticle 97 provides for judicial independence. Article 102 abolishes capital punishment. \nArticle 103 mandates a fair trial, forbids retroactive criminal legislation and multiple punishment for the same criminal act. During the establishment of the \"Grundgesetz\" in West Germany, politicians like Thomas Dehler\u2014the federal chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and Federal Minister of Justice\u2014advocated for the ideal of the \"Rechtsstaat\", or the state molded by the rule of law. Thus, criminal justice issues such as amnesty towards former Nazis, were encompassed by Article 103\u2019s ban on retroactive punishment. This was also echoed by the concept of \"Schlu\u00dfstrich\", the \u201cfinal stroke\u201d or settlement on criminal affairs. While politicians raised concerns over granting amnesty to perpetrators who committed or abetted murderous policies under the Nazis, the Bundestag ended up approving Article 103, including an extension of a statute of limitations for Nazi-related murders. When the Basic Law extended its scope into East German regions upon reunification in 1990, concerns regarding Article 103 were enlivened. At the time, courts in the new unified state dealt with the legal dilemma of liability of border guards from the GDR who killed escaping refugees between the former East-West border. Thus, the Federal German Constitutional Court had to decide whether there existed a violation of an inadmissibility of retroactive punishment in the criminal statute. Since Article 103 only permitted prosecution for an offense when it occurred under the applicable law, the Constitutional Court rejected the appeals. The prohibition of retroactive punishment in Article 103 has been likened to double jeopardy in common law systems, such as the U.S.\nArticle 104 mandates that deprivation of personal liberty must be provided for by statute and authorised by a judge before the end of the day following the arrest (analogous to the common law concept of Habeas corpus), and that a relative or a person in the confidence of the prisoner must be notified of a judicial decision imposing detention. The German Constitution (i.e. the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany) unmistakably outlines the presumption of innocence. \nLegislative branch.\nBundestag.\nThe main body of the legislative branch is Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, which enacts federal legislation, including the budget. Each member of the Bundestag has the right to initiate legislation, as do the cabinet and the Bundesrat. The Bundestag also elects the Chancellor, the head of government, usually (but not necessarily) the leader of the majority party or the party with a plurality of seats in the Bundestag, and takes part in the election of the Federal President.\nBundesrat.\nThe Bundesrat represents the \"L\u00e4nder\" (states) and participates in federal legislation. The Bundesrat's power has grown over the years, as the fields of federal legislation were extended at the expense of state legislation. In return, the number of laws requiring the assent of the Bundesrat was also extended.\nEarly elections.\nThe Basic Law contains no clear provision to call early elections. Neither the chancellor nor the Bundestag has the power to call elections, and the president can do so only if the chancellor so requests after losing a vote of confidence. This was designed to avoid the chronic instability of Weimar Republic governments. However, early elections have been called three times (1972, 1982, and 2005). The last two occasions were considered controversial moves and were referred to the constitutional court for review.\nIn April 1972, Chancellor Willy Brandt's SPD/FDP coalition had lost its majority in the Bundestag after several defections, so the opposition CDU/CSU proposed Rainer Barzel as the new chancellor in a constructive vote of no confidence. Surprisingly, three representatives of CDU/CSU abstained and the motion failed by two votes. Nevertheless, the coalition clearly could not continue, so Brandt proposed a vote of confidence that September (after the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich) which failed. It was later revealed that the East German Ministry for State Security had bribed the two dissenting representatives.\nIn 1982, CDU Chancellor Helmut Kohl had been installed through a constructive vote of no confidence after the FDP dissolved its coalition with the SPD to work with the CDU/CSU instead. He then intentionally lost a confidence vote in order to call an early election to strengthen the new coalition's majority in the Bundestag. The constitutional court examined the case, and decided that the vote was valid, but with reservations. The court emphasized this was only acceptable if the Chancellor has reason to believe he cannot continue to effectively govern with the current balance of power. It decided Kohl could believe this since the FDP was not only deeply divided by the change of coalition, but had already agreed to early elections, meaning in theory it no longer had to support the government.\nIn 2005, SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der led a coalition with the Greens. A heavy defeat for the SPD in the 2005 North Rhine-Westphalia state election gave the opposition a majority in the \"Bundesrat\". Schr\u00f6der subsequently also called a confidence vote which he deliberately lost. President Horst K\u00f6hler then called elections for 18 September 2005. The constitutional court agreed to the validity of this procedure on 25 August 2005, and the elections duly took place.\nRole of political parties.\nIn contrast to Weimar, political parties are explicitly mentioned in the constitution, i.e., officially recognized as important participants in politics. Parties are obliged to adhere to the democratic foundations of the German state. Parties found in violation of this requirement may be abolished by the constitutional court. In the Weimar Republic, the public image of political parties was clearly negative and they were often regarded as vile. At the same time there was no obligation to adhere to democratic standards (in contrast, the Basic Law stipulates that parties' \"... internal organisation must conform to democratic principles\", which precludes any party using the F\u00fchrerprinzip, even internally).\nOther stipulations.\nRole of the military.\nFrom the outset, the Basic Law guaranteed the right of conscientious objection to war service (Article 4), and prohibited the Federal Republic from activities preparing for or engaging in aggressive war (Article 26). These provisions remain in force. Also in the 1949 Basic Law, Article 24 empowered the federal government to join international systems for mutual collective security; but made no specific provision for West German rearmament.\nThe Basic Law was amended in 1955 with Article 87a allowing the creation from new of federal armed forces, the \"Bundeswehr\". The \"Bundeswehr\" therefore has no constitutional or legal continuity with either the \"Reichswehr\" of the Weimar Republic, or with the \"Wehrmacht\" of WWII Germany.\nThe Weimar Constitution had contributed to the Reichswehr becoming a state within a state, outside of the control of the parliament or the public. The army directly reported to the President who himself was not dependent on the parliament. Under the Basic Law, during times of peace, the Bundeswehr is under the command of the Minister of Defence, and during war-time under the Federal Chancellor. The Chancellor is directly responsible to the parliament, the Minister is indirectly responsible to the parliament because it can remove the entire Cabinet by electing a new chancellor.\nThe Basic Law also institutes the parliamentary post of the \"Wehrbeauftragter\" (\"defense commissioner\"), reporting once a year to parliament, not to the executive. The \"Wehrbeauftragter\" is a soldiers' ombudsman who can be petitioned directly by soldiers, bypassing the chain of command. Disciplinary measures against soldiers petitioning the \"Wehrbeauftragter\" are prohibited. From eleven defense commissioners until 2013 eight performed military or war services. Six hold an officer's rank (or reserve officer's rank), two of them, as Vizeadmiral Hellmuth Heye, were high-ranking and decorated admirals or generals of the Wehrmacht.\nAlthough this is not explicitly spelled out in the Basic Law, a number of Constitutional Court cases in the 1990s established that the military may not be deployed by the government outside of NATO territory without a specific resolution of parliament, which describes the details of the mission and limits its term. There are also strict restrictions on the intervention of the military within Germany (i.e. a ban of the military being used for police-type duties), which generally only allow the military to act in unarmed roles within Germany (such as disaster relief).\nReferendums and plebiscites.\nUnlike the Weimar Constitution, the Basic Law only names referendums, concerning the federal level of legislation, on a single issue: a new delimitation of the federal territory. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg was founded following a 1952 referendum that approved the fusion of three separate states. In a 1996 referendum the inhabitants of Berlin and Brandenburg rejected a proposed merger of the two states. After referendums on reestablishing to L\u00e4nder borders as existed in the Weimar Republic all failed, this institution has not been used, as minor border changes can be done by state contract.\nThe denial of referendums in other cases was designed to avoid the kind of populism that allowed the rise of Hitler. Yet Article 20 states that \"All state authority is derived from the people. It shall be exercised by the people through elections and other votes [\"Abstimmungen\"] and through specific legislative, executive and judicial bodies\". These \"other votes\"\u2014the words are to be understood meaning votes on legislative issues\u2014are, by now, common practice on the level of the L\u00e4nder. Claims of extending this practice also to the federal level have an undisputed constitutional basis in the Article 20, being \"the\" general and unchangeable article on state structure. However, this could only be conferred by a constitutional amendment nevertheless.\nAmendments.\nProcess.\nArticle 79 states the Basic Law may be amended by an absolute two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. Such a vote may not remove any of the principles underlying Articles 1 and 20 as defined by the eternity clause, or remove or otherwise affect the essence of, any of the fundamental rights originally specified in Articles 1 to 19, but may clarify, extend or refine those original principles and fundamental rights. Where however Articles 1 to 20 have subsequently been amended or extended, any additional words and phrases are not protected by the eternity clause but may be further amended or removed through the normal constitutional process.\nHistory.\nThe Basic Law had been amended 50 times as of 2003. Important changes to the Basic Law were the re-introduction of conscription and the establishment of the Bundeswehr in 1956. Therefore, several articles were introduced into the constitution, e.g., Articles 12a, 17, 45a-c, 65a, 87a-c. Another important reform was the introduction in 1968 of emergency competencies, for example Article 115 paragraph (1). This was done by a grand coalition of the two main political parties (CDU/CSU and SPD) and was accompanied by heated debate. In the following year there were changes to the articles regarding the distribution of taxes between federal government and the states of Germany.\nDuring reunification, the two states discussed the possibility of drafting a new common constitution followed by a plebiscite, as envisioned in Article 146, but this path was ultimately not taken. Instead the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic decided to keep the Basic Law, amended in accordance with the terms of the Two plus Four Treaty, because it had proved to be effective in West Germany. To facilitate reunification and to reassure other states, the FRG made some changes to the Basic Law. Article 23 was fulfilled by reunification itself, and then withdrawn to indicate that there were no other parts of Germany that existed outside of the unified territory.\nThe question of \"using\" Article 146 to draw a new constitution, and hold a referendum, was left to the twelfth (and first all-German) Bundestag, which after consideration decided against a new draft. However, the Bundestag passed the constitutional reform of 1994, a minor change, but still fulfilling the constitutional question together with some other amendments between 1990 and 1994. For example, affirmative action was allowed in women's rights under Article 3, and environmental protection was made a policy objective of the state in the new Article 20a. Article 3 was also reworded to ban discrimination on grounds of disability. In 1992, membership in the European Union was institutionalised (new Article 23). For the privatisation of the railways and the postal service, amendments were necessary as well.\nSince then, there have only been minor amendments, with the exception of the Balanced Budget Amendment added in 2009, which became fully effective in 2016. In 2002, the protection of animals was explicitly mentioned in Article 20a.\nThe most controversial debate arose concerning the limitation of the right to asylum in 1993 as in the current version of Article 16a. This change was later challenged and confirmed in a judgment by the constitutional court. Another controversy was spawned by the limitation of the right to the invulnerability of the private domain (\"Unverletzlichkeit der Wohnung\") by means of acoustic observation (\"Gro\u00dfer Lauschangriff\"). This was done by changes to Article 13 paragraph (3) and Article 6. The changes were challenged in the Federal Constitutional Court, but the judges confirmed the changes. Other changes took place regarding a redistribution of competencies between federal government and the \"L\u00e4nder\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This date was chosen as the customary German Unity Day, and has thereafter been celebrated each year as a national holiday. On the same date, East and West Berlin were also reunified into a single city, which eventually became the capital of Germany.\nThe East German government, controlled by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), started to falter on 2 May 1989, when the removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria opened a hole in the Iron Curtain. The border was still closely guarded, but the Pan-European Picnic and the indecisive reaction of the rulers of the Eastern Bloc started off an irreversible movement. It allowed an exodus of thousands of East Germans fleeing to West Germany via Hungary. The Peaceful Revolution, part of the international revolutions of 1989 including a series of protests by East German citizens, led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and the GDR's first free elections on 18 March 1990, and then to negotiations between the two countries that culminated in a Unification Treaty. Other negotiations between the two Germanies and the four occupying powers in Germany produced the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, which granted on 15 March 1991 full sovereignty to a reunified German state, whose two parts had previously been bound by a number of limitations stemming from their post-World War II status as occupation zones, though it was not until 31 August 1994 that the last Russian occupation troops left Germany.\nAfter the end of World War II in Europe, the old German Reich, consequent on the unconditional surrender of all German armed forces and the total absence of any German central government authority, had effectively ceased to exist, and Germany was occupied and divided by the four Allied countries. There was no peace treaty. Two countries emerged. The American-occupied, British-occupied, and French-occupied zones combined to form the FRG, i.e., West Germany, on 23 May 1949. The Soviet-occupied zone formed the GDR, i.e., East Germany, in October 1949. The West German state joined NATO in 1955. In 1990, a range of opinions continued to be maintained over whether a reunited Germany could be said to represent \"Germany as a whole\" for this purpose. In the context of the revolutions of 1989; on 12 September 1990, under the Two Plus Four Treaty with the four Allies, both East and West Germany committed to the principle that their joint pre-1990 boundary constituted the entire territory that could be claimed by a government of Germany.\nThe reunited state is not a successor state, but an enlarged continuation of the 1949\u20131990 West German state. The enlarged Federal Republic of Germany retained the West German seats in the governing bodies of the European Economic Community (EEC) (later the European Union) and in international organizations including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United Nations (UN), while relinquishing membership in the Warsaw Pact (WP) and other international organizations to which only East Germany belonged.\nNaming.\nThe term \"German reunification\" was given to the process of the German Democratic Republic joining the Federal Republic of Germany with full German sovereignty from the four Allied-occupied countries to distinguish it from the process of unification of most of the German states into the German Empire (German Reich) led by the Kingdom of Prussia that took place from 18 August 1866 to 18 January 1871, 3 October 1990 was the day when Germany again became a single nation-state. However, for political and diplomatic reasons, West German politicians carefully avoided the term \"reunification\" during the runup to what Germans frequently refer to as \"Die Wende\" (roughly: \"the turning point\"). The 1990 treaty defines the official term as (\"German unity\"); this is commonly used in Germany.\nAfter 1990, the term became more common. The term generally refers to the events (mostly in Eastern Europe) that led up to the actual reunification, and loosely translates to \"the turning point\". Anti-communist activists from Eastern Germany rejected the term as it had been introduced by the SED Secretary General Egon Krenz.\nSome people have stated that the reunification can be classified as an annexation of the GDR by the FRG. Scholar Ned Richardson-Little from the University of Erfurt noted that the terminology of an annexation can be interpreted from backgrounds across the political spectrum. In 2015, a Russian proposal was made that classified it as an annexation. Mikhail Gorbachev named it 'nonsense'. In 2010, Matthias Platzeck referred to the reunification as an 'anschluss'.\nPrecursors to reunification.\nAfter the suicide of Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945, Karl D\u00f6nitz assumed the title of \"Reichspr\u00e4sident\" in accordance with Hitler's last political testament. As such, he authorised the signing of the unconditional surrender of all German armed forces, which took effect on 8 May 1945. He tried to establish a government under Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk in Flensburg. This government, however, was not recognised by the Allies; and D\u00f6nitz and all its other members were arrested on 23 May by British forces. On 5 June 1945, in Berlin, the supreme commanders of the four occupying powers signed a common Berlin Declaration, which formally confirmed the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, as well as the complete legal extinction of the German Reich with the death of Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945 Germany was occupied by four countries representing the victorious Allies signing the agreement (US, UK, France, and the USSR). The declaration also formed the Allied Control Council (ACC) of these four countries ruling Germany, and confirmed the German borders which had been in force before the annexation of Austria. With the Potsdam Agreement at the Potsdam Conference between the three main Allies defeating the European Axis (US, UK, and the USSR) on 2 August 1945, Germany was divided by the Allies into occupation zones, each under the military government of one of these four countries. The agreement also modified Germany's border, with the country \"de facto\" losing its former territories east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line to Poland and the Soviet Union (most for Poland because the eastern territories of former Poland were annexed by the USSR). Germany's border decision came under pressure from Stalin, the dictator of the Soviet Union. During and after the war, many ethnic Germans who had lived in the historically German lands in Central and Eastern Europe, including territories east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line, fled and were expelled to post-war German and Austrian territory. Saarland, an area in the French occupation zone, was separated from Germany when its own constitution took effect, to become a French protectorate on 17 December 1947.\nDevelopments from 1948.\nAmong the Allies, geo-political tension between the Soviet Union and Western Allies in occupied Germany as part of their tension in the world led the Soviets to \"de facto\" withdraw from the ACC on 20 March 1948 (four occupying countries restored the act of the ACC in 1971) and blockade West Berlin (after the introduction of a new currency in West Germany on 20 June of the same year) from 20 June 1948 to 12 May 1949, but the USSR could not force the three Western Allies to withdraw from West Berlin as they wanted; consequently, the foundation of a new German state became impossible. The Federal Republic of Germany, or \"West Germany\", a liberal democracy, was established in the US, UK, and French zones on 23 May 1949. West Germany was \"de jure\" established in the Trizone occupied by three Western Allies and established on 1 August 1948. Its forerunner was the Bizone formed by the US and UK zones on 1 January 1947 before the inclusion of the French zone. The Trizone did not include West Berlin, which was also occupied by three Western Allies, although the city was \"de facto\" part of the West German state; the German Democratic Republic or \"East Germany\", a communist state with a planned and public economy which declared itself as the new state and the successor of the German Reich, a legal-former German state (in contrast to the Federal Republic of Germany, which considered itself a state partially identical with the German Reich and not merely its successor, with the \"partial identity\" limited to apply only within its current \"de facto\" territory), was established in the Soviet zone on 7 October 1949. It \"de jure\" did not include East Berlin, occupied by the Soviets, although the city was \"de facto\" its capital: the severe ideological conflict between German politicians and sociologists in their self-governing east\u2013west society was preceded by the influence of higher foreign occupiers; however this only really rose to become official with the birth of the two countries of Germany in the context of the period of international tension during the Cold War. The capital of West Germany was Bonn; however it was only considered provisional due to the West German aspiration to establish Berlin as its capital, although at the time Berlin was divided, with the eastern part \"de facto\" managed by East Germany. East Germany originally also wanted to gain West Berlin and make the unified Berlin its capital.\n1952 onwards.\nThe Western Allies and West Germany rejected the Soviet Union's idea of neutral reunification in 1952, resulting in the two German governments continuing to exist side-by-side. Most of the border between two Germanies, and later the border in Berlin, were physically fortified and tightly controlled by East Germany from 1952 and 1961, respectively. The flags of the two German countries were originally the same, but in 1959 East Germany changed its flag. The West German government initially did not recognize the new and \"de facto\" German\u2013Polish border, nor East Germany, but later eventually recognized the border in 1972 (with the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw) and East Germany in 1973 (with the 1972 Basic Treaty) when applying a common policy to reconcile with the communist countries in the East. The East German government also had encouraged two-state status after initially denying the existence of the West German state, influenced by the Soviet policy of \"peaceful coexistence\". The mutual recognition of the two Germanies paved the way for both countries to be widely recognized internationally. The two Germanies joined the United Nations as two separate country members in 1973 and East Germany abandoned its goal of reunification with their compatriots in the West in a constitutional amendment the following year.\nMikhail Gorbachev had led the country as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union since 1985. During this time, the Soviet Union experienced a period of economic and political stagnation, and correspondingly decreased intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. In 1987, the United States President Ronald Reagan gave a famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down this wall\" which prevented freedom of movement in Berlin. The wall had stood as an icon for the political and economic division between East and West, a division that Churchill had referred to as the \"Iron Curtain\". Gorbachev announced in 1988 that the Soviet Union would abandon the Brezhnev Doctrine and allow the Eastern European countries to freely determine their own internal affairs. In early 1989, under a new era of Soviet policies of \"glasnost\" (openness) and \"perestroika\" (economic restructuring), and taken further by Gorbachev, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. Further inspired by other images of brave defiance, a wave of revolutions swept throughout the Eastern Bloc that year. \nIn May 1989, Hungary removed their border fence. However, the dismantling of the old Hungarian border facilities did not open the borders nor were the previous strict controls removed, and the isolation by the Iron Curtain was still intact over its entire length. The opening of a border gate between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic on 19 August 1989 then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer a GDR and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. Extensive advertising for the planned picnic was made by posters and flyers among the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, which was then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting them to a picnic near the border at Sopron. It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the Berlin Wall had been built in 1961. After the picnic, which was based on an idea of Karl's father Otto von Habsburg to test the reaction of the USSR and Mikhail Gorbachev to an opening of the border, tens of thousands of media-informed East Germans set off for Hungary. The media reaction of Erich Honecker in the \"Daily Mirror\" of 19 August 1989 showed the public in East and West that the Eastern European communist rulers had suffered a loss of power in their own sphere, and that they were no longer in control of events: \"Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, in which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Marks, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.\" In particular, Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay considered whether Moscow would command the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary to intervene. But, with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the nonintervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams. Thus, the bracket of the Eastern Bloc was broken.\nHungary was no longer ready to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use force of arms. By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East German citizens had escaped to the West before the GDR denied travel to Hungary, leaving Czechoslovakia as the only neighboring state to which East Germans could escape.\nEven then, many people within and outside Germany still believed that real reunification between the two countries would not happen in the foreseeable future. The turning point in Germany, called \"Die Wende\", was marked by the \"Peaceful Revolution\" leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall on the night of 9 November 1989, with East and West Germany subsequently entering into negotiations toward eliminating the division that had been imposed upon Germans more than four decades earlier.\nProcess of reunification.\nCooperation.\nOn 28 November 1989\u2014two weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall\u2014West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced a 10-point program calling for the two Germanies to expand their cooperation with a view toward eventual reunification.\nInitially, no timetable was proposed. However, events rapidly came to a head in early 1990. First, in March, the Party of Democratic Socialism\u2014the former Socialist Unity Party of Germany\u2014was heavily defeated in East Germany's first free elections. A grand coalition was formed under Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re, leader of the East German wing of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, on a platform of speedy reunification. Second, East Germany's economy and infrastructure underwent a swift and near-total collapse. Although East Germany was long reckoned as having the most robust economy in the Soviet bloc, the removal of Communist hegemony revealed the ramshackle foundations of that system. The East German mark had been almost worthless outside East Germany for some time before the events of 1989\u20131990, and the collapse of the East German economy further magnified the problem.\nEconomic merger.\nDiscussions immediately began on an emergency merger of the German economies. On 18 May 1990, the two German states signed a treaty agreeing on monetary, economic, and social union. This treaty is called \"Vertrag \u00fcber die Schaffung einer W\u00e4hrungs-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialunion zwischen der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik und der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" (\"Treaty Establishing a Monetary, Economic and Social Union between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany\"); it came into force on 1 July 1990, with the West German Deutsche Mark replacing the East German mark as the official currency of East Germany. The Deutsche Mark had a very high reputation among the East Germans and was considered stable. While the GDR transferred its financial policy sovereignty to West Germany, the West started granting subsidies for the GDR budget and social security system. At the same time, many West German laws came into force in the GDR. This created a suitable framework for a political union by diminishing the huge gap between the two existing political, social, and economic systems.\nGerman Reunification Treaty.\nThe Volkskammer, the Parliament of East Germany, passed a resolution on 23 August 1990 declaring the accession () of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, and the extension of the field of application of the Federal Republic's Basic Law to the territory of East Germany as allowed by Article 23 of the West German Basic Law, effective 3 October 1990. This Declaration of Accession () was formally presented by the President of the Volkskammer, Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, to the President of the West German Bundestag, Rita S\u00fcssmuth, by means of a letter dated 25 August 1990. Thus, formally, the procedure of reunification by means of the accession of East Germany to West Germany, and of East Germany's acceptance of the Basic Law already in force in West Germany, was initiated as the unilateral, sovereign decision of East Germany, as allowed by the provisions of article 23 of the West German Basic Law as it then existed.\nIn the wake of that resolution of accession, the \"German reunification treaty\", commonly known in German as \" (Unification Treaty) or \" (Reunification Treaty), that had been negotiated between the two German states since 2 July 1990, was signed by representatives of the two governments on 31 August 1990. This Treaty, officially titled (Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic on the Establishment of German Unity), was approved by large majorities in the legislative chambers of both countries on 20 September 1990 (440\u201347 in the West German Bundestag and 299\u201380 in the East German Volkskammer). The Treaty passed the West German Bundesrat on the following day, 21 September 1990. The amendments to the Federal Republic's Basic Law that were foreseen in the Unification Treaty or necessary for its implementation were adopted by the Federal Statute of 23 September 1990, that enacted the incorporation of the Treaty as part of the Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The said Federal Statute, containing the whole text of the Treaty and its Protocols as an annex, was published in the (the official journal for the publication of the laws of the Federal Republic) on 28 September 1990. In the German Democratic Republic, the constitutional law () giving effect to the Treaty was also published on 28 September 1990. With the adoption of the Treaty as part of its Constitution, East Germany legislated its own abolition as a separate state.\nUnder article 45 of the Treaty, it entered into force according to international law on 29 September 1990, upon the exchange of notices regarding the completion of the respective internal constitutional requirements for the adoption of the treaty in both East Germany and West Germany. With that last step, and in accordance with article 1 of the Treaty, and in conformity with East Germany's Declaration of Accession presented to the Federal Republic, Germany was officially reunited at 00:00 CEST on 3 October 1990. East Germany joined the Federal Republic as the five (states) of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. These states were the five original states of East Germany, but were abolished in 1952 in favor of a centralized system. As part of the 18 May treaty, the five East German states were reconstituted on 23 August. East Berlin, the capital of East Germany, reunited with West Berlin, a \"de facto\" part of West Germany, in order to form the city of Berlin, which joined the Federal Republic as its third city-state alongside Bremen and Hamburg. Berlin was still formally under Allied occupation (that would only be terminated later, as a result of the provisions of the Two Plus Four Treaty), but the city's administrative merger and inclusion in the enlarged Federal Republic as its capital, effective on 3 October 1990, had been greenlit by the four Allies, and were formally approved in the final meeting of the Allied Control Council on 2 October 1990. In an emotional ceremony, at the stroke of midnight on 3 October 1990, the black-red-gold flag of West Germany\u2014now the flag of a reunited Germany\u2014was raised above the Brandenburg Gate, marking the moment of German reunification.\nConstitutional merger.\nThe process chosen was one of the two options set out in the West German constitution ( or Basic Law) of 1949 to facilitate eventual reunification. The Basic Law stated that it was only intended for temporary use until a permanent constitution could be adopted by the German people as a whole. Under that document's (then existing) Article 23, any new prospective could adhere to the Basic Law by a simple majority vote. The initial 11 joining states of 1949 (down to 9 in 1952 with foundation of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) constituted the Trizone. West Berlin had been proposed as the 12th state, but this was legally inhibited by Allied objections since Berlin as a whole was legally a quadripartite occupied area. Despite this, West Berlin's political affiliation was with West Germany, and, in many fields, it functioned de facto as if it were a component state of West Germany. On 1 January 1957, before the reunification, the territory of Saarland, a protectorate of France (1947\u20131956), united with West Germany (and thus rejoined Germany) as the tenth state of the Federal Republic; this was called \"Little Reunification\" although the Saar Protectorate itself was only one disputed territory, as its existence was opposed by the Soviet Union.\nThe other option was set out in Article 146, which provided a mechanism for a permanent constitution for a reunified Germany. This route would have entailed a formal union between two German states that then would have had, among other things, to create a new constitution for the newly established country. However, by the spring of 1990, it was apparent that drafting a new constitution would require protracted negotiations that would open up numerous issues in West Germany. Even without this to consider, by the start of 1990 East Germany was in a state of economic and political collapse. In contrast, reunification under Article 23 could be implemented in as little as six months. Ultimately, when the treaty on monetary, economic, and social union was signed, it was decided to use the quicker process of Article 23. By this process, East Germany voted to dissolve itself and to join West Germany, and the area in which the Basic Law was in force was simply extended to include its constituent parts. Thus, while legally East Germany as a whole acceded to the Federal Republic, the constituent parts of East Germany entered into the Federal Republic as five new states, which held their first elections on 14 October 1990.\nNevertheless, although the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions, and qualifications, some of which required amendments to the Basic Law itself) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is, through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognizing each another as separate sovereign states in international law. This treaty was then voted into effect by both the Volkskammer and the Bundestag by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities, effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Hence, although the GDR declared its accession to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law, this did not imply its acceptance of the Basic Law as it then stood, but rather of the Basic Law as subsequently amended in line with the Unification Treaty.\nLegally, the reunification did not create a third state out of the two. Rather, West Germany effectively absorbed East Germany. Accordingly, on Unification Day, 3 October 1990, the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist, and five new federated states on its former territory joined the Federal Republic of Germany. East and West Berlin were reunited as the third full-fledged federated city-state of the enlarged Federal Republic. The reunited city became the capital of the enlarged Federal Republic. Under this model, the Federal Republic of Germany, now enlarged to include the five states of the former GDR plus the reunified Berlin, continued to exist under the same legal personality that was founded in May 1949.\nWhile the Basic Law was modified, rather than replaced by a constitution as such, it still permits the adoption of a formal constitution by the German people at some time in the future.\nUnification of Berlin.\nIn the context of urban planning, in addition to a wealth of new opportunity and the symbolism of two former independent states being rejoined, the reunification of Berlin presented numerous challenges. The city underwent massive redevelopment, involving the political, economic, and cultural environment of both East and West Berlin. However, the \"scar\" left by the Wall, which ran directly through the very heart of the city, had consequences for the urban environment that planning still needs to address.\nThe unification of Berlin presented legal, political, and technical challenges for the urban environment. The political division and physical separation of the city for more than 30 years saw the East and the West develop their own distinct urban forms, with many of these differences still visible to this day.\nAs urban planning in Germany is the responsibility of the city government, the integration of East and West Berlin was in part complicated by the fact that the existing planning frameworks became obsolete with the fall of the Wall. Prior to the reunification of the city, the Land Use Plan of 1988 and General Development Plan of 1980 defined the spatial planning criteria for West and East Berlin, respectively. These were replaced by the new, unified Land Use Plan in 1994. Termed \"Critical Reconstruction\", the new policy aimed to revive Berlin's prewar aesthetic; it was complemented by a strategic planning document for downtown Berlin, entitled \"Inner City Planning Framework\".\nFollowing the dissolution of the GDR on 3 October 1990, all planning projects under the socialist-totalitarian regime were abandoned. Vacant lots, open areas, and empty fields in East Berlin were subject to redevelopment, in addition to space previously occupied by the Wall and associated buffer zone. Many of these sites were positioned in central, strategic locations of the reunified city.\nGerman Unity Day.\nTo commemorate the day that marks the official unification of the former East and West Germany in 1990, 3 October has since then been the official national holiday of Germany, the German Unity Day (). It replaced the previous national holiday held in West Germany on 17 June commemorating the East German uprising of 1953 and the national holiday on 7 October in the GDR, that commemorated the Foundation of the East German state. An alternative date to commemorate the reunification could have been the day the Berlin Wall came down, 9 November (1989), which coincided with the anniversary of the proclamation of the German Republic in 1918, and the defeat of Hitler's first coup in 1923. However, 9 November was also the anniversary of the first large-scale Nazi-led pogroms against Jews in 1938 (\"Kristallnacht\"), so the day was considered inappropriate for a national holiday.\nDomestic opposition.\nThroughout the entire Cold War and until 1990, reunification did not appear likely, and the existence of two German countries was commonly regarded as an established, unalterable fact. Helmut Kohl briefly addressed this issue during the 1983 West German federal election, stating that despite his belief in German national unity, it would not mean a \"return to the nation-state of earlier times\". In the 1980s, opposition to a united German country and support for lasting peaceful coexistence between the two German countries were very common amongst left-wing parties of West Germany, especially the SPD and Greens. The division of Germany was considered necessary to maintain peace in Europe, and the emergence of another German state was also seen as possibly dangerous to the West German democracy. A German publicist Peter Bender wrote in 1981: \"Considering the role Germany played in the origins of both World Wars, Europe cannot, and the Germans should not, want a new German Reich, a sovereign nation-state. That is the logic of history which is, as Bismarck noted, more exact than the Prussian government audit office.\" Opinion on reunification was not only highly partisan, but polarised along many social divides\u2014Germans aged 35 or younger were opposed to unification, whereas older respondents were more supportive; likewise, low-income Germans tended to oppose reunification, whereas more affluent responders were likely to support it. Ultimately, a poll in July 1990 found that the main motivation for reunification was economic concern rather than nationalism.\nOpinion polls in the late 1980s showed that young East Germans and West Germans saw each other as foreign, and did not regard themselves as a single nation. Heinrich August Winkler observes that \"an evaluation of the corresponding data in the Deutschland Archive in 1989 showed that the GDR was perceived by a large portion of the younger generation as a foreign nation with a different social order which was no longer a part of Germany\". Winkler argues that the reunification was not a product of popular opinion, but rather \"crisis management on the highest level\". Support for unified Germany fell once the prospect of it became a tangible reality in the fall of 1989. A December 1989 poll by \"Der Spiegel\" indicated strong support for preserving East Germany as a separate state. However, SED members were overrepresented amongst the responders, constituting 13% of the population, but 23% of those polled. Reporting on a student protest in East Berlin on 4 November 1989, Elizabeth Pond noted that \"virtually none of the demonstrators interviewed by Western reporters said they wanted unification with the Federal Republic\". In West Germany, once it became clear that a course of quick unification was negotiated, the public responded with concern. In February 1990, two-thirds of West Germans considered the pace of unification as \"too fast\". West Germans were also hostile towards the newcomers from the East\u2014according to an April 1990 poll, only 11% of West Germans welcomed the refugees from East Germany.\nAfter unification, the national divide persisted\u2014a survey by the Allensbach Institute in April 1993 found that only 22% of West Germans and 11% of East Germans felt they were one nation. Dolores L. Augustine observed that \"the sense of oneness felt by East Germans and West Germans in the euphoric period after the fall of the wall proved all too transitory\", as the old divisions persisted and Germans not only still saw themselves as two separate people, but also acted in accordance with their separate, regional interests. This state of mind became known as \"Mauer im Kopf\" (\"wall in the head\"), suggesting that despite the fall of the Berlin Wall, a \"psychological wall\" still existed between East and West Germans. Augustine argues that despite resistance to the political regime of East Germany, it still represented the history and identity of East Germans. Unification caused backlash, and the Treuhandanstalt, an agency created to carry out privatization, was blamed for creating mass unemployment and poverty in the East.\nSocial groups and figures.\nAn influential part of the reunification opponents were the so-called Anti-Germans. Emerging from the student Left, Anti-Germans were supportive of Israel and strongly opposed German nationalism, arguing that an emergence of a united German state would also result in a return of fascism (Nazism). They considered the social and political dynamics of 1980s and 1990s Germany to be comparable to those of the 1930s, denouncing the emerging anti-Zionism, unification sentiments and reemergence of pan-Germanism. Hermann L. Gremliza, who left the SPD in 1989 because of its support for German unification, was repulsed by the universal support for unification amongst most major parties, stating that it reminded him of \"Social Democrats joining the National Socialists (Nazis) in singing the German national anthem in 1933, following Hitler's declaration of his foreign policy.\" Several thousand people joined the Anti-Germans' 1990 protests against German reunification.\nAccording to Stephen Brockmann, German reunification was feared and opposed by ethnic minorities, particularly those of East Germany. He observes that \"right-wing violence was on the rise throughout 1990 in the GDR, with frequent instances of beatings, rapes, and fights connected with xenophobia\", which led to a police lockdown in Leipzig on the night of reunification. Tensions with Poland were high, and many internal ethnic minorities such as the Sorbs feared further displacement or assimilationist policies; the Sorbs had received legal protection in the GDR and feared that the rights granted to them in East Germany would not be included in the law of an eventual united Germany. Ultimately, no provision on the protection of ethnic minorities was included in the post-unification reform of the Basic Law in 1994. While politicians called for acceptance of a new multiethnic society, many were unwilling to \"give up its traditional racial definition of German nationality\". Feminist groups also opposed the unification, as abortion laws were less restrictive in East Germany than in West Germany, and the progress that the GDR had made in regard to women's welfare such as legal equality, child care and financial support were \"all less impressive or non-existent in the West\". Opposition was also prevalent amongst Jewish circles, who had special status and rights in East Germany. Some Jewish intellectuals such as G\u00fcnter Kunert expressed concern of Jews being portrayed as part of the East German socialist elites, given that the Jews had unique rights, such as being allowed to travel west.\nThere was also a significant opposition to the unification in intellectual circles. Christa Wolf and Manfred Stolpe stressed the need to forge an East German identity, while \"citizens' initiatives, church groups, and intellectuals of the first hour began issuing dire warnings about a possible Anschluss of the GDR by the Federal Republic\". Many East German oppositionists and reformers advocated for a \"third path\" of an independent, democratic socialist East Germany. Stefan Heym argued that the preservation of the GDR was necessary to achieve the ideal of democratic socialism, urging East Germans to oppose \"capitalist annexation\" in favour of a democratic socialist society. In an attempt to preserve possibility for an independent socialist Germany, Wolf, Heym, and a union of left-wing writers of GDR issued the appeal \"For Our Country\" on November 28, 1989, to try to convince East Germans a possible future of socialist Germany. The appeal managed to gather over 1 million approvals by January, 1990, which is unprecedented in the history of GDR. Writers in both East and West were concerned about the destruction of the East German or West German cultural identity respectively; in \"Goodbye to the Literature of the Federal Republic\", Frank Schirrmacher states that the literature of both states had been central to the consciousness and unique identity of both nations, with this newly developed culture being now endangered by looming reunification. David Gress remarked that there was \"an influential view found largely, but by no means only, on the German and international left\" which saw \"the drive for unification as either sinister, masking a revival of aggressive nationalist aspirations, or materialist\".\nG\u00fcnter Grass, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1999, also expressed his vehement opposition to the unification of Germany, citing his tragic memories of World War II as the reason. According to Grass, the emergence of National Socialism and the Holocaust had deprived Germany of its right to exist as a unified nation state: he wrote: \"Historical responsibility dictates opposition to reunification, no matter how inevitable it may seem.\" He also claimed that \"national victory threatens a cultural defeat\", as \"blooming of German culture and philosophy is possible only at times of fruitful national disunity\", and also cited Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's opposition to the first unification of Germany in 1871: Goethe wrote: \"Frankfurt, Bremen, Hamburg, L\u00fcbeck are large and brilliant, and their impact on the prosperity of Germany is incalculable. Yet, would they remain what they are if they were to lose their independence and be incorporated as provincial cities into one great German Empire? I have reason to doubt this.\" Grass also condemned the unification as philistinist and purely materialist, calling it \"the monetary fetish, by now devoid of all joy.\" Heiner M\u00fcller supported Grass' criticism of the unification process, warning East Germans: \"We will be a nation without dreams, we will lose our memories, our past, and therefore also our ability to hope.\" British historian Richard J. Evans made a similar argument, criticizing the unification as driven solely by \"consumerist appetites whetted by years of watching West German television advertisements\".\nForeign support and opposition.\nFor decades, West Germany's allies stated their support for reunification. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who speculated that a country that \"decided to kill millions of Jewish people\" in the Holocaust \"will try to do it again\", was one of the few world leaders to publicly oppose it. As reunification became a realistic possibility, however, significant NATO and European opposition emerged in private.\nA poll of four countries in January 1990 found that a majority of surveyed Americans and French supported reunification, while British and Poles were more divided: 69 percent of Poles and 50 percent of French and British stated that they worried about a reunified Germany becoming \"the dominant power in Europe\". Those surveyed stated several concerns, including Germany again attempting to expand its territory, a revival of Nazism, and the German economy becoming too powerful. While British, French, and Americans favored Germany remaining a member of NATO, a majority of Poles supported neutrality for the reunified state.\nThe key ally was the United States. Although some top American officials opposed quick unification, Secretary of State James A. Baker and President George H. W. Bush provided strong and decisive support to Kohl's proposals.\nUnited Kingdom and France.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We defeated the Germans twice! And now they're back!\nBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was one of the most vehement opponents of German reunification. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Thatcher told Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev that neither the United Kingdom nor, according to her, Western Europe, wanted the reunification of Germany. Thatcher also clarified that she wanted the Soviet leader to do what he could to stop it, telling Gorbachev, \"We do not want a united Germany\". Although she welcomed East German democracy, Thatcher worried that a rapid reunification might weaken Gorbachev, and she favored Soviet troops staying in East Germany as long as possible to act as a counterweight to a united Germany.\nThatcher, who carried in her handbag a map of Germany's 1937 borders to show others the \"German problem\", feared that Germany's \"national character\", size, and central location in Europe would cause it to be a \"destabilizing rather than a stabilizing force in Europe\". In December 1989, she warned fellow European Community leaders at a Council summit in Strasbourg which Kohl attended, \"We defeated the Germans twice! And now they're back!\". Although Thatcher had stated her support for German self-determination in 1985, she now argued that Germany's allies only supported reunification because they did not believe it would ever happen. Thatcher favored a transition period of five years for reunification, during which the two Germanies would remain separate states. Although she gradually softened her opposition, as late as March 1990, Thatcher summoned historians and diplomats to a seminar at Chequers to ask \"How dangerous are the Germans?\", and the French ambassador in London reported that Thatcher told him, \"France and Great Britain should pull together today in the face of the German threat.\"\nThe pace of events surprised the French, whose Foreign Ministry had concluded in October 1989 that reunification \"does not appear realistic at this moment\". A representative of French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand reportedly told an aide to Gorbachev, \"France by no means wants German reunification, although it realises that in the end, it is inevitable.\" At the Strasbourg summit, Mitterrand and Thatcher discussed the fluidity of Germany's historical borders. On 20 January 1990, Mitterrand told Thatcher that a unified Germany could \"make more ground than even Adolf had\". He predicted that \"bad\" Germans would reemerge, who might seek to regain former German territory lost after World War II and would likely dominate Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, leaving \"only Romania and Bulgaria for the rest of us\". The two leaders saw no way to prevent reunification, however, as \"None of us was going to declare war on Germany\". Mitterrand recognized before Thatcher that reunification was inevitable and adjusted his views accordingly; unlike her, he was hopeful that participation in a single currency and other European institutions could control a united Germany. Mitterrand still wanted Thatcher to publicly oppose unification, however, to obtain more concessions from Germany.\nRest of Europe.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I love Germany so much that I prefer to see two of them.\nIreland's Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, supported German reunification and he took advantage of Ireland's presidency of the European Economic Community to call for an extraordinary European summit in Dublin in April 1990 to calm the fears held of fellow members of the EEC. Haughey saw similarities between Ireland and Germany, and said \"I have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two German States for unification\". \"Der Spiegel\" later described other European leaders' opinion of reunification at the time as \"icy\". Italy's Giulio Andreotti warned against a revival of \"pan-Germanism\" and the Netherlands's Ruud Lubbers questioned the German right to self-determination. They shared Britain's and France's concerns over a return to German militarism and the economic power of a reunified country. The consensus opinion was that reunification, if it must occur, should not occur until at least 1995 and preferably much later. Andreotti, quoting Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, joked \"I love Germany so much that I prefer to see two of them\".\nFinal settlement.\nThe victors of World War II\u2014France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, comprising the Four-Power Authorities\u2014retained authority over Berlin, such as control over air travel and its political status. From the onset, the Soviet Union sought to use reunification as a way to push Germany out of NATO into neutrality, removing nuclear weapons from its territory. However, West Germany misinterpreted a 21 November 1989 diplomatic message on the topic to mean that the Soviet leadership already anticipated reunification only two weeks after the Wall's collapse. This belief, and the worry that his rival Genscher might act first, encouraged Kohl on 28 November to announce a detailed \"Ten Point Program for Overcoming the Division of Germany and Europe\". While his speech was very popular within West Germany, it caused concern among other European governments, with whom he had not discussed the plan.\nThe Americans did not share the Europeans' and Soviets' historical fears over German expansionism; Condoleezza Rice later recalled,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The United States\u2014and President George H. W. Bush\u2014recognized that Germany went through a long democratic transition. It was a good friend, it was a member of NATO. Any issues that existed in 1945, it seemed perfectly reasonable to lay them to rest. For us, the question wasn't should Germany unify? It was how and under what circumstances? We had no concern about a resurgent Germany...\nThe United States wished to ensure, however, that Germany would stay within NATO. In December 1989, the administration of President George H. W. Bush made a united Germany's continued NATO membership a requirement for supporting reunification. Kohl agreed, although less than 20 percent of West Germans supported remaining within NATO. Kohl also wished to avoid a neutral Germany, as he believed that would destroy NATO, cause the United States and Canada to leave Europe, and cause Britain and France to form an anti-German alliance. The United States increased its support of Kohl's policies, as it feared that otherwise Oskar Lafontaine, a critic of NATO, might become Chancellor.\nHorst Teltschik, Kohl's foreign policy advisor, later recalled that Germany would have paid \"100 billion deutschmarks\" if the Soviets demanded it. The USSR did not make such great demands, however, with Gorbachev stating in February 1990 that \"[t]he Germans must decide for themselves what path they choose to follow\". In May 1990, he repeated his remark in the context of NATO membership while meeting Bush, amazing both the Americans and Germans. This removed the last significant roadblock to Germany being free to choose its international alignments, though Kohl made no secret that he intended for the reunified Germany to inherit West Germany's seats in NATO and the EC.\nDuring a NATO\u2013Warsaw Pact conference in Ottawa, Canada; Genscher persuaded the four powers to treat the two Germanies as equals instead of defeated junior partners and for the six nations to negotiate alone. Although the Dutch, Italians, Spanish, and other NATO powers opposed such a structure, which meant that the alliance's boundaries would change without their participation, the six nations began negotiations in March 1990. After Gorbachev's May agreement on German NATO membership, the Soviets further agreed that Germany would be treated as an ordinary NATO country, with the exception that former East German territory would not have foreign NATO troops or nuclear weapons. In exchange, Kohl agreed to reduce the sizes of the militaries of both West and East Germany, renounce weapons of mass destruction, and accept the postwar Oder\u2013Neisse line as Germany's eastern border. In addition, Germany agreed to pay about 55 billion deutschmarks to the Soviet Union in gifts and loans, the equivalent of eight days of the West German GDP. To oppose German reunification, the British insisted to the end, against Soviet opposition, that NATO be allowed to hold maneuvers in the former East Germany. Thatcher later wrote that her opposition to reunification had been an \"unambiguous failure\".\nGerman sovereignty and withdrawal of the Allied Forces.\nOn 15 March 1991, the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany\u2014which had been signed in Moscow on 12 September 1990, by the two German states that then existed (East and West Germany) on one side and by the four principal Allied powers (the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States) on the other\u2014entered into force, having been ratified by the Federal Republic of Germany (after the unification, as the united Germany) and by the four Allied states. The entry into force of that treaty (also known as the \"Two Plus Four Treaty\", in reference to the two German states and four Allied governments that signed it) put an end to the remaining limitations on German sovereignty and the ACC that resulted from the post-World War II arrangements. After the Americans intervened, both the United Kingdom and France ratified the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany in September 1990. The Treaty entered into force on 15 March 1991, in accordance with Article 9 of the Two Plus Four Treaty, it entered into force as soon as all ratifications were deposited with the Government of Germany, thus finalizing the reunification for purposes of international law. The last party to ratify the treaty was the Soviet Union, which deposited its instrument of ratification on 15 March 1991. The Supreme Soviet of the USSR only gave its approval to the ratification of the treaty on 4 March 1991, after considerable debate. Even before the ratification of the Treaty, the operation of all quadripartite Allied institutions in Germany was suspended, with effect from the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990 and pending the final ratification of the Two Plus Four Treaty, pursuant to a declaration signed in New York on 1 October 1990 by the foreign ministers of the four Allied Powers, which was witnessed by ministers of the two German states then in existence, and to which was appended the text of the Two Plus Four Treaty. However, the Soviets cited their occupation rights for the last time as late as 13 March 1991, just two days before the Treaty became effective, when the Honeckers were enabled by Soviet hardliners to flee Germany on a military jet to Moscow from the Soviet-controlled Sperenberg Airfield, with the German Federal Government being given just one hour's advance notice.\nUnder the treaty on final settlement (which should not be confused with the Unification Treaty which was signed only between the two German states), the last Allied forces still present in Germany left in 1994, in accordance with article 4 of the treaty, which set 31 December 1994 as the deadline for the withdrawal of the remaining Allied forces. The bulk of Russian ground forces left Germany on 25 June 1994 with a military parade of the 6th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade in Berlin. This was followed by the closure of the United States Army Berlin command on 12 July 1994, an event that was marked by a Casing of the Colors ceremony witnessed by President Bill Clinton. The withdrawal of the last Russian troops (the Russian Army's \"Western Group of Forces\") was completed on 31 August 1994, and the event was marked by a military ceremony in the Treptow Park in Berlin, in the presence of Russian President Yeltsin and German Chancellor Kohl. Although the bulk of the British, American, and French Forces had left Germany even before the departure of the Russians, the Western Allies kept a presence in Berlin until the completion of the Russian withdrawal, and the ceremony marking the departure of the remaining Forces of the Western Allies was the last to take place: on 8 September 1994, a Farewell Ceremony in the courtyard of the Charlottenburg Palace, in the presence of British Prime Minister John Major, American Secretary of State Warren Christopher, French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, marked the withdrawal of the British, American and French Occupation Forces from Berlin, and the termination of the Allied occupation in Germany. Thus, the Allied presence was removed a few months before the final deadline.\nArticle 5 banned the deployment of nuclear weapons in the territory previously controlled by the GDR, and also the stationing of non-German military personnel.\nPolish border.\nOn 14 November 1990, Germany and Poland signed the German\u2013Polish Border Treaty, finalizing Germany's eastern boundary as permanent along the Oder\u2013(Lusatian/Western) Neisse line, and thus, renouncing any claims to most of Silesia, East Brandenburg, Farther Pomerania, and the southern area of the former province of East Prussia (they are called the \"Recovered Territories\" by Poland as they were once ruled by Piast Poland). The following month, the first all-German free elections since 1932 were held, resulting in an increased majority for the coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\nAs for the German\u2013Polish Border Treaty, it was approved by the Polish Sejm on 26 November 1991 and the German Bundestag on 16 December 1991, and entered into force with the exchange of the instruments of ratification on 16 January 1992. The confirmation of the border between Germany and Poland was required of Germany by the four Allied countries in the Two Plus Four Treaty. The Treaty was later supplemented by the Treaty of Good Neighbourship between the two countries which took effect on 16 January 1992 and ensured the few remaining Germans in Poland (in Upper Silesia) were treated better by the government.\nEffects.\nInternational effects.\nThe reunification made Germany into one of the world's great powers again. The newly unified Germany was not a new state, but was still the same Federal Republic of Germany that had previously been known as West Germany, meaning that it continued to hold all West Germany's seats at international organizations.\nTo facilitate this process and to reassure other countries, fundamental changes were made to the German constitution. The Preamble and Article 146 were amended, and Article 23 was replaced, but the deleted former Article 23 was applied as the constitutional model to be used for the 1990 reunification. Hence, prior to the five \"New L\u00e4nder\" of East Germany joining, the Basic Law was amended to indicate that all parts of Germany would then be unified such that Germany could now no longer consider itself constitutionally open to further extension to include the former eastern territories of Germany, which were now parts of Poland and Russia (the German territory the former USSR annexed was a part of Russia \u2013 a Soviet member state) and were settled by Poles and Russians respectively. The changes effectively formalized the Oder\u2013Neisse line as Germany's permanent eastern border. These amendments to the Basic Law were mandated by Article I, section 4 of the Two Plus Four Treaty.\nDomestic effects.\nVast differences between former East Germany and West Germany in lifestyle, wealth, political beliefs, and other matters remain, and it is therefore still common to speak of eastern and western Germany distinctly. It is often referred to as the \"wall in the head\" (). (Easterners) are stereotyped as racist, poor, and largely influenced by Russian culture, while (Westerners) are usually considered snobbish, dishonest, wealthy, and selfish. East Germans indicate a dissatisfaction with the status quo and cultural alienation from the rest of Germany, and a sense that their cultural heritage is not acknowledged enough in the now unified Germany. The West, on the other hand, has become uninterested in what the East has to say, and this has led to more resentment toward the East, exacerbating the divide. Both the West and the East have failed to sustain an open-minded dialogue, and the failure to grasp the effects of the institutional path dependency has increased the frustration each side feels.\nThe economy of eastern Germany has struggled since unification, and large subsidies are still transferred from west to east. Economically, eastern Germany has had a sharp rise of 10 percent to West Germany's 5 percent. Western Germany also still holds 56 percent of the GDP. Part of this disparity between the East and the West lies in the Western labor unions' demand for high-wage pacts in an attempt to prevent \"low-wage zones\". This caused many Germans from the East to be outpriced in the market, adding to the slump in businesses in eastern Germany as well as the rising unemployment. The former East German area has often been compared to the underdeveloped Southern Italy and the Southern United States during Reconstruction after the American Civil War. While the economy of eastern Germany has recovered recently, the differences between East and West remain present.\nPoliticians and scholars have frequently called for a process of \"inner reunification\" of the two countries and asked whether there is \"inner unification or continued separation\". \"The process of German unity has not ended yet\", proclaimed Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, in 2009. Nevertheless, the question of this \"inner reunification\" has been widely discussed in the German public, politically, economically, culturally, and also constitutionally since 1989.\nPolitically, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the successor party of the former East German socialist state party has become a major force in German politics. It was renamed PDS, and, later, merged with the Western leftist party WASG to form the Left Party ().\nConstitutionally, the Basic Law of West Germany () provided two pathways for unification. The first was the implementation of a new all-German constitution, safeguarded by a popular referendum. Actually, this was the original idea of the in 1949: it was named a \"basic law\" instead of a \"constitution\" because it was considered provisional. The second way was more technical: the implementation of the constitution in the East, using a paragraph originally designed for the West German states () in case of internal reorganization like the merger of two states. While this latter option was chosen as the most feasible one, the first option was partly regarded as a means to foster the \"inner reunification\".\nA public manifestation of coming to terms with the past () is the existence of the so-called Birthler-Beh\u00f6rde, the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records, which collects and maintains the files of the East German security apparatus.\nThe economic reconstruction of former East Germany following the reunification required large amounts of public funding which turned some areas into boom regions, although overall unemployment remains higher than in the former West. Unemployment was part of a process of deindustrialization starting rapidly after 1990. Causes for this process are disputed in political conflicts up to the present day. Most times bureaucracy and lack of efficiency of the East German economy are highlighted and the deindustrialization is seen as an inevitable outcome of the . But many critics from East Germany point out that it was the shock-therapy style of privatization that did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt, and that alternatives like a slow transition had been possible.\nReunification did, however, lead to a large rise in the average standard of living in former East Germany, and a stagnation in the West as $2 trillion in public spending was transferred East. Between 1990 and 1995, gross wages in the east rose from 35 percent to 74 percent of western levels, while pensions rose from 40 percent to 79 percent. Unemployment reached double the western level as well. West German cities close to the former border of East and West Germany experienced a disproportionate loss of market access relative to other West German cities which were not as greatly affected by the reunification of Germany.\nUnified Berlin.\nWhile the fall of the Berlin Wall had broad economic, political, and social impacts globally, it also had significant consequence for the local urban environment. In fact, the events of 9 November 1989 saw East Berlin and West Berlin, two halves of a single city that had ignored one another for the better part of 40 years, finally \"in confrontation with one another\". There was a belief in the city that, after 40 years of division, the unified city would be well placed to become a major metropolis.\nAnother key priority was reestablishing Berlin as the seat of government of Germany, and this required buildings to serve government needs, including the \"redevelopment of sites for scores of foreign embassies\".\nWith respect to redefining the city's identity, emphasis was placed on restoring Berlin's traditional landscape. \"Critical Reconstruction\" policies sought to disassociate the city's identity from its Nazi and socialist legacy, though some remnants were preserved, with walkways and bicycle paths established along the border strip to preserve the memory of the Wall. In the center of East Berlin, much of the modernist heritage of the East German state was gradually removed. Unification of Berlin saw the removal of politically motivated street names and monuments in the East in an attempt to reduce the socialist legacy from the face of East Berlin.\nImmediately following the fall of the Wall, Berlin experienced a boom in the construction industry. Redevelopment initiatives saw Berlin turn into one of the largest construction sites in the world through the 1990s and early 2000s.\nThe fall of the Wall also had economic consequences. Two German systems covering distinctly divergent degrees of economic opportunity suddenly came into intimate contact. Despite development of sites for commercial purposes, Berlin struggled to compete in economic terms with Frankfurt which remained the financial capital of the country, as well as with other key West German centers such as Munich, Hamburg, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. The intensive building activity directed by planning policy resulted in the over-expansion of office space, \"with a high level of vacancies in spite of the move of most administrations and government agencies from Bonn\".\nBerlin was marred by disjointed economic restructuring, associated with massive deindustrialisation. Economist Oliver Marc Hartwich asserts that, while the East undoubtedly improved economically, it was \"at a much slower pace than [then Chancellor Helmut] Kohl had predicted\". Wealth and income inequality between former East and West Germany continued for decades after reunification. On average, adults in the former West Germany had assets worth 94,000 euros in 2014 as compared to the adults in the former communist East Germany which had just over 40,000 euros in assets.\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall and the factors described above led to mass migration from East Berlin and East Germany, producing a large labor supply shock in the West. Emigration from the East, totaling 870,000 people between 1989 and 1992 alone, led to worse employment outcomes for the least-educated workers, for blue-collar workers, for men, and for foreign nationals.\nAt the close of the century, it became evident that despite significant investment and planning, Berlin was unlikely to retake \"its seat between the European Global Cities of London and Paris\", primarily due to the fact that Germany's financial and commercial capital is located elsewhere (Frankfurt) than the administrative one (Berlin), in resemblance of Italy (Milan vs Rome), Switzerland (Z\u00fcrich vs Bern), Canada (Toronto vs Ottawa), Australia (Sydney vs Canberra), the US (New York City vs Washington, DC) or the Netherlands (Amsterdam vs The Hague), as opposed to London, Paris, Madrid, Vienna, Warsaw or Moscow which combine both roles.\nYet, ultimately, the disparity between East and West portions of Berlin has led to the city achieving a new urban identity. A number of locales of East Berlin, characterized by dwellings of in-between use of abandoned space for little to no rent, have become the focal point and foundation of Berlin's burgeoning creative activities. According to Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit, \"the best that Berlin has to offer, its unique creativity. Creativity is Berlin's future.\" Overall, the Berlin government's engagement in creativity is strongly centered on marketing and promotional initiatives instead of creative production.\nAssessment.\nCost of reunification.\nThe subsequent economic restructuring and reconstruction of eastern Germany resulted in significant costs, especially for western Germany, which paid large sums of money in the form of the (, \"Solidarity Surcharge\") in order to rebuild the east German infrastructure. In addition, the immensely advantageous exchange rate of 1:1 between the West German Deutschmark to the East German mark meant that East Germans could trade in their almost worthless marks for and receive wages in West German currency. This dealt a major blow to the West German budget in the coming few years. The cost of German reunification for the federal government is estimated to be between 1.5 and 2 trillion euros.\nViews and life satisfaction.\nAccording to a 2019 survey conducted by Pew Research Center, 89 percent of Germans living in both the West and East believe that reunification was good for Germany, with slightly more in East than West Germany supporting it. Around 83 percent of East Germans approve of and 13 percent disapprove of eastern Germany's transition to a market economy, with the rest saying they were not sure. Life satisfaction in both the East and West has substantially increased since 1991, with 15 percent of East Germans placing their life satisfaction somewhere between 7 and 10 on a 0 to 10 scale in 1991, changing to 59 percent in 2019. For West Germans, this change over the same time period was from 52 to 64 percent. However, the 2019 annual reunification report by the German government found that 57% East Germans felt like second-class citizens, and 38% saw the reunification as a success \u2013 this figure declined to 20% amongst people under 40.\nIn 2023, a poll found that 40% of East Germans identify as \"East Germans\" rather than German which was 52%.\nAdditionally, German reunification was useful in generating wealth for those Eastern households who already had ties with the West. Those who lived in West Germany and had social ties to the East experienced a six percent average increase in their wealth in the six years following the fall of the Wall, which more than doubled that of households who did not possess the same connections. Entrepreneurs who worked in areas with strong social ties to the East saw their incomes increase as well. Incomes for this group increased at an average rate of 8.8 percent over the same six-year period following reunification. Similarly, those in the East who possessed connections to the West saw their household income increase at a positive rate in each of the six years following reunification. Those in their regions who lacked the same ties did not see this benefit.\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall proved disastrous for the East German labour unions, whose bargaining power was undermined by labour reforms and companies offshoring production to low-wage East European neighbouring countries. Membership of trade unions and associations sharply declined in the mid-1990s, and collective wage and salary agreements became increasingly uncommon. As the result, average nominal compensation per employee in East Germany \"fell to very low levels\" after the unification. Labour reforms implemented after the unification focused on reducing costs for companies and dismantled East German wage and social security regulations in favour of incentivizing employers to create jobs. The low-wage sector in Germany expanded, and the share of employees in low-paid employment amounted to 20% of the workforce by 2009.\nComparison.\nGermany was not the only country that had been divided into two states (1949\u20131990) due to the Cold War. Korea (1945\u2013present), China (1949\u2013present), Yemen (1967\u20131990), and Vietnam (1954\u20131976) were or remain separated through the establishment of \"Western-(free) Capitalist\" and \"Eastern-Communist\" zones or former occupations.\nKorea and Vietnam suffered severely from this division in the Korean War (1950\u20131953) and Vietnam War (1955\u20131975) respectively, which caused heavy economic and civilian damage. However, German separation did not result in another war.\nMoreover, Germany is the only one of these countries that has managed to achieve a peaceful reunification without subsequent violent conflict. For instance, Vietnam achieved reunification after the war under the communist government of North Vietnam in 1976, and Yemen achieved peaceful reunification in 1990 but then suffered a civil war which delayed the reunification process. North and South Korea as well as Mainland China and Taiwan still struggle with high political tensions and huge economic and social disparities, making a possible reunification an enormous challenge. With China, the Taiwan independence movement makes Chinese unification more difficult. East and West Germany today also still have differences in economy and social ideology, similar to North and South Vietnam, a legacy of the separation that the German government is trying to equalize.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The process towards reunification of the peninsula while still maintaining two opposing regimes was started by the June 15th North\u2013South Joint Declaration in June 2000, was reaffirmed by the October 4th Declaration in October 2007 and the Panmunjom Declaration in April 2018. In the Panmunjom Declaration, the two countries agreed to work to officially end the Korean conflict in the future.\nPrior to the First World War and Korea under Japanese rule (1910\u20131945), all of Korea had been unified as a single state for over a millennium, notably under the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties (the latter of which was declared the Korean Empire in 1897). After the end of World War II in 1945 and during the beginning of the Cold War, Korea had a unified government, the People's Republic of Korea. However, this would be brief and serve as the last government, as Korea was divided into two countries along the 38th parallel (now the Korean Demilitarized Zone) in 1948. After World War II, North Korea was occupied by the Soviet Union, and later administered by the Workers' Party of Korea under Kim Il Sung. South Korea was occupied by the United States, later becoming independent under dictator Syngman Rhee. Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea. The Korean War, which began in June 1950, ended in a stalemate in July 1953.\nEven after the end of the Korean War, reunification proved a challenge as the two countries increasingly diverged at a steady pace. The relations between North and South Korea warmed somewhat in early 2000s and again in late 2010s when South Korea pursued the Sunshine Policy of greater engagement with the North, though relations have subsequently deteriorated. Further deterioration has also been seen in 2024, with Kim Jong Un officially \"ruling out unification\" with South Korea, and subsequently demolishing the Arch of Reunification in Pyongyang. In the recent decades, public support for reunification in South Korea has dropped, especially among the younger generation.\nBackground.\nThe current division of the Korean Peninsula is the result of decisions taken at the end of World War II. In 1910, the Empire of Japan annexed Korea and ruled over it until its defeat in World War II. The Korean independence agreement officially occurred on 1 December 1943, when the United States, China, and the United Kingdom signed the Cairo Declaration, which stated: \"The aforesaid three powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent\". In 1945, the United Nations developed plans for trusteeship administration of Korea.\nThe division of the peninsula into two military occupation zones was agreed: the Soviet Civil Administration in the North and the United States Army Military Government in Korea in the South. At midnight on 10 August 1945, two army lieutenant colonels selected the 38th parallel as a dividing line. Japanese troops north of the line were to surrender to the Soviet Union, and the troops south of the line would surrender to the United States.\nThe partition was not originally intended to last long, but Cold War politics resulted in the establishment of two separate governments in the two zones in 1948, and rising tensions prevented co-operation. The desire of many Koreans for a peaceful unification was dashed when the Korean War broke out in 1950. On 25 June 1950, troops from North Korea invaded South Korea. Mao Zedong encouraged the confrontation with the United States and Joseph Stalin reluctantly supported the invasion. After three years of fighting, which involved both Koreas, China and United Nations forces led by the US, the war ended with an armistice agreement at approximately the same boundary.\nHistory.\nBilateral agreements.\nNorth-South Joint Communiqu\u00e9, 1972.\nAfter the d\u00e9tente between the United States and China, the North and South Korean governments made in 1972 the July 4 South\u2013North Joint Statement to improve the relations between the two countries on July 4, 1972. It had a representative of each government secretly visit the other's capital city, and both sides agreed to a North-South Joint Communiqu\u00e9, outlining the steps to be taken towards achieving a peaceful reunification of the country:\nThe agreement outlined the steps to be taken towards achieving a peaceful reunification of the country. However, the North-South Coordination Committee was disbanded the following year after no progress had been made towards implementing the agreement. In January 1989, the founder of Hyundai, Jung Ju-young, toured North Korea and promoted tourism in Mount Kumgang. After a twelve-year hiatus, the prime ministers of the two Koreas met in Seoul in September 1990 to engage in the Inter-Korean summits or High-Level Talks. In December, the two countries reached an agreement on issues of reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation, and exchange between North and South in \"The Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, Cooperation, and Exchange Between North and South\", but these talks collapsed over inspection of nuclear facilities. In 1994, after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang, the leaders of the two Koreas agreed to meet with each other, but the meeting was prevented by the death of Kim Il Sung that July.\nJune 15th North\u2013South Joint Declaration, 2000.\nIn June 2000, North and South Korea signed the June 15th North\u2013South Joint Declaration, in which both sides made promises to seek out a peaceful reunification with the co-existence of two systems:\nOctober 4th Declaration, 2007.\nDuring the 2007 high-level inter-Korean talks held in Pyongyang between Kim Jong Il and Roh Moo Hyun, both sides agreed to the October 4th Declaration, improving on inter-Korean relations on the basis of the June 15 Joint Declaration. The eight points of the declaration signed on the 4th of October 2007 are as follows:\nPanmunjom Declaration, 2018.\nIn April 2018, at the north-south summit talks at the \"House of Peace\" in Panmunjom, Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in signed the Panmunjom Declaration, declaring that there would be no longer war and a new era of peace has opened on the Korean peninsula. They declared as follows reflecting the firm will to put an end to division and confrontation, to open up a new era of national reconciliation, peace and prosperity and more actively improve and develop the north-south ties. A brief outline of the three main points of the agreement are as follows:\nInternationally.\nA unified Korean team marched in the opening ceremonies of the 2000, 2004, and 2006 Olympics, but the North and South Korean national teams competed separately. There were plans for a truly unified team at the 2008 Summer Olympics, but the two countries were unable to agree on the details of its implementation. In the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan, the two countries formed a unified team. A Unified Korea women's ice hockey team competed under a separate IOC country code designation (COR) in the 2018 Winter Olympics; in all other sports, there were a separate North Korea team and a separate South Korea team.\nCurrent status.\nThe nature of unification, i.e. through North Korean collapse, South Korean collapse, or the formation of two systems under a united federation, is still a topic of intense political debate and even conflict among interested parties, which include both Koreas, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States.\nRelations between the two Koreas have been strained, with conflict between the two coming to a head such as in the enforcement of the colonial era National Security Law in South Korea which led to the arrest of South Korean pro-reunification activist Roh Su-hui, suspected torpedoing of the ROKS \"Cheonan\" and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island, both in 2010, the rocket launches in April and December of 2012 and North Korea's third nuclear test in 2013. Kim Jong Un's sudden accession and limited experience governing have also stoked fears about power struggles among different factions leading to future instability on the Korean Peninsula.\nReunification has remained a long-term goal for the governments of both North and South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made calls in his 2012 New Year's Day speech to \"remove confrontation\" between the two countries and implement previous joint agreements for increased economic and political cooperation. The South Korean Ministry of Unification redoubled their efforts in 2011 and 2012 to raise awareness of the issue, launching a variety show (\"Miracle Audition\") and an Internet sitcom with pro-unification themes. The Ministry already promotes curriculum in elementary schooling, such as a government-issued textbook about North Korea titled \"We Are One\" and reunification-themed arts and crafts projects.\n2018\u201319 Korean peace process.\nIn Kim's 2018 New Year's address, a Korean-led reunification was repeatedly mentioned and an unexpected proposal was made for the North's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics that were held in Pyeongchang County of South Korea, a significant shift after several years of increasing hostilities, the 2018\u201319 Korean peace process. Subsequent meetings between North and South led to the announcement that the two Koreas would march together with a unified flag in the Olympics' Opening Ceremony and form a unified ice hockey team, with a total of 22 North Korean athletes participating in various other competitions including figure skating, short track speed skating, cross-country skiing and alpine skiing.\nIn April 2018, at a summit in Panmunjom, Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in signed a deal committing to finally seal peace between both Koreas by the end of the year. Both leaders also symbolically crossed each other's borders, marking the first time a South Korean president crossed the North border and vice versa. Kim stated that the North will start a process of denuclearization, which was supported by the U.S. President Donald Trump. In 2019, Moon Jae-in proposed reunification of the Korean peninsula by 2045. The peace talks led to nothing, as North Korea continued forward with their nuclear program, despite former U.S. President Donald Trump showcasing it as a considerable win.\nDeteriorating relations and Yoon Suk Yeol's presidency (2022\u20132025).\nUnder President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea adopted a harder policy towards North Korea, with the South Korean government officially declaring their goals of \u201cunification by absorption\u201d under a \u201cliberal democracy\u201d system.\nIn response, in December 2023, during a speech at the 9th plenum of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim called for a \"fundamental turnabout\" in North Korea's stance towards South Korea, calling the South the \"enemy\". He stated \"the party's comprehensive conclusion after reviewing inter-Korean relations is that reunification can never be achieved with those ROK riffraffs that defined the 'unification by absorption' and 'unification under liberal democracy' as their state policy\", which he said is in \"sharp contradiction with what our line of national reunification was: one nation, one state with two systems\".\nKim cited South Korean constitution's claims over the entire Korean Peninsula and President Yoon's policy towards the north as evidence that South Korea is an unsuitable partner for reunification. He said the relations between the two Koreas currently were \"states hostile to each other and the relations between two belligerent states\" and no longer ones that are \"consanguineous or homogeneous\", continuing by saying it is \"unsuitable\" to discuss the issue of reunification \"with this strange clan [South Korea], who is no more than a colonial stooge of the U.S. despite the rhetorical word [we used to use] \u2014 'the fellow countrymen.\" Kim also instructed the WPK on reforming organizations related to inter-Korean relations, including the WPK's United Front Department.\nKim further confirmed a shift in policy in January 2024, when he gave a speech to the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) calling for the constitution to be amended to remove references to cooperation and reunification, as well as specify DPRK's territorial borders and add an article specifying the ROK as the most hostile country. He also rejected the maritime Northern Limit Line, saying that \"If the Republic of Korea invades our ground territory, territorial air space, or territorial waters by even 0.001 mm, it will be considered a provocation of war\". He called for the removal of physical symbols such as the Arch of Reunification, which he called an \"eyesore\". The SPA also voted on the abolition of three inter-Korean cooperation organizations; the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, the Korean People's Cooperation Administration, and the Kumgangsan International Tourism Administration.\nOn March 1, 2024, the government of President Yoon Suk Yeol plans to develop a new vision of unification with North Korea to include the principle of liberal democracy. South Korea intended to update its vision of unification for the first time in 30 years. This was the first revision of the Unification Formula of the national community, South Korea's unification policy unveiled in August 1994 under the administration of late President Kim Young-sam. On 15 August 2024, Yoon outlined his policy on reunification, calling for a \"unified Republic of Korea\"; this was the first time this term was used by a South Korean administration. It was seen as South Korea's most explicit policy statement to date in support of unification by absorption, referring to unifying the Korean Peninsula under the Republic of Korea. He called on efforts to increase support among North Koreans for a \"freedom-based unification\", which he said would be done by expanding efforts to increase North Korean people's access to information.\nLee Jae Myung's presidency (2025\u2013present).\nFollowing the inauguration of President Lee Jae-myung in June 2025, South Korea\u2019s approach toward North Korea shifted to a more pragmatic and engagement-oriented stance, contrasting with the hardline policies of his predecessor.\nOn 11 June 2025, Lee banned anti-North Korean activists from sending leaflets into the North by balloon. He also ordered the military to halt loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border with North Korea, South Korea even switched off shortwave radio broadcasts that had carried similar propaganda for over half a century in an attempt to improve relations. North Korea responded by halting their own propaganda loudspeakers towards the South just a few hours later. Lee expressed gratitude for the North's reciprocation, remarking that the speed of their response had exceeded his expectations, and also expressed hope for an improvement in relations.\nBut these efforts by Lee were \u201cnot the work worthy of appreciation,\u201d said Kim Yo Jong, who spoke for her brother, Kim Jong Un, in a statement. She went on to say that no matter what policy was adopted in Seoul or proposal was sent that they had zero interest in discussion with South Korea. These had been the first official remarks on the new administration by the North. South Korea sought to downplay the significance of the statement by Kim Yo Jong, saying that the government would continue its efforts to promote reconciliation and cooperation. A South Korean government spokesman, Koo Byoung-sam, said that the remarks from the North \u201cshowed how high the wall of distrust has become in South-North Korean relations.\u201d\nPublic opinion.\nSupport for reunification in South Korea has been falling, especially among the younger generations. In the 1990s, the percent of people in government polls who regarded reunification as essential was over 80%. By 2011 that number had dropped to 56%. According to a December 2017 survey released by the Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU), 72.1% of South Koreans in their 20s believe reunification is unnecessary, with younger South Koreans saying they are more concerned about issues related to their economy, employment, and living costs. In 2025, a poll by the KINU showed that 51% thought reunification was unnecessary, while 49% thought it was necessary; it marked the first time a majority of South Koreans thought of reunification as unnecessary. A further 63.2% agreed that \"unification is not necessary if peaceful coexistence can be maintained\", 47% said it was \"acceptable\" for the two Koreas to be permanently divided, and 68.1% said they were \"indifferent\" to North Korea.\nPolls show a majority of South Koreans, even those in age groups traditionally seen as being more eager to reunify the peninsula, are not willing to see their living conditions decline in order to accommodate a reunification with the North. Moreover, about 50% of men in their 20s see North Korea as an outright enemy that they want nothing to do with.\nSome scholars, like Paul Roderick Gregory, have suggested that a complete abandonment of Korean reunification may be necessary, in exchange for the North to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and permanently ending the Korean War with a peace treaty.\nStrategies.\nSunshine Policy.\nIntroduced by the Millennium Democratic Party of South Korea under President Kim Dae-jung, as part of a campaign pledge to \"actively pursue reconciliation and cooperation\" with North Korea, the Sunshine Policy was intended to create conditions of economic assistance and cooperation for reunification, rather than sanctions and military threats. The plan was divided into three parts: increased cooperation through inter-Korean organizations (while maintaining separate systems in the North and South), national unification with two autonomous regional governments, and finally the creation of a central national government. In 1998, Kim approved large shipments of food aid to the North Korean government, lifted limits on business deals between North Korean and South Korean firms, and even called for a stop to the American economic embargo against the North. In June 2000, the leaders of North and South Korea met in Pyongyang and shook hands for the first time since the division of Korea.\nDespite the continuation of the Sunshine Policy under the Roh administration, it was eventually declared a failure by the South Korean Ministry of Unification in November 2010 over issues of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, stymied further negotiations, and again strained relations between the two Koreas.\nOpponents.\nOpponents of the Sunshine Policy argue that dialogue and trade with North Korea did nothing to improve prospects for peaceful reunification, despite the transfer of large funds to the North Korean government by President Kim Dae-jung, but allowed the North Korean government to retain its hold on power. Others believe that South Korea should remain prepared for the event of a North Korean attack. Hardliners also argue that the continued and maximized isolation of the North will lead to the country's collapse after which the territory could be absorbed by force into South Korea.\nIn November 2000, outgoing US President Bill Clinton wanted to visit Pyongyang. However, the intended visit never happened because of the controversy surrounding the results of the 2000 US presidential election. Around April or May 2001, Kim Dae-jung was expecting to welcome Kim Jong Il to Seoul. Returning from his meeting in Washington D.C., with newly elected President Bush, Kim Dae-jung described his meeting as embarrassing while privately cursing President Bush and his hardliner approach. This meeting negated any chance of a North Korean visit to South Korea. After the Bush administration labeled North Korea as part of the \"axis of evil\", North Korea renounced the nonproliferation treaty, kicked out UN inspectors, and restarted its nuclear program. In early 2005, the North Korean government confirmed that the country had successfully become a nuclear armed state, with its first nuclear test conducted in October 2006.\nThe Three Charters for National Reunification, 1997.\nIn North Korea, the Three Charters for National Reunification have served as the sole guidelines for reunification. They contain the Three Principles for National Reunification, Ten Point Programme for Reunification of the Country and the plan of founding the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo. They were formulated by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il into the Three Charters for National Reunification in his public work \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Comrade's Instructions for National Reunification\", in 1997.\nThree Principles for National Reunification.\nNorth Korean President Kim Il Sung proposed the Three Principles of National Reunification in 1972 as the central force that should drive reunification. They are as follows:\nTen Point Programme for Reunification of the Country.\nThe Ten Point Programme for Reunification of the Country was written by Kim Il Sung in 1993 and contains the idea of reunification with South Korea under a pan-national unified state. It emphasises once again the need for an independent reunification, and more specifically, the removal of US forces from the peninsula. It is laid out as follows:\nPlan for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo.\nIn accordance with the three principles and the ten point programme, Kim Il Sung elaborated on the proposed state, called Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo (DFRK), on October 10, 1980, in the \"Report to the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea on the Work of the Central Committee\". Kim proposed a confederation between North and South Korea, in which their respective political systems would initially remain. It is described by North Korea as a \"...peaceful reunification proposal to found a federal state on the condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other's existing ideologies.\" It was stated that the DFRK should be a neutral country which does not participate in any political, military alliance or bloc, embracing the whole of the territory and people of the country.\nReunification tax, 2011.\nOn January 1, 2011, a group of twelve lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties introduced a bill into the South Korean National Assembly to allow for the establishment of a \"unification tax\". The bill called for businesses to pay 0.05% of corporate tax, individuals to pay 5% of inheritance or gift taxes, and both individuals and companies to pay 2% of their income tax towards the cost of unification. The bill initiated legislative debate on practical measures to prepare for unification, as proposed by President Lee Myung-bak in his Liberation Day speech the previous year. The proposal for a unification tax was not warmly welcomed at the time. Lee has since reiterated concerns regarding the imminence of unification, which, combined with North Korean behavior, led to the tax proposal gaining wider acceptance. Practical measures to prepare for unification are becoming an increasingly frequent aspect of political debate, as concern regarding imminent and abrupt unification increases.\nKorean Economic Community.\nIt has been suggested that the formation of a Korean Economic Community could be a way to ease in unification of the peninsula. Lee Myung-bak, departing from the Saenuri Party's traditional hardline stance, outlined a comprehensive diplomatic package on North Korea that includes setting up a consultative body to discuss economic projects between the two Koreas. He proposed seeking a Korean economic community agreement to provide the legal and systemic basis for any projects agreed to in the body.\nReunification Investment Fund.\nIn 2017, former Inha University professor Shepherd Iverson proposed creating a $175 billion reunification investment fund aiming to bribe the elite officials on top of DPRK's hierarchy to ensure a diplomatic way to resolve the Korean conflict by conducting an internal regime change. In the proposal a sum of up to $23.3 billion would be paid in total to the families of those elite officials who wield power in Pyongyang, while he noted that the top ten families would receive $30 million each, and the top thousand families would get $5 million. Another sum of $121.8 billion would go to the country's general population to start their life again post-reunification, and it's envisioned that the proceeds for the fund is to be raised from private groups and business moguls.\nInternational positions.\nChina.\nIn 1984, the \"Beijing Review\" provided China's view on Korean unification: \"With regard to the situation on the Korean peninsula, China's position is clear: it is squarely behind the proposal of North Korea for tripartite (between the two Koreas and the United States) talks to seek a peaceful and independent reunification of Korea in the form of a confederation, free from outside interference. China believes this is the surest way to reduce tension on the peninsula.\"\nChina's current relationship with North Korea and position on a unified Korea is seen as dependent on a number of issues. A unified Korea could prevent North Korea's nuclear weapons program from destabilizing East Asia as well as the Chinese government. The 2010 United States diplomatic cables leak mentioned two unnamed PRC officials telling the Deputy Foreign Minister of South Korea that the younger generation of Chinese leaders increasingly believed that Korea should be reunified under South Korean rule, provided it were not hostile to China. The report also claimed that senior officials and the general public in the PRC were becoming increasingly frustrated with the North acting like a \"spoiled child,\" following its repeated missile and nuclear tests, which were seen as a gesture of defiance not only to the West, but also to China. The business magazine \"Caixin\" reported that North Korea accounted for 40% of China's foreign aid budget and required 50,000 tonnes of oil per month as a buffer state against Japan, South Korea, and the United States, with whom trade and investment is now worth billions. North Korea is seen in China as expensive and internationally embarrassing to support.\nHowever, the collapse of the North Korean regime and unification by Seoul would also present a number of problems for China. A sudden and violent collapse might cause a mass exodus of North Koreans fleeing or fighting poverty into China, causing a humanitarian crisis that could destabilize northeast China. The movement of South Korean and American soldiers into the North could result in their being temporarily or even permanently stationed on China's border, seen as a potential threat to China sovereignty and an imposition of a China containment policy. A unified Korea could also more strongly pursue its territorial disputes with China and might inflame nationalism among Koreans in China. Some have claimed the existence of contingency plans for the PRC intervening in situations of great turmoil in North Korea (with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Northeast Project on the Chinese identity of the Goguryeo kingdom potentially used to justify intervention or even annexation).\nJapan.\nSimilarly, reunification of Korea poses complications for future Korea-Japan relations, especially with regards to the disputed territorial status of the Liancourt Rocks and historical issues such as the Comfort women. A reunified Korea will likely position itself as an economic competitor to Japan.\nSoviet Union and Russia.\nAs relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union warmed, the latter returned to warm public support for Kim Il Sung's peaceful reunification proposals. Soviet attention in Northeast Asia gradually began to focus on a new plan for \"collective security in Asia\" first proposed in an \"Izvestia\" editorial in May 1969 and mentioned specifically by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev in his address to the International Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties in Moscow the following month:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For us, the burning problems of the present international situation do not push into the background more long-range tasks, especially the creation of a system of collective security in those parts of the world where the threat of the unleashing of a new World War and the unleashing of armed conflicts is centered... We think that the course of events also places on the agenda the task of creating a system of collective security in Asia.\nUnited States.\nThe United States officially supports Korean reunification under a democratic government, but questions still remain as to the continued relevance of US military presence on the peninsula. Mike Mansfield proposed that Korea be neutralized under a great-power agreement, accompanied by the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the discontinuation of security treaties with the great power guarantors of the North and South.\nIn the 1990s, despite issues surrounding the controversial US-South Korean joint Team Spirit military exercises, the Clinton administration still managed to help turn around the situation regarding peace with North Korea through Jimmy Carter's support. It promised light water reactors in exchange for the availability of North Korea for inspection of its facilities and other concessions. North Korea reacted positively, despite blaming the United States as the original aggressor in the Korean War. There were attempts to normalize relations with Japan as well as the United States with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in open support. North Korea actually favored the United States military's position on the front lines because it helped prevent an outbreak of war. Eventually, aid and oil were supplied, and even cooperation with South Korean business firms. However, one of the remaining fears was North Korea, with their necessary uranium deposits, having the potential to achieve a high level of nuclear technology.\nFormer US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, another supporter of Korean unification, proposed a six-party conference to find a way out of the Korean dilemma, composed of the two Koreas and four connected powers (the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and Japan). North Korea denounced the \"four plus two\" scenario, as it was also known, by claiming Korea would be at the mercy of the great powers and insinuated the reestablishment of Japanese power in Korea. However, North Korea ultimately lacked confidence in getting simultaneous help from China and the Soviet Union.\nUnited Nations.\nFollowing a summit meeting held between leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang from June 13 to 15 in 2000, the chairmen of the Millennium Summit issued a statement welcoming their Joint Declaration as a breakthrough in bringing peace, stability, and reunification to the Korean peninsula. Seven weeks later, a resolution to the same effect was passed by the United Nations General Assembly after being co-sponsored by 150 other nations.\nA scheduled General Assembly debate on the topic in 2002 was deferred for a year at the request of both nations, and when the subject returned in 2003, it was immediately dropped off the agenda.\nThe issue did not return to the General Assembly until 2007, following a second Inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang on October 2\u20134, 2007. These talks were held during one round of the Six-Party Talks in Beijing which committed to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\nImplications.\nA unified Korea could have great implications for the balance of power in the region, with South Korea already considered by many a regional power.\nIn September 2009, Goldman Sachs published its 188th Global Economics Paper about the subject of \"reassessing North Korea Risks and A United Korea\" which highlighted in detail the potential economic power of a unified Korea, which would surpass many G7 countries, including Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and possibly Japan within 30\u201340 years of reunification, with a potential GDP of more than $6 trillion by 2075. The young, skilled labor and large amount of natural resources from the North combined with the advanced technology, infrastructure, and large amount of capital in the South, as well as Korea's strategic location connecting three major economic powers, were cited as potential factors that could drive this growth. According to some opinions, a unified Korea could occur before 2075. If it occurred, Korean reunification would immediately raise the country's population to over 80 million. According to research by Jin-Wook Kim at Citi, reunification would require an investment of US$63.1 billion in the long term to rebuild transportation such as railroads, roads, airports, seaports, and other infrastructure like power plants, mines, oil refineries, and gas pipelines.\nHowever, there is a downside to this. The role of neighboring powers in a unified Korea will change. For example, there will continue to be competition between Russia and China to increase their influence on the Korean Peninsula.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Together with full Taiwan independence, unification is one of the main proposals to address questions on the political status of Taiwan, which is the central focus of Cross-Strait relations.\nBackground.\nIn 1895, the Manchu-led Qing dynasty of China lost the First Sino-Japanese War and was forced to cede Taiwan and Penghu to the Empire of Japan after signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki. In 1912, the Qing dynasty was overthrown and was succeeded by the Republic of China (ROC). Based on the theory of the succession of states, the ROC originally lay claim to the entire territory which belonged to the Qing dynasty during the time of its collapse, except for Taiwan, which the ROC recognized as belonging to the Empire of Japan at the time. The ROC managed to attain widespread recognition as the legitimate successor state to the Qing dynasty during the years following the fall of the Qing dynasty.\nIn the year 1945, the ROC won the Second Sino-Japanese War, which was intertwined with World War II, and took control of Taiwan on behalf of the Allied Powers, following the Japanese surrender. The ROC immediately asserted its claim to Taiwan as \"Taiwan Province, Republic of China\", basing its claim on the Potsdam Declaration and the Cairo Communique. Around this time, the ROC nullified the Treaty of Shimonoseki, declaring it to be one of the many \"Unequal Treaties\" imposed on China during the so-called \"Century of Humiliation\". At the time, the Kuomintang (KMT) was the ruling party of the ROC, and was widely recognized as its legitimate representative, especially due to the collaboration of its leader Chiang Kai-shek with the Allied Powers.\nHowever, throughout much of the rule of the ROC, China had been internally divided during a period called the Warlord Era. According to the common narrative, the ROC was divided into many different ruling cliques and secessionist states, which were in a constant struggle following the power vacuum which was created after the overthrowing of the Qing Dynasty. During this period, two ruling cliques eventually came out on top; that of the KMT, backed by the United States, and that of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), backed by the Soviet Union. The power struggle between these two specific political parties has come to be known as the Chinese Civil War. The Chinese Civil War was fought sporadically throughout the ROC's history; it was interrupted by the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nAfter the Second Sino-Japanese War concluded, the Chinese Civil War resumed, and the CCP quickly gained a huge advantage over the KMT (ruling the ROC). In 1949, the KMT evacuated its government, its military, and around 1.2\u20132 million loyal citizens to Taiwan, which had only been ruled by the KMT for around four years by this time. Back in mainland China, the CCP proclaimed the \"People's Republic of China (PRC)\", effectively creating a reality of Two Chinas. Following the creation of Two Chinas, the PRC began to fight a diplomatic war against the ROC on Taiwan over official recognition as the sole legitimate government of China. Eventually, the PRC (mostly) won this war, and ascended to the position of \"China\" in the United Nations in 1971, evicting the ROC from that position.\nAs a result, the ROC still governed Taiwan but was no longer recognized as a member state of the United Nations. In recent years, membership in the United Nations has become almost an essential qualifier of statehood. Most states with limited recognition are not at all recognized by most governments and intergovernmental organizations. However, the ROC is a unique case, given that it has still managed to attain a significant degree of unofficial international recognition, even though most countries do not officially recognize it as a sovereign state. This is mainly due to the fact that the ROC was previously recognized as the legitimate government of China, providing an extensive framework for unofficial diplomatic relations to be conducted between the ROC and other countries.\nIn the years following the ROC's retreat to Taiwan, Taiwan has gone through a series of significant social, political, economic, and cultural shifts, strengthening the divide between Taiwan and mainland China. This has been further exacerbated by Taiwan's history as a colony of the Japanese Empire, which led to the establishment of a unique Taiwanese identity and the desire for Taiwan independence. The Taiwan independence movement has grown considerably stronger in recent decades, and has especially become a viable force on the island ever since the ROC's transition to a multi-party system, during what has become known as the Democratization of Taiwan.\nThe PRC has never recognized the sovereignty of Taiwan. PRC asserts that the ROC ceased to exist in the year 1949 when the PRC was proclaimed. Officially, PRC refers to the territory controlled by Taiwan as Taiwan area, and to the government of Taiwan as the Taiwan authorities. PRC continues to claim Taiwan as its 23rd Province, and the Fujianese territories still under Taiwanese control as parts of Fujian Province. PRC has established the one China principle in order to clarify its intention. The CCP classifies Taiwan independence supporters as one of the Five Poisons. In 2005, the 10th National People's Congress passed the Anti-Secession Law authorizing military force for unification.\nMost Taiwanese people oppose joining PRC for various reasons, including fears of the loss of Taiwan's democracy, human rights, and Taiwanese nationalism. Opponents either favor maintaining the status quo of the Republic of China administrating Taiwan or the pursuit of Taiwan independence. The Constitution of the Republic of China states that its territory includes the mainland, but the official policy of the Taiwanese government is dependent on which coalition is currently in power. The position of the Pan-Blue Coalition, which comprises the Kuomintang, the People First Party and the New Party is to eventually incorporate the mainland into the ROC, while the position of the Pan-Green Coalition, composed of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, is to pursue Taiwanese independence.\nIn 2024, the Chinese government issued a directive to the courts stating that \"diehard\" independence supporters could be tried in absentia with capital punishment imposed.\nHistory.\nMainland China.\nThe concept of Chinese unification was developed in the 1970s as part of the CCP's strategy to address the \"Taiwan issue\" as China started to normalize foreign relations with a number of countries including the United States and Japan.\nAccording to the state-run China Internet Information Center, in 1979, the National People's Congress published the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan () which included the term \"Chinese reunification\" as an ideal for Cross-Strait relations. In 1981, the chairman of the People's Congress Standing Committee Ye Jianying announced the \"Nine Policies\" for China's stance on Cross-Strait relations, with \"Chinese Peaceful Unification\" () as the first policy. According to Xinhua, since then, \"one country, two systems\" and \"Chinese reunification\" have been emphasized at every National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party as the principles to deal with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. \"One Country, Two Systems\" is specifically about China's policy towards post-colonial Hong Kong and Macao, and \"Chinese Unification\" is specifically about Taiwan. Taiwan has also been offered the resolution of \"One Country, Two Systems\u201d.\nTaiwan.\nTaiwan has a complicated history of being at least partially occupied and administered by larger powers including the Dutch East India Company, the Kingdom of Tungning (purporting to be a continuation of the Southern Ming), the Qing dynasty and the Empire of Japan. Taiwan first came under direct Chinese control when it was invaded by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in 1683.\nThe island remained under Qing rule until 1895 when it was ceded to the Empire of Japan under the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Following the Axis powers' defeat in World War II in 1945, the Kuomintang-led Republic of China gained control of Taiwan. Some Taiwanese resisted ROC rule in the years following World War II. The ROC violently suppressed this resistance which culminated in the February 28 Incident in 1947. At the de facto end of the Chinese Civil War in 1950, KMT and CCP government faced each other across the Strait, with each aiming for a military takeover of the other.\nFrom 1928 to 1942, the CCP maintained that Taiwan was a separate nation. In a 1937 interview with Edgar Snow, Mao Zedong stated \"we will extend them (the Koreans) our enthusiastic help in their struggle for independence. The same thing applies for Taiwan.\"\nThe irredentist narrative emphasizing the importance of a unified Greater China area, which purportedly include Taiwan, arose in both the Kuomintang and the CCP in the years during and after the civil war. For the PRC, the claim of the Greater China area was part of a nationalist argument for territorial integrity. In the civil war years it set the communist movement apart from the ROC, which had lost Manchuria, the ancestral homeland of the Qing emperors, to Japan in 1932.\nRise of Tangwai and Taiwanese nationalism.\nFrom the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1950 until the mid-1970s the concept of unification was not the main subject of discourse between the governments of the PRC and the ROC. The Kuomintang believed that they would, probably with American help, one day retake mainland China, while Mao Zedong's communist regime would collapse in a popular uprising and the Kuomintang forces would be welcomed.\nBy the 1970s, the Kuomintang's authoritarian military dictatorship in Taiwan, led by the Chiang family was becoming increasingly untenable due to the popularity of the Tangwai movement and Taiwanese nationalism. In 1970, then-Vice Premier, Chiang Ching-kuo survived an assassination attempt in New York City by Cheng Tzu-tsai and Peter Huang, both members of the World United Formosans for Independence. In 1976, Wang Sing-nan sent a mail bomb to then-Governor of Taiwan Province Hsieh Tung-min, who suffered serious injuries to both hands as a result. The Kuomintang's heavy-handed oppression in the Kaohsiung Incident, alleged involvement in the Lin family massacre and the murders of Chen Wen-chen and Henry Liu, and the self-immolation of Cheng Nan-jung galvanized the Taiwanese community into political actions and eventually led to majority rule and democracy in Taiwan.\nThe concept of unification replaced the concept of liberation by the PRC in 1979 as it embarked, after Mao's death, on economic reforms and pursued a more pragmatic foreign policy. In Taiwan, the possibility of the ROC retaking mainland China became increasingly remote in the 1970s, particularly after the ROC's expulsion from the United Nations in 1971, the establishment of diplomatic relations between the PRC and United States in 1979, and Chiang Kai-shek's death in 1975.\nMajority rule in Taiwan.\nWith the end of authoritarian rule in the 1980s, there was a shift in power within the KMT away from the faction who had accompanied Chiang to Taiwan. Taiwanese who grew up under Japanese rule, which accounted for more than 85% of the population, gained more influence and the KMT began to move away from its ideology of cross-strait unification. After the exposure of 1987 Lieyu massacre in June, martial law was finally lifted in Taiwan on 15 July 1987. Following the Wild Lily student movement, President Lee Teng-hui announced in 1991 that his government no longer disputed the rule of the CCP in China, leading to semi-official peace talks (leading to what would be termed as the \"1992 Consensus\") between the two sides. The PRC broke off these talks in 1999 when President Lee described relations with the PRC as \"Special state-to-state relations\".\nUntil the mid-1990s, unification supporters on Taiwan were bitterly opposed to the CCP. Since the mid-1990s, there has been a considerable warming of relations between the CCP and Taiwanese unification supporters, as both oppose the pro-Taiwan independence bloc. This brought about the accusation that unification supporters were attempting to sell out Taiwan. They responded saying that closer ties with mainland China, especially economic ties, are in Taiwan's interest.\nRise of the Democratic Progressive Party.\nAfter the 2000 Taiwanese presidential election, which brought the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party's candidate President Chen Shui-bian to power, the Kuomintang, faced with defections to the People First Party, expelled Lee Teng-hui and his supporters and reoriented the party towards unification. At the same time, the People's Republic of China shifted its efforts at unification away from military threats (which it de-emphasized but did not renounce) towards economic incentives designed to encourage Taiwanese businesses to invest in mainland China and aiming to create a pro-Beijing bloc within the Taiwanese electorate.\nWithin Taiwan, unification supporters tend to see \"China\" as a larger cultural entity divided by the Chinese Civil War into separate states or governments within the country. In addition, supporters see Taiwanese identity as one piece of a broader Chinese identity rather than as a separate cultural identity. However, supporters do oppose desinicization inherent in Communist ideology such as that seen during the Cultural Revolution, along with the effort to emphasize a Taiwanese identity as separate from a Chinese one. As of the 2008 election of President Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT agreed to the One China principle, but defined it as led by the Republic of China rather than the People's Republic of China.\nMilitary significance.\nMilitary analysts often point out that control over Taiwan would have geostrategic significance for the PRC, allowing it to break out of the first island chain and increase the country's strategic depth. The first island chain is often cited as a natural barrier and perceived constraint to the PRC's access to the Pacific Ocean. Radar stations on the eastern side of Taiwan's Central Mountain Range would permit the PRC to more readily monitor activity in the Philippine Sea.149 Control over Taiwan and its deeper eastern waters would also provide the People's Liberation Army Navy's ballistic missile submarines with less detectable access to the wider Pacific where they would serve as an important component of a credible second strike capability for the PRC.\nOne China, Two Systems proposal.\nDeng Xiaoping developed the principle of one country, two systems in relation to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.176 According to the 1995 proposal outlined by CCP General Secretary and paramount leader Jiang Zemin, Taiwan would lose sovereignty and the right to self-determination, but would keep its armed forces and send a representative to be the \"number two leader\" in the PRC central government. Thus, under this proposal, the Republic of China would become fully defunct.\nIn May 1998, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a Work Conference on Taiwan Affairs which stated that the whole party and the whole nation should work together for peaceful unification.11\nFew Taiwanese are in support of the One Country, Two Systems policy while some unification supporters argued to uphold the \"status quo\" until mainland China democratized and industrialized to the same level as Taiwan. In the 2000 presidential election, independent candidate James Soong proposed a European Union-style relation with mainland China (this was echoed by Hsu Hsin-liang in 2004) along with a non-aggression pact. In the 2004 presidential election, Lien Chan proposed a confederation-style relationship. Beijing objected to the plan, claiming that Taiwan was already part of China, and was not a state and, as such, could not form a confederation with it. Developments in Hong Kong have caused the population of Taiwan in recent years to find \"One China, Two Systems\" to be \"unpersuasive, unappealing, and even untrustworthy.\"\nStasis.\nUnification proposals were not actively floated in Taiwan and the issue remained moot under President Chen Shui-bian, who refused to accept talks under Beijing's pre-conditions. Under the PRC administration of Hu Jintao, incorporating Taiwan lost emphasis amid the reality that the DPP presidency in Taiwan would be held by pro-independence President Chen until 2008. Instead, the emphasis shifted to meetings with politicians who opposed independence.\nA series of high-profile visits in 2005 to China by the leaders of the three pan-Blue Coalition parties was seen as an implicit recognition of the status quo by the PRC government. Notably, Kuomintang chairman Lien Chan's trip was marked by unedited coverage of his speeches and tours (and some added positive commentary) by government-controlled media and meetings with high level officials including Hu Jintao. Similar treatment (though marked with less historical significance and media attention) was given during subsequent visits by PFP chairman James Soong and New Party chairman Yok Mu-ming. The CCP and the Pan-Blue Coalition parties emphasized their common ground in renewed negotiations under the 1992 consensus, opening the Three Links, and opposing Taiwan's formal independence.\nThe PRC passed an Anti-Secession Law shortly before Lien's trip. While the Pan-Green Coalition held mass rallies to protest the codification of using military force to retake Taiwan, the Pan-Blue Coalition was largely silent. The language of the Anti-Secession Law was clearly directed at the independence supporters in Taiwan (termed \"'Taiwan independence' secessionist forces\" in the law) and designed to be somewhat acceptable to the Pan-Blue Coalition. It did not explicitly declare Taiwan to be part of the People's Republic of China but instead used the term \"China\" on its own, allowing definitional flexibility. It made repeated emphasis of promoting peaceful national unification but left out the concept of \"one country, two systems\" and called for negotiations in \"steps and phases and with flexible and varied modalities\" in recognition of the concept of eventual rather than immediate incorporation of Taiwan.\nUnder both President Chen and President Ma Ying-jeou, the main political changes in cross-straits relationship involved closer economic ties and increased business and personal travel. Such initiatives were met by grassroots oppositions such as the Sunflower Student Movement, which successfully scuttled Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement in 2014. President Ma Ying-Jeou advocated for the revitalization of Chinese culture, as in the re-introduction of traditional Chinese in texts to mainland China used in Taiwan and historically in China. It expressed willingness to allow the usage simplified Chinese in informal writing.\nStarting in 2017, the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, a group of Taiwanese residing in the PRC, took on a more prominent role in the CCP's united front efforts directed at Taiwan.\nOfficial stance of the People's Republic of China.\nThe CCP uses the phrase \"reunification\" instead of \"unification\" to emphasize its assertion that the island of Taiwan has always belonged to China, or at least that the island Taiwan has been part of China for a long period of time, and that it currently belongs to People's Republic of China, but is currently being sporadically occupied by alleged separatists who support Taiwanese independence.\n\u201cLiberation of Taiwan\u201d () is a term used in the PRC to garner public opinion for cross-strait unification with the Republic of China in Taiwan, proposing the use of military force to achieve it. In 1956, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong first introduced the term, which was construed to mean a \"peaceful\" way to unify with the Republic of China. Despite this, both governments have had numerous long-term military confrontations. The CCP has set the unification of China as the most important political goal since the founding of the PRC.\nIn January 1979, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress issued its first appeal to the KMT, which marked the start of the PRC's \"peaceful reunification\" strategy. In March 2005, the 10th National People's Congress passed the Anti-Secession Law authorizing military force for unification. In 2019, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed \"peaceful reunification\" based on the one country, two systems program. The government of the ROC led by President Tsai Ing-wen rejected the proposal.\nThe PRC does not consider the ROC a sovereign state today, instead believing itself to be the ROC's successor after the PRC's founding in 1949.\nIn 2024, the Chinese government issued a directive to the courts stating that \"diehard\" separatists could be tried in absentia with capital punishment imposed.\nTaiwan and Penghu.\nOfficially, the PRC traces Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan Island, allegedly historically known by the Chinese as \"Liuqiu\" (which is closely related to the name of the modern Japanese Ryukyu Islands), back to roughly around the 3rd century CE (specifically the year 230 CE). However, most Western sources trace Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan Island back to either 1661\u20131662 CE (the year(s) when Koxinga established the Kingdom of Tungning in southwestern Taiwan) or 1683 CE (the year when the Qing dynasty absorbed the Kingdom of Tungning into its territory and subsequently lay claim to the entire island).\nOfficial stance of the Republic of China.\nPolitics in the Republic of China are divided into two main camps, the Pan-Blue and the Pan-Green Coalitions. The former camp is characterized by general Chinese nationalism and ROC nationalism, whereas the latter camp is characterized by Taiwanese nationalism.\nROC official sources note that Qing forces occupied the island of Taiwan's western and northern coasts from 1683, and that Taiwan was declared a Qing province in 1885.\nPan-Blue interpretation.\nThe Japanese Instrument of Surrender (1945) is seen by the Pan-Blue camp as legitimizing the Chinese claims of sovereignty over Taiwan Island which were made with the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration (1945). The common Pan-Blue view asserts that Taiwan Island was returned to China in 1945. Irredentist in nature, those who possess this view commonly perceive Retrocession Day to be the conclusion to a continuous saga of reunification struggles on both sides of the strait, lasting from 1895, the year that Taiwan Island was ceded to Japan, up until 1945, the end of the Second World War. Hence, there is a common view among the Pan-Blue camp that the island of Taiwan was always a Chinese territory under Japanese occupation and never belonged to Japan, neither legally nor in spirit. The Cairo Declaration, Potsdam Declaration, and Japanese Instrument of Surrender are seen as proofs that the Treaty of Shimonoseki was nullified in its entirety in 1945, hence proving that the island of Taiwan always rightfully belonged to China throughout those fifty years of reunification struggles. Shortly following these events, the island of Taiwan was split from mainland China again, according to the common Pan-Blue view, marking the beginning of another reunification saga. Still, the Pan-Blue camp considers both Taiwan and mainland China to be currently under Chinese rule, with the division between the island of Taiwan and mainland China merely being internal, rather than directly the result of outsider aggression; this view is demonstrated through the 1992 Consensus, which some allege to be an agreement reached between officials of both the Kuomintang and the CCP in 1992. The notion of 1992 Consensus is that there is One China and that the island of Taiwan is part of China, but that the legitimate government of China can be interpreted differently by the two sides of the strait.\nROC singer Teresa Teng performed in many countries around the world, but never in mainland China. During her 1980 TTV concert, when asked about such possibility, she responded by stating that the day she performs on the mainland will be the day the Three Principles of the People are implemented there \u2013 in reference to either the pursuit of Chinese democracy or reunification under the banner of the ROC.\nPan-Green interpretation.\nThe views of the Pan-Green camp, though they are diverse, tend to be characterized by Taiwanese nationalism. Hence, most within the Pan-Green camp are opposed to the idea of Taiwan being part of China. Still, most within the Pan-Green camp accept certain historical facts which suggest that Taiwan was part of China. The common Pan-Green view accepts that Taiwan was controlled by a regime in mainland China between 1683 and 1895, though many characterize this as a period of constant rebellion, or suppression of identity (or discovery of a new identity), or colonization by the foreign Manchu people. While most among the Pan-Green camp accept that the transition from Chinese to Japanese rule in 1895 was violent and tragic, many believe that rule under the Japanese was either more benevolent than rule under the Chinese (both KMT and Qing) or more productive. Hence, most Pan-Green do not support the notion that Taiwan was part of China between 1895 and 1945, and neither the notion that there was a strong Chinese unification sentiment in Taiwan at that time. \"Dark Green\" members of the Pan-Green camp generally do not believe that the Treaty of Shimonoseki was ever nullified. Certain sources claim that attempts were made to nullify the treaty, but that these attempts were either illegal or futile, whereas other sources claim that the notion that the treaty was ever nullified is a complete fabrication by the KMT in modern times.\nTibet and Outer Mongolia.\nThe ROC has the historical claims to Tibet and Outer Mongolia.\nThe southwestern region of Tibet was governed by the Dalai Lama from 1912 to 1951 as a de facto independent state instead of the Ganden Phodrang. The ROC government has asserted that \"Tibet was placed under the sovereignty of China\" when the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912) ended the brief Nepalese invasion (1788\u20131792) of parts of Tibet in c. 1793. while the Tibetan Government in Exile asserts that Tibet was an independent state until the PRC invaded Tibet in 1949/1950. By that point, the position of the Republic of China with regard to Tibet appeared to become more nuanced as was stated in the following opening speech to the International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet on 8September 2007 through the pro-Taiwan independence then ROC President Chen Shui-bian who stated that his offices no longer treated exiled Tibetans as Chinese mainlanders. Today, the region is ruled by the PRC-governed Tibet Autonomous Region with parts of the ROC-claimed Xikang province.\nIn the northern region, Outer Mongolia, now controlled by the independent Mongolia and the Russian Republic of Tuva, it declared independence from the Qing dynasty in 1911 while China retained its control over the area and reasserted control over Outer Mongolia in 1919. Consequently, Mongolia sought Soviet Russian support to reclaim its independence. In 1921, both Chinese and White Russian forces were driven out by the Red Army of the Soviet Union and pro-Soviet Mongolian forces. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was formed. Soviet pressure forced China to recognize the independence of Mongolia in 1946, but the ROC reasserted the claims to Outer Mongolia in 1953. However, the claim was dropped in 2002 as the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs opened a representative office in Mongolia in 2002 with reciprocity from Mongolia in the ROC in 2003.\nPublic opinion.\nRepublic of China in Taiwan.\nIn 2019, 89% of Taiwanese opposed a 'One Country, Two Systems' unification with the PRC, more than double the opposition at the beginning of the millennium, when polls consistently found 30% to 40% of all residents were opposed, even with more preferential treatments. At that time the majority supported so-called \"status quo now\". While dominating international focus on Taiwanese politics, unification is generally not the deciding issue in Taiwanese political campaigns and elections. A majority of the population supports the status quo, mostly in order to avoid a military confrontation with PRC, but a sizable proportion supports a name rectification campaign.\nOpponents of \"One Country, Two Systems\" cite its implementation in Hong Kong, where despite promises of high levels of autonomy, the PRC government has gradually increased its control of Hong Kong through restricting elections and increasing control over media and policy. The National Security Law and the related crackdowns further diminished Taiwanese support for such a system.\nThe Taiwanese pro-unification minority has at times been vocal in media and politics. For the 2004 presidential election the unification question gained some attention as different political parties were discussing the issue. A series of demonstrations, some of which were organized by pro-unification minorities, gained significant attention.\nSince the 1990s, the share of Taiwanese residents identifying as Chinese has fallen significantly, and the number identifying exclusively as Taiwanese has grown. A majority have identified as Taiwanese-only since 2009. Those identifying exclusively as Chinese fell from 25.5% in 1992 to 4.0% in 2008. Those identifying as both Chinese and Taiwanese fell from 46.4 in 1992 to 31.0% in 2024. Those identifying exclusively as Taiwanese has grown from 17.6% in 1992 to 63.4 in 2024.\nOver the same period, the share who support independence has grown slightly from 46.5% to 48.9%, and those who support unification has fallen from 20.0% to 6.9% in 2024. Within those who support independence, the share support independence as soon as possible has fallen. Those who support maintaining the status quo indefinitely has grown from 9.8% to 34.1%.\nPeople's Republic of China.\nA 2019 phone survey conducted in nine major cities found that 53.1% of respondents supported military force for unification (\u6b66\u7edf; \"wu tong\") with Taiwan while 39.1% stated that they would oppose military force for unification under any circumstance.3762 The study concluded that education level and unfavorable views of the Taiwan government were the greatest predictors of support for military force for unification.46 Politically, economically, and socially privileged respondents, as well as respondents with greater understandings of Taiwan, were also more likely to support military force for unification.46 Residents of Xiamen and Guangzhou (on the coast) were less likely to support military force.46\nA 2020-2021 national public opinion poll conducted in China by academics Adam Y. Liu and Xiaojun Li analyzed public approval for a range of policies, including military force for unification, limited warfare in offshore islands, economic sanctions, maintaining the status quo, and de facto Taiwan independence. The resulting study, published in 2023 in the \"Journal of Contemporary China\", concludes that 55% of respondents support using military force for unification, although that amount was not greater than various less aggressive policy options.34 Approximately one-third of respondents were explicitly opposed to military force for unification.45 Respondents with college degrees or more advanced degrees were more likely to endorse the more aggressive policy options.43\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sightings, tracks, and predation have been reported in a number of countries including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, India, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. When confirmed, they are typically explained as exotic pets or escapees from private zoos.\nAustralia.\nSightings of exotic big cats in Australia began during the 19th century. It is generally thought that sightings may be attributed to escaped exotic circus animals such as Matthew St Leon's touring circus in the 1870s and large cats brought back as pets by soldiers. In one such example, in 1924, a puma and a jaguar both escaped from the Perry Brothers circus while traveling from St Arnaud, Victoria by train when their carriage's wall collapsed. The jaguar was captured after stunning itself, and the Puma later shot. \nThe New South Wales State Government reported in 2003 that \"more likely than not\" there were a number of exotic big cats living deep in the bushlands near Sydney. \nPhantom cats reported in Australia include \nBulgaria.\nIn June of 2025, sightings of a large black cat or panther were reported in the eastern city of Shumen. Later, sightings of what was assumed to be the same animal were reported in the towns of Giurgiu and N\u0103sturelu in Romania. Although no hard evidence has been documented, one hypothesis is that it escaped from captivity, perhaps from an illegal, private zoo owned by criminals, or migrated from Hungary or Serbia. Experts have suggested that evidence of tracks could be attributed to large dogs.\nChina.\nThe blue, or Maltese, tiger, the former name taken from the common color terminology for domestic cats, is a purported color morph of the South China tiger, with sightings in Myanmar, China, and the Korean Peninsula. It is speculated that while the color morph may have theoretically existed, the severe historical bottlenecking of tiger populations makes it unlikely for the genotype to remain in extant populations.\nDenmark.\nIn 1995, a big cat usually described as a lion (but sometimes as a lynx) was dubbed the \"beast of Funen\" by numerous eyewitnesses. There was an earlier big cat sighting from 1982 in southern Jutland.\nFinland.\nA supposed lion moved around Ruokolahti near the Finnish-Russian border in June\u2013August 1992. There were multiple sightings. Tracks were identified by a government biologist as a big feline not native to Finland. The biologist was given police powers to capture or shoot the lion by the Ministry of the Interior. Border guards participated in the hunt. The last reported sightings were in Russia and there were reports that the lion was seen by Finnish border guards and that lion tracks were found in the raked sand field used by Russian border guards to detect crossings. The lion was never captured and the incidents have never been explained. One possible explanation could have been a railway accident of a circus train in Russia, from which some animals escaped.\nIndia.\nThe pogeyan is a large grey feline known to local people living in the Western Ghats, India. Its name is derived from the local dialect, and means 'cat that comes and goes like the mist'.\nLuxembourg.\nIn 2009, a black panther was allegedly spotted in the industrial area of Bommelscheuer near Bascharage. When police came, the panther was gone. In the following couple of days, the panther was spotted all over the country. For a while it was alleged that a panther had escaped a nearby zoo (Amn\u00e9ville), but the zoo later denied that any panther was missing. A couple of days after the Bascharage incident, it also was mentioned that although the police did not find a panther, they did find an unusually large house cat.\nThe Netherlands.\nIn 2005, a black cougar was allegedly spotted on several occasions in a wildlife preserve, but the animal, nicknamed Winnie, was later identified as an unusually large crossbreed between a domestic cat and a wildcat.\nNew Zealand.\nSince the late 1990s, big cat sightings have been reported in widely separated parts of New Zealand, in both the North and South Islands. There have been several unverified panther sightings in Mid-Canterbury near Ashburton and in the nearby foothills of the Southern Alps, but searches conducted there in 2003 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry found no corroborating physical evidence.\nUnited Kingdom.\nSince the 1960s, there have been many alleged sightings of big cats across Great Britain. A 15-month survey conducted in 2003\u20132004 by the British Big Cats Society gave the following regional breakdown, based on 2,052 sightings: South West 21%, South East 16%, East Anglia 12%, Scotland 11%, and West Midlands 9%. Since 1903, a number of exotic cats, all of which are thought to have escaped from captivity, have been killed or captured.\nUnited States.\nPhantom cat sightings in the United States should not be confused with sightings of jaguars in their native range in the states of Arizona and New Mexico (while early records of North American jaguars show much wider distribution as far as Monterey), or of cougars recolonizing the extirpated eastern cougar's former range.\nConnecticut.\nIn 1939, a panther-like creature called the \"glawackus\" was sighted in Glastonbury, Connecticut. It became a national sensation, and sporadic sightings of it across Connecticut continued into the 1960s.\nDelaware.\nThere have been reported sightings of a mountain lion in the northern Delaware forests since the late 1990s. The Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife believes there may be more than one mountain lion in Delaware and that they originate from animals released from captivity.\nHawaii.\nIn December 2002, sightings of a big cat increased in numbers in the Kula (upcountry) area, and the Division of Forestry and Wildlife requested the help of big cat wildlife biologists William van Pelt and Stan Cunningham of the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Van Pelt and Cunningham believed that the cat was probably a large feline, such as a leopard, jaguar, or cougar. No big cat was detected by traps, infrared cameras, or professional trackers. A fur sample was obtained in 2003, but DNA analysis was inconclusive. The state's hunt for the cat was suspended in late November 2003, after three weeks without sightings. Utah State University professor and wildlife biologist Robert Schmidt expressed strong doubts about the cat's existence, likening it to the Loch Ness monster.\nMassachusetts.\nMassWildlife has confirmed two cases of a mountain lion's presence in Massachusetts. There have been numerous other reports of sightings, as well as alleged photographs, but these remain unconfirmed by state wildlife officials.\nNorth Carolina.\nBlack panthers and other large non-indigenous cats have been sighted for many years in the vicinity of Oriental, North Carolina. Accounts from locals and visitors alike have been documented in the local papers.\nExplanations for Europe's Phantom Cats.\nIn Europe, escaped exotic wildcats have been caught both dead and alive by people of Great Britain. DNA testing also helped in the process of finding out what the animals could be, proving them to actually be exotic wildcats. In the 1970s, circus owner Mary Chipperfield allegedly released her pet mountain lions into the Moorlands of Great Britain after her circus shut down. A while later, people released their exotic animals into the woods after a ban on large exotic predators took place. People have taken pictures, killed and have even captured the animals alive. Exotic wildcat species that have been caught in Great Britain include:\nAnother confirmed explanation is that the phantom cats are actually large stray or hybrid cats since some stray cats hybridize with the native Scottish Wildcat and the hybrids are larger than a purebred cat. The Scottish Kellas Cat is the result of hybridization of both domestic and wildcats, and a now mounted specimen matches the description of the British Black Cats: a large, robust body with black fur and small ears.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is not necessarily the end of a war, as it may constitute only a cessation of hostilities while an attempt is made to negotiate a lasting peace. It is derived from the Latin \"arma\", meaning \"arms\" (as in weapons) and \"-stitium\", meaning \"a stopping\".\nThe United Nations Security Council often imposes, or tries to impose, ceasefire resolutions on parties in modern conflicts. Armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than non-mandatory UN cease-fire resolutions in modern international law.\nAn armistice is a \"modus vivendi\" and is not the same as a peace treaty, which may take months or even years to agree on. The 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement is a major example of an armistice which has not been followed by a peace treaty. An armistice is also different from a truce or ceasefire, which refer to a temporary cessation of hostilities for an agreed limited time or within a limited area. A truce may be needed in order to negotiate an armistice.\nInternational law.\nUnder international law, an armistice is a legal agreement (often in a document) that ends fighting between the \"belligerent parties\" of a war or conflict. At the Hague Convention of 1899, three treaties were agreed and three declarations made. The \"Convention with respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land\" stated, \"If [the armistice's] duration is not fixed,\" the parties may resume fighting (Article 36) as they choose but with proper notifications. That is in comparison to a \"fixed duration\" armistice in which the parties may renew fighting only at the end of the particular fixed duration. When the belligerent parties say in effect that \"this armistice completely ends the fighting\" without any end date for the armistice, the duration of the armistice is fixed in the sense that no resumption of the fighting is allowed at any time. For example, the Korean Armistice Agreement calls for a \"ceasefire and armistice\" and has the \"objective of establishing an armistice which will ensure a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved.\"\nArmistice Day.\nArmistice Day (which coincides with Remembrance Day and Veterans Day, public holidays) is commemorated every year on 11 November to mark the Armistice of 11 November 1918 signed between the Allies of World War I and the German Empire at Compi\u00e8gne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I, which took effect at eleven o'clock in the morning, the \"eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\" of 1918.\nMost countries changed the name of the holiday after World War II to honor veterans of that and subsequent conflicts. Most member states of the Commonwealth of Nations adopted the name Remembrance Day, and the United States chose Veterans Day.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

BU was founded in 1839 by a group of Boston Methodists with its original campus in Newbury, Vermont. It was chartered in Boston in 1869. The university is a member of the Association of American Universities and the Boston Consortium for Higher Education.\nThe university has nearly 38,000 students and more than 4,000 faculty members and is one of Boston's largest employers. It offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, doctorates, and medical, dental, business, and law degrees through 17 schools and colleges on three urban campuses. BU athletic teams compete in the Patriot League and Hockey East conferences, and their mascot is Rhett the Boston Terrier. The Boston University Terriers compete in NCAA Division I.\nThe university is nonsectarian, though it retains its historical affiliation with the United Methodist Church. The main campus is situated along the Charles River in Boston's Fenway\u2013Kenmore and Allston neighborhoods, while the Boston University Medical Campus is located in Boston's South End neighborhood. The Fenway campus houses the Wheelock College of Education and Human Development, formerly Wheelock College, which merged with BU in 2018. The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nBoston University traces its roots to the establishment of the Newbury Biblical Institute in Newbury, Vermont, in 1839, and was chartered with the name \"Boston University\" by the Massachusetts Legislature when it moved there in 1869. The university organized formal centennial observances both in 1939 and 1969. One or the other, or both dates, may appear on various official seals used by different schools of the university.\nIn Vermont and New Hampshire.\nOn April 24\u201325, 1839, a group of Methodist ministers and laymen at the Old Bromfield Street Church in Boston elected to establish a Methodist theological school. Set up in Newbury, Vermont, the school was named the \"Newbury Biblical Institute\".\nIn 1847, the Congregational Society in Concord, New Hampshire, invited the institute to relocate to Concord and offered a disused Congregational church building with a capacity of 1200 people. Other citizens of Concord covered the remodeling costs. One stipulation of the invitation was that the Institute remain in Concord for at least 20 years. The charter issued by New Hampshire designated the school the \"Methodist General Biblical Institute\", but it was commonly called the \"Concord Biblical Institute\".\nIn Beacon Hill.\nWith the agreed twenty years coming to a close, the trustees of the Concord Biblical Institute purchased on Aspinwall Hill in Brookline, Massachusetts, as a possible relocation site. The institute moved in 1867 to 23 Pinkney Street in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, and received a Massachusetts Charter as the \"Boston Theological Seminary\".\nIn 1869, three trustees of the Boston Theological Institute obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature a charter for a university by the name of \"Boston University\". These trustees were successful Boston businessmen and Methodist laymen, with a history of involvement in educational enterprises, and they became the founders of Boston University. They were Isaac Rich (1801\u20131872), Lee Claflin (1791\u20131871), and Jacob Sleeper (1802\u20131889), for whom Boston University's three West Campus dormitories were later named. Lee Claflin's son, William, was then Governor of Massachusetts and signed the University Charter on May 26, 1869, after it was passed by the Legislature.\nAs reported by Kathleen Kilgore in her book \"Transformations, A History of Boston University\" (see Further reading), the founders directed the inclusion in the Charter of the following provision, unusual for its time:\nNo instructor in said University shall ever be required by the Trustees to profess any particular religious opinions as a test of office, and no student shall be refused admission ... on account of the religious opinions he may entertain; provided, nonetheless, that this section shall not apply to the theological department of said University.\nEvery department of the new university was also open to all on an equal footing regardless of sex, race, or (with the exception of the School of Theology) religion.\nBoston Theological Institute was absorbed into Boston University in 1871 as the BU School of Theology.\nOn January 13, 1872, Isaac Rich died, leaving the vast bulk of his estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the university was organized. Most of this bequest consisted of real estate throughout the core of the city of Boston, which was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university as of that time. By December, however, the Great Boston Fire of 1872 had destroyed all but one of the buildings Rich had left to the university, and the insurance companies with which they had been insured were bankrupt. The value of his estate, when turned over to the university in 1882, was half what it had been in 1872.\nAs a result, the university was unable to build its contemplated campus on Aspinwall Hill, and the land was sold piecemeal as development sites. Street names in the area, including Claflin Road, Claflin Path, and University Road, are the only remaining evidence of university ownership in this area. Following the fire, Boston University established its new facilities in buildings scattered throughout Beacon Hill, and later expanded into the Boylston Street and Copley Square area.\nAfter receiving a year's salary advance to allow him to pursue his research in 1875, Alexander Graham Bell, then a professor at the school, invented the telephone in a Boston University laboratory. In 1876, Borden Parker Bowne was appointed professor of philosophy. Bowne, an important figure in the history of American religious thought, was an American Christian philosopher and theologian in the Methodist tradition. He is known for his contributions to personalism, a philosophical branch of liberal theology. The movement he led is often referred to as Boston Personalism.\nThe university continued its tradition of openness in this period. In 1877, Boston University became the first American university to award a PhD to a woman, when classics scholar Helen Magill White earned hers with a thesis on \"The Greek Drama\". Then in 1878 Anna Oliver became the first woman to receive a degree in theology in the United States, but the Methodist Church would not ordain her. Lelia J. Robinson, who graduated from the university's law school in 1881, became the first woman admitted to the bar in Massachusetts. Solomon Carter Fuller, who graduated from the university's School of Medicine in 1897, became the first black psychiatrist in the United States and would make significant contributions to the study of Alzheimer's disease.\nMove to current campus and expansion.\nSeeking to unify a geographically scattered school and enable it to participate in the development of the city, school president Lemuel Murlin arranged that the school buy the present campus along the Charles River. Between 1920 and 1928, the school bought the of land that had been reclaimed from the river by the Riverfront Improvement Association. Plans for a riverside quadrangle with a Gothic Revival administrative tower modeled on the \"Old Boston Stump\" in Boston, England were scaled back in the late 1920s when the State Metropolitan District Commission used eminent domain to seize riverfront land for Storrow Drive. Murlin was never able to build the new campus, but his successor, Daniel L. Marsh, led a series of fundraising campaigns (interrupted by both the Great Depression and World War II) that helped Marsh to achieve his dream and to gradually fill in the university's new campus. By spring 1936, the student body included 10,384 men and women.\nIn 1951, Harold C. Case became the school's fifth president and under his direction the character of the campus changed significantly, as he sought to change the school into a national research university. The campus tripled in size to , and added 68 new buildings before Case retired in 1967. The first large dorms, Claflin, Rich and Sleeper Halls in West Campus were built, and in 1965 construction began on 700 Commonwealth Avenue, later named Warren Towers, designed to house 1800 students. Between 1961 and 1966, the BU Law Tower, the George Sherman Union, and the Mugar Memorial Library were constructed in the Brutalist style, a departure from the school's traditional architecture. The College of Engineering and College of Communication were housed in a former stable building and auto-show room, respectively. Besides his efforts to expand the university into a rival for Greater Boston's more prestigious academic institutions, such as Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (both in Cambridge across the Charles River from the BU campus), Case involved himself in the start of the student/societal upheavals that came to characterize the 1960s.\nWhen a mini-squabble over editorial policy at college radio WBUR-FM \u2013 whose offices were under a tall radio antenna mast in front of the School of Public Relations and Communications (later College of Communications) \u2013 started growing in the spring of 1964, Case persuaded university trustees that the university should take over the widely-heard radio station (now a major outlet for National Public Radio and still a BU-owned broadcast facility). The trustees approved the firing of student managers and clamped down on programming and editorial policy, which had been led by Jim Thistle, later a major force in Boston's broadcast news milieu. The on-campus political dispute between Case's conservative administration and the suddenly active and mostly liberal student body led to other disputes over BU student print publications, such as the \"B.U. News\" and the \"Scarlet\", a fraternity association newspaper.\nThe presidency of John Silber also saw much expansion of the campus and programs. In the late 1970s, the Lahey Clinic vacated its building at 605 Commonwealth Avenue and moved to Burlington, Massachusetts. The vacated building was purchased by BU to house the School of Education. After arriving from the University of Texas in 1971, Silber set out to remake the university into a global center for research by recruiting star faculty. Two of his faculty \"stars\", Elie Wiesel and Derek Walcott, won Nobel Prizes shortly after Silber recruited them. Two others, Saul Bellow and Sheldon Glashow won Nobel Prizes before Silber recruited them.\nIn addition to recruiting new scholars, Silber expanded the physical campus, constructing the Photonics Center for the study of light, a new building for the School of Management, and the Life Science and Engineering Building for interdisciplinary research, among other projects. Campus expansion continued in the 2000s with the construction of new dormitories and the Agganis Arena.\nStudent and faculty activism.\nTo protest the poor condition of Boston University's African-American curriculum, on April 25, 1968 (three weeks after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.), African-American students conducted a sit-in and locked BU president Arland F. Christ-Janer out of his office for 12 hours. Umoja, BU's Black Student Union, put forward ten demands to Christ-Janer and got nine of them approved that included the creation of a Martin Luther King Chair of Social Ethics, expansion of African-American library resources and tutoring services, opening an \"Afro-American coordinating center,\" admission and selection of more Black students and faculty. No disciplinary action was taken against the students who only opened the chains after their demands were met. \"There was no surprise, or feeling of victory on the students' parts,\" said Christ-Janer in response to the sit-in. \"They had confidence in their demands, and I had a confidence in them. The university, black and white alike, was the winner.\"\nThe late twentieth century saw a culmination in student activism at Boston University during the presidency of John R. Silber.\nIn 1972, student protests rose against the university administration's endorsement of Marine Corps recruitment on campus which faced significant opposition from the Student Democratic Society.\nOn March 27, 1972, 50 police officers in \"riot gear\" defused a demonstration of 150 protesters at 195 Bay State Road, the BU Placement Office, where Marine recruiters were holding student interviews. A few protesters were arrested while some sustained minor injuries, including a student and two officers. Contrary to student claims of a peaceful protest, Silber said, \"Civilization doesn't abdicate in face of barbarism. Those students or nonstudents who deliberately seek violent confrontation and refuse all efforts at peaceful resolution of issues must expect society to use its police power in its own defense.\" In response to Silber's decision of a forceful police intervention, the Faculty State conducted a vote on Silber's resignation which could not pass due to a \"vote of 140\u201325 with 32 abstentions.\" As a result of this failed motion, Peter P. Gabriel resigned his position as the dean of Boston University's School of Management in protest of Silber's presidency and his \"counterproductive\" leadership. Silber's support of military recruitment on campus, which he pushed to make the university eligible for federal grants, caused other demonstrations. On December 5, 1972, fifteen BU Student Government officers started a three-day hunger strike at Marsh Chapel demanding Silber \"to file a lawsuit against the Federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Herbert Amendment.\"\nOn March 16, 1978, about 900 Boston University students gathered at the George Sherman Union to protest against the $400 rise in tuition and $150 rise in housing charges declared by the trustees on March 7. The protest interrupted a board of trustees conference. While John Silber and Arthur G. B. Metcalf, chairman of the board of trustees, were negotiating with student government representatives to discuss the matter further on a separate occasion, the protesters marched into the building from two entrances, effectively trapping 40 trustees and 10 university administrators in the building for over thirty minutes. Twenty officers from the Boston University Police Department had to disperse the crowd from the stairwells. The protest resulted in the arrest of 19 year old Joshua Grossman, while another student and two BUPD officers were taken to hospitals.\nOn April 5, 1979, several hundred faculty members, as well as clerical workers and librarians, went on strike. The faculty members were seeking a labor contract while the clerical workers and librarians were seeking union recognition. The strike ended by mid-April under terms favorable to the employees.\nOn November 27, 1979, the committee to Defend Iranian Students\u2014composed of Iranian students, Youths Against Foreign Fascism and the Revolutionary Communist Party\u2014held a demonstration at the George Sherman Union against the deposed Shah of Iran and the deportation of Iranian students from the US. \"To the Iranian people, that man (the shah) is Adolf Hitler,\" students protested. \"The Shah Must Face the Wrath of the People.\" This was met with chants of \"God Bless America\" from the opposing group. Twenty policemen broke up the confronting parties though no arrests were made.\n21st century.\nFollowing the trustees' push for the resignation of the university's eighth president, Jon Westling, they voted unanimously to offer the presidency of the university to Daniel S. Goldin, former administrator of NASA under presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Goldin was set to take over the job on November 1, 2003, and be officially inaugurated on November 17, though the deal collapsed in the week leading up to his arrival in Boston.\nThe university eventually terminated Goldin's contract at a cost of $1.8\u00a0million and initiated a second search to fill the presidential position, culminating with the inauguration of Robert A. Brown as the university's 10th president on April 27, 2006. (Aram Chobanian, who had served as \"president ad interim\" during most of the second search, was formally recognized as the 9th president in 2005.) In the wake of this fiasco, several actions were taken to improve the image projected to potential presidential candidates as well as the functioning of the board itself.\nIn 2012, the university was invited to join the Association of American Universities, comprising 66 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. BU, one of four universities at the time invited to join the group since 2000, became the 62nd member. In the Boston area, Harvard, MIT, Tufts, and Brandeis are also members.\nThat same year, a $1 billion fundraising campaign was launched, its first comprehensive campaign, emphasizing financial aid, faculty support, research, and facility improvements. In 2016, the campaign goal was reached. The board of trustees voted to raise the goal to $1.5 billion and extend through 2019. The campaign has funded 74 new faculty positions, including 49 named full professorships and 25 Career Development Professorships. The campaign concluded in September 2019, raising a total of $1.85 billion over seven years.\nIn February 2015, the faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.\nThe Charles River and Medical Campuses have undergone physical transformations since 2006, from new buildings and playing fields to dormitory renovations. The campus has seen the addition of a 26-floor student residence at 33 Harry Agganis Way, nicknamed StuVi2, the New Balance Playing Field, the Yawkey Center for Student Services, the Alan and Sherry Leventhal Center, the Law tower and Redstone annex, the Engineering Product Innovation Center (EPIC), the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences &amp; Engineering, and the Joan and Edgar Booth Theatre, which opened in fall 2017. The construction of the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences &amp; Engineering was funded by part of BU's largest ever gift, a $115 million donation from Rajen Kilachand. The Dahod Family Alumni Center in the renovated BU Castle began in May 2017 and was completed in fall 2018. Development of the university's existing housing stock has included significant renovations to BU's oldest dorm, 610 Beacon Street (formerly Myles Standish Hall) and Annex, and to Kilachand Hall, formerly known as Shelton Hall, and a brand new student residence on the Medical Campus. In May 2024, Boston University removed Myles Standish's name from the building. It is now referred to by its address, 610 Beacon Street.\nIn 2019, Boston University expanded its financial aid program so that it would \"meet the full need for all domestic students who qualify for financial aid,\" starting in fall 2020.\nIn September 2022, Robert A. Brown announced he will step down at the end of the 2022\u20132023 academic year. Brown began his presidency in September 2005, and his contract was set to run through 2025. Although Brown chose to end his presidency, he will resume teaching at the university. On August 1, 2023, Kenneth W. Freeman started serving as president ad interim. In October 2023, Melissa Gilliam was named the incoming president, starting her term on July 1, 2024.\nOn July 1, 2024, Melissa Gilliam began her tenure as the university's 11th president. On October 16, 2024, the 2024 Boston University strikes ended.\nResponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe university closed down due to the COVID-19 and shifted to online learning for the remainder of the semester on March 11, 2020. For the fall 2020 semester, BU offered a hybrid system that allows for students to decide whether to take a remote class or participate in-person. Larger classes would be broken down into smaller groups that rotate between online and in-person sessions. The school started administering its own COVID-19 testing for faculty, staff, and students on July 27, 2020. The new BU Clinical Testing Laboratory has accelerated testing that can give results to students, staff, and faculty by the next day. The lab uses eight robots to process up to 6,000 tests per day. A contact tracing team is part of the process to contain infections on campus. BU also started a new website \"Back2BU\" to provide students with the latest information on reopening. The results of the tests were published on BU's public COVID-19 Testing Data Dashboard.\nBU's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) has been working with live coronavirus samples since March 2020, and\u2014at the time\u2014was the only New England lab to have live samples.\nIn August 2020, BU filed a service mark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to secure the phrase \"F*ck It Won't Cut It\" for a student-led COVID-19 safety program on campus. The slogan is meant to promote \"safe and smart actions and behaviors for college and university students in a COVID-19 environment\", according to the application.\nIn July 2021, BU announced faculty and staff will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for the fall 2022 semester. This comes after a vaccine requirement for all students, which was announced in April.\nCOVID-19 research and gain-of-function controversy.\nIn October 2022, Boston University's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories conducted research in a Biosafety Level 3 lab that modified the original strain of the virus that causes COVID-19 with the spike proteins of the Omicron variant. This resulted in a virus that was more lethal to lab mice than the Omicron variant itself, but less lethal than the original strain. Some medical authorities criticized the research as dangerous \"gain of function\" research, but others argued that it did not \"technically\" count as gain of function research because the modified virus happened not to be quite as lethal as the original strain. Marc Lipsitch of Harvard, however, argued \"these are unquestionably gain-of-function experiments. As many have noted, this is a very broad term encompassing many harmless and some potentially dangerous experiments. GOF is a scientific technique, not an epithet.\" While the BU researchers gained internal research and Boston government approvals for the research, they failed to notify the US Government's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that was a funder of the lab.\nCampus.\nBoston campuses and facilities.\nThe university's main Charles River Campus follows Commonwealth Avenue and the Green Line, beginning near Kenmore Square and continuing for over a mile and a half to its end near the border of Boston's Allston neighborhood. The Boston University Bridge over the Charles River into Cambridge represents the dividing line between Main Campus, where most schools and classroom buildings are concentrated, and West Campus, home to several athletic facilities and playing fields, the large West Campus dorm, and the new John Hancock Student Village complex. Boston University also has a campus located in the Fenway area, housing undergraduate students.\nThe main campus buildings of BU are separated from the Charles River Esplanade parkland and the Paul Dudley White Bike Path along the banks of the nearby Charles River, by heavily trafficked Storrow Drive, a high-speed limited-access major roadway connecting downtown Boston to its western suburbs. The separation occurred in the late 1920s, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seized land by eminent domain for the construction of the new roadway along the riverbank. A narrow strip of grassy lawn between BU academic buildings lining Commonwealth Avenue and the torrent of traffic on Storrow Drive has been humorously dubbed \"BU Beach\", because it is a favorite hangout for sunbathing in good weather. The lounging students are protected from traffic incursions by a raised earthen berm, which also muffles the traffic noise to a dull roar. To protect pedestrians from vehicular collisions, Storrow Drive is enclosed by fencing, with pedestrian bridges allowing safe crossings at Silber Way and at Marsh Chapel. An additional crossing is possible at the BU Bridge, which also allows street traffic to cross from the Boston side to the Cambridge side of the Charles River.\nAs a result of its continual expansion, the Charles River campus contains an array of architecturally diverse buildings. The College of Arts and Sciences, Marsh Chapel, and the School of Theology buildings are the university's most recognizable, and were built in the late-1930s and 1940s in collegiate gothic style. A sizable amount of the campus is traditional Boston brownstone, especially at Bay State Road and South Campus, where BU has acquired almost every townhouse those areas offer. The buildings are primarily dormitories, but many also serve as various institutes as well as department offices.\nFrom the 1960s through the 1980s, several contemporary buildings were constructed, including the Mugar Library, BU Law School, and Warren Towers, all of which were built in the brutalist style of architecture. The Metcalf Science Center for Science and Engineering, constructed in 1983, might more accurately be described as Structural Expressionism. Morse Auditorium, adjacent, stands in stark architectural contrast, as it was originally constructed as a Jewish synagogue. The most recent architectural additions to BU's campus are the Center for Computing &amp; Data Sciences, Photonics Center, Life Science and Engineering Building, The Student Village (which includes the FitRec Center and Agganis Arena), and the Questrom School of Business. All these buildings were built in brick, a few with a substantial amount of brownstone. Boston University converted the old Nickelodeon Cinemas complex into College of Engineering labs and offices. In 2016, the university sold the building that housed the Huntington Theatre Company and constructed the Joan &amp; Edgar Booth Theatre and College of Fine Arts Production Center to consolidate the theater program on campus.\nBU has earned several historic preservation awards with recent extensive building renovation projects, such as the School of Law tower, the Alan &amp; Sherry Leventhal Center, 610 Beacon Street (formerly Myles Standish Hall), and the Dahod Family Alumni Center (formerly The Castle). Construction of the brick and glass Yawkey Center for Student Services was designed to follow the requirements of the Bay State Road historic district. Use of glass and steel for new construction on Commonwealth Avenue includes the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences &amp; Engineering, which opened in 2017, and the 19-story Center for Computing and Data Sciences, which opened in 2022.\nThe ceremonial opening on December 8, 2022, was covered by publications including Bloomberg, \"The Boston Globe\", and CBS News which praised the building for being the largest carbon-neutral building in Boston and noted its unusual design. A ribbon cutting ceremony was performed by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, President Robert A. Brown, the associate provost for computing and data sciences Azer Bestavros, dean of Arts &amp; Sciences Stan Sclaroff, BU Board of Trustees chair Ahmass Fakahany, BU provost Jean Morrison, and Boston city councilor Kenzie Bok.\nIn 2018, following negotiations in the preceding year, Boston University purchased the former Wheelock College, which is now referred to as the Boston University Fenway Campus (although it is actually located in the adjacent neighborhood of Longwood).\nAs of 2019[ [update]], BU has sold or leased to real estate developers several building sites it owned in Kenmore Square next to its campus. Large multistory buildings are being constructed there, which will transform the long-time appearance of the busy traffic hub.\nIn September 2021, BU completed a $115 million project to renovate and expand the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine. The project expanded clinical spaces, added a simulation learning center, and improved collaborative spaces for students.\nStudent housing.\nBoston University's housing system is the nation's 10th largest among four-year colleges. BU was originally a commuter school, but the university now guarantees the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. Currently, 76 percent of the undergraduate population lives on campus. Boston University requires that all students living in dormitories be enrolled in a year-long meal plan with several combinations of meals and dining points which can be used as cash in on-campus facilities.\nHousing at BU is an unusually diverse melange, ranging from individual 19th-century brownstone townhouses and apartment buildings acquired by the school to large-scale high-rises built in the 1960s and 2000s.\nThe large dormitories include the 1,800-student Warren Towers, the largest on campus, as well as West Campus and The Towers. The smaller dormitory and apartment style housing are mainly located in two parts of campus: Bay State Road and the South Campus residential area. Bay State Road is a tree-lined street that runs parallel to Commonwealth Avenue and is home to the majority of BU's townhouses, often called \"brownstones\". South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the Massachusetts Turnpike. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South Campus buildings are apartments.\nBoston University's newest residence and principal apartment-style housing area is officially called 33 Harry Agganis Way, \"StuVi2\" unofficially, and is part of The John Hancock Student Village project. The north-facing, 26-story building is apartment style while the south-facing, 19-story building is in an 8-bedroom dormitory-style suite pattern. In total, the building houses 960 residents.\nAside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along Commonwealth Avenue.\nBoston University also provides specialty houses or specialty floors to students who have particular interests.\nKilachand Hall, formerly Shelton Hall, is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of playwright Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill lived in what was originally room 401 (now 419) while the building was a residential hotel. He died in a hospital on November 27, 1953, and his ghost is rumored to haunt both the room and the floor. The fourth floor is now a specialty floor called the Writers' Corridor.\nJohn Hancock Student Village.\nThe Student Village is a large new residential and recreational complex covering between Buick Street and Nickerson Field, ground formerly occupied by a National Guard Armory, which had been used by the university for indoor track and field and as a storage facility before its demolition and the start of construction. The dormitory of apartment suites at 10 Buick Street (often abbreviated to \"StuVi\" by students) opened to juniors and seniors in the fall of 2000. In 2002, John Hancock Insurance announced its sponsorship of the multimillion-dollar project.\nThe Agganis Arena, named after Harry Agganis, was opened to concerts and hockey games in January 2005. The Agganis Arena is capable of housing 6,224 spectators for Terrier hockey games, replacing the smaller Walter Brown Arena. It can also be used for concerts and shows. In March 2005, the final element of phase II of the Student Village complex, the Fitness and Recreation (FitRec) Center, was opened, drawing large crowds from the student body. Construction on the rest of phase II, which included 19- and 26-story residential towers was finished in fall 2009.\nOther facilities.\n \nThe Mugar Memorial Library is the central academic library for the Charles River Campus. It also houses the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, formerly called the Twentieth Century Archive, where documents belonging to thousands of eminent figures in literature, journalism, diplomacy, the arts, and other fields are housed.\nThe George Sherman Union (GSU), located next to Mugar Memorial Library, provides students with a food court featuring many fast-food chains, including Panda Express, Basho, Starbucks, El Comal, Rhett's, The Coop, Halal Shack, and Urban Table. The GSU also provides lounge areas for students to relax or study. The basement of the George Sherman Union is home to the BU Central lounge, which hosts concerts and other activities and events.\nBU Castle, located on the West end of Bay State Road, is one of the older buildings on campus. The building was commissioned by William Lindsay for his own use in 1905, long before his daughter's honeymoon on the ill-fated \"Lusitania\". In 1939, the university acquired the property by agreement with the city to repay all back taxes owed; these funds were raised through donations from, among others, William Chenery, a University Trustee. It served as the residence of the university president until 1967, when President Christ-Janer found it too large for his needs as a residence and turned it to other uses. It is now a conference space. Underneath the Castle is the BU Pub, the only BU-operated drinking establishment on campus.\nThe Florence and Chafetz Hillel House on Bay State Road is the Hillel House for the university. With four floors and a basement, the facility includes lounges, study rooms and a kosher dining hall, open during the academic year (including Passover) to students and walk-ins from the community. The first floor also includes the Granby St. Cafe as well as TVs and ping-pong, pool and foosball tables. The Hillel serves as a focal point for BU's large and active Jewish community. It hosts approximately 30 student groups, including social, cultural, and religious groups, and BU Students for Israel (BUSI), Holocaust Education, and the Center for Jewish Learning and Experience. It hosts a plethora of programs and speakers as well as Shabbat services and meals.\nCultural life.\nThe university is located at the junction of Fenway-Kenmore, Allston, and Brookline. In the Fenway-Kenmore area are the Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the nightlife of Landsdowne Street as well as Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox. Allston has been Boston's largest bohemian neighborhood since the 1960s. Nicknamed \"Allston Rock City\", the neighborhood is home to many artists and musicians, as well as a variety of caf\u00e9s, and many of Boston's small music halls.\nBeyond the southern border of the campus in Brookline, Harvard Avenue offers independent and foreign films at Coolidge Corner Theatre, and author readings at the Brookline Booksmith. Other nearby cultural institutions include Symphony Hall, Jordan Hall, the main branch of the Boston Public Library in Copley Square, the art and commerce of fashionable Newbury Street, and across the Charles River, the museums, shops, and galleries in Harvard Square and elsewhere in Cambridge.\nThe university is home to the Boston Playwrights' Theatre. Previously associated with the Huntington Theatre Company on Huntington Avenue, but put the BU Theatre property up for sale in 2016, it cast a shadow over the future of the organization. BU replaced the old Huntington Theatre facilities with the new Joan and Edgar Booth Theatre, located next to the Fuller Building housing the College of Fine Arts.\nBU hosts campus and non-campus musical performances in the Tsai Performance Center at 685 Commonwealth Avenue, and the CFA Concert Hall at 855 Commonwealth Avenue.\nVisual art works by students and by visiting artists are displayed in rotating exhibitions in the university's three galleries: the BU Art Gallery (BUAG) at the Stone Gallery, the 808 Gallery, and the Sherman Gallery, located respectively at 855, 808, and 775 Commonwealth Avenue. In addition, BU had been associated with the Photographic Resource Center located at 832 Commonwealth Avenue, which mounts several exhibitions yearly, as well as special events for student and professional photographers. However, BU withdrew its support as of \u00a02017[ [update]], and the Photographic Resource Center is now a resident partner with the College of Art and Design at Lesley University.\nGuest and visitor policies.\nPrior to September 2007, Boston University had a restrictive visitor policy, which limited the ability of students from different dormitories to visit each other at night. This changed when a new policy approved by Brown took effect. The new policy allows for students living on campus to swipe into any on-campus dormitory between the hours of 7\u00a0am and 2\u00a0am using their Terrier cards. Student residents can also sign in guests with photo identification at any time, day or night. Overnight visitors of the opposite sex are no longer required to seek a same-sex \"co-host\". However, during reading period and the week before final exams, no guests are permitted in the halls overnight, and are expected to be out of the hall by 2\u00a0am.\nMass transit.\nMost of the buildings of the main campus are located on or near Commonwealth Avenue, served by the subway stop on the Green Line and five surface stops on the Green Line B branch. Crowding on the busy B branch is very seasonal; during the summer, ridership falls by more than half, largely due to the reduced student population. The South Campus and Fenway Campus areas are served by on the C branch and on the D branch. MBTA bus route 57 parallels the B branch on Commonwealth Avenue; on the MBTA Commuter Rail Framingham/Worcester Line is located near East Campus.\nBicycle traffic on Commonwealth Avenue is heavy, and advocacy groups have held public meetings with BU, the MBTA, and the City of Boston to improve safety and congestion along this travel corridor. The MBTA plans to consolidate and reduce the number of stops along Commonwealth Avenue to speed travel and to reduce construction costs to upgrade the remaining stations. Improvements planned include full handicapped accessibility at the new stations, fencing to encourage pedestrians to use protected crosswalks, traffic signal prioritization for transit vehicles, and improved esthetics. The Commonwealth Avenue Improvement Project is coordinated by the Massachusetts Highway Department, in cooperation with BU, the MBTA, the City of Boston, the Boston Water and Sewer Commission, and other organizations.\nThe medical campus is served by the #1 and CT1 crosstown buses, which run along Massachusetts Avenue, and the No. 47 and CT3 crosstown buses, which connect the Boston University Medical Center with the Longwood Medical Area. The Silver Line Washington Street Branch runs the entire length of the Medical Campus, one block north of most parts of the campus; it connects Boston University Medical Center with Tufts Medical Center station and downtown Boston. The nearest rapid transit subway station is the Massachusetts Avenue station on the Orange Line, located three blocks north of the Medical Center.\nSustainability.\nThe university has a sustainability initiative and a sustainability office. Boston University's Strategic Plan for Campus Sustainability is also integrated into the university's overarching strategic plan in many areas including the Climate Action Plan Task Force, a faculty-led initiative developing the university's first Climate Action Plan. The Campus Climate Lab, led by the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability in partnership with Boston University Sustainability and the Office of Research, provides opportunities for student-led research projects that support sustainability on the campus.\nIn July 2022, social scientist Benjamin Sovacool led the establishment of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability. Formerly the Institute for Sustainable Energy, the university-wide institute advances cross-disciplinary research on sustainability with a focus on justice and equity.\nThe university bought a wind farm in South Dakota to meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2040.\nOther campuses.\nLondon campus.\nBoston University's largest study abroad program is located in London, England. Boston University London Programmes offers a semester of study and work in London through their London Internship Program (LIP), as well as a number of other specialized programs. The LIP program combines a professional internship with coursework that examines a particular academic area in the context of Britain's history, culture, and society and its role in modern Europe. Courses in each academic area are taught exclusively to students enrolled in the Boston University program by a selected faculty body representing multiple cultural backgrounds. Upon successful completion of a semester, students earn 16 Boston University credits. BU London Programmes are headquartered in South Kensington, London. The campus consists of the main building at 43 Harrington Gardens, as well as three nearby residences to house students. This program is open to Boston University students, as well as students at other American colleges.\nLos Angeles campus.\nIn Los Angeles, the university has an internship program for students to study and work in the heart of the film, television, advertising, public relations, and entertainment management and law industries. The program offers three tracks from which undergraduate and graduate students can choose: Advertising and Public Relations, Film and Television, and Entertainment Management. Graduated students have the opportunity to continue their education by enrolling in the Los Angeles Certificate Program, where students can choose either the Acting in Hollywood or the Writer in Hollywood track. Courses are taught by Boston University faculty and alumni who serve as mentors in and out of the classroom. Upon successful completion of a semester students will earn 16 Boston University credits. Students who successfully complete the Los Angeles Certificate Program will receive 8 Boston University credits and a certificate from Boston University College of Fine Arts or College of Communication.\nParis campus.\nThe Paris Center runs several programs, the largest of which is the Paris Internship Program dating from 1989. Students take language and elective courses with French faculty at the BU Paris Center, then are placed in internships with French businesses and organizations in the area. Students live with host families or in a dormitory for the extent of the semester. Boston University Paris also organizes exchange programs with the business school Paris Dauphine University and a yearlong program with the \"Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Paris\" (Sciences Po).\nWashington, D.C. campus.\nIn Washington, D.C., Boston University offers internship, journalism and management programs. Students study in the university's building on Massachusetts Avenue in Dupont Circle and take advantage of the city by interning at different locations. In 2011, the university completed construction of a new, multistory residence to house students in the program featuring touch-less entry cards for security and suites with communal kitchens, right next to the Woodley Park Metro station. The Multimedia and Journalism program allows students to act as Washington, D.C. correspondents for newspapers and television stations across the Northeast and New England while interning at major news outlets in the city, as well as at many PR internships in politics, government and public affairs. Internship opportunities are also offered in a wide variety of sectors for students enrolled in other BU Study Abroad Washington programs.\nSydney campus.\nIn Sydney, Australia, Boston University has internship, management, film festival, travel writing, engineering, and School of Education programs that vary based on semester. Around 150 students live in the university's building in Chippendale developed by Tony Owen Partners. The building uses \"fissures to provide maximum solar access to bedrooms as well as natural ventilation throughout the building\". The building opened in the beginning of 2011 and features underground classrooms, a lecture hall, office space, library, and a roof patio.\nOther internship and study abroad opportunities are available through the Study Abroad office.\nAcademics.\nColleges and schools.\nBoston University offers bachelor's, master's, doctorate, medical, dental, and law degrees through its 17 schools and colleges. The newest school at Boston University is the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies (established 2014). Boston University Wheelock College of Education &amp; Human Development was renamed in 2018 following the merger with Wheelock College. In 2019, BU created the Faculty of Computing &amp; Data Sciences, which is an interdisciplinary academic unit that will train students in computing and enable them to combine data science with their chosen field. In 2022, BU's medical school was renamed the Aram V. Chobanian &amp; Edward Avedisian School of Medicine (following a $100 million gift from Edward Avedisian, a career clarinetist). In December 2024, the Center for Computing &amp; Data Sciences was renamed the Duan Family Center for Computing &amp; Data Sciences.\nEach school and college at the university has a three letter abbreviation, which is commonly used in place of their full school or college name. For example, the College of Arts &amp; Sciences is commonly referred to as CAS, the College of Engineering is ENG, the College of General Studies is CGS, and the College of Fine Arts is CFA.\nThe College of Fine Arts was formerly named the School of Fine Arts (SFA). The College of Arts &amp; Sciences (CAS) was formerly named the College of Liberal Arts (CLA). The College of Communication was formerly named the School of Public Communication (SPC). The Questrom School of Business (Questrom) was formerly known as the School of Management (SMG), and the College of Business Administration (CBA) prior to that. The College of General Studies (CGS) was formerly named the College of Basic Studies (CBS).\nThe Mental Health Counseling and Behavioral Medicine (MHCBM) Program at Boston University School of Medicine offers a master's degree for students who wish to become licensed to practice as a mental health counselor. The program adheres to educational guidelines and standards of the American Counseling Association (ACA), American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA), and the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), which is an independent agency recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The MHCBM Program is the only counselor education program in the entire United States that is housed in a medical school for solely training students in clinical mental health counseling to treat clients and patients with a mental disorder via counseling and psychotherapy. Boston University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.\nAdmissions.\nFall freshman statistics\nBased on currently enrolled student responses within the university student database 50.6% white, 14% Asian, 11.6% international students, 8.6% Hispanic, and 3.2% black. Fall 2015 international student enrollment at Boston University is 43% Chinese, 9% Indian, 5% Korean, 5% Saudi Arabian, 4% Canadian, 4% Taiwanese, 2% Turkish, and 1% from each of the following countries: Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico, Italy, France, Thailand, Spain, and Japan. The other 18% of international enrollment comes from 123 other countries. Among international students, 39% are pursuing undergraduate degrees, 37% are pursuing graduate degrees, and 23% are enrolled in other programs. BU has the largest number of Jews out of all private schools in the U.S. with about 6,000 students identifying as Jewish.\nThe plurality of registrants were from Massachusetts (19%), followed by New York (16%), New Jersey (9%), California (8%), Connecticut (4%), Pennsylvania (4%), and Texas (2%).\nBoston University's financial aid program, \"affordableBU\", meets 100% of the demonstrated need of domestic students (U.S. citizens and permanent residents).\nRankings.\n\"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranks Boston University tied for 42nd among national universities and tied for 86th among global universities for 2026. It also ranked BU 26th in \"Best Value Schools\" and tied for 42nd in \"Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs\" at schools whose highest degree is a doctorate. \"U.S. News &amp; World Report's\" 2025 list also ranks Boston University's online graduate information technology programs 10th in the U.S. the online graduate criminal justice programs tied for 6th, and the online graduate business programs (excluding MBAs) tied for 10th.\nBoston University is ranked No. 171 nationally in the 2025 \"Wall Street Journal/College Pulse\" U.S. colleges and universities ranking.\n\"QS World University Rankings\" ranked Boston University 88th overall in the world in its 2026 rankings.\n\"Times Higher Education\" ranked Boston University 76th in the world for 2026.\n\"Times Higher Education\" ranked Boston University 34th in the 2024\u201325 Global University Employability Rankings.\nThe Academic Ranking of World Universities ranks Boston University 38\u201348 in the United States, and 101\u2013150 in the world, in its 2025 list.\nIn 2016, the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" placed the Boston University School of Social Work as sixth in the nation for research productivity by faculty.\nBoston University is also one of 250 global universities selected for the Emerging Group's 2025 Global Employability University Ranking and Survey (GEURS), and is ranked 34th in the world (12th in the U.S.) within this select group.\nBU is one of 146 American universities receiving the highest research classification (\"RU/VH\") by the Carnegie Foundation.\nResearch.\nIn 2024, the university reported in $579.5M million in total research awards, and in fiscal year 2023 it ranked 16th in the U.S. among private institutions for all research and development expenditures. Funding sources included the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Department of Defense, the European Commission, the Susan G. Komen Foundation, and the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. The university's research enterprise encompasses dozens of fields, but its primary focus currently lies in seven areas: data science, engineering biology, global health, infectious diseases, neuroscience, photonics, and urban health.\nIn 2017, BU received a $20 million grant over five years from the NSF in order to establish an Engineering Research Center (ERC). The ERC's goal is to bioengineer functional heart tissue. The director of the center is David Bishop, a professor of physics and computer and electrical engineering.\nIn 2003, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded Boston University a grant to build one of two National Biocontainment Laboratories. The National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) was created to study emerging infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to public health. NEIDL has biosafety level 2, 3, and 4 (BSL-2, BSL-3, and BSL-4, respectively) labs that enable researchers to work safely with the pathogens. BSL-4 labs are the highest level of biosafety labs and work with diseases with a high risk of aerosol transmission.\nThe strategic plan also encouraged research collaborations with industry and government partners. In 2016, as part of a broadbased effort to solve the critical problem of antibiotic resistance, the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) selected the BU School of Law (LAW)\u2014and Kevin Outterson, a BU professor of law\u2014to lead a $350 million trans-Atlantic public-private partnership called CARB-X to foster the preclinical development of new antibiotics and antimicrobial rapid diagnostics and vaccines. CARB-X was allotted an additional $370 million in funding in May 2022. HHS will continue to support CARB-X with up to $300 million over 10 years, and global charity Wellcome will fund up to $70 million over three years. In May 2023, CARB-X secured renewed funding from the UK government (\u00a324M over four years) and the German government (\u20ac39M over four years, and \u20ac2M for accelerator), and the Canadian government also announced its plan to support CARB-X with CAD $6.3 million over two years.\nIn its effort to increase diversity and inclusion, Boston University appointed Ibram X. Kendi in July 2020 as a history professor and the director and founder of its newly established Center for Antiracist Research. The university also appointed alumna Andrea Taylor as its first senior diversity officer. Later in August, Twitter founder and then CEO Jack Dorsey donated $10 million to the Center, noting that the gift came with \"no string attached.\" Ibram Kendi was named a 2021 MacArthur fellow and will receive a \"genius grant\" of $625,000 split over five years for his center's research.\nOn March 2, 2025, the Lunar Environment heliospheric X-ray Imager (LEXI) telescope landed on the moon\u2014a first for BU\u2014aboard NASA's Blue Ghost lunar lander. BU researchers involved included principal investigator Brian Walsh, lead data scientist Ramiz Qudsi, and others. LEXI will send information on Earth's magnetic shield back to BU for analysis.\nGrade deflation.\nThe independently run student newspaper at Boston University, \"The Daily Free Press\", and \"The New York Times\", have published articles exploring the existence of grade deflation. The \"Times\" discovered that administrators have suggested to faculty members deflated ideal grade distributions. Although an article in the official publication \"BU Today\" asserted that \"the GPAs of BU undergrads and the percentage of As and Bs have both risen over the last two decades\", \"The New York Times\" has found BU grades have been rising more slowly with respect to many other schools.\nIn 2014, the average GPA of a BU undergraduate was 3.16, compared to the averages of 3.35 for Boston College (2007), 3.48 for Amherst College (2006), 3.52 for New York University (2015), and 3.65 for Harvard University (2015).\nAbout 81 percent of all grades earned are in either the A or B range (75% in the B range). The article went on to note that although the university attempted to curb grade inflation and inconsistency in the late 1990s, both the percentage of As and GPAs have been rising since. They attributed the grade inflation that has occurred not to teachers' grading policies, but to the increasing quality of each incoming class which leads to more top grades.\nJournals and publication.\nBoston University is home to several academic journals and publications. The School of Law hosts six nationally recognized law journals: the \"Boston University Law Review\", \"American Journal of Law and Medicine\", \"Review of Banking &amp; Financial Law\", \"Boston University International Law Journal\", \"Journal of Science and Technology Law\", and \"Public Interest Law Journal\". The School of Education houses the \"Journal of Education\", which is the oldest continuously published journal in the field of education in the country.

The university was founded in 1965 as part of a government initiative to expand higher education. Warwick Business School was established in 1967, Warwick Law School in 1968, Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) in 1980, and Warwick Medical School in 2000. Warwick incorporated Coventry College of Education in 1979 and Horticulture Research International in 2004.\nWarwick is primarily based on a campus on the outskirts of Coventry, with a satellite campus in Wellesbourne and a central London base at the Shard. It is organised into three faculties\u2014Arts; Science, Engineering and Medicine; and Social Sciences\u2014within which there are thirty-two departments. Warwick has around 29,534 full-time students and 2,691 academic and research staff, with an average intake of 4,950 undergraduates out of 38,071 applicants (7.7 applicants per place). The annual income of the institution for 2023\u201324 was \u00a3850.5\u00a0million of which \u00a3146.5\u00a0million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3559.6\u00a0million. Warwick Arts Centre is a multi-venue arts complex in the university's main campus and is the largest venue of its kind in the UK outside of London.\nIn 2024, Warwick ranked tenth nationally for undergraduate education. Warwick is a member of AACSB, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Association of MBAs, EQUIS, the European University Association, the Midlands Innovation group, the Russell Group, Sutton 13 and Universities UK. It is the only European member of the Center for Urban Science and Progress, a collaboration with New York University. The university has extensive commercial activities, including the University of Warwick Science Park and WMG, University of Warwick.\nWarwick's alumni and staff include winners of the Nobel Prize, Turing Award, Fields Medal, Richard W. Hamming Medal, Emmy Award, Grammy, and the Padma Vibhushan, and are fellows to the British Academy, the Royal Society of Literature, the Royal Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society.

Researchers at Warwick have also made significant contributions such as the development of penicillin, music therapy, the Washington Consensus, computing standards, including ISO and ECMA, complexity theory, contract theory, and the International Political Economy as a field of study. Warwick is also known for being the center of the experimental cultural theorist collective Cybernetic Culture Research Unit, which had significant influence on computer science, philosophy, occultism, and the cyberpunk genre.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nTwentieth century.\nThe idea for a university in Warwickshire was first mooted shortly after World War II, although it was not founded for a further two decades. A partnership of the city and county councils ultimately provided the impetus for the university to be established on a site jointly granted by the two authorities. There was some discussion between local sponsors from both the city and county over whether it should be named after Coventry or Warwickshire. The name \"University of Warwick\" was adopted, even though Warwick, the county town, lies some to its southwest and Coventry's city centre is only northeast of the campus. The establishment of the University of Warwick was given approval by the government in 1961 and it received its Royal Charter of Incorporation in 1965. Since then, the university has incorporated the former Coventry College of Education in 1979 and has extended its land holdings by the continuing purchase of adjoining farm land. The university also benefited from a substantial donation from the family of John Martin, a Coventry businessman who had made a fortune from investment in Smirnoff vodka, and which enabled the construction of the Warwick Arts Centre.\nThe university admitted its first, small intake of graduate students in 1964, and took its first 450 undergraduates in October 1965. Since its establishment Warwick has expanded its grounds to , with many modern buildings and academic facilities, lakes, and woodlands. In the 1960s and 1970s, Warwick had a reputation as a politically radical institution. Under Vice-Chancellor Lord Butterworth, Warwick was the first UK university to adopt a business approach to higher education, develop close links with the business community and exploit the commercial value of its research. These tendencies were discussed by British historian and then-Warwick lecturer, E. P. Thompson, in his 1970 edited book \"Warwick University Ltd.\". The Leicester Warwick Medical School, a new medical school based jointly at Warwick and Leicester University, opened in September 2000.\nOn the recommendation of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bill Clinton chose Warwick as the venue for his last major foreign policy address as US President in December 2000. Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, explaining the decision in a press briefing on 7 December 2000, said that: \"Warwick is one of Britain's newest and finest research universities, singled out by Prime Minister Blair as a model both of academic excellence and independence from the government.\"\nTwenty-first century.\nThe university was seen as a favoured institution of the Labour government during the New Labour years from 1997 to 2010. It was academic partner for a number of flagship Government schemes including the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth and the NHS University which is now defunct. Tony Blair described Warwick as \"a beacon among British universities for its dynamism, quality and entrepreneurial zeal\". In a 2012 study by Virgin Media Business, Warwick was described as the most \"digitally-savvy\" UK university.\nIn February 2001, IBM donated a new S/390 computer and software worth \u00a32\u00a0million to Warwick, to form part of a \"Grid\" enabling users to remotely share computing power. In April 2004 Warwick merged with the Wellesbourne and Kirton sites of Horticulture Research International. In July 2004 Warwick was the location for an important agreement between the Labour Party and the trade unions on Labour policy and trade union law, which has subsequently become known as the \"Warwick Agreement\".\nIn June 2006, the new University Hospital Coventry opened, including a university clinical sciences building. Warwick Medical School was granted independent degree-awarding status in 2007, and the School's partnership with the University of Leicester was dissolved in the same year. In February 2010, Lord Bhattacharyya, director and founder of the WMG unit at Warwick, made a \u00a31\u00a0million donation to the university to support science grants and awards.\nIn February 2012, Warwick and Melbourne-based Monash University announced the formation of a strategic partnership, including the creation of ten joint senior academic posts, new dual master's and joint doctoral degrees, and co-ordination of research programmes. In March 2012, Warwick and Queen Mary, University of London announced the creation of a strategic partnership, including research collaboration, some joint teaching of English, history and computer science undergraduates, and the creation of eight joint post-doctoral research fellowships. \nIn April 2012, it was announced that Warwick would be the only European university participating in the Center for Urban Science and Progress, an applied science research institute to be based in New York consisting of an international consortium of universities and technology companies led by New York University and NYU-Poly. In August 2012, Warwick and five other Midlands-based universities\u2014Aston University, the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, Loughborough University and the University of Nottingham\u2014formed the M5 Group, a regional bloc intended to maximise the member institutions' research income and enable closer collaboration.\nIn September 2013, it was announced that a new National Automotive Innovation Centre would be built by WMG at Warwick's main campus at a cost of \u00a3100\u00a0million, with \u00a350\u00a0million to be contributed by Jaguar Land Rover and \u00a330\u00a0million by Tata Motors. The centre will open in Summer 2018. The building was opened by HRH The Prince of Wales on 18 February 2020.\nIn July 2014, the government announced that Warwick would be the host for the \u00a31\u00a0billion Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC), a non-profit organization that facilitates funding to UK-based research and development projects developing low-carbon emission powertrain technologies. The APC manages a \u00a31 billion investment fund, which is jointly supplied by the automotive industry \u2013 via the Automotive Council \u2013 and the UK government through the Department for Business and Trade and managed by Innovate UK.\nIn September 2015, Warwick celebrated its 50th anniversary and was designated \"University of the Year\" by \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\". In December 2017, the university announced it would not continue with a project to open a Campus in Roseville, California. The university had spent \u00a31.2 million on the project.\nIn 2023, the students' union voted for all the union-run catering to offer all plant-based meals. The vote was supported in order to reduce climate change emissions. By the following academic year, the menus will be 50% vegan and then will be fully plant-based by 2027. It is the eighth student union at a U.K. university to adopt plant-based catering.\nCampus.\nWarwick is located on the outskirts of Coventry, southwest of the city centre and not in the town of Warwick as its name suggests. The university's main site comprises three contiguous campuses, all within walking distance of each other. The university also owns a site in Wellesbourne, acquired in 2004 when it merged with Horticulture Research International.\nMain campus.\nThe main Warwick campus occupies between the City of Coventry and the County of Warwickshire. The original buildings of the campus are in contemporary 1960s architecture. The campus contains all of the main student amenities, all but four of the student halls of residence, and the Students' Union. The campus is split between the parliamentary constituencies of Kenilworth and Southam and Coventry South.\nWarwick Arts Centre.\nThe Warwick Arts Centre is a multi-venue arts complex situated at the centre of Warwick's main campus. It attracts around 300,000 visitors a year to over 3,000 individual events spanning contemporary and classical music, drama, dance, comedy, films and visual art. The centre comprises six principal spaces: the Butterworth Hall, a 1,500-seat concert hall; a 550-seat theatre; a 180-seat theatre studio; three cinema screens; the Mead Gallery, an art gallery; and the Music Centre, with practice rooms, and an ensemble rehearsal room where music societies and groups can rehearse. In addition the site includes a restaurant/ caf\u00e9.\nUniversity House.\nIn 2003, Warwick acquired the former headquarters of National Grid, which it converted into an administration building renamed University House. There is a student-run facility called the \u2018Learning Grid\u2019 in the building, which includes two floors of PC clusters, scanners, photocopiers, a reference library, interactive whiteboards and plasma screens for use by individuals and for group work.\nKoan.\nThe \"White Koan\" is a modern art sculpture by Liliane Lijn which is installed outside the back entrance to the Warwick Arts Centre. The \"Koan\" is high, white in colour, decorated with elliptical of fluorescent lights and is rotated by an electric motor whilst illuminated. It is intended to represent the Buddhist quest for questions without answers, the K\u014dan. The \"Koan\" was made in 1971 as part of the Peter Stuyvesant Foundation City Sculpture Project and was originally sited in Plymouth; it moved to the Hayward Gallery in London before being purchased by Warwick in 1972. \nThe \"Koan\" was temporarily relocated to the university's Gibbet Hill campus during refurbishments to the Warwick Arts Centre; it was returned upon completion of the project. According to student newspaper \"The Boar\", the white Koan has played a role in many of campus' myths and legends \u2013 it was allegedly the nose-cap of the Blue-Streak Missile, a supposed quick escape route for senior staff, and even a signalling device for aliens in outer space.\nThe \"Koan\" even garnered its own cartoon strip in the 1990s, with thirty-two episodes created by Steve Shipway. The Koan Worshipping Society, led by the Koanists, believe the \"Koan\" is \u201cthe earth-bound manifestation of the immortal Koan, the creator of the universe\u201d.\nSports facilities.\nIn April 2019, the university opened a new \u00a349\u00a0million Sports and Wellness Hub, on the main campus, featuring two sports halls with arena style balcony, the largest gym in the Higher education sector, a 12-lane 25 metre pool with movable floor, climbing and bouldering walls, squash courts, studio spaces and a caf\u00e9. The previous main sports centre was closed on 7 April 2019, \nElsewhere on campus is another sports hall, a \u00a32.5\u00a0million 4-court indoor tennis centre with floodlit outdoor courts, a 400\u00a0m athletics track, multi-purpose outdoor surfaces, and over of outdoor playing fields, including a football pitch and cricket grounds. Warwick was an official training venue for the London 2012 Olympics. During the Games, some football matches were played at the nearby Ricoh Arena, home at the time to Coventry City Football Club, and Warwick provided training and residential facilities for the Olympic teams.\nEsports facilities.\nIn September 2021, Warwick opened its esports centre in the new Junction building on central campus, marking it as the first esports facility opened in a Russell Group university and also the first university esports facility to be opened in the UK that is not tied to a degree. The centre is equipped with 24 PCs, and is designed to be easily configurable and moveable to facilitate the hosting of larger scale events. The centre is open to all of the public, not just students of the university, and this is all only part of \"Phase 1\" of a larger push from the university to invest in esports. The centre is sponsored by Uninn and Coventry City Football Club, partnered with Sky Blues in the Community, Women in Games and Special Effect and has its tech supplied by Chillblast and HyperX.\nOther sites.\nOther Warwick sites include:\nRecent developments.\nIn November 2005, Warwick outlined proposals for how it would like to develop its campus over the next fifteen years. The proposals built upon recent construction activity including a new Mathematics and Statistics Building, new Computer Science Building, new Business School buildings, a Digital Laboratory, new Residences and an expanded Sports Centre. The proposals envisage a shift in the \"centre of gravity\" of the campus away from the Students' Union towards University House and a proposed \"Academic Square\".\nDeveloped projects included an inter-disciplinary biosciences research facility; a \u00a325\u00a0million upgrade to Warwick Business School; and the National Automotive Innovation Campus (NAIC), a new \u00a3150\u00a0million venture funded by Jaguar Land Rover and the UK government. The NAIC's purpose was to research and develop novel technologies to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and to reduce CO2 emissions. The new campus for postgraduates was opened in early-2020. The campus has been dubbed a \"brain trust\" and is intended to pioneer the green and high-tech sports and luxury cars of tomorrow, doubling the size of Jaguar's research team.\nIn 2017, the university announced its intention to see an exponential growth of its main campus in order to remain \"world-class\" and cope with the growing number of applications it receives each year, especially from non-UK students. This growth included a new \u00a333\u00a0million Faculty of Arts, a \u00a355\u00a0million new sports centre which was finished in April 2019, a new \u00a354.3\u00a0million Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research Building (IBRB), a new type of student accommodation called \"Cryfield Village\", the expansion of Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), a redevelopment for the Art centre and a new Library. For this occasion, Vice-Chancellor of Warwick University Stuart Croft declared: \"New buildings are and will continue to be a part of our everyday existence. We need to open one new academic building a year from now until at least 2023. In order to do this and to keep Warwick as one of the world\u2019s leading universities, we need to do this together, involving the whole community.\"\nOrganisation and administration.\nWarwick is governed by two formal bodies: the Council and the Senate. In addition to these, a steering committee provide strategic leadership in between meetings of the formal bodies. Faculties are overseen by faculty boards which report to the Senate. The principal officers of the university have responsibility for day-to-day operations of the university. These include the registrar, the University secretary, the group finance director, the director of commercial, the chief information and transformation officer, and the chief communications officer. The latter two roles were created after it emerged that the current registrar, Rachel Sandby-Thomas, had failed in her duty as the then data protection officer to notify staff, students, and partners of a series of significant breaches.\nFaculties and departments.\nWarwick's academic activities are organised into the following faculties and departments:\nFinances.\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2024, the University of Warwick had a total income of \u00a3850.5\u00a0million (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3828.2\u00a0million) and total expenditure of \u00a3559.6\u00a0million (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3722.1\u00a0million). Key sources of income included \u00a3459.6\u00a0million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3453.8\u00a0million), \u00a374.1\u00a0million from funding body grants (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a374.4\u00a0million), \u00a3146.5\u00a0million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3144.1\u00a0million), \u00a324\u00a0million from investment income (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a314.5\u00a0million) and \u00a34.5\u00a0million from donations and endowments (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a33.9\u00a0million).\nAt year end, Warwick had endowments of \u00a37.3\u00a0million (2023 \u2013 \u00a36.7\u00a0million) and total net assets of \u00a3733.3\u00a0million (2023 \u2013 \u00a3444.7\u00a0million).\nCoat of arms.\nWarwick's coat of arms depicts atoms of two isotopes of lithium, a DNA helix to represent science and also the \"Bear and Ragged Staff\", historically associated with Warwickshire and previously the Earls of Warwick as well as the Elephant and Castle of Coventry. The Bear is not chained in the current depiction of the university's coat of arms, although it had been in its original grant of Letters Patent by the College of Arms.\nAcademic profile.\nIn 2023/24, Warwick's student body consisted of 29,435 students, composed of 19,430 undergraduates and 10,005 postgraduate students. About 43% of the student body comes from outside the UK and over 120 countries are represented on the campus. The university has twenty-nine academic departments and over forty research centres and institutes, in three faculties: Arts, Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and Social Sciences. There were 2,492 academic and research staff in October 2018.\nInternational partnerships.\nWarwick students can study abroad for a semester or a year and may obtain a double degree. International partners include Columbia University, University of Waterloo, McGill University, Cornell University, UC Berkeley, Sciences Po Paris, and the Balsillie School of International Affairs.\nRankings and reputation.\nWarwick has a number of subjects within the 2022 ARWU's global top 50:\nIn broad subject rankings, Warwick is ranked 36th globally for Social Sciences, 42nd for Humanities, and 78th for Natural Sciences, 164th for Engineering and Technology, and 204th for Life Sciences and Medicine according to the 2020 QS World University Rankings.\nThe Times Higher Education rankings has ranked six out of eleven subjects at Warwick within the global top 100 in 2020:\nWarwick's Economics department and Politics and International Studies (PAIS) department were ranked 1st in the UK by the Good University Guide 2020 ahead of Oxbridge. The Mathematics department was ranked 10th in the world (3rd in the UK) in 2019 by Academic Ranking of World Universities and 19th in the world (4th in the UK) in 2020 by QS. The Guardian University Guide ranks Warwick Business School (WBS) second only after Oxford's Sa\u00efd Business School in Business and Management in 2014. The 2020 QS World University Rankings ranked WBS 4th in the UK and 23rd globally. However, Law and Legal Studies at Warwick has dropped from 36th globally in 2013 to 51\u2013100th in 2020.\nWarwick is consistently ranked amongst the top ten in the three major national rankings of British universities. Warwick is a member of the 'Sutton 13' of top ranked universities in the UK. Warwick was declared as \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" \"University of the Year\" 2015. Overall, nineteen of the twenty-seven subjects offered by Warwick were ranked within the top 10 nationally in 2019 by the Complete University Guide. In 2017, Warwick was named as the university with the joint second highest graduate employment rate of any UK university, with 97.7% of its graduates in work or further study three and a half years after graduation.\nAdmissions.\nWarwick students also average top A-Level grades with new entrants in 2022 amassing an average of 168 UCAS points, the 18th highest in the country. The university gave offers of admission to 62% of its undergraduate applicants in 2022, the 34th lowest offer rate across the country. For 2017 entry, the university was one of only a few mainstream universities (along with Cambridge, Imperial College, LSE, Oxford, St Andrews, and UCL) to have no courses available in Clearing.\n22% of Warwick's undergraduates are privately educated, the fifteenth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities. In the 2016\u201317 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 66:9:25 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 50:50.\nLibrary.\nThe main university library is located in the middle of the main campus. It houses approximately 1,265,000 books and over 13 kilometres of archives and manuscripts. The main library houses services to support Research and Teaching practice and collaboration between departments. The Wolfson Research Exchange opened in October 2008 and provides collaboration spaces, seminar rooms, conference facilities and study areas for Postgraduate Research students. The Teaching Grid, which opened in 2008, is a flexible space which allows teaching staff to try out new technologies and techniques. Adjacent to the main library building is the Modern Records Centre, a sizeable archive collection, including the UK's largest industrial relations collection.\nCCRU.\nThe Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU, sometimes typeset Ccru) was an experimental cultural theorist collective formed in late 1995 at Warwick University, England which gradually separated from academia until it dissolved in the early 2000s. It garnered reputation for its idiosyncratic and surreal \"theory-fiction\" which incorporated philosophy, cyberpunk, and occultism, and its work has since had an online cult following related to the rise in popularity of accelerationism. \nThe CCRU are strongly associated with former leading members Sadie Plant, Mark Fisher and Nick Land. Established at the University of Warwick philosophy department, the group listed their interests as \"cinema, complexity, currencies, dance music, e-cash, encryption, feminism, fiction, images, inorganic life, jungle, markets, matrices, microbiotics, multimedia, networks, numbers, perception, replication, sex, simulation, sound, telecommunications, textiles, texts, trade, video, virtuality, war\". Iain Hamilton Grant notes \"Neuromancer\" as particularly influential to the group's formation. In addition to drawing inspiration from Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari's \"Anti-Oedipus\" and \"A Thousand Plateaus\", to which references can be found in the CCRU's writings, the collective drew inspiration from writers including H. P. Lovecraft, William Gibson, J. G. Ballard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Octavia Butler, William S. Burroughs, Carl Jung. Fisher described the CCRU's work as \"a kind of exuberant anti-politics, a \u2018technihilo' celebration of the irrelevance of human agency, partly inspired by the pro-markets, anti-capitalism line developed by Manuel DeLanda out of Braudel, and from the section of \"Anti-Oedipus\" that talks about marketization as the 'revolutionary path.'\" Their later work drew upon occultism, esotericism, numerology, and the work of Lovecraft and Aleister Crowley. \nRoc Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros considers the CCRU's work to be influential on the development of speculative realism, while Fisher considered speculative realism to be returning to the CCRU's areas of interest in 2010. In 2017, the CCRU was labeled by \"The Guardian\" as influential in computer science, philosophy, occultism, and cyberpunk, and credited with the creation of accelerationism.\nResearch.\nIn 2013, Warwick had a total research income of \u00a390.1\u00a0million, of which \u00a333.9\u00a0million was from Research Councils; \u00a325.9\u00a0million was from central government, local authorities and public corporations; \u00a312.7\u00a0million was from the European Union; \u00a37.9\u00a0million was from UK industry and commerce; \u00a35.2\u00a0million was from UK charitable bodies; \u00a34.0\u00a0million was from overseas sources; and \u00a30.5\u00a0million was from other sources. In the 2014 UK Research Excellence Framework (REF), Warwick was again ranked 7th overall amongst multi-faculty institutions and was the top-ranked university in the Midlands. 87% of the university's academic staff were rated as being in \"world-leading\" or \"internationally excellent\" departments with top research ratings of 4* or 3*.\nWarwick is particularly strong in the areas of decision sciences research including economics, finance, management, mathematics and statistics. For instance, researchers of Warwick Business School have won the highest prize of the prestigious European Case Clearing House. Warwick has also established a number of stand-alone units to manage and extract commercial value from its research activities. The four most prominent examples of these units are University of Warwick Science Park; Warwick HRI; Warwick Ventures; and WMG.\nCommercial focus.\nWarwick has at times received criticism for being too commercially focused, at the expense of academic creativity and diversity. The most famous proponent of this critique was the noted historian E. P. Thompson, who edited and wrote much of \"Warwick University Ltd\" in 1971. The book focuses on the brief student occupation of the Registry in 1967, and its causes, the files that were discovered and published, and the subsequent actions of the university, students and staff.\nNevertheless, with the appointment of Sir Nicholas Scheele as Chancellor in 2002, the university signalled that it intended to continue and expand its commercial activities. In an interview for the BBC, Scheele said: \"I think in the future, education and industry need to become even more closely linked than they have been historically. As government funding changes, the replacement could well come through private funding from companies, individuals and grant-giving agencies.\"\nStudent life.\nThe university has a campus cat named Rolf.\nStudents' Union.\nThe University of Warwick Students' Union is one of the largest students' unions in the UK, with over 260 societies and 67 sports clubs including basketball, rowing and ice hockey. The Union has an annual turnover of approximately \u00a36\u00a0million, the profit from which is used to provide services to students and to employ its staff and sabbatical officers. The Union is divided into two buildings\u2014SUHQ and The Union Building. The Union Building contains a three-room club venue known as \"The Copper Rooms\"; CAMRA-accredited \"The Dirty Duck\" pub; a popular bar called \"The Terrace Bar\"; Curiositea, a tea shop known for its hot chocolates, cakes and vintage atmosphere; The Graduate, a postgraduate social and study space; and The Bread Oven, a design-your-own sandwich shop.\nStudent media.\nStudent media at Warwick includes:\n\"University Challenge\".\nThe university won BBC television's \"University Challenge\" competition in 2021. This was their second win \u2013 their first was in 2007, beating the title-holders University of Manchester in the final.\nEsports.\nThe University of Warwick are the five-time UK Esports \"University of the Year\", having won the title every year since its inception. In August 2022, Warwick became the first UK university to receive a finalist nomination for the Esports Awards, for Esports Collegiate Program of the Year, with Head of Esports Jack Fenton also becoming the first UK nominee for Collegiate Ambassador of the Year. Warwick fields numerous esports teams each year through its student-run esports society, Warwick Esports, who compete out of the Esports Centre.\nStudent housing.\nThe Warwick campus currently has around 6,300 student bedrooms across a range of undergraduate and postgraduate residences. All of the residences are self-catered, and each has residential tutors and a warden. Warwick guarantees accommodation for all first-year undergraduate students, regardless of their present address. Many of the university's postgraduate population are also catered for, with some specific residences available for postgraduate living. Each residence accommodates a mixture of students both with home and international status, male and female, and, sometimes, undergraduate and postgraduate.\nIn their second and third years, many students live in one of the surrounding towns: either Coventry, Canley, Kenilworth or Royal Leamington Spa, where they can live in student accommodation or independently owned residences. Since 2011, Warwick has constructed two new halls of residences for the students. Bluebell, opened in 2011, offers accommodation in flats of eight people, with a total of 505 single rooms for first-year undergraduates. The Sherbourne residences was opened in 2012, which similarly provides 527 ensuite rooms to first-years, and was extended with a further 267 rooms in 2017. A further 700 new rooms were built in the Cryfield Village, namely Cryfield \u2018Townhouse\u2019 and \u2018Standard\u2019 residences.\nPolitical incidents.\nIn June 2014, the university announced Alex Davies, a member of the proscribed terrorist organisation National Action, voluntarily withdrew from his course. In early 2018, it was made public that a group of male students had constituted a group chat in which many references to rape, occasionally targeted at particular other students, and other sexual offences were made, in such a way which left significant cause for concern. As a result of this and other incidents, students staged a Sit-in in 2021 in the central plaza of the university. In January 2020, the university was criticised for choosing not to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism. This decision was later reversed in October following intervention by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. In June 2024, Students of the University's Conservative association were filmed singing and dancing to the Nazi-era World War II marching song \"Erika\" at their annual black-tie dinner.\nNotable people.\nWarwick has over 150,000 alumni and an active alumni network. Among the university's alumni, academic staff and researchers are two Nobel Laureates, a Turing Award winner, and a significant number of fellows of the British Academy, the Royal Society of Literature, the Royal Academy of Engineering, and the Royal Society.

{"id": "61116", "revid": "47841979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61116", "title": "Imperial College London", "text": "Public university in England\nThe Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, known by its trade names Imperial College London and Imperial, is a public research university in London, England. Its history began with Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, who envisioned South Kensington as a cultural district with museums, colleges, and the Royal Albert Hall. In 1907, these colleges \u2013 the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines, and the City and Guilds of London Institute \u2013 merged to form Imperial College London. \nIn 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary's Hospital Medical School and then with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School to form the Imperial College School of Medicine. The Imperial Business School was established in 2003 and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Formerly a constituent college of the University of London, Imperial became an independent university in 2007.\nImperial is organised into four faculties: Engineering, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Business. The university encourages innovation and enterprise across all its faculties by integrating business courses into science degrees and providing business students with a scientific education. The main campus is located in South Kensington, with an additional campus in White City. The Faculty of Medicine also operates five teaching hospitals across London and is a founding institution of the Francis Crick Institute.\nIts graduates and academics include 14 Nobel Prize winners, three Fields Medal winners, 74 Fellows of the Royal Society and 84 Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nThe earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the Royal College of Chemistry, founded in 1845, with the support of Prince Albert and parliament. This was merged in 1853 into what became known as the Royal School of Mines. The medical school has roots in many different schools across London, the oldest of which being Charing Cross Hospital Medical School which can be traced back to 1823, followed by teaching starting at Westminster Hospital in 1834, and St Mary's Hospital in 1851.\nIn 1851, the Great Exhibition was organised as an exhibition of culture and industry by Henry Cole and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria. An enormously popular and financial success, proceeds from the Great Exhibition were designated to develop an area for cultural and scientific advancement in South Kensington. Within the next six years the Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum had opened, joined by new facilities in 1871 for the Royal College of Chemistry, and in 1881 the opening of the Royal School of Mines and Natural History Museum.\nIn 1881, the Normal School of Science was established in South Kensington under the leadership of Thomas Huxley, taking over responsibility for the teaching of the natural sciences and agriculture from the Royal School of Mines. The school was renamed the Royal College of Science by royal consent in 1890. The Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London Institute was opened as a technical education school on Exhibition Road by the Prince of Wales in 1884, with courses beginning in 1885.\n20th century.\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that Great Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as \u2013 if an agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute \u2013 its Central Technical College.\nOn 8 July 1907, Edward VII granted a Royal Charter establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the City and Guilds College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the University of London. The college joined the University of London on 22 July 1908, with the City and Guilds College joining in 1910. The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute, the new building for the Royal College of Science having opened across from it in 1906, and the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building being laid by King Edward VII in July 1909.\nAs students at Imperial had to study separately for London degrees, in January 1919, students and alumni voted for a petition to make Imperial a university with its own degree awarding powers, independent of the University of London. In response, the University of London changed its regulations in 1925 so that the courses taught only at Imperial would be examined by the university, enabling students to gain a Bachelor of Science. In October 1945, George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Imperial to commemorate the centenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, which was the oldest of the institutions that united to form Imperial College. \"Commemoration Day\", named after this visit, is held every October as the university's main graduation ceremony. The college also acquired a biology field station at Silwood Park near Ascot, Berkshire in 1947\nFollowing World War II, there was again concern that Britain was falling behind in science \u2013 this time to the United States. The Percy Report of 1945 and Barlow Committee in 1946 called for a \"British MIT\"-equivalent, backed by influential scientists as politicians of the time, including Lord Cherwell, Sir Lawrence Bragg and Sir Edward Appleton. The University Grants Committee strongly opposed however, and so a compromise was reached in 1953, where Imperial would remain within the university but double in size over the following ten years. The expansion led to a number of new buildings being erected. These included the Hill building in 1957 and the Physics building in 1960, and the completion of the East Quadrangle, built in four stages between 1959 and 1965. The building work also meant the demolition of the City and Guilds College building in 1962\u201363, and the Imperial Institute's building by 1967. Opposition from the Royal Fine Arts Commission and others meant that Queen's Tower was retained, with work carried out between 1966 and 1968 to make it free standing. New laboratories for biochemistry, established with the support of a \u00a3350,000 grant from the Wolfson Foundation, were opened by the Queen in 1965.\nIn 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary's Hospital Medical School under the Imperial College Act 1988. Amendments to the royal charter changed the formal name of the institution to \"The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine\" and made St Mary's a constituent college. This was followed by mergers with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997, with the Imperial College Act 1997 formally establishing the Imperial College School of Medicine.\n21st century.\nIn 2003, Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council. In 2004, the Imperial Business School and a new main college entrance on Exhibition Road were opened. The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London. Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007.\nIn April 2011, Imperial and King's College London joined the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation as partners with a commitment of \u00a340 million each to the project. The centre was later renamed the Francis Crick Institute and opened on 9 November 2016. It is the largest single biomedical laboratory in Europe. The college began moving into the new White City campus in 2016, with the launching of the Innovation Hub. This was followed by the opening of the Molecular Sciences Research Hub for the Department of Chemistry, officially opened by Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan in 2019.\nIn 2014, Stefan Grimm, of the Department of Medicine, was found dead after being told that he was \"struggling to fulfil the metrics\" of his professorial post. The college announced an internal inquiry into his death and found that the performance metrics for his position were unreasonable, but new metrics would be needed to replace them.\nCampuses.\nSouth Kensington.\nThe South Kensington campus is the college's main campus, where most teaching and research takes place. It is home to many notable buildings, such as the business school, Royal School of Mines, and Royal College of Science. It is also the original site of the Imperial Institute, whose Queen's Tower stands at the heart of the campus overlooking Queen's Lawn. As part of a cultural centre known as Albertopolis the campus is surrounded by many of London's most popular attractions, including the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace, museums including the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and Victoria and Albert Museum, and institutions such as the Royal College of Art, the Royal College of Music, and the National Art Library.\nThe campus has many restaurants and caf\u00e9s run by the college, and contains much of the college's student accommodation, including the Prince's Garden Halls, and Beit Hall, home to the college union, which runs student pubs, a nightclub, and a cinema on site. To the north, within easy walking distance of the college, are Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, with green spaces and sports facilities used by many of the student clubs.\nWhite City.\nImperial has a new second major campus in White City providing a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship. This campus was built on land previously owned by BBC. The hub houses research facilities, postgraduate accommodation, as well as a commercialisation space. The campus is home to the Scale Space and incubator, Invention Rooms, a college hackerspace and community outreach centre. The White City campus also includes another biomedical centre funded by Sir Michael Uren.\nImperial revealed plans in 2025 to build an AI campus at White City, centred on a new 12-storey building designed by Allies and Morrison, to be constructed between 2028 and 2029.\nSilwood Park.\nSilwood Park is a postgraduate campus of Imperial in the village of Sunninghill near Ascot in Berkshire. The Silwood Park campus remains a centre for research and teaching in ecology, evolution, and conservation. It is set in 100 hectares of parkland used for ecological field experiments.\nHospitals.\nImperial has teaching hospitals across London which are used by the School of Medicine for undergraduate clinical teaching and medical research. All are based around college-affiliated hospitals, and also provide catering and sport facilities. College libraries are located on each campus, including the Fleming library at St Mary's.\nStudent housing.\nImperial College owns and manages ten halls of residence in Inner London, Acton and Ascot, Berkshire. Over three thousand rooms are available, with first year undergraduates guaranteed a place in one of the six main college residences (subject to certain requirements). The majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having en suite facilities. Bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms. All rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network.\nMost students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates. The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the college private housing office. However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a \"hall senior\", and places are available for a small number of returning students in three small halls. The accommodation in Ascot is only for postgraduate students based at the Silwood Park site.\nOrganisation and administration.\nFaculties and departments.\nImperial is organised into four faculties: the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Natural Sciences, and the Imperial Business School. As of 2024,[ [update]] the academic departments are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFaculty of Engineering\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFaculty of Medicine\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFaculty of Natural Sciences\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImperial Business School\nInterdisciplinary centres.\nImperial hosts centres to promote inter-disciplinary work under the titles of Global Challenge institutes, Imperial Centres of Excellence and Imperial Networks of Excellence. It also participates as a partner in a number of national institutes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGlobal Challenge institutes:\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNational institutes:\nAcademic centres.\nThe Centre for Languages, Culture and Communication operates as Imperial College London's adult education centre, offering evening class courses in the arts, humanities, languages and sciences. The university also houses two academic centres offering teaching to undergraduate and postgraduate students in subjects outside of science, technology and medicine. The academic centres are the:\nGovernance.\nThe council is the governing body of Imperial. The council consists of between 19 and 27 members, with an independent chair and \"ex officio\" members being the president, the provost, the chief operating officer, the president of Imperial College Union, and four senior staff members. There are also up to four further staff members (comprising one member elected by the academic staff, one further appointed member of academic staff and two members of the professional services staff), up to one further representative of Imperial College Union, and between nine and 13 other independent members, with the proviso that the independent members (including the chair) must comprise the majority. The president is the highest academic official and chief executive of Imperial College London. The position has been held by Hugh Brady, since August 2022[ [update]]. As of 2024,[ [update]] the provost is Ian Walmsley and the chair is Vindi Banga.\nFinances and endowment.\nThe college's endowment is sub-divided into three distinct portfolios:\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Imperial had a total income of \u00a31.309\u00a0billion (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a31.256\u00a0billion) and total expenditure of \u00a31.051\u00a0billion (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a31.235\u00a0billion). Key sources of income included \u00a3507.5\u00a0million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3452.1\u00a0million), \u00a3165.4\u00a0million from funding body grants (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3183.3\u00a0million), \u00a3396.2\u00a0million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3383.1\u00a0million), \u00a328.8\u00a0million from investment income (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a324.1\u00a0million) and \u00a335.5\u00a0million from donations and endowments (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a351.5\u00a0million).\nAt year end, Imperial had endowments of \u00a3235.2\u00a0million (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3220.1\u00a0million) and total net assets of \u00a32.082\u00a0billion (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a31.792\u00a0billion). It holds the eighth-largest endowment of any university in the UK.\nAffiliations and partnerships.\nImperial is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, European University Association, Global Alliance of Technological Universities, League of European Research Universities and the Russell Group. It is a founding member of the Imperial College academic health sciences centre, the Francis Crick Institute and MedCity. Imperial is a long-term partner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the first formal large-scale collaboration agreement dating back to 1944 as part of World War II scientific effort. The partnership between the two institutions continues with exchange programs for students and academic staff.\nAcademic profile.\nResearch.\nIn the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, Imperial's research profile was assessed as 66 per cent world class (4*) 30 per cent internationally important (3*) and 3 per cent internationally recognised (2*), with insignificant quantities of research in lower categories. This led to Imperial being ranked first in the UK on GPA and ninth for research power by \"Times Higher Education\", with a GPA of 3.63 and research power 47.3 per cent of the top-ranked University of Oxford.\nThe college promotes research commercialisation, partly through its dedicated technology transfer company, Imperial Innovations, which has given rise to a large number of spin-out companies based on academic research. Imperial researcher Narinder Singh Kapany made critical contributions to the invention of fibre optics.\nThe United States is the college's top foreign country for collaborations, and Imperial College has a long-term partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that dates from World War II.\nIn January 2018, the mathematics department of Imperial and the French National Centre for Scientific Research launched an \"international joint research unit\" (; UMI) at Imperial, known as \nUMI Abraham de Moivre after the French mathematician, focused on unsolved problems and bridging British and French scientific communities. In October 2018, Imperial College launched the Imperial Cancer Research UK Center, a research collaboration that aims to find innovative ways to improve the precision of cancer treatments, inaugurated by Joe Biden as part of his Biden Cancer Initiative.\nNeil Ferguson's 16 March 2020 report entitled \"Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand\" was described in a \"New York Times\" article as the coronavirus \"report that jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to action\". Since 18 May, Imperial College's Dr. Samir Bhatt advised the state of New York for its reopening plan. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said at the time that \"the Imperial College model, as we've been following this for weeks, was the best, most accurate model.\"\nAdmissions.\nIn the academic year 2021/22, the ratio of applicants to admissions was 9:1 for undergraduates and 7.7:1 for postgraduates. The university gave offers of admission to 30.1% of its undergraduate applicants in 2022, the 7th lowest offer rate across the country. The undergraduate courses with the highest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (19.2:1), mathematics (14.6:1) and mechanical engineering (11.2:1).\nThe postgraduate courses with the highest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (21:1), mathematics (17.9:1), and electrical engineering (14:1). Imperial is among the most international universities in the United Kingdom, with 50% of students from the UK, 16% of students from the EU, and 34% of students from outside the UK or EU. The student body is 39% female and 61% male.\nIn 2023/24, the student body consisted of 22,420 students, composed of 12,150 undergraduates and 10,265 postgraduate students. 36.5% of Imperial's undergraduates are privately educated, the fourth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.\nLibraries.\nThe college's main library is located next to Queen's Lawn and contains the main corpus of the college's collection. It previously also housed the Science Museum's library until 2014. The Fleming library is located at St Mary's in Paddington, originally the library of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, with other hospital campuses also having college libraries.\nMedicine.\nThe Imperial Faculty of Medicine was formed through mergers between Imperial and the St Mary's, Charing Cross and Westminster, and Royal Postgraduate medical schools and has six teaching hospitals. It accepts more than 300 undergraduate medical students per year and has around 321 taught and 700 research full-time equivalent postgraduate students.\nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust (Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital) and St Mary's NHS Trust (St. Mary's Hospital and Western Eye Hospital) with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine. It is an academic health science centre and manages five hospitals: Charing Cross Hospital, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, St Mary's Hospital, and Western Eye Hospital. The Trust is currently one of the largest in the UK and in 2012/13 had a turnover of \u00a3971.3 million, employed approximately 9,770 people and treated almost 1.2 million patients.\nOther (non-academic health science centres) hospitals affiliated with Imperial College include Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital, West Middlesex University Hospital, Hillingdon Hospital, Mount Vernon Hospital, Harefield Hospital, Ealing Hospital, Central Middlesex Hospital, Northwick Park Hospital, St Mark's Hospital, St Charles' Hospital and St Peter's Hospital.\nReputation and rankings.\nImperial College London is widely recognised as one of the UK's elite universities. According to the 2026 QS World University Rankings, Imperial was ranked 2nd worldwide, following MIT, and 8th by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.\nImperial is known for its hardworking entrepreneurial culture, which blends business studies with the sciences. Facilities such as the Enterprise Lab\u2014which one in eight students uses and which reports a 79 per cent startup survival rate\u2014demonstrates a commitment to innovation. Reflecting this, the 2023 QS MBA Rankings by Career Specialisation ranked its MBA programme 3rd worldwide for entrepreneurship.\nImperial is also recognised for its interdisciplinary scientific research. Its strategic collaborations with institutions around the world have led to advancements that inform industries and public policy. The college\u2019s basic and translational research reinforces its reputation as an institution where research and entrepreneurship complement one another.\nImperial's focus on practical subjects\u2014engineering, science, medicine, and business\u2014along with its emphasis on entrepreneurship and industry collaborations, has made it a leader in the UK for career outcomes. In 2026, Imperial was ranked 1st in the UK for highly skilled employment or further studies by the Complete University Guide, the Guardian University Guide, and the Times Good University Guide.\nStudent life.\nStudent body.\nFor the 2023/24 academic year, Imperial had a total full-time student body of , consisting of undergraduate students and postgraduates. 50.7% of the student body is from outside of the UK. 32% of all full-time students came from outside the European Union in 2013\u201314, and around 13% of the International students had Chinese nationality in 2007\u201308. Imperial's male to female ratio for undergraduate students is uneven at approximately 64:36 overall, and 5:1 or higher in some engineering courses. However, medicine has an approximate 1:1 ratio with biology degrees tending to be higher.\nImperial College Union.\nImperial College Union is the students' union and is run by five full-time sabbatical officers elected from the student body for a tenure of one year, and a number of permanent members of staff. It is split into constituent unions aligned with the faculties of the college, carrying on the association with the original constituent colleges of Imperial, the Royal College of Science Union, City and Guilds College Union, Royal School of Mines Students' Union and Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union. The union is given a large subvention by the university, much of which is spent on maintaining over 300 clubs, projects and societies.\nStudent societies.\nImperial College London has over 350 student clubs, societies and projects. The Techtonics, Imperial's all-male contemporary a capella group, won the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2016.\nOther notable student groups and projects include Project Nepal, which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development programmes in rural Nepal, and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project in Central America.\nFacilities.\nThe union operates on two sites, with most events at the Union Building on Beit Quad in South Kensington, with most Imperial College School of Medicine events at the Reynold's Bar at Charing Cross Hospital.\nThere are two student bars on the South Kensington campus, one at the Imperial College Union and one at Eastside. There are a number of pubs and bars on campus and also surrounding the campus, which become a popular social activity for Imperial's students. The Pewter tankard collection at Imperial College Union is the largest in Europe, with the majority of clubs and societies having tankards associated with their clubs.\nStudent media.\nStudent media at Imperial includes \"Felix\", the university newspaper, and Imperial College Radio.\nSports.\nSports at Imperial are organised by Imperial Athletes, run as a collaboration between Imperial College Union and the university's Move Imperial programme. This sports over 90 sports clubs, many of which participate in British Universities and Colleges Sport leagues or the London University Sports Leagues. The Imperial Leagues offer intramural sports at the university within the Imperial Athletes organisation.\nNotable sports clubs include Imperial College Boat Club.\nSports facilities at Imperial's London campuses include four gyms, including the main Ethos gym at the South Kensington Campus, two swimming pools and two sports halls. Imperial has additional sports facilities at the Heston and Harlington sports grounds. On the South Kensington campus, there are a total of six music practice rooms which consist of upright pianos for usage by people of any grade, and grand pianos which are exclusively for people who have achieved Grade 8 or above.\nThe Bottle Match.\nThe annual Bottle Match, a varsity rugby fixture between Imperial's Royal School of Mines and the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines, is the second oldest in the world. The first recorded match took place in 1902. The Bottle Match is traditionally held in February, normally on the third weekend of the month. The match reflects a long-standing rivalry between the two mining schools.\nExploration Board.\nImperial's Exploration Board was established in 1955 and funds student expeditions as well as recognising them as official Imperial projects. It also maintains an archive of past expeditions.\nDrinking societies.\nWhile many Imperial student activities are inclusive and run by the Imperial College Union, Imperial is also home to several highly exclusive social clubs often referred to as \"tie clubs\" or \"drinking societies\". Historically centered around students from the constituent colleges, the three most prominent clubs are The 22s, The Links, and The Chaps. These invite-only societies, dominated by alumni who were active in the student union and sports (particularly rugby) maintain strong connections to the university. Their existence has been a source of controversy within the student community, with critics pointing out their \"elitist\" and often secretive nature. For instance, the historically all-male The 22s and accusations of \"tokenism\" against The Links have led to calls for Imperial College Union to enforce stricter equal opportunities standards, especially since members of these tie clubs have traditionally held highly influential positions within the union's sabbatical and governance structures.\nMascotry.\nImperial has a tradition of mascotry, a unique and historically intense custom of rivalry, theft, and ransom between the student bodies of its founding constituent unions. This practice involves two main categories of mascots. First, there are violable mascots, the ceremonial objects that are traditionally the targets of theft and ransom demands, often for RAG (Raising and Giving) charity. Examples include the Royal College of Science's seven-foot-long thermometer Theta and the City and Guilds Union's heavy bronze Spanner and Bolt. This tradition of competitive stealing is still ongoing, though it has seen a reduction in activity in recent years and is subject to official Imperial College Union rules to prevent violence or property damage. Second, the four famous antique motorised vehicles such as the 1916 Dennis N-Type Fire Engine Jezebel and the 1902 car Boanerges are classified as inviolate (protected from theft). These motorised mascots are meticulously maintained and regularly paraded by student motor clubs at ceremonial and public events, ensuring that the engineering and historical pride of the constituent unions remains an active part of student life.\nMusic and arts.\nThe Blyth Centre for Music and Visual Arts offers resources such as music scholarships, art classes and practice rooms. The centre organises the university's regular series of public performances, many of which take place off-campus at the nearby Holy Trinity Church on Prince Consort Road. These run during term time and feature both professional artists and Imperial students, including Ash Music Scholars and ensembles such as the Imperial College Chamber Choir. The programme also includes a lunchtime concert series and formal college evensong services.\nThe rock band Queen performed one of their first gigs in the Union Concert Hall. The band was formed when Brian May placed an advert on the noticeboard in the union looking for a '\"Mitch Mitchell/Ginger Baker type\" drummer' and Roger Taylor responded.\nEach year Imperial Business School organises a major annual social event, often referred to as the \"Winter Party\" or \"Winter Ball,\" at the adjacent Natural History Museum. This exclusive, after-hours event transforms the museum's Hintze Hall into a grand venue for hundreds of students to celebrate and socialise under the iconic 25-meter blue whale skeleton.\nImperial is a key partner in the Great Exhibition Road Festival, a free annual celebration of science and the arts held in South Kensington, in collaboration with neighboring institutions like the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, V&amp;A, and Royal Albert Hall. The festival, which succeeded the annual Imperial Festival, draws over 50,000 visitors with a weekend of talks, interactive exhibits showcasing Imperial's research, and performances.\nCommemoration Day.\nThe university's main graduation ceremony, Commemoration Day, takes place annually in early summer at the Royal Albert Hall, a tradition that has been in place for over 60 years. The naming of Commemoration Day dates back to a 1945 visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to mark the centenary of the Royal College of Science.\nNotable alumni, academics and other staff.\nNobel laureates have included: \nFields medalists have included:\nAcademics:\nOther alumni.\nAdventure and Exploration: \nPolitics:\nBusiness:\nMedia:\nSports:\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61117", "revid": "42964511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61117", "title": "Taboo", "text": "Societal or cultural prohibition\nA taboo is a social group's ban, prohibition or avoidance of something (usually an utterance or behavior) based on the group's sense that it is excessively repulsive, offensive, sacred or allowed only for certain people. Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies. Taboos may be prohibited explicitly, for example within a legal system or religion, or implicitly, for example by social norms or conventions followed by a particular culture or organization.\nTaboos are often meant to protect the individual, but there are other reasons for their development. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Taboos can help use a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress said subsection of the community. A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of \"belonging\".\nThe meaning of the word \"taboo\" has been somewhat expanded in the social sciences to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on moral judgment, religious beliefs, or cultural norms.\nEtymology.\nThe English term \"taboo\" comes from \"tapu\" in Oceanic languages, particularly Polynesian languages, with such meanings as \"prohibited\" or \"forbidden\". That root \"tapu\" is reflected, among others, by Tongan or M\u0101ori \"tapu\", and by Hawaiian \"kapu\". Its English use dates to 1777 when the British explorer James Cook visited Tonga, and referred to the Tongans' use of the term \"taboo\" for \"any thing that is forbidden to be eaten, or made use of\". Having invited some of the Tongan aristocracy to dinner aboard his ship, Cook wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Not one of them would sit down, or eat a bit of any thing. . . . On expressing my surprise at this, they were all taboo, as they said; which word has a very comprehensive meaning; but, in general, signifies that a thing is forbidden.\nThe term was translated to him as \"consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed\". \"Tapu\" is usually treated as a unitary, non-compound word inherited from Proto-Polynesian *\"tapu\". It also exists in other Oceanic languages outside Polynesian, such as Fijian \"tabu\", or Hiw (Vanuatu) \"toq\".\nThose words descend from an etymon *\"tabu\" in the ancestral Proto-Oceanic language, whose meaning was reconstructed as \"forbidden, off limits; sacred, due to a sentiment of awe before spiritual forces\".\nIn its current use in Tongan, the word \"tapu\" means \"sacred\" or \"holy\", often in the sense of being restricted or protected by custom or law. On the main island, the word is often appended to the end of \"Tonga\" as \"Tongatapu\", here meaning \"Sacred South\" rather than \"Forbidden South\".\nExamples.\nSigmund Freud speculated that incest and patricide were the only two universal taboos that formed the basis of civilization. Through an analysis of the language surrounding these laws, it can be seen how the policy makers, and society as a whole, find these acts to be immoral.\nCommon taboos involve restrictions or ritual regulation of killing and hunting; sex and sexual relationships; reproduction; the dead and their graves; as well as food and dining (primarily cannibalism and dietary laws such as vegetarianism, \"kashrut\", and \"halal\") or religious (treif and haram). In Madagascar, a strong code of taboos, known as \"fady\", constantly change and are formed from new experiences. Each region, village or tribe may have its own \"fady\".\nThe word \"taboo\" gained popularity at times, with some scholars looking for ways to apply it where other English words had previously been applied. For example, J. M. Powis Smith, in his book \"The American Bible\" (editor's preface 1927), used \"taboo\" occasionally in relation to Israel's Tabernacle and ceremonial laws, including , ; ; , , and .\nAlbert Schweitzer wrote a chapter about taboos of the people of Gabon. As an example, it was considered a misfortune for twins to be born, and they would be subject to many rules not incumbent on other people.\nIn religion and mythology.\nAccording to Joseph Campbell, taboos are used in religion and mythology to test a person's ability to withhold from violating a prohibition given to them. Should one fail the test and violate a taboo, they will be subsequently punished or face the consequences of their actions. Taboos are not societal prohibitions (such as incest); rather, the use of \"taboo\" in these stories relates to its original meaning of \"prohibition\": for example, a character could be prohibited from looking, eating, and speaking or uttering a certain word.\nGreek.\nAn example of an eating taboo in Greek mythology could be found in the tale of the abduction of Persephone. Hades, who had fallen in love with Persephone and wished to make her his queen, burst through a cleft in the earth and abducted Persephone as she was gathering flowers in a field. When Demeter, Persephone's mother, finds out of her daughter's abduction, she forbids the earth to produce (or she neglects the earth) and, in the depth of her despair, causes nothing to grow. Zeus, pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. It was explained to Demeter that Persephone would be released, so long as she did not taste the food of the dead. Hades complies with the request to return Persephone to Demeter, but first, he tricks Persephone, forcing her to break the eating taboo by giving her some pomegranate seeds to eat. In other interpretations, Persephone is seen eating the pomegranate seeds as a result of temptation or hunger. In the end, Hermes is sent to retrieve her but, because she had tasted the food of the underworld, she was obliged to spend a third of each year (the winter months) there, and the remaining part of the year with the gods above. With the later writers Ovid and Hyginus, Persephone's time in the underworld becomes half the year.\nThe most notable looking taboo in Greek myth can be found in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus, the son of Apollo, was well-renowned as a legendary musician whose music could move anything and everything, living or not, in the world. While walking among her people in tall grass at her wedding, Eurydice was set upon by a satyr. In her efforts to escape the satyr, Eurydice fell into a nest of vipers and suffered a fatal bite on her heel. Her body was discovered by Orpheus who, overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs that all the humans, nymphs, and gods learnt about his sorrow and grief and wept with him. On the gods' advice, Orpheus traveled to the Underworld wherein his music softened the hearts of Hades and Persephone, who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition: he should guide her out and not look back until they both had reached the upper world. As he reached the upper world, Orpheus looked back toward Eurydice in his eagerness to reunite with her, tragically forgetting about the looking taboo given to him by Hades, and since Eurydice had not crossed into the upper world, she vanishes back into the Underworld, this time forever.\nA speaking taboo in Greek myth can be found in the story of Anchises, the father of the Trojan warrior Aeneas. Aphrodite had fallen in love with the mortal Anchises after Zeus persuaded Eros to shoot her with an arrow to cause these emergent feelings. One interpretation recounts that Aphrodite pretended to be a Phrygian princess and seduced him, only to later reveal herself as a goddess and inform Anchises that she will bear him a son named Aeneas and warns him not to tell anyone that he lay with a goddess. Anchises does not heed this speaking taboo and later brags about his encounter with Aphrodite, and as a result, he is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by Zeus. Thereafter, he is lame in that foot so that Aeneas has to carry him from the flames of Troy.\nAnother, albeit lesser-known, speaking taboo in Greek myth can be found in the story of Actaeon. Actaeon, whilst on a hunting trip in the woods, mistakenly and haplessly happened upon the bathing Artemis. When Artemis realized that Actaeon had seen her undressed, thus desecrating her chastity, she punished him for his luckless profanation of her virginity's mystery by forbidding him from speech. Whether it be due to forgetfulness or outright resistance, Actaeon defied his speaking taboo and called for his hunting dogs. Due to his failure in abiding by his speaking taboo, Artemis turned Actaeon into a stag and turned his dogs upon him. Actaeon was torn apart and ravaged by his loyal dogs who did not recognize their former master.\nAbrahamic.\nPossibly the most famous eating taboo (if not taboo, in general) is in the story of Adam and Eve in the Abrahamic religions. In the Judeo-Christian telling, found in , Adam and Eve are placed in the Garden of Eden by God and are told not to eat from a tree lest they die, but Eve is promptly tempted by a serpent (often identified as Satan in disguise) to eat from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil because they will surely not die, rather, they might become \"like God\". Eve violates the eating taboo and eats from the forbidden fruit of the tree, shortly giving some fruit to her companion, Adam. After eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve are aware of their nakedness and cover themselves with fig leaves and hide from God. God realizes that they are hiding and interrogates them about having eaten from the tree whereupon Adam assigns the blame to Eve and Eve assigns it to the serpent. As a result, God condemns Eve with pain in childbirth and subordination to her husband, he condemns Adam to have to labor on the earth for his food and be reduced into the earth at death, and in the Christian tradition, he condemns all of humanity for this original sin. God then expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden lest they eat from the Tree of Life and become immortal \"like Him\".\nIn Islam, the story of Adam and Eve is quite different, though it contains an eating taboo: the Quran mentions that Adam (Arabic: ), as the successive authority of earth by decree of Allah, is placed in a paradisal garden (not Jannah nor the Garden of Eden) therein along with his wife (unnamed in the Quran, though the Hadith gives her the name \u1e24aww\u0101\u2019, Arabic: ); such a paradise this garden was, that they would never go hungry nor unclothed, nor would they ever thirst or be exposed to the sun's heat. Allah took a promise from Adam:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u02f9Allah said,\u02fa \u201cO Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat from wherever you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.\u201d\u2014\u200a\nIblis, angered at his expulsion from Jannah for refusing to bow to Adam at his inception, decided to trick Adam and his wife into being shunned by Allah, just as he was. Allah had warned Adam and his wife about Iblis, telling them that he was a \"clear enemy\". Iblis swore in the name of Allah that he was their sincere advisor, revealed unto Adam and his wife each other's nakedness, and convinced them to eat from the forbidden tree so that they may never taste death. After eating from the tree (thus breaking the eating taboo), Allah removes Adam and his wife from their paradisal garden, telling them that mankind will be condemned with some being enemies with others on the earth wherein they will be provided habitation and provision, for a while, and \u201cThere you will live, there you will die, and from there you will be resurrected.\u201d[Quran https://]\nIn the Gnostic telling of this story, the taboo is a plot by the archons to keep Adam in a state of ignorance by preventing him from eating the fruit, which allows him to attain gnosis after the serpent, who is viewed as representative of the divine world, convinces him and Eve to eat it.\nA looking taboo can be found in the Judeo-Christian telling of the story of Lot found within the Book of Genesis. In , two angels in the form of men arrived in Sodom at eventide and were invited by Lot to spend the night at his home. The men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and demanded Lot that he bring his two guests out so that they might \"know\" them; instead, Lot offered up his two daughters, who had not \"known\" man, but they refused. As dawn was breaking, Lot's visiting angels urged him to get his family and flee, so as to avoid being caught in the impending disaster for the iniquity of the city. The command was given, \"Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, nor stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, lest you be swept away.\" Whilst fleeing, Lot's wife broke the looking taboo by turning to look back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and was turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for disobeying the angels' warning.\nFunction.\nCommunist and materialist theorists have argued that taboos can be used to reveal the histories of societies when other records are lacking. Marvin Harris explains taboos as a consequence of ecologic and economic conditions.\nModernity.\nSome argue that contemporary Western multicultural societies have taboos against tribalisms (for example, ethnocentrism and nationalism) and prejudices (racism, sexism, homophobia, extremism and religious fanaticism). \nChanging social customs and standards also create new taboos, such as bans on slavery; extension of the pedophilia taboo to ephebophilia; prohibitions on alcohol, tobacco, or psychopharmaceutical consumption (particularly among pregnant women), unmoderated discussions of politics and religion, sexual harassment and sexual objectification are increasingly becoming taboo in recent decades. \nIncest itself has been pulled both ways, with some seeking to normalize consensual adult relationships regardless of the degree of kinship (notably in Europe) and others expanding the degrees of prohibited contact (notably in the United States). Although the term \"taboo\" usually implies negative connotations, it is sometimes associated with enticing propositions in proverbs such as \"forbidden fruit is the sweetest\".\nIn medicine, professionals who practice in ethical and moral grey areas, or fields subject to social stigma such as late termination of pregnancy, may refrain from public discussion of their practice. Among other reasons, this taboo may come from concern that comments may be taken out of the appropriate context and used to make ill-informed policy decisions that would lead to (otherwise preventable) maternal death.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Load balancing can optimize response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.\nLoad balancing is the subject of research in the field of parallel computers. Two main approaches exist: static algorithms, which do not take into account the state of the different machines, and dynamic algorithms, which are usually more general and more efficient but require exchanges of information between the different computing units, at the risk of a loss of efficiency.\nProblem overview.\nA load-balancing algorithm always tries to answer a specific problem. Among other things, the nature of the tasks, the algorithmic complexity, the hardware architecture on which the algorithms will run as well as required error tolerance, must be taken into account. Therefore compromise must be found to best meet application-specific requirements.\nNature of tasks.\nThe efficiency of load balancing algorithms critically depends on the nature of the tasks. Therefore, the more information about the tasks is available at the time of decision making, the greater the potential for optimization.\nSize of tasks.\nPerfect knowledge of the execution time of each of the tasks allows to reach an optimal load distribution (see algorithm of prefix sum). Unfortunately, this is in fact an idealized case. Knowing the exact execution time of each task is an extremely rare situation.\nFor this reason, there are several techniques to get an idea of the different execution times. First of all, in the fortunate scenario of having tasks of relatively homogeneous size, it is possible to consider that each of them will require approximately the average execution time. If, on the other hand, the execution time is very irregular, more sophisticated techniques must be used. One technique is to add some metadata to each task. Depending on the previous execution time for similar metadata, it is possible to make inferences for a future task based on statistics.\nDependencies.\nIn some cases, tasks depend on each other. These interdependencies can be illustrated by a directed acyclic graph. Intuitively, some tasks cannot begin until others are completed.\nAssuming that the required time for each of the tasks is known in advance, an optimal execution order must lead to the minimization of the total execution time. Although this is an NP-hard problem and therefore can be difficult to be solved exactly. There are algorithms, like job scheduler, that calculate optimal task distributions using metaheuristic methods.\nSegregation of tasks.\nAnother feature of the tasks critical for the design of a load balancing algorithm is their ability to be broken down into subtasks during execution. The \"tree-shaped computation\" algorithm presented later takes great advantage of this specificity.\nStatic and dynamic algorithms.\nStatic.\nA load balancing algorithm is \"static\" when it does not take into account the state of the system for the distribution of tasks. Thereby, the system state includes measures such as the load level (and sometimes even overload) of certain processors. Instead, assumptions about the overall system are made beforehand, such as the arrival times and resource requirements of incoming tasks. In addition, the number of processors, their respective power and communication speeds are known. Therefore, static load balancing aims to associate a known set of tasks with the available processors in order to minimize a certain performance function. The trick lies in the concept of this performance function.\nStatic load balancing techniques are commonly centralized around a router, or master, which distributes the loads and optimizes the performance function. This minimization can take into account information related to the tasks to be distributed, and derive an expected execution time.\nThe advantage of static algorithms is that they are easy to set up and extremely efficient in the case of fairly regular tasks (such as processing HTTP requests from a website). However, there is still some statistical variance in the assignment of tasks which can lead to the overloading of some computing units.\nDynamic.\nUnlike static load distribution algorithms, dynamic algorithms take into account the current load of each of the computing units (also called nodes) in the system. In this approach, tasks can be moved dynamically from an overloaded node to an underloaded node in order to receive faster processing. While these algorithms are much more complicated to design, they can produce excellent results, in particular, when the execution time varies greatly from one task to another.\nDynamic load balancing architecture can be more modular since it is not mandatory to have a specific node dedicated to the distribution of work. When tasks are uniquely assigned to a processor according to their state at a given moment, it is a unique assignment. If, on the other hand, the tasks can be permanently redistributed according to the state of the system and its evolution, this is called dynamic assignment. Obviously, a load balancing algorithm that requires too much communication in order to reach its decisions runs the risk of slowing down the resolution of the overall problem.\nHardware architecture.\nHeterogeneous machines.\nParallel computing infrastructures are often composed of units of different computing power, which should be taken into account for the load distribution.\nFor example, lower-powered units may receive requests that require a smaller amount of computation, or, in the case of homogeneous or unknown request sizes, receive fewer requests than larger units.\nShared and distributed memory.\nParallel computers are often divided into two broad categories: those where all processors share a single common memory on which they read and write in parallel (PRAM model), and those where each computing unit has its own memory (distributed memory model), and where information is exchanged by messages.\nFor shared-memory computers, managing write conflicts greatly slows down the speed of individual execution of each computing unit. However, they can work perfectly well in parallel. Conversely, in the case of message exchange, each of the processors can work at full speed. On the other hand, when it comes to collective message exchange, all processors are forced to wait for the slowest processors to start the communication phase.\nIn reality, few systems fall into exactly one of the categories. In general, the processors each have an internal memory to store the data needed for the next calculations and are organized in successive clusters. Often, these processing elements are then coordinated through distributed memory and message passing. Therefore, the load balancing algorithm should be uniquely adapted to a parallel architecture. Otherwise, there is a risk that the efficiency of parallel problem solving will be greatly reduced.\nHierarchy.\nAdapting to the hardware structures seen above, there are two main categories of load balancing algorithms. On the one hand, the one where tasks are assigned by \u201cmaster\u201d and executed by \u201cworkers\u201d who keep the master informed of the progress of their work, and the master can then take charge of assigning or reassigning the workload in case of the dynamic algorithm. The literature refers to this as master-worker architecture. On the other hand, the control can be distributed between the different nodes. The load balancing algorithm is then executed on each of them and the responsibility for assigning tasks (as well as re-assigning and splitting as appropriate) is shared. The last category assumes a dynamic load balancing algorithm.\nSince the design of each load balancing algorithm is unique, the previous distinction must be qualified. Thus, it is also possible to have an intermediate strategy, with, for example, \"master\" nodes for each sub-cluster, which are themselves subject to a global \"master\". There are also multi-level organizations, with an alternation between master-slave and distributed control strategies. The latter strategies quickly become complex and are rarely encountered. Designers prefer algorithms that are easier to control.\nAdaptation to larger architectures (scalability).\nIn the context of algorithms that run over the very long term (servers, cloud...), the computer architecture evolves over time. However, it is preferable not to have to design a new algorithm each time.\nAn extremely important parameter of a load balancing algorithm is therefore its ability to adapt to scalable hardware architecture. This is called the scalability of the algorithm. An algorithm is called scalable for an input parameter when its performance remains relatively independent of the size of that parameter.\nWhen the algorithm is capable of adapting to a varying number of computing units, but the number of computing units must be fixed before execution, it is called moldable. If, on the other hand, the algorithm is capable of dealing with a fluctuating amount of processors during its execution, the algorithm is said to be malleable. Most load balancing algorithms are at least moldable.\nFault tolerance.\nEspecially in large-scale computing clusters, it is not tolerable to execute a parallel algorithm that cannot withstand the failure of one single component. Therefore, fault tolerant algorithms are being developed which can detect outages of processors and recover the computation.\nApproaches.\nStatic distribution with full knowledge of the tasks: prefix sum.\nIf the tasks are independent of each other, and if their respective execution time and the tasks can be subdivided, there is a simple and optimal algorithm.\nBy dividing the tasks in such a way as to give the same amount of computation to each processor, all that remains to be done is to group the results together. Using a prefix sum algorithm, this division can be calculated in logarithmic time with respect to the number of processors.\nIf, however, the tasks cannot be subdivided (i.e., they are atomic), although optimizing task assignment is a difficult problem, it is still possible to approximate a relatively fair distribution of tasks, provided that the size of each of them is much smaller than the total computation performed by each of the nodes.\nMost of the time, the execution time of a task is unknown and only rough approximations are available. This algorithm, although particularly efficient, is not viable for these scenarios.\nStatic load distribution without prior knowledge.\nEven if the execution time is not known in advance at all, static load distribution is always possible.\nRound-robin scheduling.\nIn a round-robin algorithm, the first request is sent to the first server, then the next to the second, and so on down to the last. Then it is started again, assigning the next request to the first server, and so on.\nThis algorithm can be weighted such that the most powerful units receive the largest number of requests and receive them first.\nRandomized static.\nRandomized static load balancing is simply a matter of randomly assigning tasks to the different servers. This method works quite well. If, on the other hand, the number of tasks is known in advance, it is even more efficient to calculate a random permutation in advance. This avoids communication costs for each assignment. There is no longer a need for a distribution master because every processor knows what task is assigned to it. Even if the number of tasks is unknown, it is still possible to avoid communication with a pseudo-random assignment generation known to all processors.\nThe performance of this strategy (measured in total execution time for a given fixed set of tasks) decreases with the maximum size of the tasks.\nOthers.\nOf course, there are other methods of assignment as well: \nMaster-worker scheme.\nMaster-worker schemes are among the simplest dynamic load balancing algorithms. A master distributes the workload to all workers (also sometimes referred to as \"slaves\"). Initially, all workers are idle and report this to the master. The master answers worker requests and distributes the tasks to them. When he has no more tasks to give, he informs the workers so that they stop asking for tasks.\nThe advantage of this system is that it distributes the burden very fairly. In fact, if one does not take into account the time needed for the assignment, the execution time would be comparable to the prefix sum seen above.\nThe problem with this algorithm is that it has difficulty adapting to a large number of processors because of the high amount of necessary communications. This lack of scalability makes it quickly inoperable in very large servers or very large parallel computers. The master acts as a bottleneck.\nHowever, the quality of the algorithm can be greatly improved by replacing the master with a task list that can be used by different processors. Although this algorithm is a little more difficult to implement, it promises much better scalability, although still insufficient for very large computing centers.\nNon-hierarchical architecture, without knowledge of the system: work stealing.\nAnother technique to overcome scalability problems when the time needed for task completion is unknown is work stealing.\nThe approach consists of assigning to each processor a certain number of tasks in a random or predefined manner, then allowing inactive processors to \"steal\" work from active or overloaded processors. Several implementations of this concept exist, defined by a task division model and by the rules determining the exchange between processors. While this technique can be particularly effective, it is difficult to implement because it is necessary to ensure that communication does not become the primary occupation of the processors instead of solving the problem.\nIn the case of atomic tasks, two main strategies can be distinguished, those where the processors with low load offer their computing capacity to those with the highest load, and those were the most loaded units wish to lighten the workload assigned to them. It has been shown that when the network is heavily loaded, it is more efficient for the least loaded units to offer their availability and when the network is lightly loaded, it is the overloaded processors that require support from the most inactive ones. This rule of thumb limits the number of exchanged messages.\nIn the case where one starts from a single large task that cannot be divided beyond an atomic level, there is a very efficient algorithm \"Tree-Shaped computation\", where the parent task is distributed in a work tree.\nPrinciple.\nInitially, many processors have an empty task, except one that works sequentially on it. Idle processors issue requests randomly to other processors (not necessarily active). If the latter is able to subdivide the task it is working on, it does so by sending part of its work to the node making the request. Otherwise, it returns an empty task. This induces a tree structure. It is then necessary to send a termination signal to the parent processor when the subtask is completed so that it, in turn, sends the message to its parent until it reaches the root of the tree. When the first processor, i.e. the root, has finished, a global termination message can be broadcast. In the end, it is necessary to assemble the results by going back up the tree.\nEfficiency.\nThe efficiency of such an algorithm is close to the prefix sum when the job cutting and communication time is not too high compared to the work to be done. To avoid too high communication costs, it is possible to imagine a list of jobs on shared memory. Therefore, a request is simply reading from a certain position on this shared memory at the request of the master processor.\nUse cases.\nIn addition to efficient problem solving through parallel computations, load balancing algorithms are widely used in HTTP request management where a site with a large audience must be able to handle a large number of requests per second.\nInternet-based services.\nOne of the most commonly used applications of load balancing is to provide a single Internet service from multiple servers, sometimes known as a server farm. Commonly load-balanced systems include popular web sites, large Internet Relay Chat networks, high-bandwidth File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites, Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) servers, Domain Name System (DNS) servers, and databases.\nRound-robin DNS.\nRound-robin DNS is an alternate method of load balancing that does not require a dedicated software or hardware node. In this technique, multiple IP addresses are associated with a single domain name; clients are given IP in a round-robin fashion. IP is assigned to clients with a short expiration so the client is more likely to use a different IP the next time they access the Internet service being requested.\nDNS delegation.\nAnother more effective technique for load-balancing using DNS is to delegate www.example.org as a sub-domain whose zone is served by each of the same servers that are serving the website. This technique works particularly well where individual servers are spread geographically on the Internet. For example:\none.example.org A 192.0.2.1\ntwo.example.org A 203.0.113.2\nwww.example.org NS one.example.org\nwww.example.org NS two.example.org\nHowever, the zone file for www.example.org on each server is different such that each server resolves its own IP Address as the A-record. On server \"one\" the zone file for www.example.org reports:\n@ in a 192.0.2.1\nOn server \"two\" the same zone file contains:\n@ in a 203.0.113.2\nThis way, when a server is down, its DNS will not respond and the web service does not receive any traffic. If the line to one server is congested, the unreliability of DNS ensures less HTTP traffic reaches that server. Furthermore, the quickest DNS response to the resolver is nearly always the one from the network's closest server, ensuring geo-sensitive load-balancing . A short TTL on the A-record helps to ensure traffic is quickly diverted when a server goes down. Consideration must be given to the possibility that this technique may cause individual clients to switch between individual servers in mid-session.\nClient-side random load balancing.\nAnother approach to load balancing is to deliver a list of server IPs to the client, and then to have the client randomly select the IP from the list on each connection. This essentially relies on all clients generating similar loads, and the law of large numbers to achieve a reasonably flat load distribution across servers. It has been claimed that client-side random load balancing tends to provide better load distribution than round-robin DNS; this has been attributed to caching issues with round-robin DNS, that in the case of large DNS caching servers, tend to skew the distribution for round-robin DNS, while client-side random selection remains unaffected regardless of DNS caching.\nWith this approach, the method of delivery of a list of IPs to the client can vary and may be implemented as a DNS list (delivered to all the clients without any round-robin), or via hardcoding it to the list. If a \"smart client\" is used, detecting that a randomly selected server is down and connecting randomly again, it also provides fault tolerance.\nServer-side load balancers.\nFor Internet services, a server-side load balancer is usually a software program that is listening on the port where external clients connect to access services. The load balancer forwards requests to one of the \"backend\" servers, which usually replies to the load balancer. This allows the load balancer to reply to the client without the client ever knowing about the internal separation of functions. It also prevents clients from contacting back-end servers directly, which may have security benefits by hiding the structure of the internal network and preventing attacks on the kernel's network stack or unrelated services running on other ports.\nSome load balancers provide a mechanism for doing something special in the event that all backend servers are unavailable. This might include forwarding to a backup load balancer or displaying a message regarding the outage.\nIt is also important that the load balancer itself does not become a single point of failure. Usually, load balancers are implemented in high-availability pairs which may also replicate session persistence data if required by the specific application. Certain applications are programmed with immunity to this problem, by offsetting the load balancing point over differential sharing platforms beyond the defined network. The sequential algorithms paired to these functions are defined by flexible parameters unique to the specific database.\nScheduling algorithms.\nNumerous scheduling algorithms, also called load-balancing methods, are used by load balancers to determine which back-end server to send a request to.\nSimple algorithms include random choice, round robin, or least connections. More sophisticated load balancers may take additional factors into account, such as a server's reported load, least response times, up/down status (determined by a monitoring poll of some kind), a number of active connections, geographic location, capabilities, or how much traffic it has recently been assigned.\nPersistence.\nAn important issue when operating a load-balanced service is how to handle information that must be kept across the multiple requests in a user's session. If this information is stored locally on one backend server, then subsequent requests going to different backend servers would not be able to find it. This might be cached information that can be recomputed, in which case load-balancing a request to a different backend server just introduces a performance issue.\nIdeally, the cluster of servers behind the load balancer should not be session-aware, so that if a client connects to any backend server at any time the user experience is unaffected. This is usually achieved with a shared database or an in-memory session database like Memcached.\nOne basic solution to the session data issue is to send all requests in a user session consistently to the same backend server. This is known as \"persistence\" or \"stickiness\". A significant downside to this technique is its lack of automatic failover: if a backend server goes down, its per-session information becomes inaccessible, and any sessions depending on it are lost. The same problem is usually relevant to central database servers; even if web servers are \"stateless\" and not \"sticky\", the central database is (see below).\nAssignment to a particular server might be based on a username, client IP address, or random. Because of changes in the client's perceived address resulting from DHCP, network address translation, and web proxies this method may be unreliable. Random assignments must be remembered by the load balancer, which creates a burden on storage. If the load balancer is replaced or fails, this information may be lost, and assignments may need to be deleted after a timeout period or during periods of high load to avoid exceeding the space available for the assignment table. The random assignment method also requires that clients maintain some state, which can be a problem, for example when a web browser has disabled the storage of cookies. Sophisticated load balancers use multiple persistence techniques to avoid some of the shortcomings of any one method.\nAnother solution is to keep the per-session data in a database. This is generally bad for performance because it increases the load on the database: the database is best used to store information less transient than per-session data. To prevent a database from becoming a single point of failure, and to improve scalability, the database is often replicated across multiple machines, and load balancing is used to spread the query load across those replicas. Microsoft's ASP.net State Server technology is an example of a session database. All servers in a web farm store their session data on State Server and any server in the farm can retrieve the data.\nIn the very common case where the client is a web browser, a simple but efficient approach is to store the per-session data in the browser itself. One way to achieve this is to use a browser cookie, suitably time-stamped and encrypted. Another is URL rewriting. Storing session data on the client is generally the preferred solution: then the load balancer is free to pick any backend server to handle a request. However, this method of state-data handling is poorly suited to some complex business logic scenarios, where session state payload is big and recomputing it with every request on a server is not feasible. URL rewriting has major security issues because the end-user can easily alter the submitted URL and thus change session streams.\nYet another solution to storing persistent data is to associate a name with each block of data, and use a distributed hash table to pseudo-randomly assign that name to one of the available servers, and then store that block of data in the assigned server.\nLoad balancer features.\nHardware and software load balancers may have a variety of special features. The fundamental feature of a load balancer is to be able to distribute incoming requests over a number of backend servers in the cluster according to a scheduling algorithm. Most of the following features are vendor specific:\n A ratio can be manually assigned to cause some backend servers to get a greater share of the workload than others. This is sometimes used as a crude way to account for some servers having more capacity than others and may not always work as desired.\n When the number of available servers drops below a certain number, or the load gets too high, standby servers can be brought online.\n TLS (or its predecessor SSL) acceleration is a technique of offloading cryptographic protocol calculations onto specialized hardware. Depending on the workload, processing the encryption and authentication requirements of a TLS request can become a major part of the demand on the Web Server's CPU; as the demand increases, users will see slower response times, as the TLS overhead is distributed among Web servers. To remove this demand on Web servers, a balancer can terminate TLS connections, passing HTTPS requests as HTTP requests to the Web servers. If the balancer itself is not overloaded, this does not noticeably degrade the performance perceived by end-users. The downside of this approach is that all of the TLS processing is concentrated on a single device (the balancer) which can become a new bottleneck. Some load balancer appliances include specialized hardware to process TLS. Instead of upgrading the load balancer, which is quite expensive dedicated hardware, it may be cheaper to forgo TLS offload and add a few web servers. Also, some server vendors such as Oracle/Sun now incorporate cryptographic acceleration hardware into their CPUs such as the T2000. F5 Networks incorporates a dedicated TLS acceleration hardware card in their local traffic manager (LTM) which is used for encrypting and decrypting TLS traffic. One clear benefit to TLS offloading in the balancer is that it enables it to do balancing or content switching based on data in the HTTPS request.\n Load balancers can provide features such as SYN cookies and delayed-binding (the back-end servers don't see the client until it finishes its TCP handshake) to mitigate SYN flood attacks and generally offload work from the servers to a more efficient platform.\n HTTP compression reduces the amount of data to be transferred for HTTP objects by utilising gzip compression available in all modern web browsers. The larger the response and the further away the client is, the more this feature can improve response times. The trade-off is that this feature puts additional CPU demand on the load balancer and could be done by web servers instead.\n Different vendors use different terms for this, but the idea is that normally each HTTP request from each client is a different TCP connection. This feature utilises HTTP/1.1 to consolidate multiple HTTP requests from multiple clients into a single TCP socket to the back-end servers.\n The load balancer can buffer responses from the server and spoon-feed the data out to slow clients, allowing the webserver to free a thread for other tasks faster than it would if it had to send the entire request to the client directly.\n An option for asymmetrical load distribution, where request and reply have different network paths.\n The balancer polls servers for application layer health and removes failed servers from the pool.\n The balancer stores static content so that some requests can be handled without contacting the servers.\n Some balancers can arbitrarily modify traffic on the way through.\n Some balancers can hide HTTP error pages, remove server identification headers from HTTP responses, and encrypt cookies so that end users cannot manipulate them.\n Also known as rate shaping, the ability to give different priorities to different traffic.\n Most load balancers can send requests to different servers based on the URL being requested, assuming the request is not encrypted (HTTP) or if it is encrypted (via HTTPS) that the HTTPS request is terminated (decrypted) at the load balancer.\n Authenticate users against a variety of authentication sources before allowing them access to a website.\n At least one balancer allows the use of a scripting language to allow custom balancing methods, arbitrary traffic manipulations, and more.\n Firewalls can prevent direct connections to backend servers, for network security reasons.\n Intrusion prevention systems offer application layer security in addition to the network/transport layer offered by firewall security.\nTelecommunications.\nLoad balancing can be useful in applications with redundant communications links. For example, a company may have multiple Internet connections ensuring network access if one of the connections fails. A failover arrangement would mean that one link is designated for normal use, while the second link is used only if the primary link fails.\nUsing load balancing, both links can be in use all the time. A device or program monitors the availability of all links and selects the path for sending packets. The use of multiple links simultaneously increases the available bandwidth.\nShortest Path Bridging.\nTRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) facilitates an Ethernet to have an arbitrary topology, and enables per flow pair-wise load splitting by way of Dijkstra's algorithm, without configuration and user intervention. The catalyst for TRILL was an event at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center which began on 13 November 2002. The concept of Rbridges [sic] was first proposed to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in the year 2004, whom in 2005 rejected what came to be known as TRILL, and in the years 2006 through 2012 devised an incompatible variation known as Shortest Path Bridging.\nThe IEEE approved the IEEE 802.1aq standard in May 2012, also known as Shortest Path Bridging (SPB). SPB allows all links to be active through multiple equal-cost paths, provides faster convergence times to reduce downtime, and simplifies the use of load balancing in mesh network topologies (partially connected and/or fully connected) by allowing traffic to load share across all paths of a network. SPB is designed to virtually eliminate human error during configuration and preserves the plug-and-play nature that established Ethernet as the de facto protocol at Layer 2.\nRouting 1.\nMany telecommunications companies have multiple routes through their networks or to external networks. They use sophisticated load balancing to shift traffic from one path to another to avoid network congestion on any particular link, and sometimes to minimize the cost of transit across external networks or improve network reliability.\nAnother way of using load balancing is in network monitoring activities. Load balancers can be used to split huge data flows into several sub-flows and use several network analyzers, each reading a part of the original data. This is very useful for monitoring fast networks like 10GbE or STM64, where complex processing of the data may not be possible at wire speed.\nData center networks.\nLoad balancing is widely used in data center networks to distribute traffic across many existing paths between any two servers. It allows more efficient use of network bandwidth and reduces provisioning costs. In general, load balancing in datacenter networks can be classified as either static or dynamic.\nStatic load balancing distributes traffic by computing a hash of the source and destination addresses and port numbers of traffic flows and using it to determine how flows are assigned to one of the existing paths. Dynamic load balancing assigns traffic flows to paths by monitoring bandwidth use on different paths. Dynamic assignments can also be proactive or reactive. In the former case, the assignment is fixed once made, while in the latter the network logic keeps monitoring available paths and shifts flows across them as network utilization changes (with arrival of new flows or completion of existing ones). A comprehensive overview of load balancing in datacenter networks has been made available.\nFailovers.\nLoad balancing is often used to implement failover\u2014the continuation of service after the failure of one or more of its components. The components are monitored continually (e.g., web servers may be monitored by fetching known pages), and when one becomes unresponsive, the load balancer is informed and no longer sends traffic to it. When a component comes back online, the load balancer starts rerouting traffic to it. For this to work, there must be at least one component in excess of the service's capacity (N+1 redundancy). This can be much less expensive and more flexible than failover approaches where every single live component is paired with a single backup component that takes over in the event of a failure (dual modular redundancy). Some RAID systems can also utilize hot spare for a similar effect.\nThis technique can increase fault tolerance by enabling quick substitutions for the most complicated, most failure-prone parts of a system. However, it can make the load balancer itself a single point of failure.\nData ingestion for AI model training.\nIncreasingly, load balancing techniques are being used to manage high-volume data ingestion pipelines that feed artificial intelligence training and inference systems\u2014sometimes referred to as \u201cAI factories.\u201d These AI-driven environments require continuous processing of vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, placing heavy demands on networking, storage, and computational resources. To maintain the necessary high throughput and low latency, organizations commonly deploy load balancing tools capable of advanced TCP optimizations, connection pooling, and adaptive scheduling. Such features help distribute incoming data requests evenly across servers or nodes, prevent congestion, and ensure that compute resources remain efficiently utilized.\nWhen deployed in large-scale or high-performance AI environments, load balancers also mitigate bandwidth constraints and accommodate varying data governance requirements\u2014particularly when sensitive training data cannot be sent to third-party cloud services. By routing data locally (on-premises) or across private clouds, load balancers allow AI workflows to avoid public-cloud bandwidth limits, reduce transit costs, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. As AI models expand in size (often measured by billions or even trillions of parameters), load balancing for data ingestion has grown in importance for maintaining the reliability, scalability, and cost efficiency of AI factories."}

{"id": "61123", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61123", "title": "Red Bull", "text": "Brand of energy drinks \nRed Bull is a brand of energy drinks created and owned by the Austrian company Red Bull GmbH. With a market share of 43%, it is the most popular energy drink brand as of 2020, and the third most valuable soft drink brand, behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Since its launch in 1987, more than 100\u00a0billion cans of Red Bull have been sold worldwide, including over 12.6 billion in 2024. \nOriginally available only in a single undistinguished flavour sold in a tall and slim silver and blue can, called Red Bull Energy Drink, the drink added numerous variants over time. Rather than following a traditional marketing approach, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a \"brand myth\" through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, and Red Bull Crashed Ice, as well as standout stunts like the Red Bull Stratos space diving project. In addition to sport series, its marketing includes multiple sports team ownerships, celebrity endorsements, and music through its Red Bull Records label.\nRed Bull was derived from a similar drink called Krating Daeng which originated in Thailand and was introduced by Chaleo Yoovidhya. While doing business in Thailand, Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz purchased a can of Krating Daeng and claimed it cured his jet lag. Mateschitz sought to create a partnership with Chaleo and formulated a product that would suit the tastes of Westerners, such as by carbonating the drink. In 1984, the two founded Red Bull GmbH in Fuschl am See, Salzburg, Austria. When branding their product, Mateschitz referenced Krating Daeng's name: in Thai, \"daeng\" means red, and a \"krating\" (known in English as a gaur) is a large species of wild bovine native to the Indian subcontinent. Red Bull and Krating Daeng use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market their drinks separately in the Thai and Western markets.\nHistory.\nIn 1976, Thai entrepreneur Chaleo Yoovidhya introduced a drink called Krating Daeng in Thailand, which means \"red gaur\" in English. It was popular among Thai truck drivers and labourers. While working for German manufacturer Blendax (later acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble) in 1982, Dietrich Mateschitz travelled to Thailand and met Chaleo, owner of T.C. Pharmaceutical. During his visit, Mateschitz discovered that Krating Daeng helped cure his jet lag. In 1984, Mateschitz co-founded Red Bull GmbH with Chaleo and turned it into an international brand. Each partner invested US$500,000 of savings to fund the company. Chaleo and Mateschitz each held a 49 percent share of the new company. They gave the remaining two percent to Chaleo's son, Chalerm, but it was agreed that Mateschitz would run the company. The product was first launched in Austria on 1 April 1987.\nIn Thailand, energy drinks are most popular with blue-collar workers. Red Bull re-positioned the drink as a trendy, upscale drink, first introducing it at Austrian ski resorts. Pricing was a key differentiator, with Red Bull positioned as a premium drink and Krating Daeng as a lower cost item. In many countries, both drinks are available, dominating each end of the price spectrum. The flavouring used for Red Bull is still produced in Bangkok and exported worldwide.\nDuring the 1990s, the product expanded into Hungary, Slovenia, Germany, the Czech Republic, Croatia, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. It entered Germany and the UK in 1994, the United States (via California) in 1996, the Middle East in 2000 and the Philippines in 2012. In 2008, \"Forbes\" magazine listed both Chaleo and Mateschitz as the 250th\u00a0richest people in the world with an estimated net worth of US$4 billion.\nRed Bull GmbH is headquartered in Fuschl am See, an Austrian village of about 1,500 inhabitants near Salzburg. The company is 51 percent controlled by the Yoovidhya family who, for technical reasons, own the trademark in Europe and the US.\nClaims about the drink's effects and performance have been challenged on various occasions, with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority imposing advertising restrictions in 2001 in response to complaints recorded as early as 1997.\nIngredients.\nDepending on the country, Red Bull contains different amounts of caffeine, taurine, B vitamins (B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12), glucuronolactone and simple sugars (sucrose and glucose) in a buffer solution of carbonated water, sodium bicarbonate and magnesium carbonate (substituted in some flavours with a trisodium citrate/citric acid buffer, each solution providing electrolytes). To produce Red Bull Sugarfree, sucrose and glucose have been replaced by artificial sweeteners acesulfame K and aspartame or sucralose.\nCaffeine content.\nThe caffeine content of a single 250 ml can of Red Bull is approximately 40\u201380\u00a0mg\u00a0/ 250\u00a0ml (15\u201332\u00a0mg\u00a0/ 100\u00a0ml). The caffeine level in Red Bull varies depending on the country, as some countries have legal restrictions on how much caffeine is allowed in drinks. As is the case with other caffeinated beverages, Red Bull drinkers may experience adverse effects as a result of overuse. Excessive consumption may induce mild to moderate euphoria primarily caused by stimulant properties of caffeine and may also induce agitation, anxiety, irritability, and insomnia.\nVariants.\nOver the years, Red Bull has offered many variations of its drink, all based on the same formula, but differing in taste and colour. \nRed Bull began offering variations of its drinks in 2003. A sugar-free version of the drink was introduced with a different flavour from the original, called Red Bull Sugarfree. In 2012, Red Bull released Red Bull Total Zero, a variant with zero calories. In 2018, the company released Red Bull Zero, a different sugar-free formulation designed to taste more like the original flavour.\nIn 2009, Red Bull unveiled a highly concentrated variant of its drink called Red Bull Energy Shot, supplied in 2 oz (60 ml) cans.\nThe company began expanding its flavour offerings in 2013 with the launch of Red Bull Editions. Initially available in cranberry, blueberry, and lime, the Editions line has expanded to include a variety of flavours. Some of these flavours are only available during specific seasons or in certain regions. Currently, a blue (blueberry), peach (peach-nectarine), winter (iced vanilla berry), sea blue (juneberry) and red (watermelon) are offered.\nOther products.\nRed Bull released a cola drink, called Simply Cola, in 2008. A new version of the cola was released in 2019, as part of Red Bull's Organics line.\nIn 2018, the company launched Organics by Red Bull, a line of organic sodas with four flavours; bitter lemon, ginger ale, tonic water, and a new version of Red Bull Simply Cola.\nLegal affairs.\nRegulatory approval.\nAuthorities in France, Denmark, and Norway initially did not permit the sale of Red Bull. However, as of 2021[ [update]], it is on sale in all 27 member states of the European Union and 171 countries worldwide.\nThe French food safety agency was concerned about taurine; a Red Bull drink that did not contain taurine was introduced. The French refusal of market approval was challenged by the European Commission, and partially upheld by the European Court of Justice in 2004. The French food safety agency relented in 2008 because it was unable to prove a definite health risk.\nLitigation.\nIn 2013, Red Bull told the Redwell Brewery, a Norfolk-based micro brewery, to change its name or face legal action, because it sounded too similar to Red Bull. The eight-man brewery in Norwich was told its name could \"confuse\" customers and \"tarnish\" its trademark. The two companies reached a settlement permitting Redwell to continue using its name.\nIn 2014, Red Bull entered into a US$13\u00a0million settlement to resolve two consumer class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Named as plaintiffs were Benjamin Careathers, David Wolf, and Miguel Almarez, who had sued the company claiming breach of express warranty and unjust enrichment, saying that Red Bull falsely asserted performance-enhancing benefits from the drink's ingredients which were unsubstantiated by scientific studies. On 1 May 2015, the Court approved the settlement, giving customers who had submitted claims the opportunity to receive a US$10 cash reimbursement or US$15 in Red Bull products within 150 days of affirmance on any appeal. Contrary to reports from some news outlets, the plaintiffs had not alleged that the drink did not give consumers actual wings.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hitches are used in a variety of situations, including climbing, sailing, and securing loads. They are classified based on their ability to be tightened or released, their resistance to slipping, and their strength. Some common types of hitch knots include the clove hitch, the timber hitch, and the round turn and two half-hitches.\nPhysical theory.\nA simple mathematical theory of hitches has been proposed by Bayman. It predicts whether or not a hitch will hold, given the diameter of the post, the diameter of the rope, and the coefficient of friction between the post and the rope. The theory has been extended by Maddocks and Keller, including an approximate treatment of knots that are not hitches. For example, they predict that a square knot will hold when the coefficient of friction of the rope with itself is greater than 0.24. These predictions are approximately correct when tested empirically.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition, there are speakers in Oman, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Turkmenistan, East Africa and in diaspora communities in other parts of the world. The total number of speakers, according to \"Ethnologue\", is million. Of these, 6.28 million are in Pakistan.\nBalochi varieties constitute a dialect continuum and collectively at least have 10 million native speakers. The main varieties of Balochi are Eastern (Soleimani), Southern (Makrani) and Western (Rakhshani). The Koroshi dialect is a dialect of the Balochi language, spoken mainly in the provinces of Fars and Hormozgan.\nAccording to Brian Spooner,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Literacy for most Baloch-speakers is not in Balochi, but in Urdu in Pakistan and Persian in Afghanistan and Iran. Even now very few Baloch read Balochi, in any of the countries, even though the alphabet in which it is printed is essentially identical to Persian and Urdu.\nBalochi belongs to the Western Iranian subgroup, and its original homeland is suggested to be around the central Caspian region.\nClassification.\nBalochi is an Indo-European language, spoken by the Baloch and belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the family. As an Iranian language, it is classified in the Northwestern group.\n\"Glottolog\" classifies four different varieties, namely Koroshi, Southern Balochi and Western Balochi (grouped under a \"Southern-Western Balochi\" branch), and Eastern Balochi, all under the \"Balochic\" group.\nAccording to Carina Jahani research, ISO 639-3 groups Southern, Eastern, and Western Baloch under the Balochi macrolanguage, keeping Koroshi separate.\nDialects.\nThese dialects are broadly categorized into three main groups:\nKoroshi is also classified as Balochi.\nElfenbein divides the dialects of the Balochi language into six categories: Rakhshani (subdialects: Kalati and Sarhaddi), Panjguri, Saravani, Lashari, Kechi, and Coastal Dialects.\nRakhshani \nPanjguri\nIt includes most of the Kharan region, with the kech River forming its southern border and the Rakhshan River its northern border, and Kolwa located to its east.\nSaravani\nSaravan and its surrounding areas, with Khash as its northern border and Espidan as its western border. In later works, Elfenbein, Iranshahr, and Bampur are also considered to be within the Saravani dialect area.\nKechi\nKich region in Balochistan, including Turbat.\nLashari\ncentered on the village of Lashar, south of Iranshahr where Balochi close to Persian and Baskardi.\nCoastal dialects\nIncluding Qasr-e Qand, Nikshahr, Rask and the southern coastal areas of Balochistan from near Bandar Abbas to Karachi Port, including the ports of Chahbahar, Gwadar, Pasni.\nThere are two main dialects: the dialect of the Mandwani (northern) tribes and the dialect of the Domki (southern) tribes. The dialectal differences are not very significant. One difference is that grammatical terminations in the northern dialect are less distinct compared with those in the southern tribes. An isolated dialect is Koroshi, which is spoken in the Qashqai tribal confederation in the Fars province. Koroshi distinguishes itself in grammar and lexicon among Balochi varieties.\nThe Balochi Academy Sarbaz has designed a standard alphabet for Balochi.\nUppsala University offers a course titled Balochi A, which provides basic knowledge of the phonetics and syntax of the Balochi language. Carina Jahani is a prominent Swedish Iranologist and professor of Iranian languages at Uppsala University, deeply researching in the study and preservation of the Balochi language.\nPhonology.\nVowels.\nThe Balochi vowel system has at least eight vowels: five long and three short. These are , , , , , , and . The short vowels have more centralized phonetic quality than the long vowels. The variety spoken in Karachi also has nasalized vowels, most importantly and . In addition to these eight vowels, Balochi has two vowel glides, that is /aw/ and /aj/.\nConsonants.\nThe following table shows consonants which are common to both Western (Northern) and Southern Balochi. The consonants /s/, /z/, /n/, /\u027e/ and /l/ are articulated as alveolar in Western Balochi. The plosives /t/ and /d/ are dental in both dialects. The symbol \u0144 is used to denote nasalization of the preceding vowel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn addition, occurs in a few words in Southern Balochi. (voiceless velar fricative) in some loanwords in Southern Balochi corresponding to (voiceless uvular fricative) in Western Balochi; and (voiced velar fricative) in some loanwords in Southern Balochi corresponding to (voiced uvular fricative) in Western Balochi.\nIn Eastern Balochi, it is noted that the stop and glide consonants may also occur as aspirated allophones in word initial position as and . Allophones of stops in postvocalic position include for voiceless stops, and for voiced stops . are also dentalized as .\nIntonation.\nDifference between a question and a statement is marked with the tone, when there is no question word. Rising tone marks the question and falling tone the statement. Statements and questions with a question word are characterized by falling intonation at the end of the sentence.\nQuestions without a question word are characterized by rising intonation at the end of the sentence.\nBoth coordinate and subordinate clauses that precede the final clause in the sentence have rising intonation. The final clause in the sentence has falling intonation.\nGrammar.\nThe normal word order is subject\u2013object\u2013verb. Like many other Indo-Iranian languages, Balochi also features split ergativity. The subject is marked as nominative except for the past tense constructions where the subject of a transitive verb is marked as oblique and the verb agrees with the object. Balochi, like many Western Iranian languages, has lost the Old Iranian gender distinctions.\nNumerals.\nMuch of the Balochi number system is identical to Persian. According to Mansel Longworth Dames, Balochi writes the first twelve numbers as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWriting system.\nBalochi was not a written language before the 19th century, and the Persian script was used to write Balochi wherever necessary. However, Balochi was still spoken at the Baloch courts.\nBritish colonial officers first wrote Balochi with the Latin script. Following the creation of Pakistan, Baloch scholars adopted the Persian alphabet. The first collection of poetry in Balochi, Gulbang by Mir Gul Khan Nasir, was published in 1951 and incorporated the Arabic Script. It was much later that Sayad Zahoor Shah Hashemi wrote a comprehensive guidance on the usage of Arabic script and standardized it as the Balochi Orthography in Pakistan and Iran. This earned him the title of the 'Father of Balochi'. His guidelines are widely used in Eastern and Western Balochistan. In Afghanistan, Balochi is still written in a modified Arabic script based on Persian.\nIn 2002, a conference was held to help standardize the script that would be used for Balochi.\nOld Balochi Alphabet.\nThe following alphabet was used by Syed Zahoor Shah Hashmi in his lexicon of Balochi \"Sayad Ganj\" () (lit. \"Sayad's Treasure\"). Until the creation of the Balochi Standard Alphabet, it was by far the most widely used alphabet for writing Balochi, and is still used very frequently.\nStandard Perso-Arabic Alphabet.\nThe Balochi Standard Alphabet, standardized by Balochi Academy Sarbaz, consists of 29 letters. It is an extension of the Perso-Arabic script and borrows a few glyphs from Urdu. It is also sometimes referred to as Balo-Rabi or Bal\u00f2rabi. Today, it is the preferred script to use in a professional setting and by educated folk.\nLatin alphabet.\nThe following Latin-based alphabet was adopted by the International Workshop on \"Balochi Roman Orthography\" (University of Uppsala, Sweden, 28\u201330 May 2000).\na \u00e1 b c d \u010f e f g \u011d h i \u00ed j k l m n o p q r \u0159 s \u0161 t \u0165 u \u00fa v w x y z \u017e ay aw (33 letters and 2 digraphs)\nSoviet alphabet.\nIn 1933, the Soviet Union adopted a Latin-based alphabet for Balochi as follows:\nThe alphabet was used for several texts, including children's books, newspapers, and ideological works. In 1938, however, the official use of Balochi was discontinued.\nCyrillic alphabet.\nIn 1989, Mammad Sherdil, a teacher from the Turkmen SSR, approached Balochi language researcher Sergei Axenov with the idea of creating a Cyrillic-based alphabet for Balochi. Before this, the Cyrillic script was already used for writing Balochi and was used in several publications but the alphabet was not standardized. In 1990, the alphabet was finished. It included the following letters:\nThe project was approved with some minor changes (, , and were removed due to the rarity of those sounds in Balochi, and was added). From 1992 to 1993, several primary school textbooks were printed in this script. In the early 2000s, the script fell out of use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Breton name for Finist\u00e8re, \"Penn ar Bed,\" translates as \"Head/End of the World\" and is similar to the Cornish name for Land's End, \"Pedn an Wlas\" (Head/End of the country), and also Penfro (English: Pembroke) in Wales (pen = end, bro = country). Finist\u00e8re is not to be confused with Fisterra in Galicia, Spain, which shares the same etymology.\nThe area of the department was part of the Province of Brittany before 1790.\nGeography.\nThe largest population centre in Finist\u00e8re is Brest. Other large towns in the department include Quimper (the capital), Concarneau, Morlaix, Carhaix, Quimperl\u00e9 and Douarnenez. Finist\u00e8re includes the island of Ushant (\"Eusa\" in Breton, \"Ouessant\" in French).\nFinist\u00e8re is the westernmost department of Metropolitan France and can also claim to be the \"most coastal\" department in Metropolitan France. Of its 277 communes, 117 are located on the coast (approximately 42% of the total number of communes). Its total coastline of approximately accounts for almost a quarter of the entire Brittany coast-line.\nThe \"abers\", rugged fjord-like inlets on the north coast, are a notable feature of the landscape.\nThe westernmost point of continental France, known as the Pointe de Corsen, extends from the northwestern tip of Finist\u00e8re. About 40 kilometres to the south (as the crow flies) is the slightly less westerly, but rugged and isolated, headland of Pointe du Raz.\nPrincipal towns.\nThe most populous commune is Brest; the prefecture Quimper is the second-most populous.

Its capital and largest city is Rennes.\nBordered by the English Channel to the north, the Celtic Sea to the west, and the Atlantic Ocean (Bay of Biscay) to the south, Brittany's neighboring regions are Normandy to the northeast and Pays de la Loire to the southeast. It is one of two regions in Metropolitan France where all departments have direct access to the sea, the other being Corsica.\nThe region of Brittany is sometimes referred to as \u201cadministrative Brittany\u201d in contrast to \u201chistorical Brittany\u201d or \u201ccultural Brittany\u201d, which also includes the Loire-Atlantique and whose potential reunification with the administrative region has been a subject of debate for decades.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBrittany, located in the west-northwest corner of France, is one of the historic provinces of France. The most Atlantic of France's regions, Brittany is noted for its Celtic heritage, which sets it apart from the rest of France. It enjoys a mild climate somewhat warmer though not necessarily drier than the climate of the Cornish peninsula in southwest Britain.\nThe name \"Brittany\" derives from the Britons, an Insular Celtic (Brythonic) people who inhabited most of Great Britain during the Roman and Sub-Roman periods. During the migration period of the Early Middle Ages the Britons were displaced from most of what is now England by the Anglo-Saxon invasions, leading many to settle in western Armorica, present-day Brittany. As a result the modern Bretons have strong historical, cultural and linguistic ties with those areas of Great Britain which remained Brythonic into the modern era: Wales and Cornwall.\nInitially divided into several small petty kingdoms, Brittany as a united political entity emerged in the 9th century as the Kingdom of Brittany. In the early 10th century the kingdom was devastated by Norse raids and occupation and from the mid-10th century became a vassal state of France as the Duchy of Brittany. The level of control exerted by the French kings varied over time; at various points Brittany was either subject to, aligned with or heavily influenced by the English Kings; at others it was \"de facto\" independent.\nFollowing the Breton defeat at the hands of the French army in 1488, the duchy was forced into a dynastic union with the French crown in 1491; in 1547 it was formally incorporated as a province of France.\nFollowing the French Revolution the French provinces were dissolved and replaced with departments; what had been Brittany became the C\u00f4tes-du-Nord (22) (renamed C\u00f4tes-d'Armor in 1990) in the north, Finist\u00e8re (29) in the far west, Morbihan (56) in the south, Ille et Vilaine (35) in the east and Loire-Inf\u00e9rieure (44) (renamed Loire-Atlantique in 1957) in the southeast.\nWhen the modern regions were established, Loire-Inf\u00e9rieure (44), which includes the historic capital Nantes, became part of Pays de la Loire, while the other four departments became part of the Brittany region. The capital city of the modern Brittany region is Rennes, located in the central eastern part of the region; most of the major lines of communication between Brittany and Paris pass through Rennes, which is a large industrial and university city. Other important cities in the region are Brest, one of the two most important French naval ports, Saint-Malo, an imposing walled city on the north coast, and Vannes, the capital of the Morbihan, with an attractive old town centre. Quimper, the capital of the Finist\u00e8re, and Saint-Brieuc, the capital of the C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, are less important. Lorient, in the Morbihan, was once a major shipping port trading with \u2013 as its name suggests \u2013 the Orient; but its shipping and shipbuilding industries have largely declined, and like other ports on the south coast of Brittany, is better known today for its yachting and yacht-building industry. It is also the venue for Brittany's annual Interceltiques music and culture festival.\nDespite its limited size, Brittany is quite a diverse region; the north and west coasts, open to the force of the North Atlantic, are rugged and rocky, with sandy coves and beaches. The south coast, facing onto the Bay of Biscay, is flatter, much milder, and has a number of large sandy beaches. There are also many inlets on the south coast, such as La Trinit\u00e9 sur Mer, which in the past have been ports and commercial harbours, but today are more popular with yachtsmen and a dwindling fishing industry. The sea here is warmer in summer. The backbone of Brittany is a granite ridge stretching from east to west, peaking in the Monts d'Arr\u00e9e. But most of inland Brittany is farming country, a region known for its milk and butter and its early crops.\nAs a holiday region, it is Brittany's coasts that attract the greatest number of visitors; the inland regions have attracted many second-home owners from other parts of France, and from Britain. In cultural terms, Brittany has its own language and Celtic cultural tradition that set it apart from the rest of France. The Breton language, though not much used in everyday life, and not understood by most of the modern population, has made a comeback in recent years, and is taught in many schools. Celtic traditions are reflected in Breton folk music, its Celtic festivals, and its prehistoric monuments.\nGeography.\nTerritory.\nThe region of Brittany was created in 1941 from four of the five departments constituting the territory of traditional Brittany. The other is Loire-Atlantique, which is included in the region of Pays de la Loire, whose capital, Nantes, was a historical capital of the Duchy of Brittany.\nThe capital of the administrative region is Rennes, although Nantes is considered the capital of historic Brittany and is located in Loire-Atlantique. The reunification of Brittany is supported by a majority of Loire-Atlantique and is considered a prerequisite to further autonomy of Brittany as a whole.\nPart of the reason Brittany was split between two present-day regions was to avoid the rivalry between Rennes and Nantes. Although Nantes was the principal capital of the Duchy of Brittany until the sixteenth century, Rennes had been the seat of the Duchy's supreme court of justice between 1560 and 1789. Rennes had also been the administrative capital of the Intendant of Brittany between 1689 and 1789, and Intendances were the most important administrative units of the kingdom of France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As for the provincial States of Brittany, a legislative body which had originally met every two years in a different city of Brittany, that had met in Rennes only between 1728 and 1789, although not in the years 1730, 1758, and 1760. Despite that, the \"Chambre des comptes\" had remained in Nantes until 1789. However, from 1381 until the end of the 15th century Vannes (\"Gwened\" in Breton) had served as the administrative capital of the Duchy, remaining the seat of its \"Chambre des comptes\" until the 1490s, and also the seat of its \"Parlement\" until 1553 and then again between 1675 and 1689.\nAlthough there were previous plans to create regions out of the departments, like the Cl\u00e9mentel plan (1919) or the Vichy regionalisation programme (1941), these plans had no effect or else were abolished in 1945. The current French regions date from 1956 and were created by gathering departments together. In Brittany, this led to the creation of the new region of Brittany, which included only four out of the five historical Breton departments. The term \"r\u00e9gion\" was officially created by the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982), which also gave regions their legal status. The first direct elections for regional representatives took place on 16 March 1986.\nDepartments.\nBrittany comprises four departments: C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, Finist\u00e8re, Ille-et-Vilaine, and Morbihan.\nMajor communities.\nThe following table is the list of communes in Brittany with a population over 15,000 inhabitants. Rennes is situated in the east of Brittany, being the capital of the region, the capital of the Ille-et-Vilaine department, as well as the most populous metropolitan area in Brittany with 700,000 inhabitants (2013).\nClimate.\nThe Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel provide Brittany with an oceanic climate. Prevailing northwest winds reduce variations of temperature in the region. The climate is drier in southern sections. The extreme northwest has up to 10 days with temperatures above 25\u00a0\u00b0C, while southeastern Brittany can have up to 50.\nLanguage and culture.\nThe name of Brittany derives from settlers from Great Britain, who fled the island in the wake of the Anglo-Saxon invasions of England between the fifth and seventh centuries. Unlike the rest of France and Brittany, Lower Brittany (roughly, west of a boundary from Saint Brieuc to Vannes) has maintained a distinctly Celtic language, Breton, which is related to Cornish and Welsh. It was the dominant language in Lower, or western, Brittany until the mid-20th century. It has been granted regional language status and revival efforts are underway. In Upper, or eastern, Brittany, the traditional language is Gallo, an O\u00efl language, which has also received regional recognition and is in the process of being revived.\nThe French administration now allows for some Breton or Gallo to be used by the region and its communes, in road signs and names of towns and cities, alongside the official French language version. The two regional languages are also taught in some schools, and many folklore associations and clubs are trying to revive them.\nBrittany has historically been a stronghold of the Roman Catholic Church, and its rates of church attendance have tended to be considerably higher than the national average. However, in recent years the influence of the church has declined.\nPolitics.\nThe Region of Brittany is administered by the Regional Council of Brittany.\nThe region was a traditionally conservative and Christian democratic region, with the notable exception of the department of C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, a longtime stronghold of the political left. However, the whole of Brittany has recently been moving towards the left, in 2004 electing Jean-Yves Le Drian as its first Socialist regional president, and in the 2007 presidential election voting for Socialist S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The centrist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou also polled relatively highly in the region and Foug\u00e8res elected a MoDem deputy to the National Assembly (he has since joined the pro-UMP New Centre). The French Communist Party's support is largely concentrated in the southwest of the C\u00f4tes-d'Armor and northwest of Morbihan. The Greens and other environmentalist parties have traditionally been strong in the region, especially in urban areas such as Rennes or Quimper. The region was one of the few which voted \"Yes\" to the European constitution in the 2005 referendum, and Brittany continues, along with Alsace, to be a strongly pro-European region.\nThe Socialist Party controls three departmental councils (Ille-et-Vilaine, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, and Finist\u00e8re), while the centrist MoDem controls that of Morbihan, in a coalition with the right.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 99.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 4.2% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,700 euros or 89% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 100% of the EU average.\nTransport.\nThere are several (Rennes, Brest, Lorient...) serving destinations in Europe. TGV train services link the region with cities such as Paris in 1h27m due to the LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire, Lyon, Lille and the largest French cities. TER Bretagne is the regional rail network serving Brittany in order to link the cities of Brittany to each other. OUIBUS coach services link the region with the largest cities in France at low cost. In addition there is Brittany Ferries that take passengers, vehicles and freight to Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain and Condor Ferries to the Channel Islands.\nSport.\nThree Breton clubs play in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football: Stade Rennais, Stade Brestois, and FC Lorient. Another historical club, En Avant Guingamp, plays in Ligue 2, and Vannes OC plays in the third tier Championnat National. In rugby union, RC Vannes currently plays in the second level, Pro D2.\nThe Brest Albatros Hockey is a Brest ice hockey club that plays in FFHG Division 1. The Cesson Rennes M\u00e9tropole Handball plays in LNH Division 1. The Brest Bretagne Handball plays in French Women's Handball Championship. The Rennes Volley 35 plays in Ligue B. The Fortuneo\u2013Vital Concept cycling pro team participate every year at the Tour de France, the Bretagne Classic, and the Route Ad\u00e9lie de Vitr\u00e9. Gaelic games are also increasingly popular in the region, particularly Gaelic football where the region has multiple teams that compete in Gaelic Games Europe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His performance included singing the song \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.\" In recognition of his portrayal of Remus, he was given an Honorary Academy Award in 1948.\nCareer.\nBaskett studied pharmacology as a young man but gave it up to pursue an acting career. He first moved to New York City, New York, where he joined up with Bill 'Mr. Bojangles' Robinson. Using the name Jimmie Baskette, he appeared with Louis Armstrong on Broadway in the 1929 black musical revue \"Hot Chocolates\" and in several all-black New York films, including \"Harlem is Heaven\" (1932).\nHe later moved to Los Angeles, California, and had a supporting role in the film \"Straight to Heaven\" (1939), starring Nina Mae McKinney. In 1941 he voiced Fats Crow in the animated Disney film \"Dumbo\", and he also had bit parts in several B movies, including that of Lazarus in \"Revenge of the Zombies\" (1943), a porter in \"The Heavenly Body\" (1944), and native tribal leader Orbon in \"Jungle Queen\" (1945). From 1944 until 1948, he was part of the cast of the \"Amos 'n' Andy Show\" live radio program as lawyer Gabby Gibson.\nIn 1945, he auditioned for a bit part voicing one of the animals in the new Disney feature film \"Song of the South\" (1946), based on the Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris. Walt Disney was impressed with Baskett's talent and hired him on the spot for the lead role of Uncle Remus. Baskett was also given the voice role of Brer Fox, one of the film's animated antagonists, and also filled in as the main animated protagonist, Brer Rabbit, in one sequence. This was one of the first Hollywood portrayals of a black actor as a non-comic character in a leading role in a film meant for general audiences.\nBaskett was prohibited from attending the film's premiere in Atlanta, Georgia, because Atlanta was racially segregated by law.\nAlthough Baskett was occasionally criticized for accepting such a \"demeaning\" role (most of his acting credits were that of African-American stereotypes), his acting was almost universally praised, and columnist Hedda Hopper, along with Walt Disney, was one of the many journalists and personalities who declared that he should receive an Academy Award for his work. Baskett defended the film and his character in it, saying, \"I believe that certain groups are doing my race more harm in seeking to create dissension, than can ever possibly come out of the \"Song of the South\".\"\nAcademy Honorary Award.\nOn March 20, 1948, Baskett received an Academy Honorary Award for his performance as Uncle Remus.\nHe was the first African-American male actor to earn an Academy Award. Additionally, Baskett was the last adult actor to receive an Honorary Oscar for a single performance.\nIllness and death.\nBaskett had been in poor health during the filming of \"Song of the South\" due to diabetes and he suffered a heart attack in December 1946 shortly after its release. His health continued to decline, and he was often unable to attend the \"Amos 'n' Andy\" radio show he was on, missing almost half of the 1947\u20131948 season. On July 9, 1948, during the show's summer hiatus, James Baskett died at his home of heart failure resulting from diabetes at age 44. He was survived by his wife Margaret and his mother Elizabeth. He is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They have three main functions:\nOnly a few hundred telephone lines attach to each remote concentrator. In North America concentrators are located in a serving area interface (SAI) or other enclosure in each neighborhood. In Europe the buildings which once contained local Strowger switch telephone exchanges are now usually empty except for a remote concentrator.\nOnly call packets from or destined to a phone serviced by the concentrator actually are processed by the concentrator; nonlocal phones' time slots just pass through the concentrator unchanged. If the concentrator malfunctions, a fail-safe relay connects the \"in\" wires to the \"out\" wires, and nonlocal phones detect no difference. The central switch periodically counts concentrators, and schedules maintenance, probably before users notice the failure. Concentrators for several hundred customers can be threaded on this loop like pearls.\nThe interface between remote concentrators and their parent telephone switches has been standardised by ETSI as the V5 interface.\nOperation.\nWhen a user picks up their phone, the concentrator produces the dial tone. When the user dials, it reads the tones. Once the user has completed dialing, the concentrator's microcomputer sends the dialing data to the central switch, which allocates a time slot for the dialing phone on the wire pairs that pass through the concentrator and through the switch. \nAfter the central switch tells the concentrator which time slot to use, the concentrator \"opens\" a time-slot on the loop to a local phone. The allocated time slot on the wiring into the concentrator is used to send data from the remote telephone's microphone to the local telephone's speaker. The allocated time slot on the wiring out of the concentrator (with the same time slot number) carries data from the local microphone to the remote speaker.\nTo arrange a connection, the switch just completes the circle between the user's phone and the remote phone. It interchanges the data from one to the other. In this limited sense, telephone \"exchange\" is exactly correct terminology.\nTechnology implications.\nHaving a concentrator near a subscriber's telephone results in very low signal degradation before the analog signal is digitized. This provides reliably good voice quality.\nConcentrators are often placed alongside a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM). This can provide access to asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) Internet service for subscribers who are beyond the normal signaling limit on a copper wire loop. For example, a fiber optic cable might run up to without a repeater from the telephone exchange to a concentrator site, and local subscriber wire local loops can extend an additional 4\u00a0km beyond the concentrator and its DSLAM. With repeaters in the fiber optic cable the distance from the telephone exchange can be extended much farther.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In contrast to South Padre Island, known for its beaches and vacationing college students, PINS is located on the north end of Padre Island and consists of a long beach where nature is preserved.\nMost of the park is primitive, but camping is available, and most of the beach is only accessible to four-wheel-drive vehicles. All but four miles is open to vehicle traffic. PAIS is the fourth designated national seashore in the United States.\nPadre Island is the longest undeveloped barrier island in the world. The national seashore is long with of Gulf beach. PAIS hosts a variety of pristine beach, dune, and tidal flat environments, including the Laguna Madre on its west coast, a famous spot for windsurfing. It is located in parts of Kleberg, Kenedy, and Willacy counties, with Kenedy County having the majority of its land area.\nPadre Island.\nPadre Island National Seashore is located on Padre Island, the largest of the Texas barrier islands and the world's longest barrier island. The island is located along Texas's southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and is noted for its white sandy beaches. Meaning \"father\" in Spanish, it was named after Father Jos\u00e9 Nicol\u00e1s Ball\u00ed (c.1770-1829), who owned the island and served as a missionary priest and collector of finances for all the churches in the Rio Grande Valley. He also founded the first mission in present-day Cameron County.\nIt is about long and wide, Padre Island is the second-largest island by area in the contiguous United States, after Long Island in New York on the Atlantic Coast.\nGeology.\nThe geology of Padre Island National Seashore doesn't just belong within the park itself. PAIS is part of the world's longest natural barrier bar system. Padre Island is a very young geological feature that only developed merely 4,500 to 5,000 years ago, according to radio carbon dating of shells.\nGeneral physiography.\nGeologically extremely young, Padre Island is a vastly dynamic geologic feature. Unlike most of today's geologic features, such as the Grand Canyon, Padre Island changes constantly. Situated in a stable depository basin, there isn't much that can intervene with the barrier bars, except for the occasional hurricanes that come by. Most of Padre Island is less than 20 feet above mean sea level. Constant bombardment of prevailing southeasterly winds from the Gulf of Mexico heap beach of sand into high foredunes. In some places, the onshore wind may blow loose sand from the foredunes and beach across the flats beyond. Active sand dunes march across the island, smothering vegetation in their paths and leaving barren sandflats in their wakes. In other places, vegetation may win a battle of its own and stabilize the blowing sand by binding it with roots and vines. Slower daily movements of the sand and stabilizing effects of vegetation are interrupted occasionally by the brutal force of hurricane winds, waves, and tides. During storms, beaches are eroded, vegetation is ripped up, dunes are flattened, and channels are scoured across the island.\nLaguna Madre.\nLaguna Madre, separating Padre Island from the Texas mainland, is locked in by the barrier island. Consequently, circulation of seawater in and out of the lagoon is highly restricted. The combination of a high rate of evaporation under the hot Texas sun and little mixing with either freshwater or normal seawater has made Laguna Madre extremely salty.\nThe maximum width of the lagoon is approximately 10 miles. In many places, however, lagoon width fluctuates considerably with the height of wind-generated tides. The lagoon is widest during highest wind tides, which produce maximum flooding of the vast tidal flats.\nLike the island environments, the environments of Laguna Madre vary considerably. Within the national seashore, the northern part of the lagoon is occupied largely by grassflats having an average water depth of about 3 feet. These grassflats are environments of very high biologic activity, serving as spawning grounds for a number of fish, clams, and snails.\nThe shallowest parts of the lagoon lie in the central part of the national seashore. These areas are known as Middle Ground and the Land-Cut Area, where the Intracoastal Waterway was dredged through the rarely flooded wind-tidal flats (pl. I). The Hole, which lies between Middle Ground and the Land-Cut Area, is not really much of a hole; its average depths are only 1 to 2 feet. This \"hole\" is occupied mostly by flats supporting shoalgrass and algae. The deepest parts of the lagoon are south of the Land-Cut Area, where the muddy sand bottoms lie at depths as great as 8 feet.\nTwo small natural islands in Laguna Madre are unique environments within the national seashore. North and South Bird Islands, each a series of sand berms or ridges, have become important bird rookeries. Some of the man-made spoil islands along the Intracoastal Waterway are also nesting grounds for a variety of birds.\nBiology.\nKemp's ridley sea turtles.\nA program to re-establish a nesting beach for Kemp's ridley sea turtles on Padre Island was begun in 1978. In 1992, the first two turtles from the program returned to Padre Island beach to lay their eggs. The number of Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests on Padre Island has increased ever since with 28 being found in 2005. Park rangers at PAIS are involved in an effort to help this endangered species. In the summer, visitors can witness the release of newborn turtles.\nIn September 2007, Corpus Christi, Texas wildlife officials found a record of 128 Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests on Texas beaches, including 81 on North Padre Island (Padre Island National Seashore) and 4 on Mustang Island. Wildlife officials released 10,594 Kemp's ridleys hatchlings along the Texas coast this year. The turtles are endangered due to shrimpers' nets and they are popular in Mexico as boot material and food.\nBirdwatching.\nDue to the location of Padre Island National Seashore on the Central Flyway, a major migratory route for birds, about 380 species of birds have been documented within the park, which represents approximately 45% of all bird species documented within North America. The park was designated as a \"Globally Important Bird Area\" by the American Bird Conservancy in 1998 for providing an \"important habitat for globally significant numbers of Brown Pelicans, Redheads (5% of the world's population), Least Terns (8% of the North American population), Piping Plovers (10% of the world's population), Reddish Egrets (7% of the biogeographic population) and Peregrine Falcons (7% of the North American population).\"\nThe best time to see the multitude of the park's bird migrants is during either early spring or fall and winter, when thousands of birds spend the winter there or migrate through the area. During the summer the most common birds are shore and marshbirds as well as some raptors and songbirds. The most common birds on the Gulf beach of the park during the year are the willet, sanderling, black skimmer, great blue heron, double-crested cormorant, cattle egret, grey plover, laughing gull, brown pelican, reddish egret, and five species of terns, including the least tern, Caspian tern, black tern, Sandwich tern, and royal tern. The two periodically appearing birds nesting on the park's shores are the least tern and piping plover.\nBird Island Basin, on the Laguna Madre side of the park, may be periodically dry during the summer or during periods of extended drought. It is home to a wide variety of birds when wet, including black-necked stilts, roseate spoonbills, great egrets, American white ibis, and many others.\nShoreline trash.\nDuring periods throughout the summer months there may be a large amount of \"Sargassum\", a brown seaweed, which washes up on the shore which aids in shore development by acting to hold sand in place, which can eventually build up the shoreline. Currents within the Gulf of Mexico are responsible for the transport of this seaweed mainly from the Sargasso Sea, but have also been responsible for the transport of trash to the shores of the park. This trash can be anything that is tossed overboard into the Gulf of Mexico as well as items that are either washed into the Gulf from land, or from the interior of the country by means of sewers that empty into the Gulf. These items can range from tiny pieces of plastic, hypodermic needles, and lumber, to nets or bleach bottles tossed overboard by shrimpers and even objects as large as buoys and steel containers. An international treaty known as MARPOL is designed to limit the dumping of wastes into the Gulf but there can be violators and the enforcement of the treaty is difficult, as well as the fact that some trash can originate from sewage transport or even come from the Equator. Oil and tar can commonly wash up onto the beaches as well, 94% of which originates from oil spills, engine lubrication oil, and tanker washings. The park relies on a \"grass roots\" policy that encourages park visitors to take out more trash than they bring in. Organization such as the Friends of Padre have removed over 2,000 tons of trash at their yearly Billy Sandifer Big Shell Beach Clean Up the last weekend of February every year.\nA study by the park, started in 1994, to analyze the origin of debris, titled the PAIS Marine Debris Point Source Investigation. The park began collecting data in 1998 to catalogue and remove debris from of beach. Currently the park has collected over 1,000 days of data for the project, covering a collective area of over of shoreline surveyed. This study is one of the first long-term and comprehensive marine debris research projects started within the United States. From its result the vast majority of the debris is traced to the commercial shrimping industry while approximately 14% comes from the offshore oil and gas industry.\nNaturalist and fishing guide Billy Sandifer founded an annual beach cleanup at the park in 1996. The cleanup targets the Big Shell Beach portion of the island, around the 20-25 mile marker. In 2007, Sandifer established the Friends of Padre, a non-profit association to fund park projects and to organize the cleanup.\nOil and natural gas drilling.\nOil and natural gas drilling is allowed within the park. Congress has not approved the purchase of the mineral rights within the park even though the boundaries were surveyed as early as 1957. This has caused some controversy because the land is a protected seascape under IUCAN. Heavy equipment is used within the park and is transported across beaches that are nesting areas for not only sea turtles but many birds, including the piping plover, least tern, and other animals that may nest within the park.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is based on the Uncle Remus stories as adapted by Joel Chandler Harris, stars James Baskett in his final film role, and features the voices of Johnny Lee, Baskett, and Nick Stewart. The film takes place in the U.S. state of Georgia during the Reconstruction era, a period of American history after the end of the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery. The story follows seven-year-old Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) who is visiting his grandmother's (Lucile Watson) plantation for an extended stay. Johnny befriends Uncle Remus (Baskett), an elderly worker on the plantation, and takes joy in hearing his tales about the adventures of Br'er Rabbit (Lee), Br'er Fox, and Br'er Bear (Baskett and Stewart). Johnny learns from the stories how to cope with the challenges he is experiencing while living on the plantation.\nWalt Disney had wanted to produce a film based on the Uncle Remus stories for some time. In 1939, he began negotiating with the Harris family for the film rights, and in 1944, filming for \"Song of the South\" began. The studio constructed a plantation set, for the outdoor scenes, in Phoenix, Arizona, while other scenes were filmed in Hollywood. The film is predominantly live action, but includes three animated segments, which were later released as stand-alone television features. Some scenes also feature a combination of live action with animation. \"Song of the South\" premiered in Atlanta in November 1946 and the remainder of its initial theater run was a financial success. The song \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Original Song and Baskett received an Academy Honorary Award for his performance as Uncle Remus.\nSince its initial release the film has attracted controversy, with critics characterizing its portrayal of African Americans and plantation life as racist. As a result of the film's controversial legacy, Disney has not released \"Song of the South\" on any home video format in the United States, and the film has never been available on its streaming platform Disney+. Some of the musical and animated sequences have been released through other means, and the full film has seen home video distribution in other countries. The cartoon characters from the film continued to appear in a variety of books, comics, and other Disney media for many decades after the film's release. The theme park ride Splash Mountain, located at Tokyo Disneyland and formerly located at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom, is based on the film's animated sequences.\nSynopsis.\nSetting.\nThe film is set on a plantation in Georgia, part of the Southern United States; specifically in a location some distance from Atlanta. Although sometimes misinterpreted as taking place before the American Civil War while slavery was still legal in the region, the film takes place during the Reconstruction era after slavery was abolished. Harris' original Uncle Remus stories were all set after the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery. Born in 1848, Harris was a racial reconciliation activist writer and journalist of the Reconstruction era. The film makes several indirect references to the Reconstruction era: clothing is in the newer late-Victorian style; Uncle Remus is free to leave the plantation at will; Black field hands are sharecroppers, etc.\nPlot.\nSeven-year-old Johnny is excited about what he believes to be a vacation at his grandmother's Georgia plantation with his parents, Sally and John Sr. When they arrive at the plantation, he discovers that his parents will be living apart temporarily, and he will live at the plantation with his mother and grandmother while his father returns to Atlanta to continue his controversial editorship of that city's newspaper. Distraught at his father's departure, Johnny secretly leaves for Atlanta that night with a bindle.\nAs Johnny sneaks away from the plantation, he discovers Uncle Remus telling tales of a character named Br'er Rabbit to other sharecroppers on the plantation. By this time, word had gotten out that Johnny was missing, and some plantation residents are looking for him. Johnny evades being discovered, but Uncle Remus catches up with him, offers him food for his journey, and takes him back to his cabin, where he tells the boy the traditional African-American folktale, \"Br'er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute\". In the story, Br'er Rabbit attempts to run away from home only to change his mind after an encounter with Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear. Johnny takes the advice and lets Uncle Remus take him back to Sally.\nJohnny makes friends with Toby, a young black boy who lives on the plantation, and Ginny Favers, a poor white girl. Ginny gives Johnny a puppy after her two older brothers, Joe and Jake, threaten to drown it. Sally refuses to let him take care of the puppy, so he takes it to Uncle Remus. Uncle Remus takes the dog in and delights Johnny and his friends with the fable of Br'er Rabbit and the Tar-Baby, stressing that people should not get involved with something they have no business with in the first place. Johnny imitates Br'er Rabbit's use of reverse psychology from the tale and begs the Favers brothers not to tell their mother about the dog. The trick works and the boys get in trouble after telling their mother. In an act of revenge, they tell Sally about the dog. Sally becomes upset that Johnny and Uncle Remus kept the dog despite her order (which was unknown to Uncle Remus), and she instructs him not to tell any more stories to Johnny.\nJohnny's birthday arrives and Johnny picks up Ginny to take her to his party. On the way there, Joe and Jake push Ginny into a mud puddle. With her dress ruined, Ginny is unable to go to the party and runs off crying. Johnny begins fighting with the boys, but their fight is broken up by Uncle Remus, who reprimands Joe and Jake and warns them to keep away from Johnny and Ginny. Johnny runs off to comfort Ginny. He explains that he does not want to go to the party either, especially since his father will not be there. Uncle Remus discovers both dejected children and cheers them up by telling the story of Br'er Rabbit and his \"Laughing Place\". When the three return to the plantation, Sally becomes angry at Johnny for missing his party, and tells Uncle Remus to stay away from him. Saddened by the misunderstanding of his good intentions, Uncle Remus packs his bags and begins to leave for Atlanta. Johnny rushes to intercept him, but is attacked by a bull and seriously injured after taking a shortcut through a pasture. While Johnny hovers between life and death, his father returns. Johnny calls for Uncle Remus, and his grandmother escorts him in. Uncle Remus begins telling a Br'er Rabbit tale, and the boy miraculously survives.\nLater, a fully recovered Johnny sings with Ginny and Toby while Johnny's returned puppy runs alongside them. Nearby, Uncle Remus is shocked when Br'er Rabbit and several of the other characters from his stories appear in front of them and interact with the children. Uncle Remus rushes to join the group, and, together, they all walk into the sunset.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVoices.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDevelopment.\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Walt Disney Studios faced financial difficulties due to a lack of foreign markets for animated films during wartime. The studio produced few theatrical animated shorts then, focusing instead on military training films that broke even, but produced no profit. The studio only profited in 1945 and 1946 by reissuing \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and \"Pinocchio\", and still had to lay off half of its employees in 1946. With additional financial difficulties due to a union strike in 1941, Disney sought to produce live-action films to generate additional revenue. While Disney's contract with RKO was for animated films, films that mixed live-action with animation fell under the contract, allowing the studio to lower production costs on \"Saludos Amigos\" and \"The Three Caballeros\". Additionally, Disney owned the rights to several properties purchased after the success of \"Snow White\", which could be made into family films.\nIn 1938, Walt Disney became interested in the Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus storybook, claiming to remember hearing the stories as a child, and prepared two research reports to determine if it was possible to film the stories, dated April 8 and 11, 1938. He purchased the rights to the stories in 1939, paying Harris's family $10,000 (). By 1986, the film based on the stories, \"Song of the South\", had earned $300 million.\nBeginning in 1939, Disney began developing \"Uncle Remus\" as an entirely animated feature. The stories were also considered as two-reel animated shorts. Stories considered for the production included \"Br'er Rabbit Rides the Fox\", in which Br'er Rabbit tricks Br'er Fox into riding him like a horse to a party, and \"De Wuller-De-Wust\", in which Br'er Rabbit pretends to be a ghost to scare Br'er Bear. In another treatment, Uncle Remus gathers the critters together for a prayer meeting and to encourage them to build a church that would bring peace between predators and prey. Also proposed was a storyline in which Br'er Rabbit's addiction to gambling would be at the root of the troubles that led to the film's adventures.\nDisney first began to negotiate with Harris's family for the rights in 1939, and by late summer of that year he already had one of his storyboard artists summarize the more promising tales and draw up four boards' worth of story sketches. In November 1940, Disney visited the Harris's home in Atlanta. He told \"Variety\" that he wanted to \"get an authentic feeling of Uncle Remus country so we can do as faithful a job as possible to these stories.\" Disney's brother Roy had misgivings about the project, doubting that it was \"big enough in caliber and natural draft\" to warrant a budget over $1 million and more than twenty-five minutes of animation. Disney planned to produce a series of Uncle Remus films if the first one was successful, each with the same live-action cast but different animated shorts. Ultimately, the studio decided that only a third of the film would be animated and the rest would be live-action.\nDisney was initially going to have the screenplay written by the studio animators, but later sought professional writers. In June 1944, Disney hired Southern-born writer Dalton Reymond to write the screenplay, and he met frequently with King Vidor, whom he was trying to interest in directing the live-action sequences.\nDalton Reymond delivered a 51-page outline on May 15, 1944. The Hays Office reviewed Reymond's outline, and demanded that some terminology, such as characters referring to Remus as an \"old darkie\" be removed from Reymond's treatment.\nDisney hired African-American performer and writer Clarence Muse to be consulted on the screenplay, but Muse quit when Reymond ignored Muse's suggestions to portray African-American characters in a way that would be perceived as being dignified and more than Southern stereotypes. Muse subsequently wrote letters to the editors of black publications to criticize the depiction of African-Americans in Reymond's script. Disney claimed that Muse attacked the film because Disney did not choose Muse to play the part of Uncle Remus, which Muse had lobbied for.\nIn addition to concerns about his racial stereotyping, Reymond had never written a screenplay before (nor would he write another). Maurice Rapf, who had been writing live-action features at the time, was asked by Walt Disney Productions to work with Reymond and co-writer Callum Webb to turn the treatment into a shootable screenplay. According to Neal Gabler, one of the reasons Disney had hired Rapf to work with Reymond was to temper what Disney feared would be Reymond's \"white Southern slant\".\nReymond's treatment included the phrases \"massa\", in reference to white characters, and \"darkey\", in reference to plantation workers, prominently. Rapf removed the phrases and added dialogue to make it clear that the film was set after slavery had ended; one character in Rapf's script states, in reference to the Black plantation workers, \"We gotta pay these people. They're not slaves.\" Uncle Remus also states, after being told that he cannot read any more stories to Johnny, \"I'm a free man; I don't have to take this.\"\nRapf saw the animal stories as metaphors for slave resistance, and intended to portray Br'er Rabbit as a smaller, less powerful Black man, and in place of the oppressive whites would be Br'er Fox, Br'er Bear and the deleted character Br'er Coon.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rapf was a minority, a Jew, and an outspoken left-winger, and he himself feared that the film would inevitably be Uncle-Tomish. \"That's exactly why I want you to work on it,\" Walt told him, \"because I know that you don't think I should make the movie. You're against Uncle Tomism, and you're a radical.\"\nRapf initially hesitated, but when he found out that most of the film would be live-action and that he could make extensive changes, he accepted the offer. Rapf worked on \"Uncle Remus\" for about seven weeks. When he got into a personal dispute with Reymond, Rapf was taken off the project. According to Rapf, Disney \"ended every conference by saying 'Well, I think we've really licked it now.' Then he'd call you the next morning and say, 'I've got a new idea.' And he'd have one. Sometimes the ideas were good, sometimes they were terrible, but you could never really satisfy him.\" Morton Grant was assigned to the project. Disney sent out the script for comment both within the studio and outside the studio.\nOn May 10, 1944, the title was changed from \"Uncle Remus\" to \"Song of the South\".\nProduction.\nCasting.\nIn February 1941, Disney talked with Paul Robeson about him playing Uncle Remus, and the two remained in talks about the project for several years, but ultimately he was not cast. It is speculated that Robeson's politics made him too controversial for the role. Other actors considered included Rex Ingram. Clarence Muse lobbied for the role of Uncle Remus while consulting on the screenplay, but left the project due to Dalton Reymond's depiction of African-Americans in the original treatment.\nJames Baskett was cast as Uncle Remus after responding to an ad for providing the voice of a talking butterfly. Baskett is quoted as saying; \"I thought that, maybe, they'd try me out to furnish the voice for one of Uncle Remus's animals.\" Upon review of his voice, Disney wanted to meet Baskett personally, and had him tested for the role of Uncle Remus. In addition to the role of Uncle Remus, Baskett also received the voice roles of the butterfly and Br'er Fox. Baskett also filled in as the voice of Br'er Rabbit for Johnny Lee in the \"Laughing Place\" sequence after Lee was called away to do a USO tour. Disney told Baskett's sister Ruth that Baskett was \"the best actor, I believe, to be discovered in years\". After the film's release, Disney maintained contact with him. Disney also campaigned for Baskett to be given an Academy Award for his performance, saying that he had worked \"almost wholly without direction\" and had devised the characterization of Remus himself. Baskett won an honorary Oscar in 1948. After Baskett's death, his widow wrote Disney and told him that he had been a \"friend indeed and [we] certainly have been in need\".\nAlso cast in the production were child actors Bobby Driscoll, Luana Patten, and Glenn Leedy (his only credited screen appearance). Driscoll was the first actor to be under a personal contract with the Disney studio. Patten had been a professional model since age three, and caught the attention of Disney when she appeared on the cover of \"Woman's Home Companion\". Leedy was discovered on the playground of the Booker T. Washington school in Phoenix, Arizona, by a talent scout from the Disney studio. Ruth Warrick and Erik Rolf, cast as Johnny's mother and father, had actually been married during filming, but divorced in 1946. Hattie McDaniel also appeared in the role of Aunt Tempe.\nFilming.\nProduction started under the title \"Uncle Remus\". The budget was originally $1.35 million. The animated segments of the film were directed by Wilfred Jackson, while the live-action segments were directed by Harve Foster. Filming began in December 1944 in Phoenix, Arizona where the studio had constructed a plantation and cotton fields for outdoor scenes, and Disney left for the location to oversee what he called \"atmospheric shots\". Back in Hollywood, the live action scenes were filmed at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio.\nOn the final day of shooting, Jackson discovered that the scene in which Uncle Remus sings the film's signature song, \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", had not been properly blocked. According to Jackson, \"We all sat there in a circle with the dollars running out, and nobody came up with anything. Then Walt suggested that they shoot Baskett in close-up, cover the lights with cardboard save for a sliver of blue sky behind his head, and then remove the cardboard from the lights when he began singing so that he would seem to be entering a bright new world of animation. Like Walt's idea for Bambi on ice, it made for one of the most memorable scenes in the film.\"\nAnimation.\nThere are three animated segments in the film (they total 25 minutes). The last few minutes of the film also combines animation with live-action. The three sequences were later shown as stand-alone cartoon features on television.\nMusic.\nNine songs are heard in the film, with four reprises. Nearly all of the vocal performances are by the largely African-American cast, and the renowned all-Black Hall Johnson Choir sing four pieces: two versions of a blues number (\"Let the Rain Pour Down\"), one chain-reaction-style folk song (\"That's What Uncle Remus Said\") and one spiritual (\"All I Want\").\nThe songs are, in film order, as follows:\n\"Let the Rain Pour Down\" is set to the melody of \"Midnight Special\", a traditional blues song popularized by Lead Belly (Huddie William Ledbetter). The song title \"Look at the Sun\" appeared in some early press books, though it is not in the film. Ken Emerson, author of the 1997 book \"Doo-dah!: Stephen Foster And The Rise Of American Popular Culture\", believes that \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" is influenced by the chorus of the pre-Civil War folk song \"Zip Coon\", which is today considered racist for its use of an African American stereotype.\nRelease.\nThe film premiered on November 12, 1946, at the Fox Theater in Atlanta. Walt Disney made introductory remarks, introduced the cast, then quietly left for his room at the Georgian Terrace Hotel across the street; he had previously stated that unexpected audience reactions upset him and he was better off not seeing the film with an audience. James Baskett was unable to attend the film's premiere because he would not have been allowed to participate in any of the festivities, as Atlanta was then a racially segregated city.\n\"Song of the South\" was re-released in theaters several times after its original premiere, each time through Buena Vista Pictures: in 1956 for the 10th anniversary; in 1972 for the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney Productions; in 1973 as the second half of a double bill with \"The Aristocats\"; in 1980 for the 100th anniversary of Harris's classic stories; and in 1986 for the film's 40th anniversary and in promotion of the 1989 opening of the Splash Mountain attraction at Disneyland.\nSpin-off comics and books.\nAs had been done earlier with \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937), \"Pinocchio\" (1940) and \"Bambi\" (1942), Disney produced a Sunday comic strip titled \"Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br'er Rabbit\" to give the film pre-release publicity. The strip was launched by King Features on October 14, 1945, more than a year before the film was released. The previous comic strip adaptations of Disney films lasted for four or five months, but the \"Uncle Remus\" strip continued for almost thirty years, telling new stories of Br'er Rabbit and friends, until the strip was discontinued on December 31, 1972. Apart from the newspaper strips, Disney \"Br'er Rabbit\" comics were also produced for comic books; the first such stories appeared in late 1946. Produced both by Western Publishing and European publishers such as Egmont, they continue to appear.\nIn 1946, a Giant Golden Book entitled \"Walt Disney's Uncle Remus Stories\" was published by Simon &amp; Schuster. It featured 23 illustrated stories of Br'er Rabbit's escapades, all told in a Southern dialect based on the original Joel Chandler Harris stories.\nIn 1986, Floyd Norman wrote \"A Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah Christmas!\" featuring Uncle Remus and Br'er Rabbit as that year's annual \"Disney Christmas Story\" newspaper comic strip. When the \"Christmas Story\" strips were reprinted in the 2017 collection \"Disney's Christmas Classics\", this story was omitted\u2014the only deletion in an otherwise complete run of the strip.\nHome media.\nDisney has not released a complete version of the film in the United States on home video, given the film's controversial reputation. Over the years, Disney has made a variety of statements about whether and when the film would be re-released. From 1984 to 2005, then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner stated that the film would not receive a home video release in the United States, due to not wanting to have a disclaimer and fearing backlash and accusations of racism. Uncle Remus was not featured in the Splash Mountain attraction, instead being replaced as the narrator by Br'er Frog in the Tokyo Disneyland and Magic Kingdom versions of the ride. In March 2010, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that there were no plans to release the film on DVD, calling the film \"antiquated\" and \"fairly offensive\". In November 2010, Disney creative director Dave Bossert stated in an interview, \"I can say there's been a lot of internal discussion about \"Song of the South\". And at some point we're going to do something about it. I don't know when, but we will. We know we want people to see \"Song of the South\" because we realize it's a big piece of company history, and we want to do it the right way.\" Film critic Roger Ebert, who normally disdained any attempt to keep films from any audience, supported the non-release of the film, arguing that Disney films become a part of the consciousness of American children, who take films more literally than do adults.\nAudio from the film\u2014both the musical soundtrack and dialogue\u2014was commonly used in home media tie-ins through the late 1970s. In particular, many book-and-record sets were released featuring the animated portions of the film or summaries of the film as a whole. The Walt Disney Company has also included key portions of the film in VHS and DVD compilations in the United States, as well as on the long-running Walt Disney anthology television series. \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" and some of the animated portions appear in an added feature on the 2004 \"Alice in Wonderland\" Special Edition DVD, as part of the 1950 Christmas special \"One Hour in Wonderland\", which promoted the then-forthcoming film. From 1986 to 2001, most of the musical segments \u2013 notably \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", \"How Do You Do?\", and \"Everybody's Got A Laughing Place\" \u2013 were included on the VHS and LaserDisc releases of the \"Disney Sing-Along Songs\" series.\nThe full-length film has been released in its entirety on VHS and LaserDisc in various European and Asian countries. In the United Kingdom, it was released on PAL VHS between 1982 and 2000. In Japan, it appeared on NTSC VHS and LaserDisc in 1985, 1990 and 1992, with Japanese subtitles during songs. Most of the foreign releases of the film are literal translations of the English title; the German title \"Onkel Remus' Wunderland\" translates to \"Uncle Remus's Wonderland\", the Italian title \"I Racconti Dello Zio Tom\" translates to \"The Stories of Uncle Tom\", and the Norwegian title \"Onkel Remus forteller\" translates to \"Storyteller Uncle Remus\". In 2021 and 2024, Spain and Italy released Blu-Ray releases of the film, as in both countries, the film has gone into public domain. \nIn 2017, after being inaugurated as a Disney Legend, Whoopi Goldberg expressed a desire for \"Song of the South\" to be re-released publicly to American audiences and stated, \"I'm trying to find a way to get people to start having conversations about bringing \"Song of the South\" back, so we can talk about what it was and where it came from and why it came out\".\n\"Song of the South\" has never been available on Disney's streaming service, Disney+, which launched in the United States in 2019. In 2020, Iger affirmed during a shareholders meeting that the film would not be getting a release on the service, even with an \"outdated cultural depictions\" disclaimer, stating that the film is \"not appropriate in today's world\". It has been noted on an unofficial fansite, however, that the film would become available to the public in the United States again once it enters the American public domain in 2042 when its copyright expires.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \u201cAs Uncle Remus, James Baskett is so skillful in registering contentment that even the people who believe in the virtues of slavery are going to be impressed and want to know his secret.\u201d\u2014Film critic Manny Farber in The New Republic, December 23, 1946.\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes has a rating of based on reviews, with an average score of . On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nBosley Crowther wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"More and more, Walt Disney's craftsmen have been loading their feature films with so-called 'live action' in place of their animated whimsies of the past, and by just those proportions has the magic of these Disney films decreased\", citing the ratio of live action to animation at two to one, concluding that is \"approximately the ratio of its mediocrity to its charm\". A review in \"Variety\" felt the film overall was \"sometimes sentimental, slow and overlong\". Nevertheless, the review felt the songs were \"above-average, with one 'Zip-adee-do-da,' [\"sic\"] likely to be one of the season's favorites\" and the animated sequences as \"great stuff\". They also praised Driscoll and Patten as \"two of the most natural and appealing youngsters\" and Baskett's performance was \"as warming a portrait as has been seen in a long time\". A review in \"Time\" magazine praised the animated sequences as \"topnotch Disney\u2014and delightful\", but cautioned that it was \"bound to land its maker in hot water\" because the character of Uncle Remus was \"bound to enrage all educated Negroes and a number of damyankees\".\n\"Harrison's Reports\" praised Driscoll and Baskett's performances, particularly the latter writing \"his tender understanding of the child's problems gives the picture many appealing moments.\" Overall, the review felt the film had \"a simple but sensitive and pathetic story, filled with deep human interest and fine, clean comedy situations, and it has an air of wholesomeness that comes as a pleasant relief from the general run of pictures nowadays.\" Dorothy Masters of the \"New York Daily News\" wrote: \"Although plot is practically ignored, Disney has worked a lot of magic with brilliant animation, effective and wonderful music, besides having made the very best possible choice for Uncle Remus. James Baskett, who portrays the sagacious dean of plantation workers, has both the benign appearance and mellifluous voice to make him the perfect spinner-of-tales. It's largely through his philosophical whimsy that \"Song of the South\" is so delightfully charming.\" Columnist Hedda Hopper also praised Baskett's performance, and advocated for him to receive an Academy Award.\nCriticism in the black press, however, was more politically divided. Richard B. Dier in \"The Afro-American\" was \"thoroughly disgusted\" by the film for being \"as vicious a piece of propaganda for white supremacy as Hollywood ever produced.\" Herman Hill in \"The Pittsburgh Courier\" felt that \"Song of the South\" would \"prove of inestimable goodwill in the furthering of interracial relations\", and considered criticisms of the film to be \"unadulterated hogwash symptomatic of the unfortunate racial neurosis that seems to be gripping so many of our humorless brethren these days.\"\nCharles Solomon, reviewing the film in the \"Los Angeles Times\" during its 1986 re-release, praised the film as \"essentially a nostalgic valentine to a past that never existed, and within those limits, it offers a pleasant, family diversion for holiday afternoons when the children get restless.\" \nIn Disney historian Jim Korkis's 2012 book, \"Who's Afraid of the Song of the South? And Other Forbidden Disney Stories\", the film's co-writer Maurice Rapf is quoted as saying; \"My script was terrible. I've looked at it since. It's just as racist as the film...\" however he also defended Disney by saying: \"Walt was not a racist; he was hoping not to offend the Blacks. I constantly tell the story about going to see Disney and him saying to me, 'I want you on it to prevent it from being anti-Black.'\"\nBox office.\nBy January 1948, the film had grossed $3.4 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada, netting the studio a profit of $226,000 ($2.83 million in 2017 dollars). According to RKO records, during its initial release, the film earned $3,515,000 domestically and $1,300,000 foreign, for a worldwide total of $4,815,000.\nAccolades.\nThe score by Daniele Amfitheatrof, Paul J. Smith, and Charles Wolcott was nominated in the \"Scoring of a Musical Picture\" category, and \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", written by Allie Wrubel and Ray Gilbert, won the award for Best Original Song at the 20th Academy Awards on March 20, 1948. A special Academy Award was given to Baskett \"for his able and heart-warming characterization of Uncle Remus, friend and story teller to the children of the world in Walt Disney's \"Song of the South\"\". For their portrayals of the children Johnny and Ginny, Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten were also discussed for Academy Juvenile Awards, but in 1947 it was decided not to present such awards at all.\nThe film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:\nDepiction of race.\nThe film has sparked significant controversy for its handling of race. Cultural historian Jason Sperb describes the film as \"one of Hollywood's most resiliently offensive racist texts\". Sperb, Neal Gabler, and other critics have noted the film's release as being in the wake of the Double V campaign, a campaign in the United States during World War II to promote victory over racism in the United States and its armed forces, and victory over fascism abroad. Early in the film's production, there was concern that the material would encounter controversy. Disney publicist Vern Caldwell wrote to producer Perce Pearce that \"the negro situation is a dangerous one. Between the negro haters and the negro lovers there are many chances to run afoul of situations that could run the gamut all the way from the nasty to the controversial.\"\nThe Disney Company has stated that, like Harris's book, the film takes place after the American Civil War and that all the African American characters in the movie are no longer slaves. The Hays Office had asked Disney to \"be certain that the frontispiece of the book mentioned establishes the date in the 1870s\"; however, the final film carried no such statement.\nAdam Clayton Powell Jr., a congressman from Harlem, branded the film an \"insult to American minorities [and] everything that America as a whole stands for.\" The National Negro Congress set up picket lines in theaters in the big cities where the film played, with its protesters holding signs that read \"\"Song of the South\" is an insult to the Negro people\" and, lampooning \"Jingle Bells\", chanted: \"Disney tells, Disney tells/lies about the South.\" On April 2, 1947, a group of protesters marched around Oakland, California's Paramount Theatre with picket signs reading, \"We want films on Democracy not Slavery\" and \"Don't prejudice children's minds with films like this\". \"The National Jewish Post\" scorned the fact that the film's lead was not allowed to attend its premiere in Atlanta because of his race.\nCriticisms in the Black press largely objected to the reinforcement of stereotypes, such as the subservient status of Black characters, costuming, the exaggerated dialect, and other archaic depictions of Black people.\nResponse of civil rights activists.\nAccording to Valarie Stewart, daughter of Nick Stewart (voice of Br'er Bear in the film), NAACP executive secretary Walter Francis White disliked actress Hattie McDaniel. White, a light-skinned black man with blond hair and blue eyes, according to Valarie Stewart, launched campaigns against McDaniel's films because McDaniel was dark-skinned, and she alleged that \"Song of the South\" was targeted because of White's prejudice against McDaniel.\nIn his 2012 book \"Who's Afraid of the Song of the South? And Other Forbidden Disney Stories\", Disney historian Jim Korkis alleged that White and June Blythe, the director of the American Council on Race Relations, were denied requests to see a treatment for the film, as it was standard Disney studio policy to not let outsiders see scripts for upcoming films. However, both Korkis and Neal Gabler also note that in mid-1944 Walt Disney personally invited White to the Disney Studio in Burbank to work with him on revising the script. White declined, however, saying that the NAACP had no West Coast representative, and he was not scheduled to come to California until November, and even then purely as a war correspondent.\nWhen the film was first released, White telegraphed major newspapers around the country with the following statement, erroneously claiming that the film depicted an antebellum setting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People recognizes in \"Song of the South\" remarkable artistic merit in the music and in the combination of living actors and the cartoon technique. It regrets, however, that in an effort neither to offend audiences in the north or south, the production helps to perpetuate a dangerously glorified picture of slavery. Making use of the beautiful Uncle Remus folklore, \"Song of the South\" unfortunately gives the impression of an idyllic master\u2013slave relationship which is a distortion of the facts.\nWhite had not seen the film; his statement was allegedly based on memos he received from two NAACP staff members, Norma Jensen and Hope Spingarn, who attended a press screening on November 20, 1946. Jensen had written the film was \"so artistically beautiful that it is difficult to be provoked over the clich\u00e9s,\" but said it contained \"all the clich\u00e9s in the book\". Spingarn listed several things she found objectionable from the film, including the use of African-American English. Jim Hill Media stated that both Jensen and Spingarn were confused by the film's Reconstruction setting, writing; \"it was something that also confused other reviewers who from the tone of the film and the type of similar recent Hollywood movies assumed it must also be set during the time of slavery.\" Based on the Jensen and Spingarn memos, White released the \"official position\" of the NAACP in a telegram that was widely quoted in newspapers. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" made a similar assumption, writing that the movie was a \"travesty on the \"antebellum\" South.\"\nLegacy.\nAs early as October 1945, a newspaper strip called \"Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br'er Rabbit\" appeared in the United States, and this production continued until 1972. There have also been episodes for the series produced for the Disney comic books worldwide, in the U.S., Denmark and the Netherlands, from the 1940s up to 2012. Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear also appeared frequently in Disney's Big Bad Wolf stories, although here, Br'er Bear was usually cast as an honest farmer and family man, instead of an antagonist in his original appearances.\nThe Splash Mountain log flume ride, which opened at Disneyland in 1989, and at Tokyo Disneyland and Magic Kingdom in 1992, is based on the animated portions of \"Song of the South\". As with the film, the ride had drawn controversy over the years due to the racial issues associated with the work. Amid the George Floyd protests in 2020, Disney announced that they would retool the ride in Disneyland and Magic Kingdom to remove the \"Song of the South\" elements and replace them with a concept based on Disney Animation's 2009 film \"The Princess and the Frog\". Disney stated that development of the project began in 2019. \"The New York Times\" reported that Disney executives had privately discussed removing the attraction's \"Song of the South\" theme for at least five years, before putting into development the \"Princess and the Frog\" theme. In July 2022, Disney announced that the new ride would be called Tiana's Bayou Adventure. The Magic Kingdom version of Splash Mountain closed in January 2023, while the Disneyland version closed in May 2023. Tiana's Bayou Adventure opened in June 2024 at Magic Kingdom and in November 2024 at Disneyland.\nBr'er Bear, the Tar-Baby, and the hummingbirds and moles from the \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" scene, have cameo appearances in the film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988). Br'er Bear makes a cameo appearance in the television series \"Bonkers\" (1993\u20131994) in the episode \"CasaBonkers\" (1993). Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox, and Br'er Bear make recurring cameo appearances on the television series \"House of Mouse\" (2001\u20132003), and appear in the show's direct-to-video film \"\" (2001), while the Blue Bird makes a cameo appearance in the \"House of Mouse\" episode \"Pete's One-Man Show\" (2002). In addition, Br'er Bear appears in silhouette along with other Disney cartoon characters at the end of the direct-to-video film \"The Lion King 1\u00bd\" (2004).\nBr'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox, and Br'er Bear also appeared in the 2011 video game \"\" for the Xbox 360. The game is a virtual recreation of Disneyland and features a mini game based on the Splash Mountain attraction. Br'er Rabbit helps guide the player character through that game, while Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear serve as antagonists. The Br'ers also appear as meet-and-greet characters in the game, outside Splash Mountain in Critter Country. Jess Harnell, who previously voiced Br'er Rabbit in the Disneyland and Magic Kingdom versions of the attraction reprises his role for the game and also takes on the role of Br'er Fox, while Br'er Bear is voiced by James Avery, who previously voiced Br'er Bear and Br'er Frog in the Magic Kingdom version of Splash Mountain. This is the Br'ers' first major appearance in Disney media and their first appearance as computer-generated characters.\nIn 2003, the Online Film Critics Society ranked the film as the 67th greatest animated film of all time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2020 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.\nCareer.\nWatson was the Director of the Science Division and Chief Scientist for the Office of Mission to Planet Earth at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Watson then became Associate Director for Environment in the Office of the President of the United States in the White House.\nIn 1996, Watson joined the World Bank as the Senior Scientific adviser in the Environment Department, became Director of the Environment Department and Head of the Environment Sector Board in 1997 and is currently the Chief Scientist and Senior Adviser for Sustainable Development. He took up a position as Chair of Environmental Science and Science Director of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, in August 2007 and joined the British Government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as Chief Scientific Adviser in September 2007.\nWatson had a role in the regulation efforts related to both ozone depletion and global warming. The Montreal and Vienna conventions were installed long before a scientific consensus was established. Until the 1980s EU, NASA, NAS, UNEP, WMO and the British government had dissenting scientific reports. Watson played a role in the process of unified assessments and did so as well for the IPCC.\nHe was Chairman of the Global Environment Facility's Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel from 1991 to 1994, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from 1997 to 2002 and Board co-chair for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2000 to 2005. He was then Director of the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development which ran from 2005 to 2007, and had previously been co-chair of the International Scientific Assessment of Stratospheric Ozone for their reports from 1994 to 2006. He has been Chair or co-chair of other international scientific assessments, including the IPCC Working Group II, the United Nations Environment Programme/World Meteorological Organization (UNEP/WMO), and the UNEP Global Biodiversity Assessment.\nWatson was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for his government service.\nHe is currently Director of Strategic Development for the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia.\nOn 29 February 2016, Watson was elected Chair of IPBES at the Fourth Plenary of that organisation after having served as its vice-president before.\nOpinions.\nAndrew Revkin writing for the \"New York Times\" described Watson as an \"outspoken advocate of the idea that human actions\u2014mainly burning coal and oil\u2014are contributing to global warming and must be changed to avert environmental upheavals.\"\nIn April 2002 the United States pressed for and won his replacement by Rajendra Pachauri as IPCC chair. According to \"New Scientist\", \"The oil industry seems to be behind the move.\" The industry campaign to oust Watson had begun days after George W. Bush's inauguration in January 2001, with a memo to the White House from Randy Randol of oil giant ExxonMobil asking \"Can Watson be replaced now at the request of the US?\"\nIn 2000, Watson stated:\n The overwhelming majority of scientific experts, whilst recognising that scientific uncertainties exist, nonetheless believe that human-induced climate change is inevitable. Indeed, during the last few years, many parts of the world have suffered major heat waves, floods, droughts, fires and extreme weather events leading to significant economic losses and loss of life. While individual events cannot be directly linked to human-induced climate change, the frequency and magnitude of these types of events are predicted to increase in a warmer world.\n The question is not whether climate will change in response to human activities, but rather how much (magnitude), how fast (the rate of change) and where (regional patterns). It is also clear that climate change will, in many parts of the world, adversely affect socio-economic sectors, including water resources, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and human settlements, ecological systems (particularly forests and coral reefs), and human health (particularly diseases spread by insects), with developing countries being the most vulnerable. The good news is, however, that the majority of experts believe that significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are technically feasible due to an extensive array of technologies and policy measures in the energy supply, energy demand and agricultural and forestry sectors. In addition, the projected adverse effects of climate change on socio-economic and ecological systems can, to some degree, be reduced through proactive adaptation measures. These are the fundamental conclusions, taken from already approved/accepted IPCC assessments, of a careful and objective analysis of all relevant scientific, technical and economic information by thousands of experts from the appropriate fields of science from academia, governments, industry and environmental organisations from around the world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is subdivided into 100 \"groszy\" (\"gr\"). It is the most-traded currency in Central and Eastern Europe and ranks 21st most-traded in the foreign exchange market.\nThe word \"z\u0142oty\" is a masculine form of the Polish adjective 'golden', which closely relates with its name to the guilder, whereas the grosz subunit is based on the groschen, cognate to the English word groat. It was officially introduced to replace its interim predecessor, the Polish marka, on 28 February 1919 and began circulation in 1924. The only bodies permitted to manufacture or mint z\u0142oty coins and banknotes are the Polska Wytw\u00f3rnia Papier\u00f3w Warto\u015bciowych (PWPW), founded in Warsaw on 25 January 1919, and Mennica Polska, founded in Warsaw on 10 February 1766.\nAs a result of inflation in the early 1990s, the currency underwent redenomination. Thus, on 1 January 1995, 10,000 old z\u0142oty (PLZ) became one new z\u0142oty (PLN). As a member of the European Union, Poland is obligated to adopt the euro when all specific conditions are met; however, there is no time limit for fulfilling all of them.\nCurrently, Poland is not in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II).\nName and plural forms.\nThe term \" is an adjective derived from the noun \", which in the Polish language denotes gold. A literal translation of the currency's name would be \"golden\" or \"the golden one\". There are two plural forms \u2013 as well as , and their correct usage is as follows:\nFractions should be rendered with and , for example 0.1 ; 2.5 and so on.\nNative English speakers or English-language sources tend to avoid the complexity of plural forms and in turn use \"z\u0142oty\" for all denominations, for instance 2 z\u0142oty and 100 z\u0142oty instead of 2 z\u0142ote and 100 z\u0142otych.\nSymbol.\nThe official currency symbol is z\u0142, composed of lowercase z and \u0142 which are the two first letters of \"z\u0142oty\". It has no representation in the Unicode Standard as a single sign, but previously had representation in Polish typewriters and computers. The symbol of the \"grosz\" subunit is represented by lowercase gr.\nHistory.\nFirst z\u0142oty.\nThe first form of tangible currency in Poland was the denarius (\"denar\"), which began circulating in the 10th century. During this period, Polish coinage had a single face value and was minted from bullion (primarily silver, but also compounded with copper and other precious metals). The standard unit of mass used at the time was the grzywna rather than the pound, with one grzywna being equivalent to 240 denars. From the 1300s to the mid-16th century, the Prague groschen (or groat) dominated the market and its high supply reduced the demand for a national currency across Central Europe. Certain cities and autonomous regions of the Polish Kingdom held the privilege of minting their own currency, for instance the shilling (\"szel\u0105g\") in the Duchy of Prussia, which Poland co-adopted in 1526.\nInitially, the term \"z\u0142oty\" (lit.\u2009'the golden one') was used in the 14th and 15th centuries for a number of foreign gold coins, most notably Venetian ducats, florins and guldens. In 1496, the Sejm parliament debated on the creation of a domestic currency and approved the z\u0142oty, which until then acted as a unit of account. An exchange rate of 30 grosz was imposed for one gold piece, which remained the traditional subdivision until the 19th century. In the years 1526\u20131535, as part of an extensive monetary reform proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus and Justus Decius, King Sigismund I defined the z\u0142oty as a legal tender in the minting ordinance on 16 February 1528.\nThe Polish monetary system remained complex and intricate from the 16th to 18th centuries until a monetary reform enacted by Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus which removed all other monetary units except the z\u0142oty, which was divided into 30 groszy. Polish currency was then linked to that of the Holy Roman Empire by setting the Conventionsthaler = 8 z\u0142oty = 23.3856 g fine silver and the North German thaler = 6 z\u0142oty = 17.5392 g silver (hence 2.9232 g silver in a z\u0142oty).\nRadical changes to the currency were made during the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising. The second partition of the vast Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth resulted in the loss of approximately 200,000 square kilometres of land and precipitated an economic collapse. The widespread shortage of funds to finance the defense of remaining territories forced the insurrectionist government to look for alternatives. In June 1794, Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko began printing paper money and issuing first Polish banknotes as a substitute for coinage, which could not be minted in required quantities. These entered circulation on 13 August 1794.\nThe z\u0142oty remained in circulation after the Partitions of Poland and Napoleon's Duchy of Warsaw issued coins denominated in grosz, z\u0142oty and talars, with the \"talar\" (thaler) of 6 z\u0142oty slightly reduced in value to the Prussian thaler of 16.704 g fine silver (hence 2.784 g silver in a z\u0142oty). Talar banknotes were also issued. In 1813, while Zamo\u015b\u0107 was under siege, the town authorities issued 6 grosz and 2 z\u0142oty coins. Following the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Austrian and Russian sectors of partitioned Poland continued to use the z\u0142oty for some time, while the German sector replaced the \"talar\" and \"z\u0142oty\" with the Prussian thaler and later, the German gold mark.\nOn 19 November O.S. (1 December N.S.) 1815, the law regarding the monetary system of Congress Poland (in Russia) was passed, which pegged the z\u0142oty at 15 kopecks (0.15 Imperial roubles, or almost 2.7 g fine silver) and the groszy at &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 kopeck, and with silver 1, 2, 5 and 10 z\u0142otych coins issued from 1816 to 1855.\nAt the time of the 1830 November Uprising, the insurrectionists issued their own \"rebel money\" \u2013 golden ducats and silver coins in the denomination of 2 and 5 z\u0142oty, with the revolutionary coat of arms, and the copper 3 and 10 grosz. These coins continued to be traded long after the uprising was quelled. As a consequence of the uprising, the rubel became the sole legal tender of Congress Poland from 1842, although coins marked as z\u0142oty in parallel with ruble were minted in Warsaw until 1865 and remained legal until 1890. In 1892, the Austro-Hungarian krone was introduced in Austrian Galicia. Between 1835 and 1846, the Free City of Krak\u00f3w also used its own independent currency, the Krak\u00f3w z\u0142oty (minted in Vienna), which remained legal until 1857.\nDuring World War I, the rouble and krone were replaced by the Polish marka, a currency initially equivalent to the German mark. The marka remained in use after Poland regained its independence in 1918, but was extremely unstable, disrupted the whole economy, and triggered galloping inflation.\nSecond z\u0142oty.\nThe z\u0142oty was reintroduced by the Minister of Finance, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski, in April 1924. It replaced the marka at a rate of 1 z\u0142oty to 1,800,000 marks and was subdivided into 100 grosz rather than the traditional 30 grosz.\nFollowing its inauguration, the second z\u0142oty was pegged to the United States dollar through a stabilization loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The budget deficit ballooned and out-of-control inflation ensued. The z\u0142oty began to stabilise in 1926 (chiefly due to significant exports of coal), and was re-set on the dollar-z\u0142oty rate 50% higher than in 1924. Up until 1933, the z\u0142oty was freely exchanged into gold and foreign currency. Based on these developments, the Polish government made the decision to adopt the gold standard and maintain it for a significant period to attract global investors.\nUnder the occupation during World War II, the Germans created an Emissary Bank (\"Bank Emisyjny\") in Krak\u00f3w, as Polish bank officials fled to Paris in France. It started operating on 8 April 1940, and in May, old banknotes from 1924 to 1939 were overstamped by the new entity. Money exchange was limited per individual; the limits varied according to the status of the person. The fixed exchange rate was 2 z\u0142oty per 1 Reichsmark. A new issue of notes appeared in the years 1940\u20131941.\nOn 15 January 1945, the National Bank of Poland was formed, and a new printing plant opened in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The series II and III notes were designed by Ryszard Kleczewski and Wac\u0142aw Borowski. The first three series were taken out of circulation in line with legislation signed on 28 October 1950, covering the introduction of a new z\u0142oty with a revived coinage system.\nThird z\u0142oty (PLZ).\nIn 1950, the third z\u0142oty (PLZ) was introduced, replacing all notes issued up to 1948 at a rate of one hundred to one, while all bank assets were re-denominated in the ratio 100:3. The new banknotes were dated 1948, while the new coins were dated 1949. Initially, by law with effect from 1950, 1 z\u0142oty was worth 0.222168 grams of pure gold. The banknotes were issued in denominations ranging from 10 zlotych to 5 million zlotych.\nFourth z\u0142oty (PLN).\nAfter the fall of communism in 1989 and resulting hyperinflation in 1990, the z\u0142oty was again redenominated. On 11 May 1994, a redenomination project from the NBP was approved; the act allowing the project to come into force was ratified on 7 July 1994. Thus, on 1 January 1995, the PLN was introduced at a rate of 1 PLN to 10,000 PLZ. Redesigned coins and banknotes were released featuring Polish monarchs, which were printed by De La Rue in London (until 1997) and PWPW in Warsaw (from 1997).\nBetween 2013 and 2014, the banknotes received additional security features. The design does not differ greatly from the original 1994 series, but is distinguishable by the added white-coloured field with a watermark on the obverse. The updated notes also possess randomly arranged dotting, which are part of the EURion constellation.\nOn 10 February 2017, a 500z\u0142 banknote with the likeness of John III Sobieski began circulating. On 2 October 2019, the commemorative 19 z\u0142otych note was released. In 2021, Adam Glapi\u0144ski, president of the National Bank of Poland, announced that a 1000z\u0142 note will be introduced in the near future, but the project was cancelled in 2024.\nFuture of the z\u0142oty.\nOne of the conditions of Poland joining the European Union in May 2004 obliges the country to eventually adopt the euro, though not at any specific date and only after Poland meets the necessary stability criteria; serious discussions regarding joining the Eurozone have ensued. An amendment to Article 227 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, which cedes the exclusive right to issue money to the Bank of Poland, will be required. While opinions of the euro have not always been favorable, 2022 opinion polling on behalf of the European Commission found 60% of respondents support adopting the euro. As of June 2025, Poland has not yet begun the process to adopt the Euro.\nBanknotes.\nThe banknotes range from 120 to 150 millimetres in length and from 60 to 75 millimetres in width. The length increases by 6mm and the width by 3mm with every higher denomination. The obverse features the left profile of a Polish monarch clothed in armour or royal regalia; the sovereigns are arranged chronologically based on the period of reign. The reverse illustrates important landmarks, early coinage or important objects from Poland's history. Architectural elements comprising portals, columns, windows or flower motifs are scattered throughout each banknote, both on the obverse and on the reverse. Predominant colours used include shades of brown, pink or purple, blue, green, and gold. Face value is given in numerals in the upper-left and upper-right corners on the obverse, and in the upper-right corner on the reverse. The written form of the nominal value is embedded vertically on the obverse and horizontally on the reverse.\nThe notes are adorned by the eagle charge from the Polish coat of arms, along with signatures of the President and General Treasurer of NBP \u2013 the National Bank of Poland.\nList of coins/banknotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Coins of Poland after the monetary reform of 1526\u20131528 and up to 1795\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Polish Banknotes, series 1919\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Coins of the Second Polish Republic\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Banknotes of the Second Polish Republic, series 1925-1939\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Banknotes of the Polish government-in-exile, printed in 1939.

{"id": "61146", "revid": "12202748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61146", "title": "Chastity belt", "text": "Device to prevent sexual activity\nA chastity belt is a locking item of clothing designed to prevent sexual intercourse or masturbation. Such belts were historically designed for women, ostensibly for the purpose of chastity, as an anti-rape device, or to dissuade women and their potential sexual partners from sexual temptation. Modern versions of the chastity belt are predominantly, but not exclusively, used in the BDSM community, and chastity belts are now designed for male wearers in addition to female wearers.\nAccording to modern myths, the chastity belt was used as an anti-temptation device during the Crusades. When the knight left for the Holy Lands on the Crusades, his Lady would wear a chastity belt to preserve her faithfulness to him. However, there is no credible evidence that chastity belts existed before the 15th century (over a century after the last Middle Eastern Crusade), and their main period of apparent use falls within the Renaissance rather than the Middle Ages. Research into the history of the chastity belt suggests that they were not used until the 16th century, and then only rather rarely; they first became widely available in the form of 19th-century anti-masturbation medical devices.\nRenaissance chastity belts were said to have had padded linings (to prevent large areas of metal from coming into direct prolonged contact with the skin), and these had to be changed fairly frequently, so that such belts were not practical for uninterrupted long-term wear. Uninterrupted long-term wear could have caused genitourinary infection, abrasive wounds, sepsis, and eventual death.\nHistorical usage.\nGregory the Great, Alcuin of York, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Nicholas Gorranus all made passing references to \"chastity belts\" within their exhortatory and public discourses, but meant this in a figurative or metaphorical sense within their historical context.\nThe first detailed actual mention of what could be interpreted as \"chastity belts\" in the West is in Konrad Kyeser von Eichst\u00e4tt's \"Bellifortis\" (1405), which describes the military technology of the era. The book includes a drawing that is accompanied by the Latin text: \"Est florentinarum hoc bracile dominarum ferreum et durum ab antea sic reseratum.\" (\"These are hard iron breeches of Florentine women which are closed at the front.\") The belt in this drawing is described by Dingwall as \"both clumsy and heavy\", having \"little in common with the later models which served the same use\". The \"Bellifortis\" account is not supported by any additional concrete evidence or corroborating documents. Polidoro argues that Kyeser's references are meant to be humorous or ironic, and that Dingwall's accounts of the use of chastity belts by a few rich men in the 16th and 17th centuries to ensure the faithfulness of their often much younger wives should be treated critically, because of the absence of actual artifacts of this nature from the historical period in question, and his lack of access to more detailed contemporary historical records.\nIn 1889, a leather-and-iron belt was found by Anton Pachinger\u2014a German collector of antiquities\u2014in Linz, Austria, in a grave on a skeleton of a young woman. The woman was reportedly buried in the 16th century. Pachinger, however, could not find any record of the woman's burial in the town archives. The belt itself, along with most of the rest of Pachinger's collection, were lost during the chaotic aftermath of World War I.\nTwo belts have been exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny in Paris. The first, a simple velvet-covered hoop and plate of iron, was supposedly worn by Catherine de' Medici. The other\u2014said to have been worn by Anne of Austria\u2014is a hinged pair of plates held about the waist by metal straps, featuring intricately etched figures of Adam and Eve. There are other such belts at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg and the British Museum in London. Most have been removed from public display to avoid any further embarrassment because the authenticity of these belts as medieval devices has since been called into question. Many contemporary historians accept that these alleged \"artifacts\" date from the 19th century, and are thus inauthentic.\nFrom the 18th century until the 1930s, masturbation was widely regarded as harmful in Western medicine. Numerous mentions can be found in medical journals of the time of the use of chastity belt-like devices to prevent masturbation in female children and adolescents, as well as women. Many designs for anti-masturbation devices were filed in the US Patent Office until the early 1930s, when masturbation was no longer deemed to be the cause of mental health problems.\nFurthermore, some 19th-century working women may have used chastity belts for protective reasons, as a \"rape shield\" to obstruct sexual assault from predatory bosses or male colleagues; the belts were not worn for a long time uninterruptedly, however, since sanitary and hygiene reasons prevented this before the modern invention of stainless-steel belts. The belt design was the most common but there were also concealed versions worn inside the vagina which were designed to injure the penis.\nModern usage.\nBDSM.\nChastity belts are sometimes used in BDSM play in consensual relationships. They are a means for the wearer to surrender control over their sexual behavior either for sexual play, or as a long-term method of preventing infidelity or masturbation. They range from simple leather or plastic toys commonly sold by adult stores to expensive high-security stainless steel devices made by a handful of specialist firms. The internet has significantly increased the number of people using chastity devices, with internet advertisements and amateur erotic content sites often serving as the means of discovery of chastity devices and their use. Similarly, the internet has allowed consumers to acquire devices more easily, faster, anonymously, and from a wider range of manufacturers and retailers. Simultaneously, the internet has provided a private avenue for subcultures dedicated to their usage, fostering the culture and allowing individuals with interests in chastity to connect with one another, both on the internet and in-person. \nAlthough there exists a historical association of chastity belts with women, the male chastity devices market offers more options and diversity compared to what is available for female chastity devices. Among male chastity devices, \"cock-and-ball\" trap devices are the most popular, followed by typically more secure full belt (around-the-waist) style devices.\nOther occurrences.\nIn 1981, while California State Senator John G. Schmitz was leading hearings on outlawing abortion, Gloria Allred presented him with a chastity belt. Schmitz retaliated in a press release, calling her a \"slick butch lawyeress.\" She sued him for libel, and eventually secured a settlement of $20,000 and an apology.\nIn 1998, racial riots against the ethnic Chinese in West Java prompted the production and sale of \"anti-rape corsets\". These were Florentine-type belts of imitation leather-covered plastic, fastened with a combination lock. The belts had a solid crotch strap without holes, and were intended only for brief outings.\nIn April 2002, the Uwe Koetter Jewellers company of Cape Town, South Africa, completed and delivered a diamond and pearl-encrusted chastity belt made of gold to a British customer. The belt reportedly cost R160,000 and was a wedding gift from a husband-to-be for his bride to wear at their wedding.\nOn February 6, 2004, \"USA Today\" reported that at Athens airport in Greece, a woman's steel chastity belt had triggered a security alarm at the metal detector. The woman explained that her husband had forced her to wear the device to prevent an extramarital affair while she was on vacation in Greece. She was allowed to continue her flight to London on the pilot's authority. The incident was said to have happened just before Christmas in 2003.\nIn November 2006, photographs of Lucio Valentini's hand-wrought iron chastity belts were published in newspapers including the Seoul Times, and CRI Online. Although Valentini's company, MedioEvo, claims that their chastity belts' designs are from the Middle Ages on their website, a company spokesperson acknowledged that there is no proof that devices such as these were actually used.\nIn 2007, the Asian Human Rights Commission reported that women were being forced to wear chastity belts in the Indian state of Rajasthan.\nIn 2008, masseuses in Batu, Indonesia were required to wear belts with a lock and key during working hours, to prevent prostitution.\nOn February 8, 2010, AOL News reported that Dexter Blanch, a dog breeder from Louisiana, introduced a chastity belt for dogs, called PABS (Pet Anti-Breeding System). It is made of polypropylene and uses an eight-buckle locking system and a washable mesh pad to prevent intercourse in female dogs. Kathleen Makolinski, director of veterinary outreach at the ASPCA, commented that \"For the majority of animals, spaying and neutering remains the most beneficial option\". While this may be true for dogs being helped by rescues and humane societies, the American Kennel Club subsequently changed its policy regarding pediatric spaying or neutering. Following the research published by UC Davis, the American Kennel Club (AKC) now says that the owner of large breed dogs will have a healthier, longer lived dog if the pet owner would wait until the dog is of appropriate age before spaying or neutering.\nOn September 19, 2012, \"China People's Daily\" reported that a man in his 50s, naked except for a homemade chastity belt, appeared with a pair of banners in Changchun World Sculpture Park in Jilin province in China, seeking a wife. He stated that he wore the chastity belt to symbolize fidelity to his future wife.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the last Belgian king to be sovereign of the Congo, before it became independent in 1960 and became the Democratic Republic of the Congo (known from 1971 to 1997 as Zaire).\nBaudouin was the elder son of King Leopold III (1901\u20131983) and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden (1905\u20131935). Because he and his wife, Queen Fabiola, had no children, at Baudouin's death the crown passed to his younger brother, King Albert II.\nIn 2024, the Holy See opened the cause for his beatification, which gave him the title Servant of God.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nPrince Baudouin was born on 7 September 1930 at the Ch\u00e2teau of Stuyvenberg in Laeken, northern Brussels, the elder son and second child of Prince Leopold, then Duke of Brabant, and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. In 1934, Baudouin's grandfather King Albert I of Belgium was killed in a rock climbing accident; Leopold became king and the three-year-old Baudouin became Duke of Brabant as heir apparent to the throne. When Baudouin was nearly five, his mother died in 1935 in Switzerland in the accident of an automobile that his father was driving. Later, in 1941, his father remarried to Mary Lilian Baels (later became Princess of R\u00e9thy). This marriage produced three more children: Prince Alexandre, Princess Marie-Christine (who is also Baudouin's goddaughter) and Princess Marie-Esm\u00e9ralda. Baudouin and his siblings had a close relationship with their stepmother and they called her \"Mother\". His education began at the age of seven, his tutors taught him half his lessons in French and half in Dutch. He frequently accompanied his father to parades and ceremonies and became well known to the public.\nDespite maintaining strict neutrality during the opening months of World War II, on 10 May 1940, Belgium was invaded by Nazi Germany. Baudouin, his elder sister Princess Josephine-Charlotte and his younger brother Prince Albert, were immediately sent to France for safety and then to Spain. The Belgian Army, assisted by the French and British, conducted a defensive campaign lasting 18 days, but Leopold, who had taken personal command, surrendered unconditionally on 28 May. Although the Belgian government escaped to form a Belgian government in exile, Leopold elected to remain in Belgium, and was placed under house arrest at the Palace of Laeken, from where he attempted to reach an understanding with the Germans, especially in respect of Belgian prisoners of war who were being held in Germany. The children returned to Laeken from Spain on 6 August.\nLeopold had established a royal Scout group at the palace for his sons, whose members were drawn from the various Belgian Scout associations. In April 1943, the wearing of uniforms was banned by the occupation forces and although Leopold was told that the royal group was exempt, insisted that the ban should apply to them too. However, Baudouin was about to be invested as a Scout and persuaded his father to delay the ban for one day so that the ceremony could take place.\nImmediately following the Normandy landings in June 1944, the king, his wife, and the royal children, were deported to Hirschstein in Germany and then to Strobl in Austria from where they were released in May 1945 by the United States 106th Cavalry Regiment. However, the royal family were prevented from returning to Belgium by the \"Royal Question\" over whether Leopold had collaborated with the Nazis; the surrender in 1940, his refusal to join the government-in-exile, his fruitless visit to Adolf Hitler at the Berghof in November 1940 and his unconstitutional marriage to Lilian whose father was believed to be pro-Nazi. Until a political solution could be found, the king's brother, Prince Charles, became regent and the royal family lived at the in Pregny-Chamb\u00e9sy, Switzerland. Baudouin continued his education at a secondary school in Geneva and visited the United States in 1948.\nReign.\nIn a referendum in March 1950, the public narrowly voted for King Leopold III to return from Switzerland and he was recalled on 4 June 1950. However, parliamentary dissent and public protests forced Leopold to delegate his powers to Baudouin on 11 August 1950, and finally to abdicate in favour of Baudouin, who took the oath of office as King of the Belgians on 17 July 1951. In 1960, Baudouin declared the Belgian colony of Congo independent. During the parade following the last ceremonial inspection of the Force Publique, the royal sabre of the king was momentarily stolen by Ambroise Boimbo. The photograph, taken by Robert Lebeck, was widely published in world newspapers, with some seeing the act as a humiliation for the king. \nDeath of Patrice Lumumba.\nDuring the Congolese declaration of independence, Baudouin delivered a highly contested speech in which he celebrated the acts of the first Belgian owner of the Congo, King Leopold II, whom he described as \"a genius\". At the same event, the first democratically elected prime minister of Congo, Patrice Lumumba, gave a blistering response with a speech that was highly critical of the Belgian regime. Lumumba cited the killings of many Congolese, as well as the insults, humiliation and the slavery they experienced.\nLumumba's speech infuriated Baudouin and generated significant conflict between the two men. After the independence of Congo, the natural resource-rich Katanga Province orchestrated a secession that received substantial military and financial support from the Belgian government, as well as from Belgian companies with business interests in Katanga. Baudouin strengthened his relationships with the Katangese politician Moise Tshomb\u00e9, whom he made a Knight in the Belgian Order of Leopold. In the meantime, Belgium's government, as well as the CIA, supported or organized plots to assassinate Lumumba.\nIn early December 1960, Lumumba and two colleagues, Maurice Mpolo and Joseph Okito, who had planned to assist him in setting up a new government, were imprisoned in military barracks located about from Leopoldville. They were underfed and mistreated, per Mobutu Sese Seko's orders. Lumumba registered his objections, writing directly to Indian and U.N. diplomat Rajeshwar Dayal, \"in a word, we are living amid absolutely impossible conditions; moreover, they are against the law\". Lumumba and his associates were released in mid-January 1961. Within hours, they were again captured and then transported to Katanga by the Congolese military and handed over to the Katangese authorities. They were beaten by Katangese officers and on January 17, they were executed on the orders of the Katangese leadership. The execution took place in the presence of Katangese President Tshombe, two Katangese ministers and Belgian officials. The firing squad was reportedly commanded by a Belgian Julien Gat. Lumumba was buried in a shallow grave but his body was later exhumed by Belgian police officer Gerard Soete who dismembered Lumumba's body, and dissolved the corpse in acid.\nIn 2001, a parliamentary investigation set up by the Belgian government concluded that Baudouin, amongst others, was informed of the assassination scheme developed by Mobutu and Tshomb\u00e9. Both men had conspired with a Belgian colonel, Guy Weber, to \"neutralize Lumumba, if possible physically.\" The king was informed of the plot, but did nothing to oppose the murder. His lack of intervention was described as \"incriminating\" by the parliamentary investigation, although there was no conclusive evidence found that the king ordered the specifics of the plans.\nIn June 2025, Baudouin's close associate \u00c9tienne Davignon, a former Belgian junior diplomat to Congo, was requested to be tried for war crimes for his involvement in the unlawful detention, deprivation of a fair trial, and torture of Lumumba in 1960. It is expected to be decided in January 2026 whether a trial will take place. Davignon has denied the allegations.\nWestern engagements and later reign.\nAs the head of state of Belgium, Baudouin, along with French President Charles de Gaulle, were the two prominent world leaders at the state funerals of two American presidents, John F. Kennedy in November 1963 and his predecessor Dwight D. Eisenhower in March 1969. At Kennedy's funeral, Baudouin was accompanied by Paul-Henri Spaak, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and former three-time Prime Minister of Belgium. At Eisenhower's funeral, his next visit to the United States, he was accompanied by Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens.\nIn 1976, on the occasion of his silver jubilee, the King Baudouin Foundation was formed, with the aim of improving the living conditions of the Belgian people.\nDeath and funeral.\nBaudouin died from a heart attack on 31 July 1993, while on holiday at the Villa Astrida in the southern Spanish town of Motril, after a 42-year reign. Although in March 1992 the king had been operated on for a mitral valve prolapse in Paris, his death still came unexpectedly, and sent much of Belgium into a period of deep mourning. His death notably stopped the 1993 24 Hours of Spa sportscar race, which had reached 15 hours when the news broke.\nWithin hours, the gates and enclosure of the royal palace were covered with flowers that people brought spontaneously. A viewing of the body was held at the Royal Palace in central Brussels; 500,000 people (5% of the population) came to pay their respects. Many waited in line up to 14 hours in sweltering heat to see their king one last time. The funeral service was attended by all other European monarchs \u2013 including Queen Elizabeth II (the only international state funeral she attended in person as monarch) \u2013 alongside Emperor Akihito of Japan. Non-royal guests at the funeral included more than twenty presidents and leaders. Only two reigning heads of state of sovereign states at the time were not invited: Saddam Hussein, and Mobutu, the first due to the Gulf War, the latter due to him being declared persona non grata partly thanks to Mobutu exposing information about Baudouin's brother and sister-in-law. The presidents and leaders who did attend the funeral included UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, European Commission President Jacques Delors, French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, German President Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, Polish President Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovi\u0107, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Canadian Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn and former US President Gerald Ford.\nKing Baudouin was interred in the royal vault at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels. He was succeeded by his younger brother, who became King Albert II.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage.\nOn 15 December 1960, Baudouin was married in Brussels to Do\u00f1a Fabiola de Mora y Arag\u00f3n. Fabiola was a Spanish noblewoman who was working as a nurse. The couple announced their engagement on 16 September 1960 at the Palace of Laeken.\nFabiola began undertaking official engagements immediately, accompanying the king to lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in Brussels on 26 September 1960, and remained an active queen consort and queen dowager for the remainder of her life, involved in social causes particularly those related to mental health, children's issues and women's issues.\nKing Baudouin and Queen Fabiola had no children; all of the queen's five pregnancies ended in miscarriage.\nReligion.\nBaudouin was a devout Catholic. Through the influence of Cardinal Leo Suenens, Baudouin participated in the growing Catholic Charismatic Renewal and regularly went on pilgrimages to the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paray-le-Monial.\nIn 1990, when a law submitted by Roger Lallemand and Lucienne Herman-Michielsens that liberalized Belgium's abortion laws was approved by Parliament, he refused to give royal assent to the bill. This was unprecedented; although Baudouin was \"de jure\" Belgium's chief executive, royal assent has long been a formality (as is the case in most constitutional and popular monarchies). However, due to his religious convictions\u2014the Catholic Church opposes all forms of abortion\u2014Baudouin asked the government to declare him temporarily unable to reign so that he could avoid signing the measure into law. The government under Wilfried Martens complied with his request on 4 April 1990. According to the provisions of the Belgian Constitution, in the event the king is temporarily unable to reign, the government as a whole assumes the role of head of state. All government members signed the bill, and the next day (5 April 1990) the government called the bicameral legislature in a special session to approve a proposition that Baudouin was capable of reigning again.\nHe was the 1,176th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Spain, which was bestowed upon him in 1960, the 927th Knight of the Order of the Garter, bestowed upon him in 1963, and also the last living knight of the Papal Supreme Order of Christ.\nLegacy.\nOn 29 September 2024, Pope Francis announced during Mass as part of an official visit to Belgium, after visiting the Royal Crypt where Baudouin and Fabiola are buried the day before, his intention to start the procedure towards beatification of the late King. On 17 December 2024, the Vatican's Dicastery for the Causes of Saints officially launched the cause for the beatification and canonization of Baudouin.\nHonours.\nReligious distinctions.\nThe Catholic and very pious Baudouin had been awarded some special honours associated with that faith.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bordered by Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire to the north, Rutland to the east, Northamptonshire to the south-east, Warwickshire to the south-west, and Staffordshire to the west. The city of Leicester is the largest settlement.\nThe county has an area of and an estimated population of 1,133,921 in 2024. Leicester is located in the centre of the county and is by far the largest settlement; its urban area includes the towns of Wigston and Oadby immediately to the south-east. The rest of the county is largely rural, and its settlements include the university town of Loughborough in the north, Melton Mowbray in the north-east, Hinckley in the south-west, and Coalville in the north-west. For local government purposes Leicestershire comprises a non-metropolitan county, with seven districts, and the unitary authority area of Leicester.\nLeicestershire is generally a lowland county, characterised by small, rolling hills. It is bisected by the River Soar, which rises near the Warwickshire border south of Hinckley and flows north through Leicester and Loughborough before reaching the Trent at the county boundary. To the west of the river is Charnwood Forest, an upland area which contains Bardon Hill, which at is the county's highest point.\nThere are prehistoric earthworks in the county, and Leicester was a Roman settlement. The region was settled by the Angles in the sixth century and became part of the Kingdom of Mercia, and the county existed at the time of the Domesday Survey in the 1080s. The county has had a relatively settled existence; however, it was the site of the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, which established the Tudor dynasty's position as monarchs of England. During the Industrial Revolution the Leicestershire coalfield in the north and west of the county was exploited. Leicester became known for shoemaking, and with Loughborough continues to be a manufacturing centre. In agriculture the county is known for Stilton cheese and Melton Mowbray pork pies.\nHistory.\nThe Domesday Book (1086) records four wapentakes in the territory of Leicestershire: Guthlaxton, Framland, Goscote and Gartree. These later became hundreds, with the division of Goscote into West Goscote and East Goscote, and the addition of Sparkenhoe hundred. The first recorded use of the county name occurs in 1087 as .\nLeicestershire's external boundaries have changed little since the Domesday Survey. The Measham-Donisthorpe exclave of Derbyshire has been exchanged for the Netherseal area, and the urban expansion of Market Harborough has caused Little Bowden, previously in Northamptonshire to be annexed. Until 1969, the county's legal name was \"Leicester\" rather than \"Leicestershire\", although the latter form was in common usage. In legal contexts the county was usually referred to as the \"County of Leicester\" where necessary to distinguish between the city and the county. In 1969 the government formally changed the county's name to \"Leicestershire\" at the county council's request.\nIn 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 abolished the county borough status of Leicester city and the county status of neighbouring Rutland, converting both to administrative districts of Leicestershire. These actions were reversed on 1 April 1997, when Rutland and the City of Leicester became unitary authorities. Rutland became a distinct Ceremonial County once again, although it continues to be policed by Leicestershire Constabulary.\nThe symbol of the county council, of the Leicestershire County Cricket Club and of Leicester City FC is a fox. Tradition regards Leicestershire as the birthplace of fox hunting as it is known today. Hugo Meynell (1735-1808), who lived in Quorn, has a reputation as the \"father of modern fox-hunting\".\nMelton Mowbray and Market Harborough have associations with fox hunting, as has neighbouring Rutland.\nThe flag of Leicestershire features a fox under an heraldic cinquefoil \u2014 both symbols often associated with Leicestershire. The flag design, made official in July 2021, was the last one registered for an historic county of England.\nGeography.\nThe River Soar together with its tributaries and canalisations constitutes the principal river basin of the county, although the River Avon and River Welland through Harborough and along the county's southern boundaries are also significant. The Soar rises between Hinckley and Lutterworth, towards the south of the county near the Warwickshire border, and flows northwards, bisecting the county along its north\u2013south axis, through 'Greater' Leicester and then to the east of Loughborough where its course within the county comes to an end. It continues north marking the boundary with Nottinghamshire in the Borough of Rushcliffe for some before joining the River Trent at the point where Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire meet.\nThe geographical centre of England is in Leicestershire, near Fenny Drayton in the southwest of the county. In 2013, the Ordnance Survey calculated that the point was on land at Lindley Hall Farm. An alternative point at Meriden, around to the southwest, had been considered the traditional centre for more than 500 years.\nA large part of the north-west of the county, around Coalville, forms part of the new National Forest area extending into Derbyshire and Staffordshire. The highest point of the county is Bardon Hill at , which is also a Marilyn; with other hilly/upland areas of around and above in nearby Charnwood Forest and also to the east of the county around Launde Abbey. The lowest point, at an altitude of about , is located at the county's northernmost tip close to Bottesford where the River Devon flowing through the Vale of Belvoir leaves Leicestershire and enters Nottinghamshire.\nDemographics.\nThe population of Leicestershire (excluding Leicester Unitary Authority) is 609,578 people (2001 census). The county covers an area of . Its largest population centre is the city of Leicester, followed by the town of Loughborough. Other large towns include Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Coalville, Hinckley, Lutterworth, Market Harborough, Melton Mowbray, Oadby, Shepshed and Wigston.\nSome of the larger of villages are: Burbage (population estimated around 16,500 in 2014), Birstall (population 11,400 in 2004), Broughton Astley, Castle Donington, Kibworth Beauchamp (along with Kibworth Harcourt), Great Glen, Ibstock, Countesthorpe and Kegworth. One of the most rapidly expanding villages is Anstey, which has seen expansion in almost every decade since the 1950s to the 2020s, with further expansion expected.\nEconomy.\nEngineering.\nEngineering has long been an important part of the economy of Leicestershire. John Taylor Bellfounders continues a history of bellfounding in Loughborough since the 14th century. In 1881 John Taylors cast the largest bell in Britain, \"Great Paul\", for St Paul's Cathedral in London. https:// have been making sand cast sheet lead roofing and stained glass since 1825 working on many of England's major cathedrals and historic buildings, including Salisbury Cathedral, Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, Hampton Court Palace, and Chatsworth House. There were three coal mines that operated in Coalville from the 1820s until 1986. Abbey Pumping Station houses four enormous steam powered beam engines built in Leicester in the 1890s in the Vulcan factory owned by Josiah Gimson, whose son Ernest Gimson was an influential furniture designer and architect of the English Arts and Crafts movement.\nEngineering companies today include sports car makers Noble Automotive Ltd in Barwell and Ultima Sports Ltd in Hinckley, Triumph Motorcycles in Hinckley, Jones &amp; Shipman (machine tools), Caterpillar Redford (Plant machinery), Plant manufacturers Metalfacture Ltd (sheet metal work), Richards Engineering (foundry equipment), Transmon Engineering (materials handling equipment), Trelleborg Industrial AVS in Beaumont Leys (industrial suspension components), Parker Plant (quarrying equipment) in Belgrave which opened in 1911 inside a single railway arch. The business relocated to an 18-acre site in 1926. In the 1950s, 60s and 70s they were employing over 1,400 people to meet demand. In 1969, 1978 and in 1994 the business won the prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise. In 2006 Universal Conveyors was acquired and in 2007 Phoenix Parker Holdings Ltd was formed. In 2014 Phoenix Transworld, Cartem &amp; Universal Conveyors marketed under the Parker brand. Aggregate Industries UK (construction materials), Infotec in Ashby-de-la-Zouch (electronic information display boards), Alstec in Whetstone, Leicestershire (airport baggage handling systems), and Brush Traction (railway locomotives) in Loughborough. There are also consultancies (including Pick Everard) in Leicestershire supporting engineering and the built environment. Local commitment to nurturing the upcoming cadre of British engineers includes apprenticeship schemes with local companies, and academic-industrial connections with the engineering departments at Leicester University, De Montfort University and Loughborough University.\nThe Engineering Innovation Centre and Centre for Excellence for low carbon and fuel cell technologies are both based at Loughborough University. Private sector research and development organisations include PERA\u2014the technology based consultancy in Melton Mowbray, and MIRA\u2014the automotive research and development centre based on the outskirts of Hinckley. Automotive and aerospace engineers use the test facilities at Mallory Park, and Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome and proving ground. On 18 October 2007, the last airworthy Avro Vulcan was flown from Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome after 10 years of restoration there by aerospace engineers of the Vulcan Operating Company.\nFarming.\nLeicestershire has a long history of livestock farming which continues today. Robert Bakewell (1725\u20131795) of Dishley, near Loughborough, was a revolutionary in the field of selective breeding. Bakewell's Leicester Longwool sheep was much prized by farmers across the British Empire and is today a heritage breed admired. Commercial and rare breeds associated with the descendants of Bakewell's sheep include the English Leicester, Border Leicester, Bluefaced Leicester, Scotch mule and Welsh halfbred.\nThe Leicestershire County Show is held on the first Bank Holiday in May each year and includes animal showings, trade exhibitions and show jumping. Melton Mowbray Market is an important regional livestock market.\nField sports remain an important part of the rural economy of Leicestershire, with stables, kennels and gunsmiths based in the county.\nFood and drink.\nStilton and Red Leicester cheeses and the pork pie are the three most famous contributions to English cuisine from Leicestershire.\nLeicestershire food producers include Claybrooke mill, one of the very few commercially working watermills left in Britain producing a range of over 40 flours; meat from rare and minority breeds from Brockleby's Pies; and Christmas turkey and goose from Seldom Seen Farm. Two dairies produce Red Leicester cheese in the county: Long Clawson, who also produce blue stilton, and the Leicestershire Handmade Cheese Company.\nAll-natural non-alcoholic fruit cordials and pressed drinks are made by Belvoir Fruit Farms and sold in supermarkets across Britain. Swithland Spring Water is sourced from the Charnwood hills. Breweries in Leicestershire and Rutland are listed on the Leicester CAMRA website. The county's largest beer brewer is Everards, and there are several microbreweries.\nVarious markets are held across the county. Leicester Market, given its Market status in the 13th century, is said to be the largest outdoor covered marketplace in Europe and among the products on sale are fruit and vegetables sold by market stallholders, and fresh fish and meat in the Indoor Market.\nThe annual East Midlands Food &amp; Drink Festival held in Melton Mowbray had over 200 exhibitors and 20,000 visitors attending in 2007 making it the largest British regional food festival.\nFood processing in the city and county includes popular British fish and chip shop pie Pukka Pies who are based in Syston. Walkers Midshire Foods, part of the Samworth Brothers group, makes sausages and pies in its Beaumont Leys factories. Walkers Midshire Foods - Walkers Deli &amp; Sausage Co, part of Samworth Brothers is on the Cobden Street Industrial Estate in Belgrave. The Business specialises in the manufacturing of Premium Sliced Cooked Meats and Sausages as well as being the largest producer of Pate in the UK. Samworth Brothers has operations in Leicestershire and Cornwall (Ginsters), making a range of products from sandwiches to desserts for UK retailers under their brands as well the company's own portfolio of brands including Dickinson &amp; Morris, producers of pork pies and Melton Hunt Cake. Walkers crisps are made in Beaumont Leys using Lincolnshire potatoes. United Biscuits have their distribution centre in Ashby-de-la-Zouch as well as a snacks factory and they also have a biscuit factory in Wigston. The Masterfoods UK factory at Melton Mowbray produces petfood. Hand made chocolates are produced by Chocolate Perfection in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.\nSome 15 major Indian food manufacturers are based in Leicester including Sara Foods, Mayur Foods, Cofresh Snack Foods Ltd, Farsan, Apni Roti and Spice n Tice. The 'Mithai' Indian sweet market is catered for by award-winning Indian restaurants\u2014for instance, the vegetable samosas approved by the Vegetarian Society sold at The Sharmilee on Belgrave Road AKA the Golden Mile in the Belgrave area of Leicester. The growing market for Indian food has afforded new opportunities to long-standing local companies, for example the Long Clawson dairy, a co-operative manufacturer of Stilton (cheese) now also makes Paneer cheese used in the Indian dish Mattar Paneer.\nLeicestershire food exported abroad includes cheese from the Long Clawson dairy, which is sold in supermarkets in Canada and the United States via a network of distributors coordinated by Taunton-based company Somerdale. Belvoir Fruit Farms cordials and press\u00e9 drinks are sold on the United States east coast in Wegmans Food Markets, World Market, Harris Teeter, Dean &amp; DeLuca, and in specialised British food stores such as Myers of Keswick (New York City) and the British Pantry (near Washington, D.C.).\nClothing.\nLeicester and Leicestershire has had a traditional industry of knitwear, hosiery and footwear, and the sheep on the county's coat of arms is recognition of this. The local manufacturing industry, which began with hand knitting in the Middle Ages, and was fully industrialised by the end of the 19th century, survived until the end of the 20th century through retailers buying UK-sourced products, and government measures such as the protection of the Multi Fibre Arrangement which ended in 2004. Cheaper global competition, coupled with the 1999 slump in the UK fashion retail sector, led to the end of much of the cheaper clothing manufacturing industry. Today Leicestershire companies focus on high quality clothing and speciality textiles.\nOther local companies manufacture knitwear such as Commando Knitwear of Wigston, and others specialise in technical textiles for industrial or medical purposes. Clothing and fabric for the British Asian community is made here\u2014for example the shop Saree Mandir sells silk sarees and salwar suits for women whose design patterns closely follow contemporary Indian trends. The Knitting Industries' Federation continues to be based in Leicestershire. On the creative side the design centre for next is headquartered in Enderby, and the design centre for George Clothing (Asda/Walmart) is in Lutterworth. De Montfort University has, in the form of its Fashion and Contour Design course a leading design department for female underwear. It also has the only UK University courses in Footwear Design providing future designers for local shoemakers Shoefayre, Stead and Simpson, and Shoe Zone, who all have their headquarters in the county.\nBelgrave-based British United Shoe Machinery, part of a group which for most of the 20th century was the world's largest manufacturer of footwear machinery and materials, exporting shoe machinery to more than 50 countries. In the 1960s and 1970s it was Leicester's biggest employer, employing more than 4,500 locally and 9,500 worldwide. The company had \"a respected reputation for technical innovation and excellence\", between 1898 and 1960 it developed and marketed nearly 800 new and improved shoe machines and patented more than 9,000 inventions, at one time employing 5% of the UK\u2019s patent agents.\nAlso Belgrave-based Wolsey, a heritage British clothing brand founded in 1755, making it one of the oldest existing textile companies in the world.\nFred Perry also had a Factory in Belgrave.\nGola also originates from the county.\nHealthcare.\nUniversity Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust employs around 11,000 at its three hospitals in the city and county, the Glenfield, the General and the Royal Infirmary. Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust employs over 5,500 staff providing mental health, learning disability and community health services in the city and county. These services are commissioned by the three Clinical Commissioning Groups, led by local GPs.\nThe British Psychological Society, the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) based in Wigston, and the National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health (NEBOSH) have their head offices in Leicestershire.\nBiomedical industries.\nPharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical instrument manufacturing companies include 3M, Bridgehead International in Melton, Fisher Scientific in Loughborough, and Ashfield Healthcare in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.\nFreight and distribution.\nTransportation links are good. East Midlands Airport is south of Castle Donington, next to the M1 in north-west Leicestershire, and is the second largest freight airport in the United Kingdom after London Heathrow. DHL Aviation have a large purpose-built facility at EMA, and courier companies UPS and TNT also use the airport as a base. Lufthansa Cargo is also a regular user of East Midlands, and the airport is a primary hub for Royal Mail. The M1 is Leicestershire's other important transport hub. The start of the M6, and part of the A14 briefly intersect with the southern tip of Leicestershire. Many large retail companies have huge warehouses at the Magna Park complex near Lutterworth.

The non-metropolitan county is divided into seven districts ran by district councils: The seven district councils in Leicestershire are Blaby, Charnwood, Harborough, Hinckley &amp; Bosworth, Melton, North West Leicestershire and Oadby &amp; Wigston. It has been proposed by the Leicestershire County Council in 2018 to get rid of the district councils.\nLeicestershire County Council consists of 55 elected members, from 52 wards. The most recent election was the May 2017 elections, where all seats were up for re-election. Following these elections the current political composition of the council is 42 Conservatives, 9 Liberal Democrats and 4 Labour councillors.\nCounty Hall, in Glenfield, some north-west of central Leicester and a little over from Leicester railway station, is the seat of Leicestershire County Council and the headquarters of the county authority. Below the County Council, there are seven district councils, Blaby, Charnwood, Harborough, Hinckley and Bosworth, Melton, North West Leicestershire and Oadby and Wigston. The City of Leicester is a unitary authority which is separate from the county for local government, and provides all services in its area; the City Council meets at Leicester Town Hall.\nParliamentary constituencies.\nFollowing the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Leicestershire is represented by eleven members of parliament (MPs). Labour Party won three seats within the City of Leicester in 2019, but ended up losing two, Leicester East was won by Conservative and Leicester South was won by an Independent politician. Labour however gained two seats back in Leicestershire from the Conservatives in Loughborough and North West Leicestershire. The other six Leicestershire seats are represented by Conservative MPs.\nEducation.\nPublicly funded secondary schools in Leicestershire are comprehensive. The schools are segregated by age in some areas to ages 10\u201314 (middle schools), and 14\u201316 (upper schools) or 14\u201318 (upper schools which also provide sixth-form education). The schools, compared with other LEAs, have large numbers on the roll with school enrolment often 2,000 and more. For Melton and Blaby districts, although there is division by middle and upper schools, there is only one upper school in either district, giving no choice of school. However, many students of Lutterworth College in Harborough District actually hail from Blaby district.\nCharnwood has the largest school population\u2014four times the size of the Melton district. In 2007, the best-performing state school at GCSE was Beauchamp College in Oadby. No comprehensives in Leicestershire LEA were rated as poor performers, unlike in some neighbouring counties. In 2007, 7,800 pupils took GCSE exams.\nFor A-levels, the best comprehensive school in the county was the De Lisle College in Loughborough. The best schools overall at A-level were the two private single-sex schools in Loughborough\u2014Loughborough Grammar School and Loughborough High School.\nGCSE results by district council.\nPercentage of pupils gaining 5 grades A\u2013C in 2007 including English and Maths (46.8% was the England average compared to Leicestershire's 48.9%).\nIndependent schools.\nIndependent senior schools in Leicestershire include Leicester Grammar School (day, co-educational), Leicester High School for Girls (day, girls), Loughborough Grammar School (day and boarding, boys), Loughborough High School (day, girls), Ratcliffe College (day and boarding, co-educational), LGS Stoneygate (day, co-educational) and Dixie Grammar School (day, co-educational). \nLoughborough Amherst School (formerly Our Lady's Convent School) was a co-educational day and boarding school located in Loughborough. It closed at the end of the 2024\u201325 academic year, following financial hardship. \nFurther education.\nThere are four general further education colleges operating in Leicestershire; Leicester College, Loughborough College, South Leicestershire College and Stephenson College. All offer various vocational courses as well as apprenticeships and some academic courses.\nBrooksby Melton College provides apprenticeships and further education training courses in animal care, countryside, equine, fisheries and land-based service engineering, at their Brooksby campus.\nHigher education.\nLeicestershire has three universities, the University of Leicester, Loughborough University and De Montfort University.\nEducational associations.\nSeveral educational associations have their head offices in Leicestershire, including the Mathematical Association, the Association of School and College Leaders, the Association for College Management, the Girls Schools Association, the National Adult School Association, the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education and the Headmasters &amp; Headmistresses Conference.\nSporting associations.\nA number of UK sporting bodies have their head offices in Leicestershire, including the Institute of Sports &amp; Recreation Management, the Institute of Swimming, Volleyball England, the Great Britain Wheelchair Basketball Association, the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association, the British Judo Association, the British Parachute Association, the British Triathlon Federation, the Amateur Swimming Association, the British Gliding Association, the British Motorcycle Federation, the English Indoor Bowls Association, the Youth Sport Trust and the British Isles Bowls Council.\nMusic.\nThe full range of music is performed in the county, from early medieval, European and Asian classical music, folk, jazz, blues, rock and pop.

He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale d'Architecture in 1762 and became chief architect to Frederick II of Prussia, a largely honorary title. He designed a number of private houses from 1762 to 1778, though most of these no longer exist; notable survivors into the modern era include the H\u00f4tel de Brunoy (demolished in 1930) and the H\u00f4tel Alexandre, both in Paris. His work for Fran\u00e7ois Racine de Monville has apparently also vanished but his probable influence on Monville's own architectural works as seen at the D\u00e9sert de Retz speaks for itself. Together with Claude Nicolas Ledoux, he was one of the most influential figures of French neoclassical architecture.\nGeometric style.\nIt was as a teacher and theorist at the \u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es between 1778 and 1788 that Boull\u00e9e made his biggest impact, developing a distinctive abstract geometric style inspired by Classical forms. His work was characterised by the removal of all unnecessary ornamentation, inflating geometric forms to a huge scale and repeating elements such as columns in huge ranges.\nFor Boull\u00e9e regularity, symmetry and variety were the golden rules of architecture.\nCenotaph for Sir Isaac Newton.\nBoull\u00e9e promoted the idea of making architecture expressive of its purpose, a doctrine that his detractors termed \"architecture parlante\" (\"talking architecture\"), which was an essential element in Beaux-Arts architectural training in the later 19th century. His style was most notably exemplified in his proposal for a cenotaph (a funerary monument celebrating a figure interred elsewhere) for the English scientist Isaac Newton, who 50 years after his death became a symbol of Enlightenment ideas.\nThe building itself was a tall sphere, taller than the Great Pyramids of Giza, encompassed by two large barriers circled by hundreds of cypress trees. The massive, spherical shape of the building was inspired by Boull\u00e9e's own study called \"theory of bodies\" where he claims that the most beautiful and perfect natural body is the sphere, which is the most prominent element of the Newton Memorial. Though the structure was never built, Boull\u00e9e had many ink and wash drawings engraved and circulated widely within professional circles in 1784.\nThe small sarcophagus for Newton would have been placed at the lower pole of the sphere. The design of the memorial was intended to create the effect of day and night. The night effect would have occurred when the sarcophagus is illuminated by the sunlight coming through the holes in the vaulting, giving the illusion of stars in the night sky. The day effect would have been provided via an armillary sphere hanging in the center that gives off a mysterious glow. Thus, the use of light in the building's design would have caused the building's interior to change its appearance.\nSalon for the H\u00f4tel de Tourolles.\nThe boiseries, still often dated in the mid-1760s, were discussed in the issue of \"L'Avant-coureur\" for 21 January 1761, and so must have been carried out about 1758\u201359. The H\u00f4tel in the Marais district remodelled for Claude-Charles-Dominique Tourolle survives (the rue d'Orl\u00e9ans is now the rue Charlot) but the salon's \"boiseries\" and chimneypieces were removed in the mid-nineteenth century to a house in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 now in the possession of the Cercle Interalli\u00e9. Round-arched mirrors over the chimneypieces and centering the long wall in a shallow recess are disposed in a system of stop-fluted Ionic pilasters. White marble draped caryatid therm figures support the chimneypiece's \"tablette\". There is a full architrave under a dentilled cornice. The white-and-gold ensemble would still have been fully in style in 1790.\nH\u00f4tel Alexandre.\nThe H\u00f4tel Alexandre or H\u00f4tel Soult, rue de la Ville l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Paris (1763\u20131766), is the sole survivor of Boull\u00e9e's residential work in Paris. It was built for the financier Andr\u00e9-Claude-Nicolas Alexandre. In its \"cour d'honneur\" four Ionic columns embedded against a recess in the wall plane create an entry (now glazed). Flanking doors in the corners of the courtyard have isolated architraves embedded in the wall above their plain openings, while above oval bull's-eye windows are draped with the swags of husks that became a common feature of the neoclassical manner. The garden front has a colossal order of pilasters raised on the high basement occupied by the full height of the ground floor.\nLegacy.\nBoull\u00e9e's ideas had a major influence on his contemporaries, not least because of his role in teaching other important architects such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chalgrin, Alexandre-Th\u00e9odore Brongniart, and Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand. Some of his work only saw the light of day in the 20th century; his book \"Architecture, essai sur l'art\" (\"Essay on the Art of Architecture), arguing for an emotionally committed Neoclassicism, was only published in 1953. The volume contained his work from 1778 to 1788, which mostly comprised designs for public buildings on a wholly impractical grand scale.\nBoull\u00e9e's fondness for grandiose designs has caused him to be characterised as both a megalomaniac and a visionary. His focus on polarity (offsetting opposite design elements) and the use of light and shadow was highly innovative, and continues to influence architects to this day. He was \"rediscovered\" in the 20th century and has influenced recent architects such as Aldo Rossi.\nPeter Greenaway's film \"The Belly of an Architect\" (1987) concerns a fictitious architect who is staging an exhibition devoted to Boull\u00e9e's work. The film contains many visual references to Boull\u00e9e.\nWhat Dreams May Come (1998) features a Library inspired by Boull\u00e9e's 1785 \"Deuxieme Projet pour la Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi\"\nEthel Cain's song \"Etienne\", from the studio record \"Perverts\" (2025), is named after Boull\u00e9e. Cain has stated that the song \"was [her] ode to him\", paying tribute to his life and work.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61155", "revid": "46945329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61155", "title": "President of the Republic of China", "text": "Head of state of Taiwan\nThe president of the Republic of China, also known as the president of Taiwan, is the head of state of the Republic of China (Taiwan), as well as the commander-in-chief of the Republic of China Armed Forces. Before 1949 the position had the authority of ruling over Mainland China, but losing control of it after communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the remaining jurisdictions of the ROC have been limited to Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and smaller islands.\nOriginally elected by the National Assembly, the presidency was intended to be a ceremonial office with no real executive power because the ROC was originally envisioned as a parliamentary republic. Since the 1996 election however, the president has been directly elected by plurality voting to a four-year term, with incumbents limited to serving two terms. The current president is Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, preceded by Tsai Ing-wen from the same party.\nPowers.\nThe president is currently elected for a term of four years by a plurality voting direct election of areas administered by the Republic of China. Before 1991, the president was selected by the National Assembly of the Republic of China for a term of six years.\nThe Constitution of the Republic of China names the president as head of state and commander-in-chief of the Republic of China Armed Forces (formerly the National Revolutionary Army). The president is responsible for conducting foreign relations, such as concluding treaties, declaring war, and making peace. The president must promulgate all laws and has no right to veto, but can approve or decline a veto proposed by the Executive Yuan (Cabinet). Other powers of the president include granting amnesty, pardon or clemency, declaring martial law, and conferring honors and decorations.\nThe president may, by resolution of the Executive Yuan Council, issue emergency decrees and take all necessary measures to avert imminent danger affecting the security of the state or of the people or to cope with any serious financial or economic crisis. However, such decrees shall, within ten days of issuance, be presented to the Legislative Yuan for ratification. Should the Legislative Yuan withhold ratification, said emergency decrees are rendered invalid.\nThe president may, within ten days following passage by the Legislative Yuan of a no-confidence vote against the premier, dissolve the Legislative Yuan after consulting with its president. However, the president may not dissolve the Legislative Yuan while martial law or an emergency decree is in effect. Following a dissolution of the Legislative Yuan, an election for legislators must be held within 60 days.\nThe president can also appoint senior advisors (), national policy advisors () and strategy advisors (), but they do not form a council.\nThe Constitution does not clearly define whether the president is more powerful than the premier, as it names the Executive Yuan (headed by the premier) as the \"highest administrative authority\" with oversight over domestic matters, while giving the president powers as commander-in-chief of the military and authority over foreign affairs. Prior to his election as president in 1948, Chiang Kai-shek had insisted that he be premier under the new Constitution, while allowing the presidency (to which he nominated Hu Shih) be reduced to a figurehead role. However, the National Assembly overwhelmingly supported Chiang as president and once in this position, Chiang continued to exercise vast prerogatives as leader, and the premiership served to execute policy, not make it. Thus, until the 1980s, power in the Republic of China was personalized rather than institutionalized, which meant presidential power depended largely on who occupied the office. For example, Yen Chia-kan was a mostly ceremonial president, with real power in the hands of Premier Chiang Ching-Kuo, who carried said power with him to the office of president. After President Lee Teng-hui succeeded Chiang as president in 1988, the power struggle within the KMT extended to constitutional debate over the relationship between the president and the premier. The first three premiers under Lee (Yu Kuo-hwa, Lee Huan, and Hau Pei-tsun) were mainlanders who had initially opposed Lee's ascent to power. The appointments of Lee Huan and Hau were compromises by President Lee to placate KMT conservatives. The subsequent appointment of the first native Taiwanese premier, Lien Chan, was seen as Lee consolidating power. Moreover, during this time the power of the premier to approve the presidential appointments, and the power of the Legislative Yuan to confirm the president's choice of premier, were removed. This established the president as the more powerful official.\nAfter the 2000 election of Chen Shui-bian as president, the presidency and Legislative Yuan were controlled by different parties, which brought forth a number of latent constitutional issues, such as the role of the Legislative Yuan in appointing and dismissing a premier, the right of the president to call a special session of the Legislative Yuan, and exactly who has the power to call a referendum. Most of these issues have been resolved through inter-party negotiations.\nSuccession.\nThe Constitution of the Republic of China gives a short list of persons who will succeed to the presidency if the office were to fall vacant. According to the Additional Articles of the Constitution, Article 2:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Should the office of the vice president become vacant, the president shall nominate a candidate(s) within three months, and the Legislative Yuan shall elect a new vice president, who shall serve the remainder of the original term until its expiration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Should the offices of both the president and the vice president become vacant, the president of the Executive Yuan shall exercise the official powers of the president and the vice president. A new president and a new vice president shall be elected in accordance with Paragraph 1 of this article and shall serve out each respective original term until its expiration. The pertinent provisions of Article 49 of the Constitution shall not apply.\nAs no president of the Executive Yuan (also known as the premier) has ever succeeded to the presidency under these provisions (or their predecessors, under Article 49), it is untested whether, should the office of the premier be vacant as well, whether, pursuant to the Additional Articles, Article 3, the vice president of the Executive Yuan (vice premier), who would be acting premier, would act as president. There is currently no constitutional provision for a succession list beyond the possibility that the vice president of the Executive Yuan might succeed to the presidency.\nAssuming that the vice president of the Executive Yuan would be third in line for the presidency, the current line of succession is:\nPresidential succession has occurred three times under the 1947 Constitution:\nDiplomatic protocol.\nThe diplomatic protocol regarding the President of the ROC is rather complex because of the political status of Taiwan. In the nations that have diplomatic relations with the ROC, the president is accorded the standard treatment that is given to a head of state. In other nations, the president is formally a private citizen, although even in these cases, travel usually meets with strong objections from the People's Republic of China.\nThe president of ROC has traveled several times to the United States, formally in transit to and from Central America, where a number of countries do recognize the ROC. This system allows the president to visit the United States without the US State Department having to issue a visa. During these trips, the president is not formally treated as a head of state, does not meet US government officials in their official capacities, and does not visit Washington, D.C. However, in these visits, the ROC president invariably meets with staff members from the US government, although these visits are with lower-ranking officials in non-governmental surroundings.\nIn the area of Southeast Asia, the ROC president was able to arrange visits in the early 1990s which were formally private tourist visits. However, these have become increasingly infrequent as a result of PRC pressure.\nAt the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit, the ROC president is forbidden from attending personally, and must send a special envoy to represent them at the event.\nHowever, on 2 December 2016, US President-elect Donald Trump accepted a congratulatory telephone call from the ROC president, a clear break from prior protocol.\nThe Government of the People's Republic of China and its media uses the terms Leader of the Taiwan Area, Leader of the Taiwan Region () and Leader of the Taiwanese Authorities () to describe Taiwan's head of state. These terms are used by the media in the People's Republic of China (PRC) to reflect the PRC's official stance of not recognizing the legitimacy of Taiwan as a country, or of Two Chinas. If the official title cannot be avoided in a news article, quotation marks would be used around terms for all official ROC positions and organizations.\nSecretary-general to the president.\nThe secretary-general to the president is the highest-ranking official in the Office of the President and supervises the staff of the office. The current secretary-general is Pan Men-an.\nSymbols.\nThe president's podium bears the symbol of a golden plum blossom surrounded by wreath laurel on front side. \nThe presidential standard, officially called the Commander-in-Chief Standard of the Republic of China, is the symbol of the President as head the Republic of China Armed Forces. The Standard is a rectangular, red field with a thin, yellow border. In the center of the red field is the national emblem of the Republic of China. The Standard is flown from the Presidential Office, as well as other buildings for the president\u2019s use; facilities for presidential visits; transportation vehicles when used by the president; and in other ceremonial contexts. The Standard was designed by Chiang Kai-shek in 1928, based on the flag of Whampoa Military Academy, which was in turn designed by Ho Ying-chin in 1924, and revised in 1988.\nThe Presidential Seal is square, and its inscription is written in seal script (). It is written vertically in two columns, with the right-hand line containing the characters (\"Z\u01d2ngt\u01d2ng\"), and the left-hand line containing the characters (\"Zh\u012by\u00ecn\").\nHistory.\nTaiwan was previously led by the emperor of Japan during colonial rule by Japan from 1895 to 1945, represented by the governor-general of Taiwan.\nAfter the outbreak of the Wuchang Uprising against Qing rule in 1911, the revolutionaries elected Sun Yat-sen as the \"provisional president\" () of the transitional government, with the Republic of China officially established on 1 January 1912. But Sun soon resigned from the provisional presidency in favor of Yuan Shikai, who assumed the title \"Great President\" () in March 1912. Yuan induced the Last Emperor to abdicate, ending thousands of years of imperial rule in China. The 1913 Constitution called for a strong presidential system with notable checks on the president by the National Assembly. However, Yuan soon began to assert dictatorial power, ignoring the National Assembly and later abolishing it altogether. In 1915, Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China in a largely unpopular move and was forced to retract his declaration shortly before his death in 1916.\nWith Yuan Shikai's death the Warlord Era began. Vice President Li Yuanhong succeeded Yuan as president and attempted to reassert the constitutional government, but was soon forced to resign by military strongmen. The presidency, though leading an internationally recognized government, was thereafter to be headed by a series of prominent warlords. This presidency ended in 1928 when the Northern Expedition, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), succeeded in conquering North China.\nSun Yat-sen established a rival (military, not constitutional) government in Guangzhou in 1917 and took the title of \"Generalissimo of the Military Government\" (). He was ousted in 1918 but returned again to Guangzhou in 1921. Claiming to restore the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, he summoned the members of the original parliament to elect him as president, but since there lacked a quorum, he took the title of \"Extraordinary President\" (). Sun, again expelled from Guangzhou in 1922, returned in 1923 to take the title of \"Generalissimo of the Military Government.\" Sun died in 1925 with no clear successor and leadership of the government, now named the National Government, rested in a series of Leninist-style dual party and state committees, the most powerful of which was the policy-making Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. The government was organized into five branches, with the Executive Yuan, headed by the premier, holding primary administrative authority. The \"Chairman of the National Government\", though not given specific presidential powers, took on the functions of a \"de facto\" head of state and its official English translation was \"President of the National Government of the Republic of China\". This form of government under the KMT lasted through the Northern Expedition, which moved the capital to Nanjing and gave the National Government domestic control and foreign recognition, and the Second Sino-Japanese War, during which the Japanese established a puppet \"Reorganized\" National Government with almost the identical organizational structure, until the promulgation of a new Constitution in 1947.\nFollowing the Chinese victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the National Government under Chiang Kai-shek was restored in Nanjing and the KMT set out to enact a liberal democratic constitution in line with the last stage of Sun Yat-sen's three stages of national development. The new Constitution of the Republic of China, promulgated on 25 December 1947, established a five-branch government with the office of president () as head of state. On 20 May 1948, Chiang Kai-shek was formally elected by the National Assembly to be the first term president.\nAfter the KMT lost mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, the government was evacuated to Taiwan, where the term limits for the president specified in the 1947 constitution were suspended after 1960. In 1954, as the term of the first National Assembly were about to expire, the Judicial Yuan ruled that the expired seats of the National Assembly would continue in power until the respective delegate region elections could be held. This largely froze the membership of the National Assembly mainland delegates and prevented local Taiwanese from widespread legislative and assembly participation in the expired mainland seats until the early 1970s. The members of the National Assembly continued in their office until 1991, and continued to elect Chiang Kai-shek as president until his death in 1975.\nPresidents were elected by the National Assembly until the first direct presidential election in 1996, while the term length was shortened from six to four years.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the eldest and only biological son of President Chiang Kai-shek, he held numerous posts in the government of the Republic of China and ended martial law in 1987. He served as the third premier of the Republic of China between 1972 and 1978 and was the third president of the Republic of China from 1978 until his death in 1988.\nBorn in Fenghua, Ching-kuo was sent as a teenager to study in the Soviet Union during the First United Front in 1925, when his father's Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party were in alliance. Before his education in the USSR, he attended school in Shanghai and Beijing, where he became interested in socialism and communism. He attended university in the USSR and spoke Russian fluently, but when the Chinese Nationalists violently broke with the Communists, Joseph Stalin sent him to work in a steel factory in the Ural Mountains. There, Chiang met and married Faina Vakhreva. With war between China and Japan imminent in 1937, Stalin sent the couple to China. During the war, Ching-kuo's father gradually came to trust him, and gave him more and more responsibilities, including administration.\nAfter the Japanese surrender, Ching-kuo was tasked with and effectively reduced corruption in Shanghai. The victory of the Communists in 1949 drove the Chiang family and their Kuomintang government to retreat to Taiwan. Ching-kuo was first given control of the secret police, a position he retained until 1965 and in which he used arbitrary arrests and torture to ensure tight control as part of the White Terror. He then became Minister of Defense (1965\u20131969), Vice-Premier (1969\u20131972) and Premier (1972\u20131978). After his father's death in 1975, he took leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT) as chairman, and was elected president in 1978 and again in 1984.\nUnder his tenure as president, the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan, while remaining authoritarian, became more open and tolerant of political dissent. Chiang courted Taiwanese voters, and reduced the preference for those who came from the mainland after World War II. Toward the end of his life, Chiang decided to relax government controls on the media and speech, and allowed Han Chinese born in Taiwan into positions of power, including his eventual successor Lee Teng-hui. Chiang was credited for his Soviet-inspired city planning policies, economic development with Ten Major Construction Projects in Taiwan, efforts to clamp down on corruption, as well as the democratic transition of Taiwan and gradually shifting away from the authoritarian dictatorial rule of his own father Chiang Kai-shek.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nThe son of Chiang Kai-shek and his first wife, Mao Fumei, Chiang Ching-kuo was born in Fenghua, Zhejiang, with the courtesy name of Ji\u00e0nf\u0113ng (). He had an adopted brother, Chiang Wei-kuo. \"Ching\" literally means \"longitude\", while \"kuo\" means \"nation\"; in his brother's name, \"wei\" literally means \"parallel (of latitude)\". The names are inspired by the references in Chinese classics such as the \"Guoyu\", in which \"to draw the longitudes and latitudes of the world\" is used as a metaphor for a person with great abilities, especially in managing a country.\nWhile the young Chiang Ching-kuo had a good relationship with his mother and grandmother (who were deeply rooted to their Buddhist faith), his relationship with his father was strict, utilitarian and often rocky. Chiang Kai-shek appeared to his son as an authoritarian figure, sometimes indifferent to his problems. Even in personal letters between the two, Chiang Kai-shek would sternly order his son to improve his Chinese calligraphy. From 1916 until 1919 Chiang Ching-kuo attended the \"Grammar School\" in \"Wushan Temple\" an important temple in Xikou Town. Then, in 1920, his father hired tutors to teach him the Four Books, the central texts of Confucianism. On 4 June 1921, Ching-kuo's grandmother died. What might have been an immense emotional loss was compensated for when Chiang Kai-shek moved the family to Shanghai. Chiang Ching-kuo's stepmother, historically known as the Chiang family's \"Shanghai Mother\", went with them. During this period Chiang Kai-shek concluded that Chiang Ching-kuo was a son to be taught, while Chiang Wei-kuo was a son to be loved.\nDuring his time in Shanghai, Chiang Ching-kuo was supervised by his father and made to write a weekly letter of 200\u2013300 Chinese characters. Chiang Kai-shek also underlined the importance of classical books and of learning English, two areas he was hardly proficient in himself. On 20 March 1924, Chiang Ching-kuo was able to present to his now-nationally famous father a proposal concerning the grass-roots organization of the rural population in Xikou. Chiang Ching-kuo planned to provide free education to allow people to read and to write at least 1000 characters. In his own words:\nI have a suggestion to make about the Wushan School, although I do not know if you can agree to it. My suggestion is that the school establish a night school for common people who cannot afford to go to the regular school. My school established a night school with great success. I can tell you something about the night school:\nName: Wuschua School for the Common People\nTuition fee: Free of charge with stationery supplied\nClass hours: 7\u00a0pm to 9\u00a0pm\nAge limit: 14 or older\nSchooling protocol: 16 or 20 weeks.\nAt the time of the graduation, the trainees will be able to write simple letters and keep simple accounts. They will be issued a diploma if they pass the examinations. The textbooks they used were published by the Commercial Press and were entitled \"One thousand characters for the common people.\" I do not know whether you will accept my suggestion. If a night school is established at Wushan, it will greatly benefit the local people.\nIn early 1925, Chiang entered Shanghai's Pudong College, but Chiang Kai-shek decided to send him on to Beijing because of warlord action and spontaneous student protests in Shanghai. In Beijing, he attended the school organized by a friend of his father, Wu Zhihui, a renowned scholar and linguist. The school combined classical and modern approaches to education. While there, Ching-kuo started to identify himself as a \"progressive revolutionary\" and participated in the flourishing social scene inside the young Communist community. The idea of studying in Moscow now seized his imagination. Within the help program provided by the Soviet Union to the countries of East Asia there was a training school that later became the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. The participants to the university were selected by the CPSU and KMT members, with a participation of CPC Central Committee.\nChiang Ching-kuo asked Wu Zhihui to name him as a KMT candidate. Wu did not try to dissuade him, even though Wu was a key figure of the right-leaning and anti-Communist \"Western Hills Group\" of the KMT. In the summer of 1925, Chiang Ching-kuo traveled south to Whampoa Military Academy to discuss his plans for study in Moscow with his father. Chiang Kai-shek was not keen, but after a discussion with Chen Guofu he finally agreed. In a 1996 interview, Ch'en's brother, Chen Li-fu, recalled that Chiang Kai-shek accepted the plan because of the need to have Soviet support at a time when his hold over the KMT was tenuous.\nMoscow.\nWith or without his father's enthusiastic approval, Chiang Ching-kuo went on to Moscow in late 1925. He stayed in the Soviet Union for nearly twelve years. While there, Chiang was given the Russian name Nikolai Vladimirovich Elizarov (\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0415\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432) and put under the tutelage of Karl Radek at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. Noted for having an exceptional grasp of international politics, his classmates included other children of influential Chinese families, most notably the future Chinese Communist party leader, Deng Xiaoping. Chiang Ching-kuo joined the Communist Youth League under Deng. Soon Ching-kuo was an enthusiastic student of Communist ideology, particularly Trotskyism; though following the Great Purge, Joseph Stalin privately met with him and ordered him to publicly denounce Trotskyism. Chiang even applied to be a member of the All-Union Communist Party, although his request was denied.\nIn April 1927, however, Chiang Kai-shek purged KMT leftists, had Communists arrested or killed, and expelled his Soviet advisers. Chiang Ching-kuo responded from Moscow with an editorial that harshly criticized his father's actions but was nonetheless detained as a \"guest\" of the Soviet Union, a practical hostage. The historiographic debate still continues as to whether he was forced to write the editorial, but he had seen Trotskyist friends arrested and killed by the Soviet secret police. The Soviet government sent him to work in the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, a steel factory in the Urals, Yekaterinburg (then Sverdlovsk), where he met Faina Ipat'evna Vakhreva, a native Belarusian. They married on 15 March 1935, and she would later take the Chinese name Chiang Fang-liang. In December of that year, their son, Hsiao-wen was born.\nChiang Kai-shek refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for a Chinese Communist Party leader. He wrote in his diary, \"It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.\" In 1937, he maintained that \"I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation's interests\", since he had no intention of stopping the war against the Communists.\nReturn to China and WWII.\nStalin allowed Chiang Ching-kuo to return to China with his Belarusian wife and son in April 1937 after living in the USSR for 12 years.\nBy then, the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) under Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists under Mao Zedong had signed a ceasefire to create the Second United Front and fight the Japanese invasion of China, which began in July 1937. Stalin hoped the Chinese would keep Japan from invading the Soviet Pacific coast, and he hoped to form an anti-Japanese alliance with the senior Chiang.\nOn Ching-kuo's return, his father assigned a tutor, Hsu Dau-lin, to assist with his readjustment to China. Chiang Ching-kuo was appointed as a specialist in remote districts of Jiangxi where he was credited with training of cadres and fighting corruption, opium consumption, and illiteracy. Chiang Ching-kuo was appointed as commissioner of Gannan Prefecture () between 1939 and 1945; there he banned smoking, gambling and prostitution, studied governmental management, allowed for economic expansion and a change in social outlook. His efforts were hailed as a miracle in the political war in China, then coined as the \"Gannan New Deal\" (). During his time in Gannan, from 1940 he implemented a \"public information desk\" where ordinary people could visit him if they had problems, and according to records, Chiang Ching-kuo received a total of 1,023 people during such sessions in 1942.\nIn regard to the ban on prostitution and closing of brothels, Chiang implemented a policy where former prostitutes became employed in factories. Due to the large number of refugees in Ganzhou as a result from the ongoing war, thousands of orphans lived on the street; in June 1942, Chiang Ching-kuo formally established the Chinese Children's Village () in the outskirts of Ganzhou, with facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital and gymnasium. During the last years of the 1930s, he met Wang Sheng, with whom he would remain close for the next 50 years.\nThe paramilitary \"Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps\" was under Chiang's control. Chiang used the term \"big bourgeoisie\", in a disparaging manner to call H.H. Kung and T. V. Soong.\nWhile in mainland China, Chiang and his wife had a daughter, Hsiao-chang, born in Nanchang (1938), and two more sons, Hsiao-wu, born in Chongqing (1945), and Hsiao-yung, born in Shanghai (1948).\nRelationship with Chang Ya-juo and her death.\nChiang met Chang Ya-juo when she was working at a training camp for enlistees and he was serving as the head of Gannan Prefecture during the war. The two had a relationship that brought twin sons: Chang Hsiao-tz'u and Chang Hsiao-yen, born in 1942. In August 1942, Chang felt sick at a dinner party, and died the next day in a Guilin hospital. The circumstances of her death raised speculation that it was murder. Over the years, many of her relatives, including her sons and highly ranked ex-security personnel, insisted that KMT's security apparatus orchestrated her murder to keep a lid on CCK's marital affair, and to protect CCK's political career.\nHostage claim.\nJung Chang and Jon Halliday claim Chiang Kai-shek allowed the Communists to escape on the 1934\u20131935 Long March because he wanted Stalin to return Chiang Ching-kuo. This is contradicted by Chiang Kai-shek's diary, \"It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.\" He refused to negotiate for a prisoner swap of his son in exchange for the Chinese Communist Party leader (Zhou Enlai). Again in 1937 he stated about his son: \"I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation's interests.\" Chiang had absolutely no intention of stopping the war against the Communists. Chang and Halliday likewise claim that Chiang Ching-kuo was \"kidnapped\" in spite of the evidence that he went to study in the Soviet Union with his father's own approval.\nEconomic policies in Shanghai.\nAfter the Second Sino-Japanese War and during the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Ching-kuo briefly served as a liaison administrator in Shanghai, trying to eradicate the corruption and hyperinflation that plagued the city. He was determined to do this because of the fears arising from the Nationalists' increasing lack of popularity during the Civil War. Given the task of arresting dishonest businessmen who hoarded supplies for profit during the inflationary spiral, he attempted to assuage the business community by explaining that his team would only go after big war profiteers.\nChiang Ching-kuo copied Soviet methods, which he learned during his stay in the Soviet Union, to start a social revolution by attacking middle class merchants. He also enforced low prices on all goods to raise support from the Proletariat.\nChiang Ching-kuo used his own agents to make arrests in Shanghai, rather than the Shanghai city police.178 Chiang Ching-kuo relied on two relatively new organizations which answered directly to him.178 He used the Sixth Battalion of the Bandit-Suppression National-Reconstruction Corps to search warehouses for hoarded goods and to place secret report boxes in the city where people could anonymously report violators. He also used the Shanghai Youth Service Corps for enforcement.179\nAs riots broke out and savings were ruined, bankrupting shopowners, Chiang Ching-kuo began to attack the wealthy, seizing assets and placing them under arrest. The son of the gangster Du Yuesheng was arrested by him.\nChing-kuo ordered KMT agents to raid the Yangtze Development Corporation's warehouses, which was privately owned by H.H. Kung and his family, as the company was accused of hoarding supplies. H.H. Kung's wife was Soong Ai-ling, the sister of Soong Mei-ling who was Chiang Ching-kuo's stepmother.\nChiang Ching-kuo had H.H. Kung's son son David Kung and several employees of the Yangtze Development Corporation arrested on allegations of holding foreign exchange.181 Soong Mei-ling called Chiang Kai-shek to complain and also called Chiang Ching-Kuo directly. David Kung was eventually freed after negotiations, and Chiang Ching-kuo resigned, ending the terror on the Shanghainese merchants.\nThe major impact of Chiang Ching-kuo's campaign was to cause the flight of prominent capitalists from Shanghai to Hong Kong and elsewhere.183 The failure of the campaign also affected Ching-kuo's political influence and reputation temporarily.\nPolitical career in Taiwan.\nAfter the Nationalists lost control of mainland China to the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Ching-kuo followed his father and the retreating Nationalist forces to Taiwan. On 8 December 1949, the Nationalist capital was moved from Chengdu to Taipei, and early on 10 December 1949, Communist troops laid siege to Chengdu, the last KMT-controlled city on mainland China. Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo directed the city's defense from the Chengdu Central Military Academy, before the aircraft \"May-ling\" evacuated them to Taiwan; they would never return to mainland China.\nIn 1950, Chiang's father appointed him director of the secret police, which he remained until 1965. An enemy of the Chiang family, Wu Kuo-chen, was kicked out of his position of governor of Taiwan by Chiang Ching-kuo and fled to America in 1953. Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated Soviet-style military organization in the Republic of China Military, reorganizing and Sovietizing the political officer corps, surveillance, and KMT party activities were propagated throughout the military. Opposed to this was Sun Li-jen, who was educated at the American Virginia Military Institute.\nChiang orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General Sun Li-jen in August 1955, allegedly for plotting a coup d'\u00e9tat with the American CIA against his father. General Sun was a popular Chinese war hero from the Burma Campaign against the Japanese and remained under house arrest until Chiang Ching-kuo's death in 1988. Ching-kuo also approved the arbitrary arrest and torture of prisoners.\nFrom 1955 to 1960, Chiang administered the construction and completion of Taiwan's highway system. Chiang's father elevated him to high office when he was appointed as the ROC Defense Minister from 1965 until 1969. He was the nation's Vice Premier between 1969 and 1972. Afterwards he was appointed the nation's Premier between 1972 and 1978.\nIn 1970, Chiang was the target of an assassination attempt in New York City by Peter Huang.27\nAs Premier Chiang organized a people's diplomacy campaign in the United States in an effort to mobilize American political sentiment in opposition to the PRC through mass demonstrations and petitions.42 Among these efforts, the KMT worked with the John Birch Society to launch a petition writing campaign through which Americans were urged to write their local government officials and ask them to \"Cut the Red China connection.\"42\nAs Chiang Kai-shek entered his final years, he gradually gave more responsibilities to his son, and when he died in April 1975, Vice President Yen Chia-kan became president for the balance of Chiang Kai-shek's term, while Chiang Ching-kuo succeeded to the leadership of the KMT (he opted for the title \"Chairman\" rather than the elder Chiang's title of \"Director-General\").\nLeadership.\nChiang Ching-kuo was elected president of the ROC in the 1978 Taiwanese presidential election by the Eternal Parliament on 20 May 1978. He was reelected to another term in the 1984 Taiwanese presidential election. At that time, the National Assembly consisted mostly of \"ten thousand year\" legislators, men who had been elected in 1947\u201348 before the fall of mainland China and who would hold their seats indefinitely. Starting from the 1970s when his father grew sick, Chiang became the de facto leader of the regime and reformed many of his father's autocratic policies and gradually phased out of the white terror by allowing the freedom of peaceful assemblies and political pluralism of the Tangwai movement, which later became the DPP. Chiang also turned down many of the suggestions of the conservatives in the KMT regime to violently suppress the protesters.\nIn a move he launched the \"Ten Major Construction Projects\" and the \"Twelve New Development Projects\" which contributed to the \"Taiwan Miracle\". Among his accomplishments was accelerating the process of economic modernization to give Taiwan a 13% growth rate, $4,600 per capita income, and the world's second largest foreign exchange reserves. On 16 December 1978, U.S. president Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would no longer recognize the ROC as the legitimate government of China. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States would continue to sell weapons to Taiwan, but the TRA was purposely vague in any promise of defending Taiwan in the event of an invasion.\nChiang Ching-kuo also enacted major labor rights reforms throughout the 1970s and the 1980s that addressed child labor, women's employment, working time, pensions, paid leave, employment contract with several legislations such as the \"Labor Safety and Hygiene Law\" in 1974 and the \"Factory Law\" in 1975. The average salary of Taiwanese workers tripled under his rule. Chiang Ching-kuo also loosened the harsh anti-strike laws and union busting practice, thus giving the labor movement more opportunity to bargain for fairer wages as he lifted the martial law provisions.\nIn an effort to bring more Taiwan-born citizens into government services, Chiang Ching-kuo \"exiled\" his over-ambitious chief of General Political Warfare Department, General Wang Sheng, to Paraguay as an ambassador (November 1983), and hand-picked Lee Teng-hui as vice-president of the ROC (formally elected May 1984), first-in-the-line of succession to the presidency. Chiang emphatically declared that his successor would not be from the Chiang family in a Constitution Day speech on 25 December 1985:\nChiang Wei-kuo, Chiang's younger brother, would later repudiate the declaration in 1990 after he was selected as a vice-presidential candidate.\nOn 15 July 1987, Chiang finally ended martial law and allowed his family to visit the mainland. The ban on tourism to Hong Kong and Macau was also lifted. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls and opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish political criticism papers.\nWhen the Democratic Progressive Party was established on 28 September 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders, but its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the Tangwai movement.\nChiang Ching-kuo also increased the political representation of Taiwanese people to certain degree under his rule, allowing them to have various positions, which paved the way for Lee Teng-hui to come to power and further democratize Taiwan.\nDeath and legacy.\nChiang Ching-kuo died at Taipei Veterans General Hospital on 13 January 1988, aged 77, from a heart attack. He used a wheelchair during the last months of his life, and also had diabetes, alongside vision and heart problems. He was interred temporarily in Daxi Township, Taoyuan County (now Daxi District, Taoyuan City), but in a separate mausoleum in Touliao, a mile down the road from his father's burial place. The hope was to have both buried at their birthplace in Fenghua once mainland China was recovered. Composer Hwang Yau-tai wrote the Chiang Ching-kuo Memorial Song in 1988.\nIn January 2004, Chiang Fang-liang asked that both father and son be buried at Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery in Hsichih, Taipei County (now New Taipei City). The state funeral ceremony was initially planned for Spring 2005, but was eventually delayed to winter 2005. It may be further delayed due to the recent death of Chiang Ching-kuo's oldest daughter-in-law, who had served as the de facto head of the household since Chiang Fang-liang's death in 2004. Chiang Fang-liang and Soong Mei-ling had agreed in 1997 that the former leaders be first buried, but still be moved to mainland China.\nMurray A. Rubinstein called Chiang Ching-kuo more of a civilian leader than his father, whom Rubenstein refers to as a \"quasi-warlord.\"\nJay Taylor has described Chiang Ching-kuo as a figure who was ideologically inspired by a mix of Soviet communism, Chinese nationalism, Taiwanese localism, and American democracy, who became the helmsman of the democratization of Taiwan.\nUnlike his highly controversial father, Chiang Ching-kuo's reputation is overwhelmingly positive among the Taiwanese population as the people of Taiwan recognize his economic and social achievements, as well as his efforts of democratization. 38.7% of the population considers him the best president who contributed the most to Taiwan, and he was rated 84.8/100 by the Taiwanese population.\nMemorials.\nRepublic of China Air Force.\nThe AIDC, the ROC's air defense company, has nicknamed its AIDC F-CK Indigenous Defense Fighter the \"Ching Kuo\" in his memory.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his signature songs, including \"Livin' In The Sunlight\", \"Valentine\", \"Louise\", \"Mimi\", and \"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\", and for his films, including \"The Love Parade\", \"The Big Pond\", \"The Smiling Lieutenant\", \"One Hour with You\", and \"Love Me Tonight\". His trademark attire was a boater hat and tuxedo.\nChevalier was born in Paris. He made his name as a star of musical comedy, appearing in public as a singer and dancer at an early age before working in menial jobs as a teenager. In 1909, he became the partner of the biggest female star in France at the time, Fr\u00e9hel. Although their relationship was brief, she secured him his first major engagement, as a mimic and a singer in \"l'Alcazar\" in Marseille, for which he received critical acclaim by French theatre critics. In 1917, he discovered jazz and ragtime and went to London, where he found new success at the Palace Theatre.\nAfter this, he toured the United States, where he met the American composers George Gershwin and Irving Berlin and brought the operetta \"D\u00e9d\u00e9\" to Broadway in 1922. He developed an interest in acting and had success in \"D\u00e9d\u00e9\". When talkies arrived, he went to Hollywood in 1928, where he played his first American role in \"Innocents of Paris\". In 1930, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in \"The Love Parade\" (1929) and \"The Big Pond\" (1930), which secured his first big American hits, \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" and \"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight\".\nIn 1957, he appeared in \"Love in the Afteroon\", which was his first Hollywood film in more than 20 years. In 1958, he starred with Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan in \"Gigi\". In the early 1960s, he made eight films, including \"Can-Can\" in 1960 and 'Fanny' the following year. In 1970, he made his final contribution to the film industry where he sang the title song of the Disney film \"The Aristocats\". He died in Paris, on 1 January 1972, from complications of a suicide attempt.\nEarly life.\nChevalier was born on 12 September 1888 in Paris to Victor Charles Chevalier (1854\u20131916), a French house painter, and Jos\u00e9phine (\"n\u00e9e\" Van Den Bossche, 1852\u20131929) a lace-maker of Belgian (Flemish) descent. He had two brothers, Charles (1877\u20131938) and Paul (1884\u20131969). Victor, an alcoholic, deserted the family in 1896, leaving Jos\u00e9phine to feed and take care of the children on her own; forced to work much longer hours, she was hospitalized for overwork in 1898. Charles, the eldest, took over some responsibilities but was married in 1900, leaving his mother to take care of Maurice and Paul on her own.\nPaul was forced to find work, and eventually secured a job at a metal-engraving factory; the brothers became very close with their mother during this time, nicknaming her \"La Louque\", after whom Maurice would later name his Marnes-la-Coquette estate. Determined to be an acrobat, Maurice left school aged ten but was convinced to abandon this after a severe injury. He tried a number of other jobs: a carpenter's apprentice, an electrician, a printer, and even as a doll painter. Chevalier was eventually able to hold down a job at a mattress factory, and became interested in performing; while daydreaming his finger was crushed in a machine and he was forced to stop working.\nWhile recovering, in 1900, he offered his services as a performer to the skeptical owner of a nearby caf\u00e9. Chevalier performed his first song there, \"V'la Les Croquants\", although his performance was met with laughter as he had sung three octaves too high. Discouraged, Maurice returned home, where his mother and brother Paul encouraged him to continue practicing. He continued singing, unpaid, at the caf\u00e9 until a member of the theatre saw him and suggested he try for a local musical. Chevalier got the part, and began to make a name as a mimic and a singer. His act in l'Alcazar in Marseille was so successful, on his return to Paris he was met by an admiring crowd.\nIn 1909, he became the partner of the biggest female star in France, Fr\u00e9hel. However, due to her alcoholism and drug addiction, their liaison ended in 1911. Chevalier later said that he became addicted to cocaine during this time, a habit that he was able to quit because he had no access to the drug as a prisoner of war in World War I. After splitting with Fr\u00e9hel, he then started a relationship with 36-year-old Mistinguett at the Folies Berg\u00e8re, where he was her younger dance partner; they eventually played out a public romance.\nWorld War I.\nWhen World War I began, Chevalier was in the middle of his national service, already in the front line, where he was wounded by shrapnel in the back in the first weeks of combat and was taken as a prisoner of war in Germany for two years, where he learned English. In 1916, he was released through the secret intervention of Mistinguett's admirer, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, the only king of a neutral country who was related to both the British and German royal families.\nIn 1917, Chevalier became a star in le Casino de Paris and played before British soldiers and Americans. He discovered jazz and ragtime and started thinking about touring the United States. In the prison camp, he had studied English and had an advantage over other French artists. He went to London, where he found new success at the Palace Theatre, even though he still sang in French.\nParis and Hollywood.\nAfter the war, Chevalier went back to Paris and created several songs still known today, such as \"Valentine\" (1924). He played in a few pictures, including Chaplin's \"A Woman of Paris\" (1923), a rare drama for Chaplin, in which his character of The Tramp does not appear, and made an impression in the operetta \"D\u00e9d\u00e9\". He met the American composers George Gershwin and Irving Berlin and brought \"D\u00e9d\u00e9\" to Broadway in 1922. The same year he met Yvonne Vall\u00e9e, a young dancer, who became his wife in 1927.\nWhen Douglas Fairbanks was on honeymoon in Paris in 1920, he offered him star billing with his new wife Mary Pickford, but Chevalier doubted his own talent for silent movies (his previous ones had largely failed). When sound arrived, he made his Hollywood debut in 1928. He signed a contract with Paramount Pictures and played his first American role in \"Innocents of Paris\". In 1930, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in \"The Love Parade\" (1929) and \"The Big Pond\" (1930). \"The Big Pond\" gave Chevalier his first big American hit songs: \"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight\" with words and music by Al Lewis and Al Sherman, plus \"A New Kind of Love\" (or \"The Nightingales\"). He collaborated with film director Ernst Lubitsch. He appeared in Paramount's all-star revue film \"Paramount on Parade\" (1930).\nWhile Chevalier was under contract with Paramount, his name was so recognized that his passport was featured in the Marx Brothers film \"Monkey Business\" (1931). In this sequence, each brother uses Chevalier's passport, and tries to sneak off the ocean liner where they were stowaways by claiming to be the singer\u2014with unique renditions of \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" with its line \"If the nightingales could sing like you\". In 1931, Chevalier starred in a musical called \"The Smiling Lieutenant\" with Claudette Colbert and Miriam Hopkins. Despite the disdain audiences held for musicals in 1931, it proved a successful film.\nIn 1932, he starred with Jeanette MacDonald in Paramount's film musical \"One Hour With You\", which became a success and one of the films instrumental in making musicals popular again. Due to its popularity, Paramount starred Maurice Chevalier in another musical called \"Love Me Tonight\" (also 1932), and again co-starring Jeanette MacDonald. It is about a tailor who falls in love with a princess when he goes to a castle to collect a debt and is mistaken for a baron. Featuring songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, it was directed by Rouben Mamoulian, who, with the help of the songwriters, was able to put into the score his ideas of the integrated musical (a musical which blends songs and dialogue so the songs advance the plot). It is considered one of the greatest film musicals of all time.\nIn 1934, he starred in the first sound film of the Franz Leh\u00e1r operetta \"The Merry Widow\", one of his best-known films, though he felt his role was too narrow and repetitive. He then signed with MGM for \"The Man from the Folies Berg\u00e8re\", his own favourite of his films. After a disagreement over his star-billing, he returned to France in 1935 to resume his music-hall career.\nEven when he was the highest-paid star in Hollywood, Chevalier had a reputation as a penny-pincher. He later admitted that he was hesitant to spend money on things such as changing the blade of his razor as he had grown up in poverty, remarking that \"poverty is a disease that can never be cured.\" When not playing around with young chorus-girls, he actually felt quite lonely, and sought the company of Adolphe Menjou and Charles Boyer, also French, but both much better educated than Chevalier. Boyer in particular introduced him to art galleries and good literature, and Chevalier would try to copy him as the man of taste. But at other times, he would 'revert to type' as the bitter and impoverished street-kid he was at heart. When performing in English, he always put on a heavy French accent, although his normal spoken English was quite fluent and sounded more American.\nIn 1937, Chevalier married the dancer Nita Raya. He had several successes, such as his revue \"Paris en Joie\" in the Casino de Paris. A year later, he performed in \"Amours de Paris\". His songs remained big hits, such as \"Prosper\" (1935), \"Ma Pomme\" (1936) and \"\u00c7a fait d'excellents fran\u00e7ais\" (1939).\nWorld War II.\nChevalier continued performing for as long as he could freely, retreating to the free zone in the south of France with his Jewish wife and her parents as well as some friends following the 1940 invasion by German troops. During this time, patriotic songs such as \"\u00c7a sent si bon la France\" and \"Paris sera Toujours Paris\" became popular, and he held charity balls and performed to raise money for resistance efforts. Chevalier consistently refused to perform for the Vichy France collaborators, and feigned illness, but eventually, out of fear for the safety of his wife and her parents, he reluctantly agreed to a deal. He refused to perform on the collaborating station Radio Paris, but agreed to perform for prisoners of war at the very camp in which he had been incarcerated during World War I. The performance was given in exchange for the release of ten French prisoners.\nIn 1942, Chevalier was named on a list of French collaborators with Germany to be killed during the war, or tried after it. That year he moved to La Bocca, near Cannes, but returned to the capital city in September. In 1944 when Allied forces freed France, Chevalier was accused of collaboration. The 28 August 1944, issue of \"Stars and Stripes\", the daily newspaper of U.S. armed forces in the European Theater of Operations, reported in error that \"Maurice Chevalier Slain By Maquis, Patriots Say\". Even though he was acquitted by a French convened court, the English-speaking press remained hostile and he was refused a visa for several years. In a review of the 1969 Oscar-nominated documentary film about French collaboration \"Le chagrin et la piti\u00e9\" (\"The Sorrow and the Pity\"), Simon Heffer draws attention to \"a clip of Maurice Chevalier explaining, entirely dishonestly, to an anglophone audience how he had not collaborated.\"\nIn his own country, however, he was still popular. In 1946, he split from Nita Raya and, at the age of 58, began writing his memoirs, which took many years to complete.\nHe started to collect art and paint, and acted in \"Le silence est d'or (Man About Town)\" (1946) by Ren\u00e9 Clair. He toured throughout the United States and other parts of the world, then returned to France in 1948.\nIn 1944, he had participated in a Communist demonstration in Paris. He was therefore even less popular in the U.S. during the McCarthyism period; in 1951, he was refused re-entry into the U.S. because he had signed the Stockholm Appeal.\nIn 1949, he performed in Stockholm in a Communist benefit against nuclear arms. Also in 1949, Chevalier was the subject of the first official roast at the New York Friars' Club, although celebrities had been informally \"roasted\" at banquets since 1910.\nIn 1952, he bought a large property in Marnes-la-Coquette, near Paris, and named it La Louque, as a homage to his mother's nickname. He started a relationship in 1952 with Janie Michels, a young divorcee with three children.\nIn 1954, after the McCarthy era abated, Chevalier was welcomed back in the United States. His first full American tour was in 1955, with Vic Schoen as arranger and musical director. The Billy Wilder film \"Love in the Afternoon\" (1957) with Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper, was his first Hollywood film in more than 20 years.\nIn 1957, Chevalier was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.\nChevalier appeared in the movie musical \"Gigi\" (1958) with Leslie Caron and Hermione Gingold, with whom he shared the song \"I Remember It Well\", and several Walt Disney films. The success of \"Gigi\" prompted Hollywood to give him an Academy Honorary Award that year for achievements in entertainment. In 1957, he appeared as himself in an episode of \"The Jack Benny Program\" titled \"Jack in Paris\". He also appeared as himself in an episode of \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\", titled \"Lucy Goes to Mexico\".\nFinal years.\nIn the early 1960s, he toured the United States and between 1960 and 1963 made eight films, including \"Can-Can\" (1960) with Frank Sinatra. In 1961, he starred in the drama \"Fanny\" with Leslie Caron and Charles Boyer, an updated version of Marcel Pagnol's \"Marseilles Trilogy\". In 1962, he filmed \"Panic Button\" (not released until 1964), playing opposite Jayne Mansfield. In 1965, at age 77, he made another world tour. In 1967 he toured in Latin America, again, the US, Europe and Canada, where he appeared as a special guest at Expo 67. The following year, on 1 October 1968, he announced his farewell tour.\nHistorical newsreel footage of Chevalier appeared in the 1969 Marcel Oph\u00fcls documentary \"The Sorrow and the Pity\". In a wartime short film near the end of the film's second part, he explained his disappearance during World War II, as rumors of his death lingered at that time, and he emphatically denied any collaboration with the Nazis. His theme song, \"Sweepin' the Clouds Away\", from the film \"Paramount on Parade\" (1930), was one of the film's theme songs and was played in the end credits of the second part.\nIn 1970, two years after his retirement, songwriters Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman convinced him to sing the title song of the Disney film \"The Aristocats\", which ended up being his final contribution to the film industry.\nDeath and burial.\nChevalier suffered from bouts of depression throughout his adult life. On 7 March 1971, he attempted suicide by overdosing on barbiturates. Rushed to the hospital, Chevalier was saved but suffered liver and kidney damage as a result of the drug. In the following months, he suffered memory lapses, chronic tiredness, and spent much of his time alone. On 12 December, he fell ill and was taken to Paris's Necker Hospital and placed on dialysis. By 30 December, doctors announced his kidneys were no longer responding to dialysis. Too frail for a transplant, he underwent surgery as a last-ditch effort to save his life. It was unsuccessful; Chevalier died from a cardiac arrest following kidney surgery on New Year's Day 1972, aged 83.\nHe is interred in the cemetery of Marnes-la-Coquette in Hauts-de-Seine, outside Paris, France, with his mother, \"La Louque\".\nChevalier has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1651 Vine Street.\nAuthor Michael Freedland said in his 1981 biography of Chevalier that the actor Felix Paquet, who became close to Chevalier during the 1960s, cut off contact with all of his friends and family in hopes of securing access to his fortune. Freedland alleges that Paquet, eighteen years Chevalier's junior, intercepted mail and withheld information about Maurice's health in the months before his death.\nNotable songs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSelected filmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It depicts the real-life romance between poets Elizabeth Barrett (Norma Shearer) and Robert Browning (Fredric March), despite the opposition of her abusive father Edward Moulton-Barrett (Charles Laughton). The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Shearer was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. It was written by Ernest Vajda, Claudine West, and Donald Ogden Stewart, from the successful 1930 play \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" by Rudolf Besier, and starring Katharine Cornell.\nIn 1957, Franklin directed a color remake in CinemaScope and Metrocolor starring Jennifer Jones, John Gielgud, and Bill Travers.\nPlot.\nIn her bedroom where she has been sequestered for years, Elizabeth (\"Ba\") (Norma Shearer), the eldest Barrett daughter, consults with her doctor. She is recovering from an illness and is weak, but the doctor advises that a full recovery is possible.\nShe has a vivacious and brilliant mind, her poetry is frequently published, and she loves fooling around with her siblings, especially her youngest sister, Henrietta (Maureen O'Sullivan). Her stern father Edward (Charles Laughton), however, wastes no opportunity to remind Elizabeth that she is near death. Henrietta is interested in marrying her brothers' friend Surtees (Ralph Forbes), but she cannot see any way around her insanely possessive father, who has forbidden his children to marry.\nRobert Browning (Fredric March), who has been corresponding with Elizabeth for some time, arrives in person and sweeps her off her feet. Months pass, and with a new lease on life, Elizabeth is able to walk. Edward insists she is still very sick, and when the doctors prescribe a trip to Italy, Edward forbids it. Exasperated, Robert makes his feelings towards Edward plain to Elizabeth, and they declare their love for each other.\nOne day, the Barretts' cousin Bella (Marion Clayton) reveals that Elizabeth's relationship with Robert is romantic. Edward arranges a scheme to get Elizabeth away from Robert by selling the house and moving the family to Surrey, six miles from the nearest railway station.\nUnexpectedly, Edward returns from London and catches Henrietta and Surtees modeling his dress uniform for Elizabeth. He forces Henrietta to confess her secret affair. Denouncing her as a whore, he makes her swear never to see Surtees again and to lock herself in her room.\nBa conspires with her maid Wilson to let Robert know she will elope with him and Wilson is coming along. Edward opens up to Ba and confesses the motivation for his behavior. He apparently thinks of himself as having a sex addiction and now suppresses his desires, equating sex with sin, and he wants his children never to fall prey to carnal passion. As he goes into detail about how he wants Ba all to himself, he embraces her and comes close to making a sexual pass. Horrified, Ba repulses him. He apologizes and leaves, saying he'll pray for her. Ba soon departs with her dog Flush. The film closes with a brief scene of Elizabeth's and Robert's marriage, with Wilson as a witness and Flush waiting patiently by the church door.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Norma Shearer as Elizabeth Barrett\nDepiction of events.\nThe numerous love letters that Robert and Elizabeth exchanged before their marriage give readers a great deal of information about this famous courtship in their own words. The correspondence was well underway before they ever met in person, he having admired the collection \"Poems\" that she published in 1844. He opens his first letter to her, \"I love your verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett\", and a little later in that first letter he says \"I do, as I say, love these books with all my heart\u2014and I love you too\" (January 10, 1845). Several editions of these letters have been published, the first being one compiled by their son in 1898. \"\", the version by Virginia Woolf, from the perspective of Elizabeth's dog, is also an imaginative reconstruction, though more closely based on reading the letters.\nBoth the play and film reflect popular concerns at the time, particularly Freudian analysis. Although Edward Barrett's behavior in disinheriting any of the children who married seems bizarre, there appears to be no evidence of his being sexually aggressive toward any of the family members.\nFor the screenplay, all overt suggestions of incest were removed from Besier's original play, but Charles Laughton, who played Edward, assured producer Irving Thalberg, \"They can't censor the gleam in my eye.\"\nReception.\nAndre Sennwald of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"a drama of beauty, dignity and nobility\", praising Shearer's performance as \"a brave and touching piece of acting\" and Laughton as \"superb.\" \"Variety\" called it \"truly an actor's picture\" with a \"final stretch that grips and holds\", but that overall it was \"slow\" and \"talky\" and suggested its running time could have been shortened. \"Film Daily\" lauded it as \"Unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever filmed\", with \"a superb performance\" by Shearer and one of Laughton's \"most dominating performances.\" \"I found myself pleasantly surprised by the performances of Miss Shearer and Mr. March\", wrote St. Clair McKelway for \"The New Yorker\". Although McKelway found it \"hard to accept Miss Shearer in her role\", he called it \"sensibly handled from beginning to end, and every now and then Mr. Laughton creates moments as effective, I think, as any you have seen on the screen.\" \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" topped the \"Film Daily\" year-end poll of 424 critics as the best film of 1934.\nThe film was considered a success at the box office. According to MGM records it earned theater rentals of $1,258,000 in the US and Canada and $1,085,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $668,000. Its unexpected success in rural U.S. markets, despite its upper-class themes, was mentioned in the 1935 \"Variety\" article famously headlined \"Sticks Nix Hick Pix\".\nAdaptations.\nIn 1957, Sidney Franklin filmed a word-for-word, and nearly shot-for-shot Metrocolor remake, of \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\", in CinemaScope. This version starred Jennifer Jones as Elizabeth, John Gielgud as her father, Bill Travers as Robert Browning, and Keith Baxter in his film debut.\nBoth of the films were released by MGM.\nIt was also adapted in the Hindi language as the Indian film \"Aaj Aur Kal\" (1963).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Established amidst the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, its primary task was initially to provide the military command structure to the peacekeeping forces in the Middle East to enable the peacekeepers to observe and maintain the ceasefire, and in assisting the parties to the Armistice Agreements in the supervision of the application and observance of the terms of those Agreements. The organization's structure and role has evolved over time as a result of the various conflicts in the region and at times UNTSO personnel have been used to rapidly deploy to other areas of the Middle East in support of other United Nations operations. The command structure of the UNTSO was maintained to cover the later peacekeeping organisations of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to which UNTSO continues to provide military observers.\nBackground.\nOn 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 on \"the future constitution and government of Palestine\" setting forth a \"Plan of Partition with Economic Union\". The result of the vote was 33 in favour, 13 against and 10 abstentions. The report consisted of four parts: future constitution and government of Palestine; boundaries; city of Jerusalem; and capitulations. It called for the creation of Arab and Jewish states no later than 1 October 1948, with Jerusalem as \"corpus separatum\" under an international regime to be administered by the U.N. with the Trusteeship Council being the designated body in this regard. The plan also included steps to be taken prior to independence, including the issues of citizenship, transit, economic union between the two states, access to holy places and religious and minority rights. Resolution 181 (II) also established the United Nations Palestine Commission to carry out the plan. The Trusteeship Council was to administer Palestine for ten years.\nAs the civil war in Palestine began to escalate the Security Council voted on and adopted Resolution 42 (1948) of 5 March 1948, appealing to all governments and peoples, particularly in and around Palestine, to take all possible action to prevent or reduce such disorders as were occurring in Palestine. The Trusteeship Council decided on 10 March 1948 in resolution 32 (II) \"that the statute on Jerusalem was in satisfactory form and agrees that the question of its formal approval, together with the appointment of a governor of the city, shall be taken up at a subsequent meeting to be held not later than one week before 29 April 1948\", the deadline given to the council by the assembly. On 21 April 1948, the Trusteeship Council transmitted the Resolution along with the draft statute to the General Assembly.\nThe situation in Palestine was becoming even more chaotic when the Security Council met on 1 April 1948 it adopted Resolution 43 (1948), calling for an \"immediate truce be effected in Palestine\" and for \"the Jewish Agency for Palestine and the Arab Higher Committee to make representatives available to the Security Council for the purpose of arranging a truce between the Arab and Jewish communities of Palestine; and emphasizes the heavy responsibility which would fall upon any party failing to observe such a truce\". The Security Council adopted Resolution 44 (1948), invoking Article 20 of the U.N. Charter on 1 April 1948 where the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to convoke a special session of the General Assembly to consider further the future of the government of Palestine.\nBy 17 April 1948, the situation in Palestine had deteriorated further and the Security Council adopted Resolution 46 (1948), calling upon all persons and organizations in Palestine to immediately cease all military activities, as well as acts of violence, terrorism and sabotage; to refrain from any actions endangering the safety of the Holy Places in Palestine and refrain from importing or acquiring or assisting or encouraging the importation or acquisition of weapons and war materials (arms embargo). It also requested the government of the U.K., as the Mandatory Power, to supervise the execution of those measures and to keep the Security Council and the General Assembly informed on the situation in Palestine.\nThe General Assembly then convened for its second special session between 16 April to 14 May 1948, during which it considered a working paper submitted by the United States (U.S.) on the question of the \"Trusteeship of Palestine\", which was opposed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) as well as the Jewish Agency. The assembly adopted resolution 185 (S-2) of 26 April 1948, asking the Trusteeship Council to study measures for the protection of Jerusalem, its inhabitants and to submit proposals to the General Assembly.\nOn 14 May 1948, the assembly adopted Resolution 186 (S-2), which affirmed its support for the efforts of the Security Council to secure a truce in Palestine. The assembly also decided to appoint a U.N. Mediator to Palestine and specified the functions of the mediator, relieving the Palestine Commission from further \"exercise of responsibilities\" under resolution 181 (II). Bernadotte was appointed Mediator. After receiving proposals from the Trusteeship Council, the assembly adopted Resolution 187 (S-2), recommending to the Mandatory Power the appointment of a Special Municipal Commissioner for Jerusalem.\nThe Jewish state of Israel was proclaimed on 14 May 1948, taking effect at midnight that day, as the British mandate expired the following day. The U.S. had proposed the establishment of a trusteeship for Palestine; nevertheless, the U.S. government recognized the Jewish state as did the U.S.S.R. The 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War broke out shortly afterwards when Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt invaded the newly proclaimed state.\nHistory.\nAccording to the United Nations, \"following the wars of 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, [UNTSO's] functions...[have evolved]... in the light of changing circumstances, but they [have] remained in the area, acting as go-betweens for the hostile parties and as the means by which isolated incidents could be contained and prevented from escalating into major conflicts.\"\nEstablishment.\nIn response to a request from Count Folke Bernadotte, the Swedish United Nations Mediator for Palestine, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, sent 50 members of the United Nations guard force from Lake Success to assist the mediator in supervising the truce in the former British Mandate of Palestine in 1948. The first peacekeeping operation was established by the United Nations. All the members of the party were experienced international civil servants with a background of service with the United Nations Secretariat at Headquarters. While on duty in Palestine, they were to continue to wear United Nations guard uniforms. United Nations military observers (UNMOs) remain in the Middle East to monitor ceasefires, supervise armistice agreements, prevent isolated incidents from escalating and assist other UN peacekeeping operations in the region. This resolution formed the basis for the establishment of the first UN peacekeeping operation which became known as the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). \nPrior to this, in November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed a plan for the partition of the then British Mandate of Palestine, providing for the creation of an Arab State and a Jewish State, with Jerusalem to be placed in Trusteeship with international status. The plan was not accepted by the Palestinian Arabs and Arab States and only partially accepted by the Jewish Agency. On 14 May 1948, the United Kingdom relinquished its mandate over Palestine and the State of Israel was proclaimed. The following day, the Arab States invaded.\nThe General Assembly adopted Resolution 186 (S-2) on 14 May 1948. This affirmed its support for the efforts of the Security Council to secure a truce in Palestine, and it decided to appoint a UN Mediator. Bernadotte was appointed was sent to Palestine. On 22 May 1948, the Security Council adopted Resolution 49 (1948), calling for an abstention from any hostile military action in Palestine. The resolution also called upon the parties to facilitate the task of the UN Mediator. On 22 May 1948, Thomas C. Wasson, the US Consul and a member of the UN Truce Commission, was assassinated in Jerusalem.\nOn 29 May 1948, UN Security Council Resolution 50 (1948), called for a cessation of hostilities in Palestine and decided that the truce should be supervised by the Bernadotte with the assistance of a group of military observers. The first group of military observers, which later became known as UNTSO, arrived in the region in June 1948, when the Security Council threatened Chapter VII intervention. To enforce the first of two truces, lasting four weeks, the United Nations then established an observer formation, with members drawn from Belgium, France, and the United States. On 6 July the UN observers had their first casualty with the death of the French Observer Commandant Rene de Labarriere, who was wounded near the Afoula area and later died in the Jewish Hospital at Afoula. He was wounded while investigating an alleged violation of the truce provisions by Jewish forces.\nThe mediator was instructed on 29 May 1948 to create a one-month truce in Palestine. The mediator concept was teamed with the Truce Commission for supervisory over-watch of the Truce Plan. The month-long truce went into effect on 11 June 1948. On the same day, the first group of 36 observers arrived via Cairo, Egypt, and continued to arrive for the next three days. The first truce did not last long due to widespread violence. As a result, the observers were withdrawn on 9 July 1948. The second truce, indefinite in length, was called by the United Nations Security Council on 15 July 1948. This declaration was to be put into effect on 18 July 1948. It was from Security Council Resolution 54 that the mediator was instructed to supervise the observance of the truce and to establish procedures for examining alleged breaches of the truce since 11 June 1948, and authorized the mediator to deal with breaches so far as it was within the capacity of the mediator to do so by appropriate local action. The Security Council Resolution 54 also requested the mediator to keep the Security Council informed concerning the operation of the truce and, where necessary, to take appropriate action. During the autumn of 1948, UNTSO was re-established with an increase in size to supervise the Second Truce. The first group of observers to serve in Palestine under the UN Mediator, Bernadotte, arrived in Rhodes on 20 July. It included 41 Americans and about 25 Belgians and were deployed on 21 July 1948. The initial group was quickly expanded to 93 in total because of the large area that had to be covered. As the number of personnel grew, the United Nations Secretariat (of Personnel) supported the creation of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), the same organization UN military observers are assigned to today. Initially, the command was headed by a Chief-of-Staff (a general officer from one of the participating countries) in accordance with the personal direction of the mediator (a civilian).\nOn 17 September 1948, UN Mediator Count Folke Bernadotte, and Colonel Andr\u00e9 Serot, while on an official tour of duty to Jerusalem, were murdered \"in cold blood... in the Katamon quarter of Jerusalem by Jewish assailants.\" After the assassination, the talks between the warring parties began under the supervision of Acting Mediator Ralph Bunche. Bunche, Chief of the UN Mission in Palestine, in his letter to the Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Shertok wrote that the incident was \"an outrage against the international community and an unspeakable violation of elementary morality. His [Bernadotte's] safety, therefore, and that of his Lieutenants under the ordinary rules of law and order was a responsibility of the Provisional government of Israel whose armed forces and representatives control and administer the area. The act constitutes a breach of the truce of the utmost gravity for which the Provisional Government of Israel must assume full responsibility.\" The Provisional Government of Israel did not submit the report to the Security Council or to the Acting Mediator regarding the progress of the investigation into the assassination of Count Bernadotte.\nThe General Armistice Agreements (GAAs) came out of the mediator-chaired talks. On 11 August 1949, it was decided by the Security Council that the mediator's function had been completed and that the role in observing the ceasefire should be passed to the Chief of Staff of the UNTSO. In 1949, UNTSO military observers remained to supervise the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbours, which were for many years the main basis of the uneasy truce in the whole area. UNTSO's activities have been and still are spread over territory within five States, and therefore it has relations with five host countries \u2013 Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syrian Arab Republic. Since then, UNTSO has also supervised the General Armistice Agreements of 1949 and the observation of the ceasefire in the Suez Canal area following the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the Golan Heights following the Six-Day War of June 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of 1973.\n1949 to 1956.\nThe period from August 1949 to June 1956 was initially chaotic but quickly settled into a routine of complaints on the Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian and Lebanese fronts. It was initially possible for the UN personnel to deal with complaints of violations of the \"truce\" at the local commander level. As time progressed there arose a culture of claim and counter claim by the participating parties and regardless of the work and intent of UNTSO the intensity of the violent incidents increased. The GAAs had been hastily prepared in anticipation of an early peace along the lines of the 1947 Partition Plan and the primary concern was an end to the bloodshed at the earliest opportunity. As a result, the armistice lines had laid out temporary boundaries without thought to existing village boundaries or water rights. The armistice agreements were of a purely military character, intended to provide a transitional stage between the truce and a final peace. They constituted, in effect, non-aggression agreements of unlimited duration, but they contained in themselves no provision for establishing normal relations between the neighbouring countries. The armistice lines did not follow the fighting lines in all cases especially the Syrian Armistice line. In the case of the Egyptian Armistice line Israel forces carried on with a push south arriving at Umm Rashrash (Eilat) in March after the Egyptian-Israel GAA of 24 February 1949. This caused friction on setting the \"truce lines\". The contribution toward the foundation of a peaceful existence by the Mixed Armistice Commissions (MACs) was limited by the sanctions that the MACs were able to apply (a formal condemnation by the Security Council). For approximately 18 years (from 1949 until after the 1967 war), lack of harmony within the MACs was typical of the relationship existing between the countries. With the exception of the Israeli-Lebanon MAC, strife and discord became common.\nThe MACs were very different from one another, bringing about four unique peacekeeping missions under the head of the UNTSO. Disputes on the Israel/Syria Mixed Armistice Commission (ISMAC) centred on the most precious Middle Eastern commodity: water and sovereignty of the DMZ. Contentious issues in the HKJIMAC principally concerned the divided city of Jerusalem, the Israeli Mount Scopus enclave, the Latrun salient (sovereignty of the DMZ), Arab infiltration across the armistice demarcation line and large scale Israeli military incursions into Jordanian territory. The troubles were followed by infiltration from displaced Arabs, followed by raids of reprisal and intimidation by the Israelis, which heightened tensions around the borders. The infiltration by Palestinians initially consisted of unarmed groups crossing to regain possessions, harvest their crops or visit relatives, but later infiltrations included armed individuals and then later developed into small retaliatory raids.\nIsraeli infiltration into Jordanian territory at this time included retaliatory raids by military units at Qibya and Nahhalin. Israel's frustration with the UN and the other parties led to their withdrawal from ISMAC in 1951 and HKJIMAC in 1954. The functioning of the Israel-Lebanon MAC remained smooth due to the more relaxed attitude of the Israeli patrols towards returnees and infiltrators. Disputes with Egypt, who banned Israel-bound shipping from the Suez Canal and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, pertained to the al-Auja DMZ. By 1955, Egypt's sponsorship of Palestinian fedayeen (self-sacrificer) raids caused Israel to cease attending the Egyptian MAC and to step up raids into the Gaza Strip and Sinai, which resulted in Egypt arming the fedayeen. From 21 September 1955, the Egypt/Israel demilitarized zone was occupied by Israel armed forces. In response, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and the Chief of Staff UNTSO attempted to secure the implementation of a plan for withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and the removal of Egyptian forces from prohibited positions. Articles VII and VIII of the Egypt-Israel GAA established a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) centred on El-Auja and forbade the presence of armed forces. It also prohibited Egypt from maintaining positions in an adjoining area west of the demilitarized zone, and limited the arms and troops in the Defensive Areas on both sides of the Line. Both Egypt and Israel had indicated to the Secretary-General their willingness to comply fully with these two articles, within the framework of a return to full compliance with the Armistice Agreement. The Israeli Government gave assurances of its complete acceptance in principle of the plan. The agreed withdrawal, however, never took place. The 1956 invasion of Egypt by British, French and Israeli forces, followed Egypt's decision on 26 July 1956 to nationalize the Suez Canal.\nSuez Crisis to Six Day War.\nAfter the 1956 War (often referred to as the Suez Crisis), UNTSO greatly assisted the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF); in large measure the result of diplomatic efforts of the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and a proposal from Canadian minister of external affairs Lester Pearson, by providing a group of trained military personnel for peacekeeping and emergency operations to UNEF.\nIsrael, after the 1956 war, subsequently ceased all cooperation/participation in its Israeli-Egyptian MAC. On 8 November, the Israeli representative informed the Secretary-General that his Government would withdraw its forces from Egypt immediately after the conclusion of satisfactory arrangements with the United Nations in connection with the Emergency International Force. As a result, according to the United Nations, arrangements were made through which, \"without any change of the legal structure or status of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, the functions of UNTSO in the Gaza area were placed under the operational control of UNEF\". A close co-operation between UNTSO and UNEF was to be maintained.\nThe General Assembly, on 19 January 1957, noted \"with regret and concern the failure of Israel to withdraw from Egyptian territory\". Later, on 2 February 1957, the council deplored the\" non-compliance of Israel with regard to completion of its withdrawal and called upon Israel to complete its withdrawal without delay\". On 6 March 1957, General Burns was able to report to the Secretary-General of the UN that the \"United Nations Emergency Force troops are now in position in all camps and centres of population in Gaza Strip\". The staged withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, with the exception of an Israel troop unit at Rafah camp, at 0400 GMT on 7 March 1957 was carried out according to plan and without incidents. By agreement, that last Israel element was withdrawn by 1600 GMT on 8 March and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Sharm al Shaikh area was effected at the same time. In the following years, the Israel-Egypt MAC remained inactive, with only Egyptians and UN personnel taking part. \nIn this period, the Lebanese sector was relatively calm compared to subsequent events in that area. The Israel-Lebanon MAC met regularly and had developed a routine for handling incidents that occurred. In the Jordanian and Syrian sectors were the scene of frequent and often serious incidents and both the Israel-Jordan and the Israel-Syria MAC's were quite active in pursuance of their mandate in responding to issues, with several incidents evolving regarding land use around Jerusalem and in the Hula area, and the movement of supply convoys to the Israeli enclave at Mount Scopus. During one of these incidents around Mount Scopus, a military observer, Canadian Lieutenant Colonel George Flint, was killed.\nIn response to Israeli activities in the DMZ between the armistice demarcation lines in the Government House area in Jerusalem, Jordan complained to UN. This resulted in the Security Council adopting Resolution 127 (1958) on 22 January 1958, noting that the status of the zone is affected by the provisions of the Israel-Jordan GAAs and that neither Israel nor Jordan enjoys sovereignty over any part of the zone and directing the Chief of Staff of UNTSO in Palestine to regulate activities in the zone. \nIn June 1958, UNTSO personnel were used to quickly raise the United Nations Observation Group in Lebanon, a short lived mission that was sent to Lebanon over the period June \u2013 December 1958 during the 1958 Lebanon crisis.\nOn 17 March 1961, the Israelis undertook a dress rehearsal for a military parade in the Israeli-occupied part of the Jerusalem, in which heavy military armaments were displayed. In response, Jordan complained to the MAC. On 20 March 1961, the Mixed Armistice Commission decided that \"this act by Israel is a breach of the General Armistice Agreement\". The MAC also condemned the parade and called upon the Israeli authorities to take the strongest measures to prevent a recurrence of such a breach of the GAA and to refrain in the future from bringing to Jerusalem any equipment that was in excess of that allowed for under the terms of the GAA. The Israeli authorities still contemplated holding the full dress military parade on 20 April 1961 in the Israeli-occupied part of Jerusalem. The Security Council, on 11 April 1961, adopted Resolution 162 (1961); this endorsed the 20 March 1961 decision of the MAC; relating to the military parade contemplated for 20 April 1961 in the Israel-occupied part of Jerusalem, and urged Israel to comply with the decision of the MAC made on 20 March 1961.\nThe Israel-Syria Armistice Agreement provided for a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in the Hula Lake area at the foot of the Golan Heights, a zone which encompassed the area of Palestine as defined in the League of Nations Mandate occupied by Syrian forces at the time of the armistice. Civilian construction and land use in the DMZ caused numerous incidents around this time due to disputes over land ownership even though UNTSO was tasked with attempting to regulate activities leading to such disputes in the zone. After heavy fighting broke out between Israel and Syria in the DMZ, the Security Council in Resolutions 92 (1951) and 93 (1951) of 8 and 18 May 1951 called upon the parties to cease fighting and endorsed the request of the Chief of Staff of UNTSO that the Israeli company involved be instructed to cease all operations in the DMZ until such time as an agreement is arranged through the Chairman of the MAC for continuing its project. In Resolution 111 (1956) of 19 January 1956, the Security Council dealt with the confrontation which had escalated following interference by the Syrian authorities with legitimate Israeli activities on Lake Tiberias. It condemned as \"in no way justified\" the Israeli action taken in response to that interference in the form of an attack by Israeli regular army forces against Syrian regular army forces on Syrian territory. It also noted that in violation of the provisions of the General Armistice Agreement concerning the DMZ, the Zone had been crossed by the Israeli forces that entered Syria.\nFollowing a prolonged military confrontation between the parties, the Security Council was again involved in the Israel \u2013 Syria situation in 1962 in the light of a report by the Chief of Staff of UNTSO on the military activities in the Lake Tiberias area and in the DMZ. The council in Resolution 171 (1962) of 9 April 1962 noted with satisfaction that a cease fire had been achieved. It deplored the hostile exchanges which had taken place and called upon the governments concerned to comply with the General Armistice Agreement. It determined that an Israeli attack on 16\u201317 March had been a flagrant violation of the previous resolution (111), and called on Israel scrupulously to refrain from such action in the future. It also called upon both parties to abide scrupulously by the cease fire arranged by the Chief of Staff of UNTSO, and called specifically for strict observance of the article of the GAA which provides for the exclusion of armed forces from the demilitarized zone, and of the annex to the GAA which sets limits on forces in the defensive area.\nOn 7 June 1967, during the Six Day War, Comdt Thomas Wickham of the Irish Defense Forces was shot dead in Syria.\nSix Day War to Yom Kippur War (1967 to 1973).\nThe period between the Six-Day War of June 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, UNTSO performed a vital function of helping to establish and supervise ceasefire agreements which included new boundaries between the countries. Even though there was no change to UNTSO's mission, the execution of its original mission became nearly impossible with the advent of the newly drawn ceasefire lines between Israel and Egypt-Jordan-Syria respectively.\nAdditionally, UNTSO did not have the MACs to supervise since Israel abrogated its initial agreement to the Armistice as conceived. Realizing the changing political situation, the UN Security Council added some new tasks to the UNTSO Charter on the first few months following the 1967 ceasefire. Specifically, in the Egypt-Israel and Israel-Syria fronts, UNTSO established observation posts (OPs): a total of 15 were established along the Suez, while 16 were established in the Golan Heights. These posts remained in effect until the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. The UN offices established in Amman and Gaza (before the 1967 War) were allowed to continue to function as Liaison Offices, even though the MAC concept had become defunct.\nAt the urging of the Lebanese government, UNTSO created an observation operation along the Lebanese border (1949 Armistice Demarcation line) in the spring of 1972. Due to the Palestinian activity in South Lebanon and the potential Israeli reprisal against their encampments, UNTSO felt the potential for further conflict warranted the additional OPs. At this time, posts were established at El Khiam, Maroun Er Ras, and at Naquora.\nYom Kippur to the Israel\u2013Lebanon War.\nAs a result of the Yom Kippur War, the positions occupied by the UN military observers in the Middle East were drastically affected. A total of eight OPs were abandoned at this time; however, most OPs are still located in the same place today. In the Egyptian-Israeli sector, UNTSO personnel were structured around the Observer \"Group\" concept and placed under the UN Peace-Keeping Forces that occupied the region. Observer Group Sinai was formed and attached to the Second United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF II). The Charter for UNEF II expired on 24 July 1979 which only left UNTSO's presence. The observers were then restructured on new OPs which were located on vantage points throughout the Sinai peninsula. For the Sinai Group, their main office was located in Cairo (in 1993 it was moved to Ismailia, closer to the OPs). On the Israeli-Syria border, UNTSO's ceasefire observation and supervision mission continued but with a readjusted ceasefire line. Observer Groups Damascus and Golan (Syrian sector) were established as a result of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF).\nShortly after the 1973 war, U.S. participation in UNTSO expanded to twenty-five officers. The U.S. Marine Corps portion was six. Approximately the same period, the Soviets made a surprise move and announced their support of UNTSO and likewise wanted to provide observers. To keep a balanced presence between the east\u2013west Superpowers\u2014the Soviet participation was set at the same level as the United States (which was twenty-five each at that time). Subsequent to the 1973 agreement, the number of observers for all countries participating increased. As a result, the number of personnel to be provided by Soviet Union and the United States was re-established at thirty-six each. Since U.S. personnel were not allowed in Lebanon (a limitation set forth by U.S. Secretary of Defence Frank Carlucci, due to the threat to U.S. personnel), at this time there was a move to reduce U.S. participation to UNTSO. As a corollary, this also required a reduction in the numbers of Soviet observers. This reduction was delayed due to a lengthy diplomatic process.\nAfter the Lebanon War.\nThe Israeli-Lebanese conflict commenced in the late 1970s, ending the relative stability of the demarcation line along that front. It provided the latest major change to UNTSO's structure. After the outbreak of the Civil War in Lebanon and the Israeli invasion of Southern Lebanon (March 1978), the United Nations established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). UNTSO's observers were thus reorganized into Observer Group Lebanon (OGL) to assist UNIFIL. September 1982 saw a low point for UNTSO with the deaths of four of its unarmed officer observers\u2014one Finn, one Irishman, and two Americans\u2014in a landmine explosion just outside Beirut. As the Israelis advanced north, the position of Observer Group Lebanon was adjusted. In the early 1980s, the headquarters of the Israel-Lebanon Mixed Armistice Commission (ILMAC) which was already located in Beirut, was also tasked with being the United Nations Liaison Office Beirut (UNLOB). Under the close supervision of UNTSO's Chief-of-Staff, UNLOB/ILMAC functioned as a dual purpose headquarters/ liaison office for both UNTSO and UNIFIL.\nWith the establishment of the non-UN Multinational Force and Observers mission in the Sinai in 1981, UNTSO's Observer Group Sinai was retained to maintain a UN presence in the area.\nFour unarmed UN peacekeepers from Austria, China, Finland and Canada were killed during an Israeli air strike on 25 July 2006, which struck a UN OP at Khiam.\nHeadquarters.\nCairo was the initial headquarters of UNTSO. This was moved, shortly after its creation, to Haifa (a British enclave in this time), in late June 1948. The Haifa HQ was evacuated on 9 July due to renewed fighting. With the return of UN peacekeeping forces to Israel on 21 July 1948, UNTSO headquarters was moved again on 7 October 1948 for the third and final time to the former British High Commissioner's headquarters in Jerusalem.\nUNTSO also has offices in Beirut, Ismailia and Damascus.\nContributing countries.\nMilitary personnel allocated to UNTSO have come from many nations over the course of the mission's history. The United States, Belgium and France provided the initial groups of observers until 1953, but as the Cold War developed the number of personnel committed by the US and France was reduced. From 1953, other nations began contributing observers. Notably, Sweden has provided the most number of chiefs of staff. The Soviet Union first deployed personnel after the 1973 Arab\u2013Israeli war. In 2020, the following nations contributed personnel: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bhutan, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the People's Republic of China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Fiji, Gambia, Ireland, India, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. Britain is the only permanent member of the Security Council that does not currently provide personnel to the mission.\nToday.\nUNTSO personnel have also been available at short notice to form the nucleus of other peacekeeping operations. The availability of UNTSO's military observers for almost immediate deployment after the Security Council had acted to create a new operation has been an enormous contributory factor to the success of those operations.\nAccording to the United Nations, \"the military observers are unarmed and they carry out their jobs by observing and reporting violations of the agreements of ceasefire, disengagement etc. that are relevant to their area of operations. All military observers are seasoned officers of the rank of captain or major coming from all branches of service in their respective countries armed forces. The military observers work in multi-national teams, so that any observations will always be confirmed by at least two observers from different nations, as a measure to ensure impartiality\".\nUNTSO currently provides military observers to three different UN missions in the area: Observer Group Lebanon (OGL), supporting UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon; Observer Group Golan (OGG), supporting UNDOF in the Golan Heights; and Observer Group Egypt (OGE) in the Sinai Peninsula.\nOGG, who has its headquarters co-located with UNDOF HQ in Camp Faouar in Syria, is split into two outstations; OGG-D (Observer Group Golan \u2013 Damascus) based in Damascus, Syria and OGG-T (Observer Group Golan \u2013 Tiberias) based in Tiberias, Israel. Each outstation maintains \"a number of observation posts on each side of the Area of Separation (AOS) that was put in place as part of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement between Syria and Israel following the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The military observers carry-out fortnightly inspections inside the Area of Limitations (AOL) to verify, that both sides adhere to the limitations on troop levels and military equipment within 10, 20 and 25\u00a0km zones from the AOS as prescribed by the 1974 Disengagement Agreement\".\nOGL HQ are co-located with UNIFIL HQ in Naqoura, Southern Lebanon. OGL occupies several patrol bases along the \"Blue Line\" \u2013 a demarcation line between Israel and Lebanon.\nOGE is based in Ismalia by the Suez Canal in Egypt. OGE conducts short and long-range patrols in the Sinai Peninsula.\nInternational Day of United Nations Peacekeepers.\nThe United Nations has designated 29 May as the \"International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers.\" On that day in 2008 the sixtieth anniversary of the first United Nations Peacekeeping Forces being deployed was celebrated. In a press release, the UN announced:\nSixty years ago on that date, the United Nations Security Council established the first peacekeeping operation, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), based in the Middle East. In 2001, the General Assembly proclaimed 29 May as the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers to pay tribute to the men and women who serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations and honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Structurally, by containing a sulfonic acid group instead of a carboxylic acid group, it is not involved in protein synthesis but is still usually referred to as an amino acid. As non-proteinogenic amino sulfonic acid, it is not encoded by the genetic code and is distinguished from the protein-building \u03b1-amino acids.\nTaurine is a major constituent of bile and can be found in the large intestine, and is named after Latin , meaning bull or ox, as it was first isolated from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and Leopold Gmelin.\nAlthough taurine is abundant in human organs, it is not an essential human dietary nutrient and is not included among nutrients with a recommended intake level. Among the diverse pathways by which natural taurine can be biosynthesized, its human pathways (primarily in the human liver) are from cysteine and/or methionine.\nTaurine is commonly sold as a dietary supplement, but there is no good clinical evidence that taurine supplements provide any benefit to human health. Taurine is used as a food additive to meet essential dietary intake levels for cats, and supplemental dietary support for dogs and poultry.\nDiscovery and name.\nTaurine was first isolated from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and Leopold Gmelin. Another German scientist Von H. Demarcay first used its common chemical name Taurine in 1838, derived from the Latin (cognate to Ancient Greek , ) meaning bull or ox. It was subsequently identified in human bile in 1846 by Edmund Ronalds.\nIn nature.\nTaurine is widely distributed in nature, particularly in animal tissues. Moreover, it is abundant in nature, including in animal organs, and further, as substrates in the biosynthesis of bile salts. Taurine concentrations in human cells may derive from at least three processes:\nIt is not an essential human dietary nutrient, resulting in the absence of taurine from compounds having a Reference Daily Intake. Its role in human physiology is unknown.\nTaurine is a major constituent of bile, and can be found in the large intestine. Its concentrations in land plants are low or undetectable, but up to a substantial wet weight has been found in algae.\nChemical and biochemical features.\nTaurine exists as a zwitterion , as verified by X-ray crystallography. The sulfonic acid has a low p\"K\"a ensuring that it is fully ionized to the sulfonate at the pHs found in the intestinal tract.\nBiosynthesis.\nAmong the diverse pathways by which natural taurine can be biosynthesized, its pathways in the human liver are from cysteine and/or methionine. With regard to the route from cysteine: mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the liver via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway. In this pathway, cysteine is first oxidized to its sulfinic acid, catalyzed by the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine. Hypotaurine is enzymatically oxidized to yield taurine by hypotaurine dehydrogenase.\nTaurine is also produced by the transsulfuration pathway, which converts homocysteine into cystathionine. The cystathionine is then converted to hypotaurine by the sequential action of three enzymes: cystathionine gamma-lyase, cysteine dioxygenase, and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase. Hypotaurine is then oxidized to taurine as described above.\nA pathway for taurine biosynthesis from serine and sulfate is reported in microalgae, developing chicken embryos, and chick liver. Serine dehydratase converts serine to 2-aminoacrylate, which is converted to cysteic acid by 3\u2032-phosphoadenylyl sulfate:2-aminoacrylate \"C\"-sulfotransferase. Cysteic acid is converted to taurine by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase.\nChemical synthesis.\nSynthetic taurine is obtained by the ammonolysis of isethionic acid (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid), which in turn is obtained from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous sodium bisulfite. A direct approach involves the reaction of aziridine with sulfurous acid.\nIn 1993, about of taurine were produced for commercial purposes: 50% for pet food and 50% in pharmaceutical applications.\nIn the laboratory, taurine can be produced by alkylation of ammonia with bromoethanesulfonate salts.\nIn food.\nTaurine occurs naturally in fish and meat. The mean daily intake from omnivore diets was determined to be around (range ), and to be low or negligible from a vegan diet. Typical taurine consumption in the American diet is about per day.\nTaurine is partially destroyed by heat in processes such as baking and boiling. This is a concern for cat food, as cats have a dietary requirement for taurine and can easily become deficient. Either raw feeding or supplementing taurine can satisfy this requirement.\nBoth lysine and taurine can mask the metallic flavor of potassium chloride, a salt substitute.\nBreast milk.\nTaurine is present in breast milk, and has been added to many infant formulas as a measure of prudence since the early 1980s. However, this practice has never been rigorously studied, and as such it has yet to be proven to be necessary, or even beneficial.\nEnergy drinks and dietary supplements.\nTaurine is an ingredient in some energy drinks in amounts of per serving.\nResearch.\nTaurine is not regarded as an essential human dietary nutrient and has not been assigned recommended intake levels. High-quality clinical studies to determine possible effects of taurine in the body or following dietary supplementation are absent from the literature. Preliminary human studies on the possible effects of taurine supplementation have been inadequate due to low subject numbers, inconsistent designs, and variable doses.\nSafety and toxicity.\nAccording to the European Food Safety Authority, taurine is \"considered to be a skin and eye irritant and skin sensitiser, and to be hazardous if inhaled\"; it may be safe to consume up to 6\u00a0grams of taurine per day. Other sources indicate that taurine is safe for supplemental intake in normal healthy adults at up to 3\u00a0grams per day.\nA 2008 review found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks, concluding, \"The amounts of guarana, taurine, and ginseng found in popular energy drinks are far below the amounts expected to deliver either therapeutic benefits or adverse events\".\nAnimal dietary requirement.\nCats.\nCats lack the enzyme sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to produce taurine and must therefore acquire it from their diet. A taurine deficiency in cats can lead to retinal degeneration and eventually blindness \u2012 a condition known as central retinal degeneration as well as hair loss and tooth decay. Other effects of a diet lacking in this essential amino acid are dilated cardiomyopathy, and reproductive failure in female cats.\nDecreased plasma taurine concentration has been demonstrated to be associated with feline dilated cardiomyopathy. Unlike CRD, the condition is reversible with supplementation.\nTaurine is now a requirement of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and any dry or wet food product labeled approved by the AAFCO should have a minimum of 0.1% taurine in dry food and 0.2% in wet food. Studies suggest the amino acid should be supplied at of bodyweight per day for domestic cats.\nOther mammals.\nA number of other mammals also have a requirement for taurine. While the majority of dogs can synthesize taurine, case reports have described a singular American cocker spaniel, 19 Newfoundland dogs, and a family of golden retrievers suffering from taurine deficiency treatable with supplementation. Foxes on fur farms also appear to require dietary taurine. The rhesus, cebus and cynomolgus monkeys each require taurine at least in infancy. The giant anteater also requires taurine.\nBirds.\nTaurine appears to be essential for the development of passerine birds. Many passerines seek out taurine-rich spiders to feed their young, particularly just after hatching. Researchers compared the behaviours and development of birds fed a taurine-supplemented diet to a control diet and found the juveniles fed taurine-rich diets as neonates were much larger risk takers and more adept at spatial learning tasks. Under natural conditions, each blue tit nestling receive of taurine per day from parents.\nTaurine can be synthesized by chickens. Supplementation has no effect on chickens raised under adequate lab conditions, but seems to help with growth under stresses such as heat and dense housing.\nFish.\nSpecies of fish, mostly carnivorous ones, show reduced growth and survival when the fish-based feed in their food is replaced with soy meal or feather meal. Taurine has been identified as the factor responsible for this phenomenon; supplementation of taurine to plant-based fish feed reverses these effects. Future aquaculture is expected to use more of these more environmentally-friendly protein sources, so supplementation would become more important.\nThe need of taurine in fish is conditional, differing by species and growth stage. The olive flounder, for example, has lower capacity to synthesize taurine compared to the rainbow trout. Juvenile fish are less efficient at taurine biosyntheis due to reduced cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase levels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He began to study classical piano at age five and quickly developed a thirst for musical instruction and a desire to improvise. At age nine he began studying guitar and drums, and at age ten added flute.\nAfter graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in humanities, Sharifi went on to further his musical education at Berklee College of Music in Boston. At Berklee, he studied Jazz Piano and Composition as well as Film Scoring, and in 1983, he received the Outstanding Jazz Pianist award at the Collegiate Jazz Festival held at the University of Notre Dame. He studied with noted trumpeter and Charlie Parker sideman Herb Pomeroy, and after graduation from Berklee, Pomeroy asked Sharifi to lead the MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble, a post Pomeroy had held for twenty-two years. From 1985\u20131992, under Sharifi's direction and leadership, the group recorded two CDs, performed twenty of his compositions, and won the prestigious Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival in 1991. During this time, Sharifi also taught in the Music Synthesis and Ensemble Departments at Berklee. In 1992, he left his teaching positions in Boston and moved to New York City in search of new musical endeavors and opportunities.\nSharifi began to focus his attention on film soundtracks. His foray into the world of film and television began as a keyboardist and orchestrator for Michael Gibbs. Together they scored three feature films and fifteen one-hour television shows. Sharifi went on to compose the soundtracks to many major studio and independent films including \"Muppets From Space\", \"Down To Earth\", Nickelodeon film \"Harriet the Spy\" and the Paramount/Nickelodeon film \"Clockstoppers\", and contributed to the scores of \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" and \"The Rugrats Movie\".\nAnd while Sharifi's initial focus in music can be credited to American jazz, it is his infusions of elements from the Middle East and Africa that make his music distinctive. He was an accomplished pianist and synthesizer player. Notably, Sharifi held the synthesizer to an 'acoustic' standard and aimed to play it with the detail and richness of articulation that comes naturally to an acoustic instrumentalist. To achieve this sound he used a controller which allowed him to manipulate the synthesizer with his breath. He combined this technique with a ribbon controller that allowed him to bend the pitch smoothly and continuously with his finger. According to Jamshied, using both these techniques makes the instrument a \"wind-driven, fretless synthesizer\".\nIn addition to creating his own albums and scoring films, Sharifi has arranged and produced albums for many artists, including Tibetan vocalist Yungchen Lhamo, and Persian vocalist Mamak Khadem. He has also recorded four albums with world fusion band Mo Boma. His first solo album, \"A Prayer for the Soul of Layla\", received critical acclaim including Best Contemporary World Music Album at the 1st Annual New Age Voice Music Awards. His next release \"One\" continues to explore his inimitable approach to music. \"For both One and A Prayer for the Soul of Layla, the inspiration has been to make music true to my heart and interests\" said Sharifi. \"I have had the opportunity to work on a number of different musical projects, very often helping another artist to realize his or her vision. These records reflect my ongoing love for and exploration of music outside of what we think of as Western music.\u201d\nFor Dream Theater's album \"Octavarium\", he arranged and conducted for various orchestra instruments, including strings and horns. On April 1, 2006, he conducted the orchestra for the Dream Theater 20th Anniversary World Tour performance at Radio City Music Hall in NYC. This concert was released on the Dream Theater CD/DVD \"Score\".\nSharifi's first record, \"A Prayer for the Soul of Layla\", was inspired by his daughter, Layla Sakamoto Sharifi.\nHe won a Tony Award in 2018 for orchestrating the stage adaptation of \"The Band's Visit\".\nSharifi died on August 15, 2025, at the age of 64, after a long battle with cancer.\nAppearance in film.\nThree of Sharifi's songs \u2013 \"The Complicated Man\", \"UFO Get-Go\" and \"Back Porch\" \u2013 appeared in the film \"The Thomas Crown Affair\".\nAt the request of MIT Wind Ensemble music director Frederick Harris, Sharifi composed music about the Arab Spring for a spring concert which PBS affiliate WGBH filmed and aired on May 31, 2013. The film won a New England Emmy Award.\nFor MIT's 2020 virtual commencement ceremony, Sharifi's \"To the Light, To the Flame\" was recorded by dozens of musicians from remote locations during quarantine.\nFor MIT's 2021 virtual commencement ceremony, Sharifi's \"Diary of a Pandemic Year\" was recorded by dozens of musicians at several venues on MIT's campus.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The transmitter itself generates a radio frequency alternating current, which is applied to the antenna. When excited by this alternating current, the antenna radiates radio waves.\nTransmitters are necessary component parts of all electronic devices that communicate by radio, such as radio (audio) and television broadcasting stations, cell phones, walkie-talkies, wireless computer networks, Bluetooth enabled devices, garage door openers, two-way radios in aircraft, ships, spacecraft, radar sets and navigational beacons. The term \"transmitter\" is usually limited to equipment that generates radio waves for communication purposes; or radiolocation, such as radar and navigational transmitters. Generators of radio waves for heating or industrial purposes, such as microwave ovens or diathermy equipment, are not usually called transmitters, even though they often have similar circuits.\nThe term is popularly used more specifically to refer to a broadcast transmitter, a transmitter used in broadcasting, as in \"FM radio transmitter\" or television transmitter. This usage typically includes both the transmitter proper, the antenna, and often the building it is housed in.\nDescription.\nA transmitter can be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electrical circuit within another electronic device. A transmitter and a receiver combined in one unit is called a transceiver. The purpose of most transmitters is radio communication of information over a distance. The information is provided to the transmitter in the form of an electronic signal called the modulation signal, such as an audio (sound) signal from a microphone, a video (TV) signal from a video camera, or in wireless networking devices, a digital signal from a computer. The transmitter generates a radio frequency signal which when applied to the antenna produces the radio waves, called the carrier signal. It combines the carrier with the modulation signal, a process called modulation. The information can be added to the carrier in several different ways, in different types of transmitters. In an amplitude modulation (AM) transmitter, the information is added to the radio signal by varying its amplitude. In a frequency modulation (FM) transmitter, it is added by varying the radio signal's frequency slightly. Many other types of modulation are also used.\nThe radio signal from the transmitter is applied to the antenna, which radiates the energy as radio waves. The antenna may be enclosed inside the case or attached to the outside of the transmitter, as in portable devices such as cell phones, walkie-talkies, and garage door openers. In more powerful transmitters, the antenna may be located on top of a building or on a separate tower, and connected to the transmitter by a feed line, that is a transmission line.\nOperation.\nElectromagnetic waves are radiated by electric charges when they are accelerated. Radio waves, electromagnetic waves of radio frequency, are generated by time-varying electric currents, consisting of electrons flowing through a metal conductor called an antenna which are changing their velocity and thus accelerating. An alternating current flowing back and forth in an antenna will create an oscillating magnetic field around the conductor. The alternating voltage will also charge the ends of the conductor alternately positive and negative, creating an oscillating electric field around the conductor. If the frequency of the oscillations is high enough, in the radio frequency range above about 20\u00a0kHz, the oscillating coupled electric and magnetic fields will radiate away from the antenna into space as an electromagnetic wave, a radio wave.\nA radio transmitter is an electronic circuit which transforms electric power from a power source, a battery or mains power, into a radio frequency alternating current to apply to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the energy from this current as radio waves. The transmitter also encodes information such as an audio or video signal into the radio frequency current to be carried by the radio waves. When they strike the antenna of a radio receiver, the waves excite similar (but less powerful) radio frequency currents in it. The radio receiver extracts the information from the received waves.\nComponents.\nA practical radio transmitter mainly consists of the following parts:\nMany other types of modulation are also used. In large transmitters the oscillator and modulator together are often referred to as the \"exciter\".\nIn higher frequency transmitters, in the UHF and microwave range, free running oscillators are unstable at the output frequency. Older designs used an oscillator at a lower frequency, which was multiplied by frequency multipliers to get a signal at the desired frequency. Modern designs more commonly use an oscillator at the operating frequency which is stabilized by phase locking to a very stable lower frequency reference, usually a crystal oscillator.\nRegulation.\nTwo radio transmitters in the same area that attempt to transmit on the same frequency will interfere with each other, causing garbled reception, so neither transmission may be received clearly. Interference with radio transmissions can not only have a large economic cost, it can be life-threatening (for example, in the case of interference with emergency communications or air traffic control).\nFor this reason, in most countries, use of transmitters is strictly controlled by law. Transmitters must be licensed by governments, under a variety of license classes depending on use such as broadcast, marine radio, Airband, Amateur and are restricted to certain frequencies and power levels. A body called the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) allocates the frequency bands in the radio spectrum to various classes of users. In some classes, each transmitter is given a unique call sign consisting of a string of letters and numbers which must be used as an identifier in transmissions. The operator of the transmitter usually must hold a government license, such as a general radiotelephone operator license, which is obtained by passing a test demonstrating adequate technical and legal knowledge of safe radio operation.\nExceptions to the above regulations allow the unlicensed use of low-power short-range transmitters in consumer products such as cell phones, cordless telephones, wireless microphones, walkie-talkies, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices, garage door openers, and baby monitors. In the US, these fall under Part 15 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. Although they can be operated without a license, these devices still generally must be type-approved before sale.\nHistory.\nThe first primitive radio transmitters (called spark gap transmitters) were built by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1887 during his pioneering investigations of radio waves. These generated radio waves by a high voltage spark between two conductors. Beginning in 1895, Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical radio communication systems using these transmitters, and radio began to be used commercially around 1900. Spark transmitters could not transmit audio (sound) and instead transmitted information by radiotelegraphy: the operator tapped on a telegraph key which turned the transmitter on-and-off to produce radio wave pulses spelling out text messages in telegraphic code, usually Morse code. At the receiver, these pulses were sometimes directly recorded on paper tapes, but more common was audible reception. The pulses were audible as beeps in the receiver's earphones, which were translated back to text by an operator who knew Morse code. These spark-gap transmitters were used during the first three decades of radio (1887\u20131917), called the wireless telegraphy or \"spark\" era. Because they generated damped waves, spark transmitters were electrically \"noisy\". Their energy was spread over a broad band of frequencies, creating radio noise which interfered with other transmitters. Damped wave emissions were banned by international law in 1934.\nTwo short-lived competing transmitter technologies came into use after the turn of the century, which were the first continuous wave transmitters: the arc converter (Poulsen arc) in 1904 and the Alexanderson alternator around 1910, which were used into the 1920s.\nAll these early technologies were replaced by vacuum tube transmitters in the 1920s, which used the feedback oscillator invented by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner around 1912, based on the Audion (triode) vacuum tube invented by Lee De Forest in 1906. Vacuum tube transmitters were inexpensive and produced continuous waves, and could be easily modulated to transmit audio (sound) using amplitude modulation (AM). This made AM radio broadcasting possible, which began in about 1920. Practical frequency modulation (FM) transmission was invented by Edwin Armstrong in 1933, who showed that it was less vulnerable to noise and static than AM. The first FM radio station was licensed in 1937. Experimental television transmission had been conducted by radio stations since the late 1920s, but practical television broadcasting didn't begin until the late 1930s. The development of radar during World War II motivated the evolution of high frequency transmitters in the UHF and microwave ranges, using new active devices such as the magnetron, klystron, and traveling wave tube.\nThe invention of the transistor allowed the development in the 1960s of small portable transmitters such as wireless microphones, garage door openers and walkie-talkies. The development of the integrated circuit (IC) in the 1970s made possible the current proliferation of wireless devices, such as cell phones and Wi-Fi networks, in which integrated digital transmitters and receivers (wireless modems) in portable devices operate automatically, in the background, to exchange data with wireless networks.\nThe need to conserve bandwidth in the increasingly congested radio spectrum is driving the development of new types of transmitters such as spread spectrum, trunked radio systems and cognitive radio. A related trend has been an ongoing transition from analog to digital radio transmission methods. Digital modulation can have greater spectral efficiency than analog modulation; that is it can often transmit more information (data rate) in a given bandwidth than analog, using data compression algorithms. Other advantages of digital transmission are increased noise immunity, and greater flexibility and processing power of digital signal processing integrated circuits.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nPlanning section.]"}

He is best known for voicing Homer Simpson on the animated series \"The Simpsons\", as well as other characters on the show such as Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Sideshow Mel, Mr. Teeny, Kodos, Itchy, and Barney Gumble. Castellaneta is also known for voicing Grandpa in Nickelodeon's \"Hey Arnold!\", and has had voice roles in several other programs, including \"Futurama\", \"Sibs\", \"Darkwing Duck\", \"The Adventures of Dynamo Duck\", \"The Batman\", \"Back to the Future: The Animated Series\", \"Aladdin\", \"Earthworm Jim\", and \"Taz-Mania\".\nIn 1999, Castellaneta appeared in the Christmas special \"Olive, the Other Reindeer\" and won an Annie Award for his portrayal of the Postman. Castellaneta released a comedy album \"I Am Not Homer\", and wrote and starred in a one-person show titled \"Where Did Vincent van Gogh?\"\nEarly life.\nDaniel Louis Castellaneta was born on October 29, 1957, at Roseland Community Hospital on Chicago's south side and was raised in River Forest and Oak Park, Illinois. He is of Italian descent, born to Elsie (n\u00e9e\u00a0Lagorio; 1926\u20132008) and Louis Castellaneta (1915\u20132014), an amateur actor who worked for a printing company.\nCastellaneta became adept at impressions at a young age and his mother enrolled him in an acting class when he was 16 years old. He would listen to his father's comedy records and do impressions of the artists. He was a \"devotee\" of the works of many performers, including Alan Arkin and Barbara Harris and directors Mike Nichols and Elaine May. He attended Oak Park and River Forest High School and upon graduation, started attending Northern Illinois University (NIU) in the fall of 1975.\nCastellaneta studied art education, with the goal of becoming an art teacher. He became a student teacher and would entertain his students with his impressions. Castellaneta was a regular participant in \"The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show\", a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled \"We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing a voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didn't care. It was that we got a chance to do it and write our own material.\" He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would \"fall on his face with improvisation\" but soon \"was churning out material faster than [they] could make it work.\"\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nCastellaneta began his acting career after his graduation from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He decided that if his career went nowhere he would still have a chance to try something else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. He started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations.\nHe auditioned for a role in \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.\n\"The Simpsons\".\nCastellaneta is most famous for his roles on the longest-running American animated television show, \"The Simpsons\", most notably as Homer Simpson. \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers asked Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson respectively, rather than hire more actors. Homer's voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not \"get enough power behind that voice\" and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour recording sessions.\nHe tried to find something easier, so he \"dropped the voice down\", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest, and is said to \"let his IQ go.\"\nCastellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, \"except, maybe, by a die-hard fan.\"\nCastellaneta also provides the voices for numerous other characters, including Grampa Simpson, Barney Gumble, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Hans Moleman, Sideshow Mel, Itchy, Kodos, Arnie Pye, the Squeaky Voiced Teen and Gil Gunderson. Krusty's voice is based on Chicago television's Bob Bell, who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. During early recording sessions, he recorded a new version of Barney's loud trademark belch for every episode but discovered that it was not easy for him to belch each time a script called for it. Castellaneta chose a recording of what he believed was his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard.\nGroundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in the season two episode \"Principal Charming\". The character was written as an angry janitor, and Castellaneta was assigned to perform the voice. He did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, suggested he use an accent. Castellaneta first tried using Hispanic voicing, which Simon felt was too clich\u00e9d. He then tried a \"big dumb Swede\", which was also rejected. For his third try, he used the voice of a grumpy Scotsman, which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode. The voice was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show \"Second City Television\", who was portrayed by Dave Thomas.\nMayor Quimby, who first appeared in \"Bart Gets an 'F'\", is a parody of various members of the Kennedy family. The episode script did not call for Quimby to be a parody of them, and Castellaneta improvised the accent. Sideshow Mel's voice is Castellaneta's impression of Kelsey Grammer, the voice of Sideshow Bob. Hapless Gil Gunderson is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon's portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play \"Glengarry Glen Ross\". Showrunner Mike Scully thought that Gil would be \"a one-shot thing\" but \"Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character, we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in.\" The Blue-Haired Lawyer's voice, as well as his demeanor, is based on lawyer Roy Cohn.\nCastellaneta has won several awards for voicing Homer, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for \"Outstanding Voice-Over Performance\" in 1992 for \"Lisa's Pony\", 1993 for \"Mr. Plow\", 2004 for voicing several characters in \"Today I Am a Clown\", and 2009 for voicing Homer in \"Father Knows Worst\".\nIn 1993, Castellaneta was given a special Annie Award, \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in the Field of Animation\", for his work as Homer on \"The Simpsons\".\nIn 2004, Castellaneta and Julie Kavner (the voice of Marge) won a Young Artist Award for \"Most Popular Mom &amp; Dad in a TV Series\". Homer was placed second on \"TV Guide\"'s 2002 Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters, and in 2000, Homer and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.\nUntil 1998, Castellaneta was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute was soon resolved and Castellaneta began receiving $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the cast demanded to be paid $360,000 an episode. The issue was resolved a month later, with Castellaneta starting to earn $250,000 per episode. Following salary negotiations in 2008, the cast received approximately $400,000 per episode. In 2011, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, the cast accepted a pay cut to around $300,000 per episode.\nIn the early 1990s, Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta wrote a script for an episode in which Barney becomes sober, and pitched it to showrunner Al Jean. He liked the story but turned it down because he felt that it was too similar to \"Duffless\", an episode that the writers were already working on. The two waited for nearly a decade and offered an updated version of the script to later showrunner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes. Their script became the episode \"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\". Castellaneta and his wife have also written the episodes \"Gump Roast\", \"The Ziff Who Came to Dinner\", \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\", and \"The Fight Before Christmas\". In 2007, they were nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for the episode \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\". Castellaneta is also credited as a consulting producer.\nFurther career.\nCastellaneta has been a regular cast member in several other television series. In 1991, he played Warren Morris in the short-lived ABC live-action sitcom \"Sibs\". Heide Perlman, creator of \"Sibs\", wrote the part with Castellaneta in mind.\nHe provided the voice of the eponymous character in \"The Adventures of Dynamo Duck\", Megavolt in \"Darkwing Duck\", \"Doc\" Emmett Brown in \"Back to the Future: The Animated Series\", the lead character in \"Earthworm Jim\" and several characters, including Grandpa Phil and the Jolly Olly Man, the mentally unstable ice cream truck driver, on Nickelodeon's \"Hey Arnold!\". He guest starred as The Robot Devil in five episodes of \"Futurama\", as well as the \"Futurama\" film \"The Beast with a Billion Backs\".\nCastellaneta has also made guest appearances in a number of television series episodes. In 1992, he guest-starred in an episode of the legal drama \"L.A. Law\", as a Homer Simpson meetable character at a California amusement park who is dismissed for inappropriate behavior while in costume. \nIn 1996, he made a guest appearance as a Zoo Keeper in Season 2, Episode 12 \"The One After the Superbowl\" in Friends.\nIn 2005, he appeared in the episode \"Sword of Destiny\" in \"Arrested Development\" as Dr. Stein, a deadpan incompetent doctor.\nIn 2005, Castellaneta guest-starred as Joe Spencer in the \"Stargate SG-1\" season eight episode \"Citizen Joe\". He also appeared in episodes of \"ALF\", \"Campus Ladies\", \"Castle\", \"Entourage\", \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", \"Frasier\", \"Friends\", \"Greek\", \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"Mad About You\", \"Married... with Children\", \"Murphy Brown\", \"NYPD Blue\", \"Parks and Recreation\", \"Reba\", \"Reno 911!\", \"That '70s Show\", \"Veronica Mars\", \"Hot in Cleveland\", \"Yes, Dear\", and \"Desperate Housewives\".\nHe appeared as the Genie in the \"Aladdin\" sequel \"The Return of Jafar\" and on the 1994 \"Aladdin\" television series. The Genie had been voiced by Robin Williams in \"Aladdin\", and Castellaneta described replacing him as \"sort of like stepping into \"Hamlet\" after Laurence Olivier did it, how can you win?\" He also provided Genie's voice in the \"Kingdom Hearts\" video game series for both \"Kingdom Hearts\" and \"Kingdom Hearts II\" (with archived audio used for ' and its remake as well as for the later HD collections \"Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix\" and \"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix\"). Castellaneta portrayed Aaron Spelling in the 2004 NBC film \"Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie's Angels\", which followed the true story of how Spelling created the show. Other films in which Castellaneta has appeared include \"Nothing in Common\", \"Say Anything...\", \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"The Client\", \"Space Jam\", \"My Giant\", \"The Simpsons Movie\", ', ', ', \"The Cat in the Hat\" and \"The Pursuit of Happyness\".\nIn 2000, he won an Annie Award for his portrayal of the Postman in the animated Christmas television special \"Olive, the Other Reindeer\". In 2006, he appeared in Jeff Garlin's independent film \"I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With\" along with several other Second City alumni.\nOn February 22, 2000, his first music CD \"Two Lips\" was published. It was followed on April 23, 2002, by his first comedy CD, \"I Am Not Homer\", in which he and his wife perform several comedy skits. The majority of the sketches had been written and performed before the CD was recorded, and Castellaneta thought that it would be a good idea to preserve them \"since [he and Lacusta] don't perform them much anymore.\"\nSome came from their sketch series on a local radio station in Chicago and had to be lengthened from the \"two-minute bits\" that they were originally, while several others were stage sketches performed in a comedy club in Santa Monica. Additionally, \"Citizen Kane\", a sketch in which two people discuss the film \"Citizen Kane\" with different meanings, was something the pair had performed at an art gallery. Castellaneta noted that \"we already knew that these skits were funny, [but] some of them we polished and tightened.\" The skits were principally written by improvising from a basic point, transcribing the results, and then editing them to the finished scene. Castellaneta chose the title \"I Am Not Homer\" as a parody of Leonard Nimoy's famous first autobiography, \"I Am Not Spock\", as well as to show that most of the comedy featured \"is not the typical Homer comedy.\"\nAlongside his television and film work, Castellaneta has appeared in a number of theatrical productions. In 1992, he starred in \"Deb &amp; Dan's Show\" alongside his wife. In 1995, Castellaneta started writing \"Where Did Vincent van Gogh?\", a one man play in which he portrays a dozen different characters, including artist Vincent van Gogh. He first officially performed the play at the ACME Comedy Theatre in Los Angeles in 1999. In 2007, he appeared in \"The Bicycle Men\" at King's Head Theatre in London.\nCastellaneta hosted the final of New York comedy show Thrills and Spills on December 31, 2015. The final was held in Montgomery, Alabama.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1987, Castellaneta married writer and actress Deb Lacusta, whom he had met at an improv class in Chicago. They divide their time between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, California.\nCastellaneta is a vegetarian and does not drink alcohol. He enjoys exercising regularly.\nDiscography.\nAlso featured in:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Stationed in the Hawaiian Islands, he has a contentious but friendly relationship with his sergeant, Scrapper Thornhill. When General Fitts visits the post with his daughter Kit on their way to Manila, Dick is assigned to drive her to a reception that evening. Falling victim to the moonlit night, Kit and Dick attend a luau instead, and he sings \"Aloha \u2018Oe\". They are discovered in each other's arms by Scrapper and Lieutenant Biddle, who is also in love with Kit. Biddle accuses Dick of ruining Kit's reputation and forcing her to accompany him off post. Dick decides to desert. Scrapper begs Kit to reconcile with Biddle.\nTo prevent Dick from deserting, Kit tells him that she was responding to a crazy impulse and that he means nothing to her. Stung by her words, and Biddle's condescending statement that \"if you were an officer and a gentleman, you'd understand,\" Dick decides to compete with Biddle as an equal and applies for admission to the United States Military Academy. He is accepted and fares very well, to Scrapper's delight. In his first year, Dick becomes a first captain and General Fitts is appointed the academy's superintendent, with Biddle as his aide. While most of his classmates are infatuated with Kit, Dick is cold to her. He is unhappy when the men insist that she participate in the traditional \"Hundredth Night\" theatrical performance that he is to direct.\nDick writes a comedy about a female general with a message directed at Kit. After the first rehearsal, Kit walks with Dick on Flirtation Walk and tries to explain why she told him that she was not in love with him. Dick is too angry to listen to Kit, but during their on-stage love scene kisses her, and she admits that she loves him. Near graduation, General Fitts announces Kit's engagement to Biddle, and Dick is confused. He visits her at night in an attempt to dissuade her from marrying Biddle. He is caught by Biddle and agrees to resign from the academy to protect Kit's name. Scrapper arrives to see Dick graduate and is disappointed to learn of his resignation.

It also features Alice Brady, Edward Everett Horton, Erik Rhodes, and Eric Blore. The screenplay was written by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost, and Edward Kaufman. It is based on the Broadway musical \"Gay Divorce\", written by Dwight Taylor, with Kenneth Webb and Samuel Hoffenstein adapting an unproduced play by J. Hartley Manners.\nThe stage version included many songs by Cole Porter that were left out of the film, except for \"Night and Day\". Although most of the songs were replaced, the screenplay kept the original plot of the stage version. Three members of the play's original cast repeated their stage roles: Astaire, Rhodes and Blore.\n\"The Gay Divorcee\" was the second (after \"Flying Down to Rio\") of ten pairings of Astaire and Rogers on film and their first one as a duo in leading roles.\nPlot.\nGuy Holden, a famous American dancer, is at a Paris nightclub with his friend, scatterbrained English lawyer Egbert Fitzgerald, when they both realize that they have forgotten their wallets. After Guy dances for the audience to avoid washing dishes to work off the bill, Egbert discovers his wallet in a different pocket.\nTraveling to England by ship, Guy encounters Mimi Glossop, whose dress has been caught when closing a trunk, asking Guy to call a porter to open the trunk to free her. Taking advantage of the situation, Guy teases her and attempts to free her dress, but ends up tearing the skirt at thigh level, angering Mimi. Chastised, Guy apologizes and gives Mimi his coat to cover up, and asks for her address to retrieve his coat, but Mimi insists that she will mail it back at the address he provides.\nMimi returns the coat, paying the courier not to disclose her contact information. After searching for Mimi in London for two weeks, Guy ends up serendipitously rear-ending her car in traffic. As Mimi drives away and races to evade him, he chases her into the country. Taking a shortcut, Guy sets up a fake roadblock, trapping her, offering her an impromptu picnic and casually proposing marriage. Convinced that he is insane, she rebuffs his attempts to charm her and attempts to tear up notes with his phone number (but keeps one), but he learns that her name is Mimi.\nCoincidentally, Mimi seeks a divorce from her geologist husband, Cyril Glossop, who she has not seen for some time. Under the guidance of her domineering and much-married Aunt Hortense, she consults bumbling lawyer Egbert Fitzgerald, once a fianc\u00e9 of her aunt. He arranges for Mimi to spend a night at a seaside hotel in Brightbourne and to be caught \"flagrante delicto\" in a staged \"adulterous relationship\", a purpose for which he hires a professional co-respondent, Rodolfo Tonetti. In an unrelated previous conversation with Guy, Egbert had been impressed when Guy philosophically used the phrase, \"Chance is the fool's name for fate\". Without Guy's knowledge and without intending any connection, Egbert gives Mimi the expression as a code phrase to identify her co-respondent.\nAccompanying his friend Egbert to the hotel, the besotted and unaware Guy encounters Mimi, who has warmed up to him, and admits that she attempted to contact the phone number that he gave her. He sings Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\" to her, and they fall under a spell while dancing together. Wanting to impress Mimi, Guy waxes philosophical, inadvertently using the code phrase that Egbert has given Mimi to identify the co-respondent. Appalled, Mimi mistakes him for the co-respondent who she has been expecting, considering him not much more than a gigolo.\nWhen Mimi gives Guy her room number and makes it clear that she expects him \"at midnight\", Guy is astonished by her seemingly brazen attitude. Guy keeps the \"appointment\" in Mimi's bedroom, and Tonetti arrives, revealing the truth and clearing up the misunderstandings. Not trusting Tonetti alone with Mimi, Guy insists on staying, potentially thwarting the point of a co-respondent for Mimi's divorce case. Tonetti insists that Mimi and Guy not foil the plan by being seen together outside of the bedroom. While Tonetti is busy playing solitaire in another room, Guy and Mimi contrive to escape and dance the night away. An elaborate 16-minute dance sequence, \"The Continental\", follows, with Mimi singing the introduction, another singer and ensembles of dancers doing routines, and Guy and Mimi joining in.\nIn the morning, after several mistakes with the waiter, Guy hides in the next room when Cyril arrives at the door, while Mimi and Tonetti pretend that they are lovers. When Cyril does not believe that Mimi would fall for Tonetti, Guy comes out and embraces Mimi in an attempt to convince Cyril that he is her lover, but to no avail. Cyril does not want a divorce from a wealthy wife. The unwitting waiter ultimately reveals that Cyril is an adulterer, having come to another hotel on previous occasions with another woman, thus clearing the way for Mimi to obtain a divorce and marry Guy.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Fred Astaire as Guy Holden\nSongs and dance numbers.\nNew songs introduced in the film\nNight and Day\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nAfter the success of Astaire and Rogers's first feature, \"Flying Down to Rio\" (1933), RKO's head of production, Pandro S. Berman, purchased the screen rights to Dwight Taylor's Broadway musical \"Gay Divorce\", with another Astaire and Rogers matchup in mind. According to Astaire's autobiography, director Mark Sandrich claimed that RKO altered the title to insinuate that the film concerned the amorous adventures of a recently divorced woman (divorc\u00e9e). In addition to the credited screenwriters, Robert Benchley, H. W. Hanemann, and Stanley Rauh made uncredited contributions to the dialogue.\nDance routines from the film, specifically \"Night and Day\" and the scene in which Astaire dances on the table, were taken from Astaire's performances in the original play, \"Gay Divorce\". The choreography to \"Don't Let It Bother You\" came from foolhardy antics during rehearsals, and became an in-joke in future Astaire\u2013Rogers films.\nFilming.\nExteriors set in what was supposed to be the English countryside were shot in Clear Lake, California. Additional exteriors were filmed in Santa Monica and Santa Barbara, California.\nThe car driven by Rogers was her own, a 1929 Duesenberg Model\u00a0J. It still exists, and has been displayed at least once at the Amelia Island Car Show, Concours d'Elegance.\nCensorship concerns.\nJames Wingate, Director of Studio Relations for RKO, warned: \"Considering the delicate nature of the subject upon which this script is based... great care should be taken in the scenes dealing with Mimi's lingerie, and... no intimate article should be used.\" Wingate also insisted that no actor or actress appear in only pajamas.\nThere are differing accounts of why the film's name was changed from the play's \"Gay Divorce\" to \"The Gay Divorcee\". In one, the Hays Office insisted that RKO change the name, finding it \"too frivolous toward marriage\": while a divorc\u00e9e could be gay or lighthearted, it would be unseemly to allow a divorce to appear so. According to Astaire, however, the change was made proactively by RKO. Sandrich told him that \"The Gay Divorcee\" was selected as the new name because the studio \"thought it was a more attractive-sounding title, centered around a girl\". RKO even offered $50 to any employee who could come up with a better title. In the United Kingdom, the film was released under the title \"The Gay Divorce\".\nReception.\nBox office.\nAccording to RKO records, the film earned $1,077,000 in the United States and Canada, and $697,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $584,000.\nCritical response.\n\"The New York Times\" critic Andre Sennwald said of the film on November 16, 1934: \"Like the carefree team of Rogers and Astaire, \"The Gay Divorcee\" is gay in its mood and smart in its approach. For subsidiary humor, there are Alice Brady as the talkative aunt; Edward Everett Horton as the confused lawyer ... and Erik Rhodes ... as the excitable co-respondent, who takes the correct pride in his craftsmanship and objects to outside interference. All of them plus the Continental, help to make the new Music Hall show the source of a good deal of innocent merriment.\"\nAccolades.\nThe film was nominated for the following Academy Awards, winning in the category Music (Song):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Werker, Sidney Lanfield\nThe House of Rothschild is a 1934 American pre-Code historical drama film directed by Alfred L. Werker and starring George Arliss, Loretta Young and Boris Karloff. It was adapted by Nunnally Johnson from the play by George Hembert Westley, and chronicles the rise of the Rothschild family of European bankers.\nPlot.\nIn 1780 in Frankfurt youngster Nathan Rothschild warns his parents Mayer and Guttle that the taxman is coming. They hurriedly hide their wealth. The taxman demands 20,000 gulden, an exorbitant sum, but accepts a bribe of 5,000 in exchange for assessing them 2,000 in taxes. Mayer's satisfaction is short-lived, however; a courier bringing him 10,000 guldens is intercepted and the money confiscated by the taxmen. Mayer tells his sons that he tries to be as honest as possible, but the authorities will not let him; he admonishes his children to acquire money, for \"money is power\" and can protect their people.\nLater, as Mayer is lying on his deathbed, he instructs his five sons to start banks in different countries across Europe: Amschel in Frankfurt am Main, Salomon in Vienna, Nathan in London, Carl in Naples, and James in Paris. That way, they can avoid having to send gold back and forth when the need arises, for in war they are in danger of being robbed by the enemy and in peace by their own countrymen. Instead, they can draw on each other's banks.\nThirty-two years later, the sons have established banking houses. Then France overruns Europe in the Napoleonic Wars. Austrian Prince Metternich asks Salomon to raise 15 million florins to help defeat Napoleon. The other brothers are approached with similar requests. Even in France itself, Talleyrand asks for 50 million francs. Nathan refuses to loan the British Government five million pounds (on top of previous loans) to hold off the enemy, but offers the Duke of Wellington twice that amount to smash him.\nAfter the war is won, Wellington is disappointed to find that Nathan Rothschild has not even been invited to a party in the duke's honour. He insists on going to see Nathan. His aide, Captain Fitzroy, knows the address, as he and Nathan's daughter Julie are in love. While there, Wellington tells Nathan that the victorious powers are going to make a very large loan to France to help it recover from the war. The winning underwriter will become the most powerful and prestigious bank in Europe.\nNathan's bid is the best, but is rejected primarily in favor of Barings Bank. When Nathan demands to know the reason, Prussian Count Ledrantz (despite having himself sought a war loan from the Rothschilds) explains it was discarded on a \"technicality\", because Nathan is a Jew. Nathan learns that the quarter of the loan not awarded to Barings will fall to Ledrantz, Metternich and Talleyrand, who stand to make enormous profits. Nathan outmanoeuvres them financially, bringing them to the brink of ruin and dishonour; they capitulate and surrender to him the entire loan. However, this has somewhat embittered him. Where once he accepted Julie's choice, he now tells the non-Jewish Fitzroy to stay away from her.\nAnti-Jewish riots break out all over Germany, instigated by Ledrantz. Nathan returns to Frankfurt and, under pressure from his own people, agrees to submit to Ledrantz. However, before he can, he receives word that Napoleon has escaped from exile. Nathan's brothers, fearful of their positions, want to support the restored French Emperor. However, Nathan refuses to do so. With Ledrantz and others once again desperately in need of financial support, he extracts a treaty from them granting Jews rights, freedoms and dignity long denied them. He also tells Fitzroy that he can once again see Julie. With Napoleon seemingly invincible, Nathan determines to risk all in support of the allies. Just before he is bankrupted, he receives word that Wellington has won the Battle of Waterloo, and he is not only saved, he becomes the richest man in the world and a baron.\nBackground.\nThe movie was produced by Zanuck (who was not Jewish), as an attack on Nazism and anti-semitism following Hitler's rise to power in Germany in 1933. The story was suggested to him by George Arliss (also non-Jewish) who had made successful film appearances as Jewish characters like Shylock and Benjamin Disraeli. Arliss was given the dual role of Amschel Rothschild and one of Rothschild's sons, Nathan Mayer, the one who settled in England. Zanuck faced behind-the-scenes opposition from Jewish concerns such as the Anti-Defamation League but the screenplay passed the muster of the Hays Office, one of whose officials, James Wingate, found no cause for objection and even suggested it be shown to a representative of the German government, a step Zanuck refused to take. In December 1933 the project was endorsed in one major Jewish journal, \"The B'nai B'rith Messenger\".\nCinematography.\nWhile nearly all of the film is in black and white, its final sequence was one of the first shot in the three-strip Technicolor process, along with the MGM musical \"The Cat and the Fiddle\", released in February 1934.\nReception.\nThe movie had positive reviews from various American journals; although the film made no reference to then-current events in Germany, some critics noticed similarities to the Nazi regime's treatment of German Jews\u2014such as the columnist of \"Time\", who considered it \"shrewdly timed to touch obliquely on current Jew-baiting in Germany\". It was also publicly endorsed by the National Council of Jewish Women, which helped make it acceptable.\nThe film was the biggest hit of the year for Twentieth Century Pictures, which had only been formed in June 1933. It was one of United Artists' most popular films of the year. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nIn a close contest \"The House of Rothschild\" was voted the second best picture of 1934 in \"Film Daily\"'s annual poll of critics, narrowly edged out by \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\".\nTwo scenes from \"The House of Rothschild\" were used in the German antisemitic propaganda film \"The Eternal Jew\" (1940) without the permission of the copyright holders.\nHistorical accuracy.\nThe film takes several creative liberties with Rothschild family history. Amschel Rothschild did not die until 1812, during the later stages of the Napoleonic Wars he is portrayed as not having lived to see. Only two of his five sons were actually present at his death bed; the rest were already established in other European countries.\nNathan Rothschild (born 1777) would have been only three years old in 1780, when the film begins. The relationship between Captain Fitzroy and Julie Rothschild is fictional; Nathan Rothschild had no daughter named Julie. The Captain Fitzroy who did become his son-in-law (albeit after Nathan died in 1836) was born in 1807, therefore a child at the time of Waterloo, and married in 1839 Hannah Rothschild, Nathan's second daughter (born 1815).\nAlso, in the 18th century Frankfurt was a Free City in the Holy Roman Empire. It did not belong to Prussia until 1866.\nThe Prussian Count Ledrantz, Nathan Mayer's antagonist, was a purely fictional character written into the story by Nunally Johnson.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The novel, which deals with issues of race, class and gender, was originally serialized in 1932 in the magazine \"Pictorial Review\" under the title \"Sugar House\".\nSynopsis.\nSet in the 1910s at \"the Shore\" of New Jersey, the novel explores issues of race and class in early 20th-century United States. Bea Chipley is a quiet, mousy Atlantic City teenage girl whose mother dies, leaving her to keep house for her father (Mr. Chipley) and Benjamin Pullman, a boarder who peddles ketchup and relish on the boardwalk and sells maple syrup door-to-door. Within a year, her father and Pullman decide that she should marry Pullman; she soon becomes pregnant and has a daughter named Jessie. Her father suffers an incapacitating stroke, confining him to a wheelchair, and Pullman is killed in a train accident. Bea is left to fend for her father and Jessie by herself.\nShe takes in boarders to defray expenses as well as peddles Pullman's maple syrup door-to-door, using his \"B. Pullman\" business cards to avoid the ubiquitous sexism of the 1910s. To care for her infant daughter and disabled father, Bea Pullman hires Delilah, an African-American mammy figure, who has an infant daughter Peola. The girl has \"light skin\" (as described then).\nAs Delilah is a master waffle-maker, Bea capitalizes on Delilah's skills to open a \"B. Pullman\" waffle restaurant. It attracts many of the tourists at the Shore. She eventually builds a nationwide and then international chain of highly successful restaurants. Frank Flake, a young man intent on entering medical school, becomes Bea's business manager.\nJessie and Peola have grown up side by side. Peola is painfully aware of the tension between her white appearance and black racial identity. She continually attempts to pass as white to gain wider advantages. Disturbed by her daughter's unhappiness, Delilah encourages the girl to take pride in her black \"race.\" Eventually, after living in Seattle for several years as a white woman, Peola severs all ties with her family. She marries a white man and moves to Bolivia to pass permanently. Heartbroken, Delilah dies.\nBea falls in love with Flake, who is eight years her junior. Jessie, by now in her late teens, comes home for a visit just as Bea is planning on selling the \"B. Pullman\" chain and marrying Flake. The three are mired in a love triangle, resulting in a tragic ending that leaves Bea alone.\nHistorical context.\nFrom the turn of the 20th century until the Supreme Court ruled in \"Loving v. Virginia\" (1967), numerous Southern states passed laws enforcing a \"one-drop rule\", requiring that persons of any known African ancestry had to be classified in records as black. Only black and white were recognized as racial categories, and blacks were restricted by racial segregation laws. Virginia enacted a law regarding \"passing\" in 1924.\nHurst stated that her novel was written because of a \"consciousness\" that came from how African-American soldiers had fought for their country in World War I even though they were discriminated against at home.\nLiterary significance and criticism.\nHurst was a Jewish woman and supporter of feminist causes. She also supported African Americans in their struggle for greater equality. She was deeply involved in the Harlem Renaissance, especially with Zora Neale Hurston. Hurst helped sponsor Hurston in her first year at Barnard College and employed Hurston briefly as an executive secretary. The two traveled together on road trips that may have contributed to Hurst's understanding of racial discrimination. Both Hurston and Langston Hughes claimed to like \"Imitation of Life\", though both reversed their opinion after Sterling Allen Brown lambasted both the book and the 1934 film adaptation in a review entitled \"Imitation of Life: Once a Pancake\", a reference to a line in the first film.\nThe novel \"Imitation of Life\" continues to provoke controversy, as some read it as heavy-handed stereotyping, while others see it as a more subtle and subversive satire of and commentary on race, sex, and class in early 20th-century America. The book was adapted twice as film, in 1934 and 1959. Both the novel and films have remained deeply embedded in the American consciousness. In 1970, Toni Morrison named one of her characters \"Pecola\" in her novel \"The Bluest Eye\".\nThe novel version has Peola leave for good, while in both films, the Peola character (named Sarah Jane in the second film) returns, attends her mother's funeral, and shows remorse. Molly Hiro contends the \"premature removal of Peola\" from the novel version of the story \"not only allows her successfully to escape the \u201cblackness\u201d she has resisted, but also keeps the character at a distance from readers, thereby rendering her incapable of representing a legible message about racial authenticity.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It also won the academy's first Award for Best Original Score.\nPlot.\nOpera singer Mary Barrett (Grace Moore) leaves to study music in Milan, Italy to the disappointment of her family in New York City. Mary gets a job at the Cafe Roma, where Giulio Monteverdi (Tullio Carminati), a famous vocal coach, hears her sing. Giulio promises to make Mary a star if she will allow him to control her life. He also tells her that there cannot be any romance between the two of them, as that would distract from the process of growing her talent. Mary discovers she has stagefright as she prepares for a tour of provincial opera houses, however Giulio helps her overcome it.\nYears later, still under Giulio's tutelage, Mary begins to tire of his dominance and discipline. The two meet one of Giulio's old pupils, Lally (Mona Barrie), while in Vienna. Lally once tried to be romantic with Giulio, but was rejected. This past history renders Mary jealous and she pretends to have laryngitis. Mary thinks Giulio has gone to Lally to rekindle a romance, and so visits Bill Houston (Lyle Talbot), a longtime friend who has proposed marriage.

According to a later biography, she flew into a rage and blamed the orchestra. However, when studio boss Harry Cohn asked Columbia music director, Morris Stoloff, what the problem was, Stoloff replied, \"There's nothing wrong with the orchestra. These are the original Puccini orchestrations.\" Moore was then told that either she went back to the recording stage or she would be responsible for paying the day's salary for the entire orchestra, and she returned and recorded the aria.\nFeatured music.\nGrace Moore's title song \"One Night of Love\" was composed by Victor Schertzinger himself, with lyrics by Gus Kahn. The lyrics began \"One Night Of Love, When two hearts are one\". It was later recorded by Anna Moffo as the title track of a 1965 crossover album. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReception.\n\"One Night of Love\" was selected as one of the ten best pictures of 1934 by \"Film Daily\"'s annual poll of critics.\nThrough October 1936 \"One Night of Love\" had theater rentals in the U.S. and Canada of over $733,000 according to Variety magazine surveys of the time. The film earned an estimated $2.5 million worldwide.

She began as a flower seller in a restaurant in her hometown, singing popular ballads as she sold blossoms. \nEntertainer.\nAfter taking classes in theatre and singing, she began her career as an entertainer in 1885. One day on the train to Paris for a violin lesson, she met Saint-Marcel, who directed the revue at the Casino de Paris. He engaged her first as a stage-hand, and here she began to pursue her goal to become an entertainer, experimenting with various stage-names, being successively Miss Helyett, Miss Tinguette, Mistinguette and, finally, Mistinguett. In the 1880s Mistinguett visited her neighbour Anna Thibaud to ask for advice. Thibaud told her, \"To succeed in the theatre ... you must be pretty. You must excite men.\" Mistinguett asked if she meant that she had to excite the crowds. Thibaud repeated, \"No, the men!\"\nBourgeois made her debut as Mistinguett at the Casino de Paris in 1895 and went on to appear in venues such as the Folies Berg\u00e8re, Moulin Rouge and Eldorado. Her risqu\u00e9 routines captivated Paris, and she went on to become the most popular French entertainer of her time and the highest-paid female entertainer in the world, known for her flamboyance and a zest for the theatrical. In 1919, her legs were insured for 500,000 Francs.\nThough Mistinguett never married, she had a son, Leopoldo Jo\u00e3o de Lima e Silva, born in 1901, from a liaison she had with a Brazilian diplomat, Leopoldo Jos\u00e9 de Lima e Silva (1872\u20131931). She also had a long relationship with Maurice Chevalier, 15 years her junior. It is claimed that she and Chevalier informed the police in 1940 that singer-songwriter Charles Trenet was gay and consorting with youths.\nShe first recorded her signature song, \"Mon Homme\" in 1920. It was popularised under its English title \"My Man\" by Fanny Brice and has become a standard in the of numerous pop and jazz singers.\nDuring a tour of the United States, Mistinguett was asked by \"Time\" magazine to explain her popularity.

Van Dyke\nThe Thin Man is a 1934 American pre-Code comedy-mystery film directed by W. S. Van Dyke and based on the 1934 novel by Dashiell Hammett. The film stars William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, a leisure-class couple who enjoy copious drinking and flirtatious banter. Nick is a retired private detective who left his very successful career when he married Nora, a wealthy heiress accustomed to high society. Their wire-haired fox terrier Asta was played by canine actor Skippy. In 1997, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry having been deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nThe film's screenplay was written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, a married couple. In 1934, the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The eponymous \"Thin Man\" is not Nick Charles, but the man Charles is initially hired to find \u2013 Clyde Wynant. In the original novel Charles is described as being overweight and out of shape while Charles describes Wynant as a \"thin man with white hair\". The trim William Powell was cast for the films, leading many viewers to believe it referred to Nick Charles and, it was subsequently used in the titles of sequels as if referring to Charles. It was followed by five sequels.\nPlot.\nDorothy Wynant discusses her upcoming wedding with her father Clyde. She is surprised that her fianc\u00e9, Tommy, knows all about her family yet still wants to marry her. Later, her father discovers that bonds worth $50,000, intended as a wedding present for his daughter, are missing. The only other person who knows the combination of the safe in which they were kept is his secretary and mistress, Julia Wolf. When he confronts Julia about the missing bonds, she confesses that she cashed them in and has only $25,000 left. He threatens to call the police unless she comes up with the other $25,000.\nNick Charles is a retired detective who once did a job for Clyde. Nick and his wealthy wife, Nora, live in San Francisco but are visiting New York City for Christmas, staying in a glamorous apartment-like suite at the Hotel Normandie. While in New York, Nick is pressed back into service by Dorothy, as her father, the \"Thin Man\" of the title, had left on a secret business trip with a promise to return home before his daughter's wedding, but he has mysteriously disappeared. According to his attorney, Herbert MacCauley, he had been sending money to Wynant from time to time while Wynant was away on his trip. Dorothy convinces Nick to take the case, with the assistance of his socialite wife, who is eager to see him in action.\nWhat appears to be a missing person situation rapidly turns into a murder case when Julia Wolf is found dead and evidence points to Clyde as the prime suspect. Dorothy refuses to believe that her father is guilty. Nick and Police Lieutenant Guild visit Arthur Nunheim, a petty criminal who regularly provides information to the lieutenant. After being pressed for information, Nunheim excuses himself momentarily, only to slip away down the fire escape. Later he arranges a meeting with the yet-unidentified murderer to collect $5,000 from him, in exchange for keeping quiet about the murder. When Nunheim arrives, however, he is immediately shot four times and killed with what police find was the same gun that killed Julia Wolf.\nPolice think Wynant is guilty of both murders after his ex-wife, Mimi Wynant Jorgenson, provides evidence that implicates him. On a hunch, Nick visits Wynant's closed shop in the dead of night and uses his dog Asta's nose to find a skeletonized, but fully dressed, body, buried under the floor. In the dark shop, Wynant's former bookkeeper, Tanner, a man known to Nick as an ex-con, suddenly appears. He had been hired by Julia Wolf and admits to having stolen money from Wynant, claiming to have come back to return the money and \"clean up the books.\" When the police arrive, they conclude that Wynant committed the murders of Julia, Nunheim, and this newly discovered body, assuming that the remains belong to the \"Fat Man\"\u2014a long-ago enemy of Wynant's\u2014because of its oversized clothing with a belt buckle bearing an \"R\" (for \"Rosebreen\", that notorious figure's surname).\nNick\u2014who had accompanied the medical examiner when he X-rayed the buried body\u2014theorizes that the clothes were planted to hide the body's true identity of Clyde Wynant, as the X-ray revealed telltale shrapnel which matched Wynant's old war wound. Nick deduces that the real culprit murdered Clyde once he discovered that the killer had been embezzling from him. The culprit then murdered his own accomplice, Julia Wolf, because she knew about Clyde's murder, and after that, he murdered Nunheim since he had witnessed Julia's murder and was blackmailing him.\nSince Nick has already all but solved the case, he invites the full cast of suspects to an elegant dinner party to expose the murderer. Nick unfurls his theory to the dinner guests, informing them that Wynant isn't the killer, and that he saw Wynant the night before (not revealing he meant Wynant's corpse). Several guests claim to have also seen Wynant the night before. As Nick provides potential evidence about each guest as the possible murderer, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCauley panics and tries to shoot Nick. Nick punches him out and declares MacCauley to be the murderer.\nAfter murdering Wynant and then Wolf, MacCauley had sought to clean out Wynant's bank account by making it look like Wynant was just away on a business trip. He also paid off Wynant's ex, Mimi Wynant Jorgenson, to throw police off the scent in Julia Wolf's murder, having her provide evidence to the police that would implicate her cheating ex-husband in that case. He didn't inform Mimi that Wynant was dead, and that she was entitled to her ex-husband's entire estate, not just the small bribe MacCauley paid her.\nLater, Nick and Nora, along with Dorothy and her new husband Tommy, celebrate as they ride a luxury train back to California. Nora, in the lower bunk, wants to sleep with Asta, but Nick tosses Asta to the upper bunk and joins Nora himself. Asta looks down on the couple and covers his eyes with his paw. The film ends with a short rendition of \"California, Here I Come\".\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* William Powell as Nick Charles\nCast notes:\nProduction.\nScreenplay.\nThe film was based on the novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett, released in January 1934. Hammett's novel drew on his experiences as a union-busting Pinkerton detective in Butte, Montana. Hammett based Nick and Nora's banter upon his rocky on-again, off-again relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman.\nMGM paid Hammett $21,000 for the screen rights to the novel. The screenplay was written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, who had been married for three years. Director W.S. Van Dyke encouraged them to use Hammett's writing as a basis only, and to concentrate on providing witty exchanges for Nick and Nora.\nCasting.\nVan Dyke convinced MGM executives to let Powell and Loy portray the lead characters despite concerns that Powell was too old and strait-laced to play Nick Charles and that Loy had become typecast in exotic femme fatale roles.\nSkippy played Asta, the dog of Nick and Nora. Skippy was subsequently cast in two screwball comedy classics, \"The Awful Truth\" (1937) and \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938).\nFilming.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Nick and Nora were the] first on-screen Hollywood couple for whom matrimony did not signal the end of sex, romance and adventure.\u2014\u200a\nThe film was shot with a budget of $226,408 by cinematographer James Wong Howe. For Powell's first scene in the film, Van Dyke told him to take the cocktail shaker, go to the bar and just walk through the scene while the crew checked lights and sound. Powell did it, throwing in some lines and business of his own. Suddenly he heard Van Dyke say, \"That's it! Print it!\" The director had decided to shoot the scene without Powell knowing it so that he would be as relaxed and natural as possible.\nVan Dyke often did not bother with cover shots if he felt the scene was right on the first take, reasoning that actors \"lose their fire\" if they have to do something over and over. It was a lot of pressure on the actors, who often had to learn new lines and business immediately before shooting, without the luxury of retakes, but Loy credited much of the appeal of the film to Van Dyke's pacing and spontaneity. He paid the most attention to Powell and Loy's easy banter between takes and their obvious enjoyment of each other's company and worked it into the movie. The director often encouraged and incorporated improvisation and off-the-cuff details into the picture. In order to keep her entrance fresh and spontaneous, Van Dyke did not tell Loy about it until right before they shot it.\nPowell loved working so much with Loy because of her naturalness, her professionalism, and her lack of any kind of \"diva\" temperament. Of her, Powell said: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When we did a scene together, we forgot about technique, camera angles, and microphones. We weren't acting. We were just two people in perfect harmony. Myrna, unlike some actresses who think only of themselves, has the happy faculty of being able to listen while the other fellow says his lines. She has the give and takes of acting that brings out the best.\nAccording to Loy, the actors were not allowed to interact between takes with the dog Skippy; trainers felt it would break his concentration. Skippy once bit Loy during filming.\nAlthough she had great compliments for Powell's charm and wit, Maureen O'Sullivan (who played the daughter of Wynant) later said she did not enjoy making the picture because her part was so small and the production was so rushed.\nThe scene of Nick shooting the ornaments off the tree was added after Powell playfully picked up an air gun and started shooting ornaments the art department was putting up.\nLoy wrote that the biggest problem during shooting was the climactic dinner party scene in which Nick reveals the killer. Powell complained that he had too many lines to learn and could barely decipher the complicated plot he was unraveling. It was the one scene when several retakes were necessary, which brought up an entirely new problem. The script called for oysters to be served to the dinner guests and, in take after take, the same plate of oysters was brought out under the hot lights. Loy recalled that \"they began to putrefy. By the time we finished that scene, nobody ever wanted to see another oyster\".\nReception.\nThe film was released on May 25, 1934, to overwhelmingly positive reviews, with special praise for the chemistry between Loy and Powell. Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" called it \"an excellent combination of comedy and excitement\", and the film appeared on the \"Times\" year-end list of the ten best of the year. \"Variety\" reported that \"\"The Thin Man\" was an entertaining novel, and now it's an entertaining picture. For its leads the studio couldn't have done better than to pick Powell and Miss Loy, both of whom shade their semi-comic roles beautifully\". \"Film Daily\" raved: \"The screen seldom presents a more thoroughly interesting piece of entertainment than this adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's popular novel. The rapid fire dialogue is about the best heard since talkies, and it is delivered by Powell and Miss Loy to perfection\". John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that Loy and Powell played their parts \"beautifully\", adding: \"All the people of the book are there, and I think the final scenes of the solution of the mystery are handled on a higher note than they were in print\". Louella Parsons called it \"the greatest entertainment, the most fun and the best mystery-drama of the year\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" said that it was \"exciting\", \"amusing\" and \"fat with ultra, ultra-sophisticated situations and dialog\". It also called Powell and Loy \"delightful\". Harrison Carroll of \"The Los Angeles Herald-Express\" wrote that it was \"one of the cleverest adaptations of a popular novel that Hollywood has ever turned out\".\nThe film was such a box-office success that it spawned five sequels:\n\"The Thin Man\" was voted one of the ten best pictures of 1934 by \"Film Daily\"'s annual poll of critics.\nIn 2002, critic Roger Ebert added the film to his list of Great Movies. Ebert praised William Powell's performance in particular, stating that Powell \"is to dialogue as Fred Astaire is to dance. His delivery is so droll and insinuating, so knowing and innocent at the same time, that it hardly matters what he's saying\".\nThe Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited \"The Thin Man\" as one of his favorite films.\nThe film is 32nd on the American Film Institute's 2000 list AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs and was nominated for the following lists:\n Nick Charles: \"It's not true. He didn't come anywhere near my tabloids\".\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"The Thin Man\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 47 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Featuring an involving mystery and sparkling repartee between William Powell and Myrna Loy, \"The Thin Man\" is an endlessly charming romp.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 86 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating .\nBox office.\n\"The Thin Man\" earned total theater rentals of $1,423,000, with $818,000 from the US and Canada and $605,000 in other foreign rentals, resulting in a profit of $729,000.\nTrailer.\nThe trailer contained specially filmed footage in which Nick Charles (William Powell) is seen on the cover of the Dashiell Hammett novel \"The Thin Man\". Nick Charles then steps out of the cover to talk to fellow detective Philo Vance (also played by Powell) about his latest case. Charles mentions he hasn't seen Vance since \"The Kennel Murder Case\", a film in which Powell played Vance, released in October 1933, just seven months prior to the release of \"The Thin Man\". Charles goes on to explain to Vance that his latest case revolves around a \"tall, thin man\" (referring to Clyde Wynant's character), just before clips of the film are shown.\nAdaptations.\n\"The Thin Man\" was dramatized as a radio play on an hour-long broadcast of \"Lux Radio Theatre\" on June 8, 1936. William Powell, Myrna Loy, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall, William Henry, and Thomas Jackson reprised their film roles, and W. S. Van Dyke was host.\nHome media.\nLong available on VHS and DVD, \"The Thin Man\" was released on Blu-ray Disc by the Warner Archive Collection on July 30, 2019. The 1080p high-definition master was made from a 4K restoration based on new transfers of the picture's best surviving film elements, with digital correction of a multitude of defects seen in earlier home-media releases. Blu-ray.com reported that the film \"looks exceptional and, aside from a true 4K option, will likely never get a better home video release\". Extras include the theatrical trailer, the 1936 \"Lux Radio Theatre\" broadcast, and the 1958 second-season premiere of the NBC television series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Wellman\nViva Villa! is a 1934 American pre-Code Western film directed by Jack Conway and starring Wallace Beery as Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. The screenplay was written by Ben Hecht, adapted from the 1933 book \"Viva Villa!\" by Edgecumb Pinchon and O. B. Stade. Parts of the film were shot on location in Mexico and produced by David O. Selznick. There was uncredited assistance with the script by Howard Hawks, James Kevin McGuinness, and Howard Emmett Rogers. Hawks and William A. Wellman were also uncredited directors on the film.\nThe film is a highly fictionalized biography of Pancho Villa starring Beery in the title role and featuring Fay Wray, who had played the leading lady in \"King Kong\" the previous year. The supporting cast includes Leo Carrillo, Donald Cook, Stuart Erwin, Henry B. Walthall, Joseph Schildkraut and Katherine DeMille.\nPlot.\nAfter seeing his poor father lose his land and be whipped to death for protesting, young Pancho Villa stabs one of the killers, then heads off into the hills of Chihuahua, Mexico during the 1880s. As a grown man, Villa and a band of rebel bandits, including his trusted ally Sierra, kill wealthy landowners and become heroes to their fellow \"peons\".\nA wealthy aristocrat, Don Felipe, arranges an introduction for Villa to the distinguished and eloquent Francisco Madero, who resents what has become of Mexico under the rule of president Porfirio D\u00edaz and persuades Villa to help him fight for liberty, not just for personal gain. The coarse and illiterate Villa is humbled in the presence of Madero and agrees to fight for his cause. He also is attracted to Don Felipe's beautiful sister Teresa, although there are many women in Villa's life, including one he is married to, Rosita.\nVilla's exploits are made even more colorful by an American newspaper reporter, Johnny Sykes, to whom Villa has taken a great liking. While drunk, Sykes is misinformed and reports that Villa has already overtaken the village of Santa Rosalia in a great victory for his men. Disobeying the orders of Madero and the arrogant General Pascal, simply to help his newspaper friend, Villa stages a raid on Santa Rosalia, as well as on Juarez.\nMadero ultimately assumes office in Mexico City, then commands Villa to disband his personal army. Villa agrees, but when Sierra kills a bank teller just so Villa can withdraw his money, Villa himself ends up sentenced to death. A gloating General Pascal mocks the way Villa pleads for his life, then reads a telegram from Madero, ordering that Villa instead be exiled from the country.\nAlone and drunk in El Paso, Texas, feeling forsaken by his homeland, Villa is visited by Sykes, who informs him that Madero has been assassinated by the power-mad Pascal and his men. Villa returns to Mexico and rebuilds his own army, recruiting tens of thousands to ride by his side. Together they storm the capital, where Pascal is subjected to a particularly gruesome death. Villa takes what he wants, but when Teresa resists and he physically assaults her, she draws a gun that her brother Don Felipe has given her for protection. Sierra intervenes and murders her.\nVilla appoints himself president but is ineffectual, unable to restore Madero's dream of land reform for Mexico's poor. He ultimately agrees to step aside and go back to where he belongs, including to his wife. Before he can, with Sykes by his side, Villa is gunned down by Don Felipe out of revenge for his sister. Sykes vows to keep Villa's memory alive, telling his dying friend that he is no longer news, but history.\nProduction and release.\nDavid O. Selznick began filming \"Viva Villa!\" in 1932 in Mexico. Between filming and its release in April 1934, the film went through a development hell.\nInitially, Lee Tracy was cast to play a role of Jonny Sykes. However, following an incident on a Mexican balcony, from which he urinated on military cadets during a parade, he was fired from the film and eventually was replaced by Stuart Erwin.\nOn September 29, 1933, Pancho Villa's son, Pancho Augustin Villa Jr. was signed to cast in a role of a young Pancho Villa.\nThe film also experienced script problems requiring a change of as many as three writers and two directors (William Wellman and Howard Hawks, both uncredited).\n\"Viva Villa!\" premiered at the Paramount Theatre in Los Angeles on May 17, 1934.\nWhen the film premiered in Mexico on September 7, 1934, exploding firecrackers interrupted the showing.\nReception.\n\"Viva Villa!\" was popular at the box office and was voted one of the ten best pictures of 1934 by \"The Film Daily\"'s annual poll of critics.\n\"Variety\" called the film a \"corking western\", while Helen Brown-Norden of \"Vanity Fair\" wrote \"There is also no denying the fact that Wallace Beery is not everybody's Villa\".\nDuring the film's production, the Mexican press called it \"derogatory to Mexico\", and urged the film to be boycotted in Mexico.\nIn 2025, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed \"Vila Villa!\" as having the best stunts of 1934.\nBox office.\nIn its initial release \"Viva Villa!\" earned total theater rentals of $1,875,000, with $941,000 from the US and Canada and $934,000 elsewhere.

He was noted for irony, characterization, dark humour, social commentary, historical settings and challenging vocabulary and syntax.\nHis early long poems (1833) and \"Paracelsus\" (1835) were acclaimed, but his reputation dwindled for a time \u2013 his 1840 poem \"Sordello\" was seen as wilfully obscure \u2013 and took over a decade to recover, by which time he had moved from Shelleyan forms to a more personal style. In 1846, he married fellow poet Elizabeth Barrett and moved to Italy. By her death in 1861, he had published the collection \"Men and Women\" (1855). His \"Dramatis Personae\" (1864) and book-length epic poem \"The Ring and the Book\" (1868\u20131869) made him a leading poet. By his death in 1889, he was seen as a sage and philosopher-poet who had fed into Victorian social and political discourse. Societies for studying his work survived in Britain and the US into the 20th century.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nBrowning was born in Walworth in the parish of Camberwell, Surrey, which now forms part of the Borough of Southwark in south London. He was baptised on 14 June 1812, at Lock's Fields Independent Chapel, York Street, Walworth, the only son of Sarah Anna (n\u00e9e Wiedemann) and Robert Browning. His father was a well-paid clerk for the Bank of England, earning about \u00a3150 per year. Browning's paternal grandfather was a slave owner in Saint Kitts, West Indies, but Browning's father was an abolitionist. Browning's father had been sent to the West Indies to work on a sugar plantation but returned to England following a slave revolt. Browning's mother was the daughter of a German shipowner who had settled in Dundee, Scotland with his Scottish wife. His paternal grandmother, Margaret Tittle, had inherited a plantation in St Kitts and was rumoured in the family to have a mixed-race ancestry including some Jamaican blood, but author Julia Markus suggests she was Kittitian rather than Jamaican. The evidence is inconclusive. Robert's father, a literary collector, had a library of some 6,000 books; many of them were rare so that Robert grew up in a household with significant literary resources. His mother, to whom he was close, was a devout nonconformist and a talented musician. His younger sister, Sarianna, also gifted, became her brother's companion in his later years, after the death of his wife in 1861. His father encouraged his children's interest in literature and the arts.\nBy the age of 12, Browning had written a book of poetry, which he later destroyed for want of a publisher. After attending one or two private schools and showing an insuperable dislike of school life, he was educated at home by a tutor, using the resources of his father's library. By 14 he was fluent in French, Greek, Italian and Latin. He became an admirer of the Romantic poets, especially Shelley, whom he followed in becoming an atheist and a vegetarian. At 16, he studied Greek at University College London, but left after his first year. His parents' evangelical faith prevented his studying at either Oxford or Cambridge University, both then open only to members of the Church of England. He had inherited substantial musical ability through his mother, and composed arrangements of various songs. He refused a formal career and ignored his parents' remonstrations by dedicating himself to poetry. He stayed at home until the age of 34, financially dependent on his family until his marriage. His father sponsored the publication of his son's poems.\nFirst published works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n (ll. 192\u2013200)\n&lt;poem&gt;Some one shall somehow run a muck\nWith this old world, for want of strife\nSound asleep: contrive, contrive\nTo rouse us, Waring! Who's alive?\nOur men scarce seem in earnest now:\nDistinguished names!\u2014but 'tis, somehow,\nAs if they played at being names\nStill more distinguished, like the games\nOf children.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"Bells and Pomegranates No. III: Dramatic Lyrics\" (1842)\nIn March 1833, \"Pauline, a Fragment of a Confession\" was published anonymously by Saunders and Otley at the expense of the author, Robert Browning, who received the money from his aunt, Mrs Silverthorne. It is a long poem composed in homage to the poet Shelley and somewhat in his style. Originally Browning considered \"Pauline\" as the first of a series written by different aspects of himself, but he soon abandoned this idea. The press noticed the publication. W. J. Fox writing in \"The Monthly Repository\" of April 1833 discerned merit in the work. Allan Cunningham praised it in the \"Athenaeum\". However, it sold no copies. Some years later, probably in 1850, Dante Gabriel Rossetti came across it in the Reading Room of the British Museum and wrote to Browning, then in Florence, to ask if he was the author. John Stuart Mill, however, wrote that the author suffered from an \"intense and morbid self-consciousness\". Later Browning was rather embarrassed by the work, and only included it in his collected poems of 1868 after making substantial changes and adding a preface in which he asked for indulgence for a boyish work.\nIn 1834, he accompanied the Chevalier George de Benkhausen, the Russian consul-general, on a brief visit to St Petersburg and began \"Paracelsus\", which was published in 1835. The subject of the 16th-century savant and alchemist was probably suggested to him by the Comte Am\u00e9d\u00e9e de Ripart-Monclar, to whom it was dedicated. The publication had some commercial and critical success, being noticed by Wordsworth, Dickens, Landor, J. S. Mill and the already famous Tennyson. It is a monodrama without action, dealing with the problems confronting an intellectual trying to find his role in society. It gained him access to the London literary world.\nAs a result of his new contacts he met Macready, who invited him to write a play. \"Strafford\" was performed five times. Browning then wrote two other plays, one of which was not performed, while the other failed, Browning having fallen out with Macready.\nIn 1838, he visited Italy looking for background for \"Sordello\", a long poem in heroic couplets, presented as the imaginary biography of the Mantuan bard spoken of by Dante in the Divine Comedy, canto 6 of Purgatory, set against a background of hate and conflict during the wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines. This was published in 1840 and met with widespread derision, gaining him the reputation of wanton carelessness and obscurity. Tennyson, jokingly, commented that he only understood the first and last lines. Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of Thomas Carlyle (a friend of Browning's who deeply influenced Browning's poetry), quipped that she read the poem through and \"could not tell whether Sordello was a [sic] 'a book, a city, or a man'\".\nBrowning's reputation began to make a partial recovery with the publication, 1841\u20131846, of \"Bells and Pomegranates\", a series of eight pamphlets, originally intended just to include his plays. Fortunately for Browning's career, his publisher, Moxon, persuaded him to include some \"dramatic lyrics\", some of which had already appeared in periodicals.\nMarriage.\nIn 1845, Browning met the poet Elizabeth Barrett, six years his senior, who lived as a semi-invalid in her father's house in Wimpole Street, London. They began regularly corresponding and gradually a romance developed between them, leading to their marriage and journey to Italy (for Elizabeth's health) on 12 September 1846. The marriage was initially secret because Elizabeth's domineering father disapproved of marriage for any of his children. Mr. Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did each of his children who married: \"The Mrs. Browning of popular imagination was a sweet, innocent young woman who suffered endless cruelties at the hands of a tyrannical papa but who nonetheless had the good fortune to fall in love with a dashing and handsome poet named Robert Browning.\" At her husband's insistence, the second edition of Elizabeth's \"Poems\" included her love sonnets. The book increased her popularity and high critical regard, cementing her position as an eminent Victorian poet. Upon William Wordsworth's death in 1850, she was a serious contender to become Poet Laureate, the position eventually going to Tennyson.\nFrom the time of their marriage and until Elizabeth's death, the Brownings lived in Italy, residing first in Pisa, and then, within a year, finding an apartment in Florence at Casa Guidi (now a museum to their memory). Their only child, Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning, nicknamed \"Penini\" or \"Pen\", was born in 1849. In these years Browning was fascinated by, and learned from, the art and atmosphere of Italy. He would, in later life, describe Italy as his university. As Elizabeth had inherited money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy, and their relationship together was happy. However, the literary assault on Browning's work did not let up and he was critically dismissed further, by patrician writers such as Charles Kingsley, for deserting England.\nPolitical views.\nBrowning identified as a liberal, supported the emancipation of women, and opposed slavery, expressing sympathy for the North in the American Civil War. Later in life, he even championed animal rights in several poems attacking vivisection. He was also a stalwart opponent of anti-Semitism, leading to speculation that Browning himself was Jewish. In 1877 he wrote a poem explaining \"Why I am a Liberal\" in which he declared: \"Who then dares hold \u2013 emancipated thus / His fellow shall continue bound? Not I.\" Critical attention to Browning's politics has, in general, been sparse. Isobel Armstrong's writing on dramatic monologues, as well as more recent work on the influence of \"Coriolanus\" on Browning's politics, has attempted to situate the poet's political sensibility at the centre of his practice.\nReligious beliefs.\nBrowning was raised in an evangelical non-conformist household. However, after his reading of Shelley he is said to have briefly become an atheist. Browning is also said to have made an uncharacteristic admission of faith to Alfred Domett, when he is said to have admired Byron's poetry \"as a Christian\". Poems such as \"Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day\" seem to confirm this Christian faith, strengthened by his wife. However, many have dismissed the usefulness of these works at discovering Browning's own religious views due to the consistent use of dramatic monologue which regularly expresses hypothetical views which cannot be ascribed to the author himself.\nSpiritualism incident.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n (opening lines)\n&lt;poem&gt;Now, don't, sir! Don't expose me!

When Browning and his wife Elizabeth attended one of his s\u00e9ances on 23 July 1855, a spirit face materialized, which Home claimed was Browning's son who had died in infancy: Browning seized the \"materialization\" and discovered it to be Home's bare foot. To make the deception worse, Browning had never lost a son in infancy.\nAfter the s\u00e9ance, Browning wrote an angry letter to \"The Times\", in which he said: \"the whole display of hands, spirit utterances etc., was a cheat and imposture.\" In 1902 Browning's son Pen wrote: \"Home was detected in a vulgar fraud.\" Elizabeth, however, was convinced that the phenomena she witnessed were genuine, and her discussions about Home with her husband were a constant source of disagreement.\nMajor works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n (ll. 21\u201333)\n&lt;poem&gt;He stood and watched the cobbler at his trade,\nThe man who slices lemons into drink,\nThe coffee-roaster's brazier, and the boys\nThat volunteer to help him turn its winch.\nHe glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye,\nAnd fly-leaf ballads on the vendor's string,\nAnd broad-edge bold-print posters by the wall.\nHe took such cognizance of men and things,\nIf any beat a horse, you felt he saw;\nIf any cursed a woman, he took note;\nYet stared at nobody\u2014you stared at him,\nAnd found, less to your pleasure than surprise,\nHe seemed to know you and expect as much.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"Men and Women\" (1855)\nIn Florence, probably from early in 1853, Browning worked on the poems that eventually composed his two-volume \"Men and Women\", for which he is now well known, although in 1855, when they were published, they made relatively little impact.\nIn 1861, Elizabeth died in Florence. Among those whom he found consoling in that period was the novelist and poet Isa Blagden, with whom he and his wife had had a voluminous correspondence. The following year Browning returned to London, taking Pen with him, who by then was 12 years old. They made their home in 17 Warwick Crescent, Maida Vale. It was only when he became part of the London literary scene\u2014albeit while paying frequent visits to Italy (though never again to Florence)\u2014that his reputation started to take off.\nIn 1868, after five years' work, he completed and published the long blank-verse poem \"The Ring and the Book\". Based on a convoluted murder-case from 1690s Rome, the poem is composed of 12 books: essentially 10 lengthy dramatic monologues narrated by various characters in the story, showing their individual perspectives on events, bookended by an introduction and conclusion by Browning himself. Long even by Browning's standards (over twenty-thousand lines), \"The Ring and the Book\" was his most ambitious project and is arguably his greatest work; it has been called a \"tour de force\" of dramatic poetry. Published in four parts from November 1868 to February 1869, the poem was a success both commercially and critically, and finally brought Browning the renown he had sought for nearly 40 years. The Robert Browning Society was formed in 1881 and his work was recognised as belonging within the British literary canon.\nLast years and death.\nIn the remaining years of his life Browning travelled extensively. After a series of long poems published in the early 1870s, of which \"Balaustion's Adventure\" and \"Red Cotton Night-Cap Country\" were the best-received, the volume \"Pacchiarotto, and How He Worked in Distemper\" included an attack against Browning's critics, especially Alfred Austin, who was later to become Poet Laureate. According to some reports Browning became romantically involved with Louisa Caroline Stewart-Mackenzie, Lady Ashburton, but he refused her proposal of marriage, and did not remarry. In 1878, he revisited Italy for the first time in the seventeen years since Elizabeth's death, and returned there on several further occasions. In 1887, Browning produced the major work of his later years, \"Parleyings with Certain People of Importance in Their Day\". It finally presented the poet speaking in his own voice, engaging in a series of dialogues with long-forgotten figures of literary, artistic, and philosophic history. The Victorian public was baffled by this, and Browning returned to the brief, concise lyric for his last volume, \"Asolando\" (1889), published on the day of his death.\nBrowning died at his son's home Ca' Rezzonico in Venice on 12 December 1889. He was buried in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey; his grave now lies immediately adjacent to that of Alfred Tennyson.\nDuring his life Browning was awarded many distinctions. He was made LL.D. of Edinburgh, a life Governor of London University, and had the offer of the Lord Rectorship of Glasgow. But he turned down anything that involved public speaking.\nHistory of sound recording.\nAt a dinner party on 7 April 1889, at the home of Browning's friend the artist Rudolf Lehmann, an Edison cylinder phonograph recording was made on a white wax cylinder by Edison's British representative, George Gouraud. In the recording, which still exists, Browning recites part of \"How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix\" (and can be heard apologising when he forgets the words). When the recording was played in 1890 on the anniversary of his death, at a gathering of his admirers, it was said to be the first time anyone's voice \"had been heard from beyond the grave.\"\nLegacy.\nBrowning's admirers have tended to temper their praise with reservations about the length and difficulty of his most ambitious poems, particularly \"Sordello\" and, to a lesser extent, \"The Ring and the Book\". Nevertheless, they have included such eminent writers as Henry James, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, G. K. Chesterton, Ezra Pound, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Jorge Luis Borges, and Vladimir Nabokov. Among living writers, Stephen King's \"The Dark Tower\" series, A. S. Byatt's \"Possession\", and Maggie O'Farrell's \"The Marriage Portrait\" refer directly to Browning's work.\nToday Browning's critically most esteemed poems include the monologues \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\", \"Fra Lippo Lippi\", \"Andrea Del Sarto\", and \"My Last Duchess\". His most popular poems include \"Porphyria's Lover\", \"How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix\", the diptych \"Meeting at Night\", the patriotic \"Home Thoughts from Abroad\", and the children's poem \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\". His abortive dinner-party recital of \"How They Brought The Good News\" was recorded on an Edison wax cylinder, and is believed to be one of the oldest surviving recordings made in the United Kingdom of a notable person (a recording of Sir Arthur Sullivan's voice was made about six months earlier).\nBrowning is now popularly known for such poems as ', ', ', and ', and also for certain famous lines: \"Grow old along with me!\" (\"\"), \"A man's reach should exceed his grasp\" and \"Less is more\" (\"Andrea Del Sarto\"), \"It was roses, roses all the way\" (\"The Patriot\"), and \"God's in His heaven\u2014All's right with the world!\" (\"Pippa Passes\").\nHis critical reputation has traditionally rested mainly on his dramatic monologues, in which the words not only convey setting and action but reveal the speaker's character. In a Browning monologue, unlike a soliloquy, the meaning is not what the speaker voluntarily reveals but what he inadvertently gives away, usually while rationalising past actions or special pleading his case to a silent auditor. These monologues have been influential, and today the best of them are often treated by teachers and lecturers as paradigm cases of the monologue form. One such example used by teachers today is his satirisation of the sadistic attitude in his \"Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister\". Ian Jack, in his introduction to the Oxford University Press edition of Browning's poems 1833\u20131864, comments that Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot \"all learned from Browning's exploration of the possibilities of dramatic poetry and of colloquial idiom\".\nIn Oscar Wilde's dialogue \"The Critic as Artist\", Browning is given a famously ironical assessment: \"He is the most Shakespearean creature since Shakespeare. If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammer through a thousand mouths. [...] Yes, Browning was great. And as what will he be remembered? As a poet? Ah, not as a poet! He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what more should an artist do? Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made Hamlet. Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him. The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is George Meredith. Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.\"\nProbably the most adulatory judgment of Browning by a modern critic comes from Harold Bloom: \"Browning is the most considerable poet in English since the major Romantics, surpassing his great contemporary rival Tennyson and the principal twentieth-century poets, including even Yeats, Hardy, and Wallace Stevens. But Browning is a very difficult poet, notoriously badly served by criticism, and ill-served also by his own accounts of what he was doing as a poet... Yet when you read your way into his world, precisely his largest gift to you is his involuntary unfolding of one of the largest, most enigmatic, and most multipersoned literary and human selves you can hope to encounter.\" More recently, critics such as Annmarie Drury, H\u00e9di A. Jaouad, and Joseph Hankinson have shifted to focus on Browning's surprising receptivity to other cultures, languages, and literary traditions.\nHis work has nevertheless had many detractors, and most of his voluminous output is not widely read. In a largely hostile essay Anthony Burgess wrote: \"We all want to like Browning, but we find it very hard.\" Gerard Manley Hopkins and George Santayana were also critical. The latter expressed his views in the essay \"The Poetry of Barbarism\", which attacks Browning and Walt Whitman for what he regarded as their embrace of irrationality.\nCultural references.\nFrench composer Ang\u00e8le Raviz\u00e9 (1887-1980) used Browning\u2019s text for her vocal quartet \"Voici le Printemps\".\nThe young Henry Walford Davies made a musical setting of \"Prospice\" in 1894 for baritone and string quartet. Stephen Banfield rates it highly among musical settings of Browning, calling it \"one of his few very powerful compositions\". It has been recorded by Martin Oxenham and the Bingham String Quartet.\nIn 1914, the American modernist composer Charles Ives created the \"Robert Browning Overture\", a dense and darkly dramatic piece with gloomy overtones reminiscent of the Second Viennese School.\nIn 1917, the U.S. composer Margaret Hoberg Turrell composed a song based on Browning's poem \"Love: Such a Starved Bank of Moss\". In 1920, the U.S. composer Anne Stratton composed one based on Browning's poem \"Parting at Morning\".\nIn 1930, the story of Browning and his wife was made into the play \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\", by Rudolph Besier. It was a success and brought popular fame to the couple in the United States. The role of Elizabeth became a signature role for the actress Katharine Cornell. It was twice adapted into film. It was also the basis of the stage musical \"Robert and Elizabeth\", with music by Ron Grainer and book and lyrics by Ronald Millar.\nTerence Rattigan's play \"The Browning Version\" (1948) refers to a translation by the poet Robert Browning of \"\u201cAgamemnon\u201d\" (1877), a classical Greek tragedy in which the main character is murdered by his wife, aided by her lover. The play explores the transformative power of literature. It was adapted in two films, one directed by Anthony Asquith in 1951 and the other directed by Mike Figgis in 1994.\nBrowning is an important character in Michael Dibdin's 1986 novel \"A rich full death\". \nIn A.S. Byatt's 1990 novel \"Possession\", the fictional Victorian poet Randolph Henry Ash is loosely based on Robert Browning. Ash writes 19th century dramatic monologues in the style of Browning, and conducts an epistolary courtship with a fictional poet (Christabel LaMotte) that echoes Browning's letters to Elizabeth Barrett. \n\"God's in his heaven \u2013 All's right in the world\", an excerpt from his poem, Pippa Passes, is the slogan for the fictional organisation NERV from Hideaki Anno's 1995 anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion.\nA memorial plaque on the site of Browning's London home, in Warwick Crescent, Maida Vale, was unveiled on 11 December 1993.\n\"\", is a 2023 Malayalam language Indian film and it has six separate chapters and five of them are based on Robert Browning's poems.\nList of works.\nThis section lists the plays and volumes of poetry Browning published in his lifetime.

{"id": "61181", "revid": "9011961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61181", "title": "The Way of All Flesh", "text": "1903 semi-autobiographical novel by Samuel Butler\nThe Way of All Flesh (originally titled Ernest Pontifex or the Way of All Flesh) is a semi-autobiographical novel by Samuel Butler that attacks Victorian-era hypocrisy. Written between 1873 and 1884, it traces four generations of the Pontifex family. Butler dared not publish it during his lifetime, but when it was published posthumously in 1903 as \"The Way of All Flesh\" it was accepted as part of the general reaction against Victorianism. Butler's first literary executor, R. A. Streatfeild, made substantial changes to Butler's manuscript. The original manuscript was first published in 1964 as \"Ernest Pontifex or the Way of All Flesh\" by Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, edited by Daniel F. Howard.\nThe title is a quotation from the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible's translation of a Biblical Hebrew expression that is literally translated \"to go the way of all the earth\" and which signifies \"to die\". It is found in the First Book of Kings: \"I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage and shew thyself a man.\" (1 Kings 2.2). \nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked \"The Way of All Flesh\" twelfth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.\nPlot summary.\nThe story is narrated by Overton, godfather to the central character.\nThe novel takes its beginnings in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to trace Ernest's emergence from previous generations of the Pontifex family. John Pontifex was a carpenter; his son George rises in the world to become a publisher; George's son Theobald, pressed by his father to become a minister, is manipulated into marrying Christina, the daughter of a clergyman; the main character Ernest Pontifex is the eldest son of Theobald and Christina.\nThe author depicts an antagonistic relationship between Ernest and his hypocritical and domineering parents. His aunt Alethea is aware of this relationship, but dies before she can fulfil her aim of counteracting the parents' malign influence on the boy. However, shortly before her death she secretly passes a small fortune into Overton's keeping, with the agreement that once Ernest is twenty-eight, he can receive it.\nAs Ernest develops into a young man, he travels a bumpy theological road, reflecting the divisions and controversies in the Church of England in the Victorian era. Easily influenced by others at university, he starts out as an Evangelical Christian, and soon becomes a clergyman. He then falls for the lures of the High Church (and is duped out of much of his own money by a fellow clergyman). He decides that the way to regenerate the Church of England is to live among the poor, but the results are, first, that his faith in the integrity of the Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one of the poor he was hoping to convert, and, second, that under the pressures of poverty and theological doubt, he attempts a sexual assault on a woman he has incorrectly believed to be of loose morals.\nThis assault leads to a prison term. His parents disown him. His health deteriorates.\nAs he recovers he learns how to tailor and decides to make this his profession once out of prison. He rejects Christianity as superstition. He marries Ellen, a former housemaid of his parents; they have two children and set up shop together in the second-hand clothing industry. However, in due course he discovers that Ellen is both a bigamist and an alcoholic. Overton at this point intervenes and pays Ellen a stipend, and she happily leaves with another for America. He gives Ernest a job, and takes him on a trip to Continental Europe.\nWhen Ernest reaches the age of 28 he receives his aunt Alethea's gift. He returns to the family home until his mother's death; his father's influence over him wanes as Theobald's own position as a clergyman is reduced in relative stature, though to the end Theobald deliberately finds small ways to annoy him. Ernest becomes the author of controversial literature.\nCritical reputation.\nThe writer George Orwell praised the novel and called it \"a great book because it gives an honest picture of the relationship between father and son, and it could do that because Butler was a truly independent observer, and above all because he was courageous. He would say things that other people knew but didn't dare to say. And finally there was his clear, simple, straightforward way of writing, never using a long word where a short one will do.\"\nA. A. Milne, author of \"Winnie-the-Pooh\", wrote about it in his essay \"A Household Book\", published in a collection of his essays, \"Not That It Matters\":\n\"Once upon a time I discovered Samuel Butler; not the other two, but the one who wrote \"The Way of All Flesh\", the second-best novel in the English language. I say the second-best, so that, if you remind me of \"Tom Jones\", or \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\", or any other that you fancy, I can say, of course, that one is the best.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was one of the early musicals to feature a Technicolor sequence, which sparked the trend of color being used in a flurry of musicals that would hit the screens in 1929\u20131930.\n\"The Broadway Melody\" was written by Norman Houston and James Gleason from a story by Edmund Goulding and directed by Harry Beaumont. Original music was written by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, including the popular hit \"You Were Meant for Me\". The George M. Cohan classic \"Give My Regards to Broadway\" is used under the opening establishing shots of New York City, its film debut. Bessie Love was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. Today, the Technicolor sequence survives only in black and white. The film was the first musical released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was Hollywood's first all-talking musical.\nHaving been published in 1929, it entered the public domain on January 1, 2025.\nPlot.\nEddie Kearns sings \"The Broadway Melody\" and tells some chorus girls that he has brought the Mahoney Sisters vaudeville act to New York to perform it with him in the latest revue being produced by Francis Zanfield. Harriet \"Hank\" Mahoney and her sister Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie's arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big, while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. Hank declines the offer of their Uncle Jed to join a 30-week traveling show but consents to think it over.\nEddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a young girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield's revue to present their act. Flo, a dancer in Zanfield's company, sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank. Zanfield isn't interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well, saying both will work for one wage. She also convinces him to pretend that Hank's business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During a dress rehearsal for the revue, Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for \"The Broadway Melody\" and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number.\nMeanwhile, another woman is injured after falling off a set prop, and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is enamored with Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques \"Jock\" Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.\nOver the following weeks, Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deteriorating the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight her growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she's setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other, but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister's heart, runs off to Jock once again.\nAfter witnessing Queenie's fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, Hank finally realizes that they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. Hank claims to have never loved him and that she'd only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves, Hank breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.\nThere's a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie, but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances, he says it's the least she could do after all he's done for her. He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.\nSometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the return of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend, but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she's through with show business and will settle in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank live with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments that she couldn't help her sister find the happiness she deserves. Ironically, Hank's new partner is Flo, the blonde who tried to sabotage the act when the sisters first arrived in New York. The final scene shows Hank on her way to the train station. She promises her new partner that they'll be back on Broadway within six months.\nMusical numbers.\nMusic by Nacio Herb Brown, lyrics by Arthur Freed, except as noted.\nProduction.\nBecause the movie was one of the early sound features made and one of the early sound musicals, the production learned how to record sound properly by trial and error. After the rushes were viewed, the sets were modified to enhance the recording quality, and scenes were re-shot, resulting in extended days for the actors and an overall prolonged shooting schedule. It took over three hours to film Bessie Love's brief ukulele-playing scene. For earlier takes, a full orchestra was off-camera, but for later takes, the actors sang and danced to prerecorded music. A silent version of the film was produced, as there were still many motion picture theaters without sound equipment at the time.\nJohn Arnold shot with spherical lenses on 35mm black-and-white film, with one sequence in color. The film was presented in an aspect ratio of 1.37:1 (sound on disc version) and 1.20:1 (sound on film version).\nThe film featured a musical sequence for \"The Wedding of the Painted Doll\" that was presented in early two-color Technicolor (red and green filters). Color quickly became associated with the musical genre, and numerous features were released in 1929 and 1930 that either featured color sequences or were filmed entirely in color, like \"On with the Show\" (1929), \"Gold Diggers of Broadway\" (1929), \"Sally\" (1929), \"The Life of the Party\" (1930), and others. The color footage is not extant, although a few frames still survive.\nReception and legacy.\nContemporary.\n\"The Broadway Melody\" was a substantial success and made a profit of $1.6\u00a0million for MGM. It was the top grossing picture of 1929 and won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nContemporary reviews from critics were generally positive. \"Variety\" wrote that it \"has everything a silent picture should have outside of its dialog. A basic story with some sense to it, action, excellent direction, laughs, a tear, a couple of great performances and plenty of sex.\" \"Has everything\", agreed \"Film Daily\". \"Sure-fire moneymaker that will drag 'em in everywhere.\"\n\"This picture is great. It will revolutionize the talkies\", wrote Edwin Schallert for \"Motion Picture News\". \"The direction is an amazing indication of what can be done in the new medium.\"\nMordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" wrote a mixed review, calling it \"rather cleverly directed\" but \"somewhat obvious\", with sentiment \"served out too generously in most of the sequences.\" Hall called King's performance \"vigorous\", but of Page, he wrote, \"Her acting, especially her voice, does not enhance her personality. Notwithstanding, it must be admitted that there are girls who talk as they are made to for the screen. Miss Page, however, fails to give one an impression of spontaneity, for she recites rather than speaks her lines.\"\nJohn Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote, \"The stage background allows opportunity for one or two musical interpolations, and no one is more glad than we that the talkies charmingly succeed in a very pleasant ballet. Because of that, we shall try to forget the dialogue of the play, and that James Gleason ever wanted to take any credit for it.\"\nAccolades.\nThe film was nominated for three Academy Awards at the 1930 ceremony: Best Actress (Bessie Love), Best Director (Harry Beaumont), and Outstanding Picture. No nominations were announced before the 1930 ceremonies. Love and Beaumont are presumed to have been under consideration, and they are listed as such by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\nRetrospective.\nHistorically, \"The Broadway Melody\" is often considered the first complete example of a Hollywood musical. Contemporary critics now view the movie as clich\u00e9d and overly melodramatic, despite its innovative status for its time and its contributions to the concept and structure of musical films. It currently holds a rating of 42% at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.50/10. The site's consensus is that the film \"is interesting as an example of an early Hollywood musical, but otherwise, it's essentially bereft of appeal for modern audiences\".\nAssessing the film in 2009, James Berardinelli wrote, \"\"The Broadway Melody\" has not stood the test of time in ways that many of its more artistic contemporaries have. Some of its deficiencies can be attributed to ways in which the genre has been re-shaped and improved over the years, but some are the result of the studio's validated belief that viewers would be willing to ignore bad acting and pedestrian directing in order to experience singing, dancing, and talking on the silver screen.\"\nSequels.\nMGM later made three more movies with similar titles: \"Broadway Melody of 1936\", \"Broadway Melody of 1938\", and \"Broadway Melody of 1940\". Although not direct sequels in the traditional sense, they all had the same basic premise of a group of people putting on a show (the films also had recurring cast members playing different roles, most notably dancer Eleanor Powell who appeared in all three).\nThe original movie was remade in 1940 as \"Two Girls on Broadway\". Another \"Broadway Melody\" film was planned for 1943 (starring Gene Kelly and Eleanor Powell), but production was cancelled when Kelly was loaned to Columbia for \"Cover Girl\" (1944). \"Broadway Rhythm\", a 1944 musical by MGM, was originally to have been titled \"Broadway Melody of 1944\".\nHome media.\nWarner Bros. released \"The Broadway Melody\" on a Region 1 special edition DVD in 2005. It is included in the 18-disc \"Best Picture Oscar Collection\", also released by Warner Bros. The film was given a Blu-ray release from a 4K restoration by Warner Archive in July 2023. After the DVD had been released, a 25- to 30-second establishing shot of New York City, missing from 35mm prints and the DVD release, was discovered in a 16mm print. This footage was put back into the film when Warner Brothers restored the film for its 2023 Warner Archive Blu-Ray release. However, the entire \"Wedding of the Painted Doll\" sequence remains in black and white on the Blu-ray.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Chick attends the theater with Joan and, at the intermission, sneaks away, committing a robbery during which a policeman is killed. Chick is suspected of the crime but is able to use Joan to substantiate his alibi. The police plant Danny McGann, an undercover agent, in Chick's gang; but he is discovered, and Chick murders him. Chick is later cornered by the police in his own home. Before they can arrest him, he flips the light switch, plunging the room into darkness. In the midst of the chaos, Chick escapes to the roof.

Hallenbeck said the film was \"creaky by today's standards...[but] still fun to watch.\"\nCensorship.\nWhen \"Alibi\" was released in the United States, many states and cities in the United States had censor boards that could require cuts or other eliminations before the film could be shown. The Chicago Board of Censors banned the film, citing it for \"immorality, criminality, and depravity.\" United Artists appealed the ban to circuit court, where the Board explained that the film had been banned because it ridiculed the police. After watching the film, Judge Harry Fisher, stating that \"censorship is a form of tyranny at best, and abhorrent to ideals of the American people,\" issued an injunction allowing the film to be shown in an U.A. theater.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
